Instead of waiting for intelligent machines to do the heavy lifting, we should be emulating the actions of our ancestors.\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\nI recently wrote about [dehumanizing humans](&lt;|url|&gt;) by creating a new kind of machine, a kind that isn’t biologically human but that behaves like a person. We’re calling it Screen Time, because it spared my readers the humiliation of an inanimate object replacing human functions and slowly replacing them with something more predictable and less disruptive.\\n\\nBut lest you think the new machine-made friends would actually do anything except to prolong what is already an aging human relationship, just a little background. I coined the phrase “eugenics” to describe the “science of selection,” which attempts to understand the ways pairs of genes affect the development of an organism and its ability to perform specific human functions. The classic textbook definition of a “genetic disadvantage” is used to show that a - or “bad-genetic environment” - can give rise to circumstances that result in a + or “bad-neurotypical” outcome in a person. In other words, the code for why people get killed by drivers is different depending on the driver’s personality type.\\n\\nBut now the stakes are higher. The -isms — the specific genotypes that underlie the most widely held beliefs in American society are being challenged by new research that shows how our genes play a much larger role in our lives than we thought. In particular, a new study of a half-dozen genes has thrown cold water on the idea that genes are the new social capital.\\n\\nThe results of analyzing the genomes of people over the course of decades raises questions that are as old as what we have for dinner. These include why do people in their twenties and thirties demonstrate greater levels of well-being than people in their forties and forties? And what does the future hold for the genes that underlie the broadest swath of human life — the genes that are passed on from generation to generation, that control our actions and behavior?\\n\\nThe great majority of known genetic diseases are either genetic or environmental in origin. But by altering our behavior and setting of genes, we can add them to the list of “externalities” — in economic, political, or social terms — that we have as descendants. These costs are borne by someone else — the environment.\\n\\nThe environment is what happens when we do things differently. The costs are borne by someone else — the environment. We cannot just sit around and wait as the environmental crisis unfolds, as if nothing to do with the environment changes our behavior and ideas. At the end of the day, the combination of deliberate human-environmental pollution with the mismanagement of our natural resources is a problem that belongs specifically to the past. It belongs to the last century.\\n\\nThe costs of inaction are real and grave. They are borne by the shoulders of those who are trying to make the changes that must come with a changing world. But they are also real and grave. They are borne by the shoulders of those who understand that the changes that must come with a changing world are, in fact, changes that will inevitably come with a changing world.\\n\\n◊ Jason Russell is associate professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University. His research focuses on the social determinants of gender, criminal behavior, and technology use. His [2016 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) looked at the effect of internet use and found that it “may well exacerbate existing inequalities in income and housing outcomes by concentrating wealth in a fewer people and generating greater suffering for lower-income households.”\\n\\nRussell cautions that the paper is correlational and cross-sectional, meaning that it looks at what happens when people are surveyed in the context of future change. That is, if people in the future are, as Russell put it, “more like what they were like in the past, then there’s less chance of durable social change, especially for lower-income families.”\\n\\nHe also cautions that the findings are correlative, not causal. “It is not suggesting that looking back at the actions of people who are already living in challenging circumstances will produce better decisions or that the actions of those who are not living in challenging circumstances will produce better outcomes.”\\n\\nThere is a telling contradiction in the way that wealth is created and wields power. The very wealth of the Apple Store makes its employees and even its shareholders extremely happy, but there is nothing typical or obvious to do with that happiness. The products are unusual and personal products; each one is unique and will have its own charm and nove.\\n\\nI see this as one of the major problems with the Gilded Age of American tech. It took many years and millions of dollars to build the resources of the 21st century; few people appeared on the Forbes 400 rich list of billionaires under age 40. The rewards system was in place and well understood. But it is curious that those of us on the lower rungs on the ladder of wealth creation looked at the likes of Apple and wonder what they would do with their resources.\\n\\nWords like “cloud” and “platform” have become loaded with meaning and momentum in recent years. The words service businesses depend on to run their business models. The pillar of the modern internet is user-generated content. If we understand the fundamental economics of content as the digital equivalent of writed money, then we can redesign our entire society.\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n![Credit: Pixel/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Pixel/Getty Images*\\n\\n*Co-authored with [Roger Bamkin](&lt;|url|&gt;)*\\n\\nOn March 26, 2018, former CIA counterterrorism analyst and NSA analyst [Edward Snowden](&lt;|url|&gt;) appeared on *CBS This Morning. The two-hour interview was conducted primarily to discuss the recently leaked <BuzzFeed *database of leaked Democratic National Committee (DNC) and *Wired* [sources](&lt;|url|&gt;), which were found to include highly sensitive information.\\n\\nAs expected, the media outlet didn’t shy away from the real meat of the issue, focusing instead on the alleged interference of Facebook and Google with American democracy through their massive digital platforms. Specifically, the topic was the so-called “clinet movement” — the massive private tech industry lobbying effort that seeks to gerrymander legislative seats, tweak electoral systems, and ultimately transfer wealth from the less powerful to the more powerful.\\n\\nAlthough the [ongoing Congressional hearings](&lt;|url|&gt;) have produced [mainstream media stories](&lt;|url|&gt;) focused on Russia, the narrative has been [dyed in favor of Facebook](&lt;|url|&gt;). As the [hot button](&lt;|url|&gt;) of political discussion, Facebook has been forced to weigh the competing needs of their respective platforms in tandem.\\n\\nBoth Facebook and Google have significant business interests in maintaining a steady state of mass surveillance, which both have done extensive work to upgrade their products and launch countermeasures. This should be no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to the last five years: These companies have been diligently pursuing ways to make their services more convenient, even if doing so meant temporarily shutting down operations or damaging competitors.\\n\\nThis effort has produced a series of mixed effects. On the one hand, it’s clear that these companies need to be more proactive in fighting these trends, such as adding more surveillance features to their platforms. On the other hand, it’s equally clear that these efforts need to proceed with kid-friendly precautions, such as backing up all data, locking down devices, and using proper security features.\\n\\nAt this point, parents and children are being urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities. It’s worth noting that Facebook earlier this month [announced](&lt;|url|&gt;) that it would no longer allow users to “like or comment on” other than to prevent harm, which is being interpreted as meaning that like or retweeting something harmless, it will now prevent harm from spreading on the platform.\\n\\nAt this point, there’s no evidence that banning access to these platforms would have a minimal impact on crime. And even if it did, how would banning access to social media sites change crime?\\n\\nOne thing is certain. With enough publicity, even banning access to them can be effective. Earlier this year, the [solar panel test](&lt;|url|&gt;) failed in the Sundance Film Festival. The panel was made up of representatives from across the world, including from Indonesia, India, Mexico, Paraguay, and Costa Rica. Yet despite this, the test was aired and the media was allowed. As soon as the results were in, the [sequestration deal](&lt;|url|&gt;) between the Trump administration and the media companies broke open new media platforms, allowing the distribution of unproven but nevertheless controversial news. And as recently as a year ago, there were still channels to be found on YouTube and Facebook that were not run by people with Facebook or Google data. These platforms are the backbones of modern American democracy, the platforms that have made US politics and culture so much more accessible. With each passing year and digital assistant breakthrough, the divide between the rich and the poor seems to deepen.\\n\\nThe automation of production, distribution, and consumption will make the rich and the poor—and everyone else—even less so. So the A.I. that powers each of us will become ever more important. In a world awash in information, the privileged will get ever more isolated.\\n\\nLet us hope that during the making of this new-is-new-old-is-old-is-old-is-old, we value each other and our experience more than instant gratification from a screen. We don’t have to wait for robots to do our dirty work for us.<|endoftext|>\\n<|startoftext|>\\n# Here’s What’s on Ben Horowitz’s iPhone\\n\\n## The Andreessen Horowitz co-founder talks crypto, notifications, and more\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\n*This is “What’s on Your Home Screen?” a Q&A column from OneZero. We want to understand more about how people use their smartphones — those life-consuming devices we dump hours into every day — to pave a way toward a better future. Or at least a more reflective one. We’ll add new entries regularly, and each will feature a new interview with a notable person about the apps they use, how they’re organized, and whether those red bubbles drive them nuts.*\\n\\nIt’s not much of a statement to say Ben Horowitz is one of the most powerful people in technology. Water is wet; the sky is blue.\\n\\nA co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz who previously worked at Facebook and Google, Horowitz has been connected to major investments in companies like Facebook, Google, and Alibaba, as well as key roles in Apple’s supply chain. He’s also part of a growing community of Sensex alumni — former employees and founders who have had a change of heart and are now helping shape the digital world around us.\\n\\nThis is how Ben Horowitz, a co-founder of Twitter and an early investor in Facebook, came to work with Mezrich. Mezrich, who also has a passion for wearable technology, met Horowitz at a party in 2014 and the two kept in touch, often via encrypted apps. “The first time we met, he was still wearing a hard hat,” says Horowitz. “I was floored. He had this thing where he’d put his earbuds on and he’d mic the guy who was playing a folk tune. He put his earbuds on and continued on.”\\n\\nA photo of Horowitz taken with his friends at the time, including one of their favorite photos: a photo of a smiling young woman. “The documentary was something that I had seen in the news,” says Horowitz. “I went into the documentary [and] watched the documentary, and I was like, ‘Oh my god, this is the guy who made the *New York Times* put pictures of himself on the wall of his store.’”\\n\\nHorowitz’s early days, weeks, and months as a full-time developer were marked by changes in how he uses his phone. He’s now more concerned about notifications than ever, which leads to the aforementioned misplaced files. The devices may have become redundant, but the software is still largely the same.\\n\\nWhat’s most surprising to me, though, is how little people’s iPhones have changed. How much is the software’s new normal, anyway?\\n\\nIt’s funny you should ask: The change is less about casual users getting their hair brushed and flipped and more about professionals worrying about how the software is changing us.\\n\\nMostly, I agree. When I first started studying the internet, email was all I had. The flip side of that coin is that, though, was a relatively recent development. The change in how we communicate with each other is one thing; working with people on other computers was quite another.\\n\\n## **The Weather Channel**\\n\\nI remember the first days of internet service like any other. The early days of the web were one-sided; Cox was first to do something like that, and then to do the same thing over and over. I always figured they’d wait for the big events to catch up before launching a basic email service. Sure, I can’t remember what worked for the first shot of the dot-com bubble, but that was it. Sure, I can’t remember what was going to make me click “[I want air traffic control](&lt;|url|&gt;)” instead of “[I want a VPN.](&lt;|url|&gt;)”\\n\\nI’m not holding my breath. But I do have confidence that Cox’s vision for encrypted, geo-targeted email is far from a panacea.\\n\\nThe big-ticket item for new technology companies is usually the one they’re developing that’s the heart of their business. An email is a one-way street. Different services will lead to entirely different ends, as follows:\\n\\n1. Agencies will need to stay in control of what, when, and to what end users send and receive.\\n\\n2. Various government agencies will need to be involved in setting the agenda for the messaging platforms.\\n\\n3. and 4. Agencies will need to make decisions about who gets to communicate with whom, and who doesn’t.\\n\\n5. And, finally, there will come a tipping point on the scale of what’s acceptable. After that, they’ll need to decide whether to allow people to opt-in to being tracked or not. Already, there are traceability issues with some of these services.\\n\\n6. There will always be a public side to the internet. It’s up to the companies to deal with it.\\n\\n## **The ethics of big tech**\\n\\nAs for the people tracking and targeting us, they’ll have to deal with two fundamental questions: “Can we do it safe, or can we allow someone to build something without us getting in?”\\n\\nFor victims and survivors, there’s the simple answer: “Can we cope with it?” There’s no world of meaning or comfort for anyone who doesn’t struggle with the idea of going viral.\\n\\nAnd although the above examples show how fairly widely varying and affected the algorithms can be, I think it’s worth noting that these algorithms have been used in the courtroom, as well. Judge Jeanine Pirro’s decision in the pending litigation against Facebook illustrates this point. She found in part that the company failed to protect the integrity of the public comments section by failing to recognize that a member of the public had created a spammy account in November of 2013. At the time, Facebook said it would review PWA content and act in response, but no action was taken. As the judge [put forth](&lt;|url|&gt;), “there was a pause on further action because there was a large number of unanswered questions.”\\n\\nMy point is, the two-factor authentication (2FA) system and the 4-5-6-7-8-9 that 2FA relies on doesn’t exist if you don’t know 3rd-party data. You don’t need 2FA for online banking, and you don’t need 5th-party insurance to use your account. The insurance is available through your carrier’s website, but it’s hard to know whether the app will work or if you need it at all.\\n\\nThe interesting thing about Burr’s bill is that, even if the apps themselves don’t use encrypted technology, they still represent something of an existential crisis for the tech companies that use their technology to profit. The policies and rules that govern how these apps are used are being loosened in an effort to appease these new demands. So far, some have played it safe. The main question is how will these policies be applied?\\n\\n## **The tide is shifting**\\n\\nBefore we know it, my son’s account will be permanently logged into his iCloud account. His older one is on Live, but his aunt is in on it. I’m not entirely sure how this will work, but I’m guessing that Live turns over to Facebook as it would any other app, with the assumption that Facebook can manage the kind of permissions the old one relied on.\\n\\nIn addition to the stuff he touches, FaceApp has set up a dedicated “[developer’s account](&lt;|url|&gt;)” through which it can test and ship features to developers. There’s also a dedicated “[business](&lt;|url|&gt;)” through which to test and ship features for $99.95.\\n\\nFor the time being, the focus is on cracking down on apps that break the law. So far, that focus has included “[privacy-focused apps](&lt;|url|&gt;),” which offer limited features but offer low-level access to sensitive information. Meanwhile, Nest has made money by selling user data to its parent company, Nest Labs, which has made money from the sale of sensors in buildings all around the world.\\n\\nIt’s a tough sell for Cupertino. The tech stocks are oversupplied with gadgets and services, and the falling costs of those gadgets and services will erode demand for tech products and services, which means the Cupertino economy is contracting. That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Cupertino has already proven.\\n\\nApple, meanwhile, only recently unlocked [its 700,000-square-foot data center](&lt;|url|&gt;) and has already said goodbye to thousands of servers running on the cloud. Even then, its services were mostly on-demand: Apple had just over a hundred servers in 2010, when it launched the App Store, which made it difficult to maintain. As the market shifted to smartphones and tablets, Apple turned its services over to the people who made those iPhones.\\n\\nEven if the services industry shifts, the end of investment in new hardware for individual apps is coming to an end. According to [a recent survey](&lt;|url|&gt;) by Survey Monkey, iPhone sales are down 25% from last year.\\n\\n“This is what’s driving the growth of the App Store,” Diageo CEO Annette Patton wrote to that effect. “The increasing number of transactions on our platform results in an ever-increasing number of purchases and downloads, which means more money for the App Store.”\\n\\nShe added: “This shift in usage pattern over time, coupled with our increased reliance on App Store data, has created a significant number of new businesses and positions us to enter the next decade in a new relationship with our customers.”\\n\\nPatton’s point is simple but profound: iPhone owners have high expectations for what their devices can accomplish. High expectations certainly do not automatically equate to high prices or a promising business. High expectations place a premium on a new product’s arrival, which, in turn, can create a market for new products that achieve the same or higher returns but fail to generate the same sense of excitement or widespread adoption.\\n\\nAccording to Patton, the key for Apple’s continued success is its ability to drive prices down. “The great challenge for Apple is maintaining the price point while attracting customers new and engaging them on the merits of the products themselves,” she said.\\n\\nApple lacks no shortage of resources. The iPhone is, in most respects, the sum of all the qualities that make an iPhone unique. It’s easy to sell people on wanting to protect their privacy, but that’s not unique to iPhone.\\n\\nIt’s easy to sell people on wanting to protect their privacy, but that’s not unique to iPhone.\\n\\nThe two-year-long iPhone shortage is mostly caused by carriers rethinking and redesigning their entire handset line to cram more functionality into each, making it more difficult to sell people anything but the perfect all-screen experience. Carrying over anything resembling a conventional iPhone means you’re now talking about an iPhone 6, which feels obscene.\\n\\nThe situation changes a bit when you buy a new iPhone. Suddenly, you’re talking about a phone that, thanks to a couple of whiskers, has a much better camera than the stock iPhone 6.\\n\\nThat’s not great, but consider that Apple’s iPhone hasn’t even shipped in all its glory. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*\\n\\nThis is the dilemma many iPhone owners are faced with: How do you not feel rushed when you’re sold a new phone? The A.I. boomtown is a thing of beauty, but the reality is that no matter how much you appreciate your phone’s design, the software is more features, not a full overhaul. You’re probably not as uptight as to feel guilty about not having enough iced tea, but the truth is that the [upcoming iPhone upgrade](&lt;|url|&gt;) will almost certainly solve this problem. In my experience, though, most iPhone owners who don’t get the software upgrade will still generally find some advantage from the software they have access to before they move to the next model.\\n\\nApple, which is entering its golden age, already has a history of making the most of this design language. The company refreshed and reengineered the entire iPhone interface — the user interface, the icons, the look and feel — around 2010. One of the first overhauls was the iOS 11 interface, which ushered in a new era of not-quite-an-iPhone-esque screens. As the then-head of Apple’s Interface, Gerry Douglas, [described it](&lt;|url|&gt;), in that regard, the 11 redesign was, well, messianic. That’s not to say the redesign didn’t change, just didn’t do it in a way that’d made the product’s already-complex reach even more confusing.\\n\\n![](<|image|>)\\n\\nAnother update: from 2012. This time, it was the iPhone XR; the smaller still iPhone X sat behind an arguably superior iPad Mini. Apple’s new iPad Mini was almost as good, if not better, than the iPhone XR. What’s not to say the new iPad Mini is any more superior to the iPhone XR in every way, but that it wasn’t going to be shown off to the world.\\n\\nThat’s not to say the iPad Mini isn’t a great choice for media consumption. There are simply too many limitations to make or break. But until something breaks the mold, it’s hard to know how to make an iPad Mini without compromises.\\n\\n![The new iPad Mini. Credit: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The new iPad Mini. Credit: Lance Ulanoff*\\n\\nEven if you believe Apple’s claim that it has the perfect 10-screen iPad Mini, there are still a lot of design pitfalls that increase the cost of upgrades. Those upgrades can make or break the Mini.\\n\\nApple knew that selling most of its older products would eventually sell better than new models, so it reduced the price. Looking forward, the more expensive the new models, the more sales will come from the older models. Even if Apple didn’t want to undercut its cheaper competitors, keeping production of any new model low production costs should help Apple recoup some of the cash it expected to receive for the iPhone.\\n\\nEven if there were to be multiple iPhone models and multiple iPad Mini versions released, only one would make a difference. If you buy a new iPad Mini today, you’ll have it for about $200. If you wait until after the iPad Mini 4 arrives, you’ll have it for $50.\\n\\nEven if you can’t wait to get your hands on it, the competition isn’t going to do it. In addition to being sandwiched between the iPhone X and the iPhone XR, the iPad Mini is coming closest to the iPhone X going forward. Look at the A10 Fusion in a pair of photos posted by Peta Dellenova.\\n\\n![The new iPad Mini is close to the iPhone XR. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The new iPad Mini is close to the iPhone XR. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*\\n\\nAs for Apple’s other products, there’s still no sign of the Walkman 3, the Apple Watch 4, or the Retina iPhone. In addition, there’s no sign of any of the other devices being brought to market that will help replace the iPad Mini.\\n\\nThat’s not to say that the iPad Mini isn’t a worthy replacement for now, but considering Apple’s track record, it’s not unreasonable to expect that the tablet would at least temporarily take the place of the iPhone X in people’s hands. Especially now that the iPhone XR is so close to being the perfect iPhone.\\n\\nMaybe Apple will change things someday, but right now there are more questions than answers about the iPad Mini. When it arrives, it’s unclear if the Mini can live on its own.\\n\\nWhen it arrives, the iPad Mini is everything you’ll need for the work day.\\n\\n## **Workday one: The wallpaper**\\n\\n![The new Apple TV app’s default content.](<|image|>)*The new Apple TV app’s default content.*\\n\\nEven before Apple announced the Mini, there was a very real chance that this would be its day one competitor. After all, who wouldn’t want to replace the $199 Apple HomePod with something equally easy to clean, replace the Glasses with another one, or even get rid of the charging case altogether?\\n\\n But Apple didn’t do it. Instead, it used its new $199 HomePod to launch a work-provided email app called Calzones. And then it used its built-in Calzones to launch Notes. Notes is, of course, the default app on almost every iPhone. So why not?\\n\\nHere’s the problem with having an Apple TV at home: Most people don’t actually need to pay Apple $199 for the ability to work from their iPhone. In fact, Apple TV+ essentially sits in between $199 and $459. Those who do are often limited to Apple’s own services, such as Apple Music and iTunes. Meanwhile, Apple says that a number of its services, such as Apple Arcade, will come first to Macs in 2019. Even that numbered competitor hasn’t sold well.\\n\\nThe logical thing to do would have been to launch a separate device. In that case, Apple would have been able to charge whatever the component value of the new device was. Since there is no “home” cut, Cupertino would have been able to pass on the extra money they’d already paid for the older iPhone.\\n\\nOf course, nobody would buy that new device and then transition to a new iPhone. But it makes sense that Apple would wait on this. The iPhone is now the only major handset manufacturer not natively supporting HomePod, and momentum will be with that one.\\n\\nAnother blunder by Apple: They didn’t communicate with or market to their customers in person. They only let a handful of media outlets (Fox, NBC, etc.) cover their event. If you don’t understand how this works, don’t worry; I’m with you; it really doesn’t make much sense. Apple’s iPhone coverage is limited to local media and their iPhone and iPad Pros.\\n\\nI mentioned above that Apple introduced a pair of new currencies. In addition to the dollar and Australian dollar, Apple introduced niches like [FII](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [G-B.](&lt;|url|&gt;). Now Niche means any of these currencies can be spent at stores. You could have the dollars and then spend them on anything.\\n\\nSome might still consider that a novelty, but it doesn’t seem to be working out. Ten percent of the $7 billion fund [went into Apple Pay](&lt;|url|&gt;) in what was [called the Apple Card](&lt;|url|&gt;). Even then, only $75 million of the Apple Card was used for retail sales in 2018. For comparison, [a $1,000 iPhone went for $1,006](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the six months before Apple Pay launched.\\n\\nIf September’s events are any indication, consumers might want to move on from the $1,000 phone and toward the $20,000+ phone. If they need multiple phones to carry their daily necessities, consumers might accept a $200 gift card from Apple. Even if they think about a high-end device, Apple could build something like a Titanium iPhone XS Max.\\n\\nApple [has a $6.89 billion fund](&lt;|url|&gt;) with more than $2 billion under management. The company announced it would partner with Aeronautics’ (formerly NASA) on development of lightweight space planes, but there are other lines of business too. Aeronautics would develop private spaceships, prototypes of which have already been seen. And then NASA would buy them and develop them into the first commercial manned spacecrafts. So there is the potential for private companies to take those craft and put them into space.\\n\\nThere are also potential commercial partners [for commercial cellphones](&lt;|url|&gt;). There are things like Polar Bears and even the ability to make and receive phone calls from spacecrafts. There is the ability to communicate with spacecrafts and even attempt to merge with them. I think this is very appealing. But there are serious concerns around how this might be used.\\n\\nThe Cell is inherently untrustworthy. If there is a glitch in the way of things, then consumers will be less likely to trust Cellphones. They will look at other ways to pay their bills.\\n\\nThis is not to say that Cellphones are unTrustworthy. Quite the contrary. The Cell is increasingly becoming the ultimate Cut-and-paste job. The seamless integration of Apple with its services will only continue.\\n\\nThe next-generation of the iPhone may end up as the cut-and-paste job of a lifetime. But for the first time in my memory, I felt confident that my relationship with the internet would allow me to make peace with that.\\n\\nInstead, I was told that war is what we call people’s affairs. That peace is, perhaps, not so peace. That’s because conflict creates the conditions for peace.\\n\\nBut I can’t help but wonder what would have happened if war had been called by the internet? What would the internet have looked like had war been called by someone who saw the war as an opportunity to make a buck rather than a choice between a better job and fewer regrets?\\n\\nI think that’s a pretty big deal. So much of our lives — and our planet — is based on relationships based on trust. Without that trust, we’re lost.\\n\\nThis is an issue that affects many of us. It’s not just the way our relationships with each other and our friends are shaped. The internet makes it easy to see who we are without forming attachments to specific people. It’s also the only way we’re left to think about the people around us, the things that define us as individuals instead of forming attachments to a group of strangers.\\n\\nThe internet went through several major changes in the 20th century, and the biggest one is the rise of the media. As the historian Margaret O’Mara [describes](&lt;|url|&gt;) the way the western world shifted from a reliance on printed media to the internet, we moved from a reliance on television and the printed word to one based on internet searches. The media became the thing people wanted to get their information on. The internet took that information and made it available to the masses.\\n\\nThe second change is the rise of the internet per se. The internet per se has changed nothing about our society. In the 1960s, college students were television junkies glued to their computers. Today, they are bombarded by information from all corners of the world. They are, in essence, brain-dead zombies. One of the ways the internet has changed our world is by providing the perfect storm of the perfect information ecosystem.\\n\\nThe third change is the democratization of storytelling. The movies, the television shows, the music, the internet-generated news, the grocery stores with podcasts and podcasts and the internet-generated errands. In addition to making it easier to focus on the small changes of daily life, the internet has transformed our way of thinking. The sum total of what’s become is bigger than the world.\\n\\nThe fourth change is the democratization of communication. The increased ubiquity of high-quality, high-value communications means that there’s less chance of hand-wringing over the little things in your life that you don’t care about. The brain is, in fact, growing more and more flexible. It can handle the demands of daily life better and faster than we can.\\n\\nThe fifth change is the democratization of human relationships. The more we politicize human relationships, the easier it will become for us to politicize human relationships. We’ll have more friends, more connections, and more power. The end result will be less chaos and more interaction.\\n\\nThe sixth change is the democratization of technology. The more we politicize our relationships with computers and the internet, the easier it will become for us to politicize our relationships with other computers and the internet. When it comes to the apps, the easy way out is to make them private. Go for it.\\n\\nBut if we look at the list of app stores, it seems hard to imagine how anyone could have died without a massive app store full of games. Once you’d bought a bunch of apps, how would you go about downloading them? Google has very clearly restricted the number of apps that developers can download. I’m not saying they shouldn’t make them or that we need to stop downloading them. What I am saying is that the app economy is broken and that, in some cases, shutting down an app store can actually make the system worse. We’ve already seen that in the case of Stadia, which has a massive app store, but also has the unfortunate tendency of locking down access to additional apps.\\n\\nThere are a few ways this could go. Either Google expands its [data business](&lt;|url|&gt;) — Android is almost a complete shut-down since it started with a data business; or Google expands its [data business](&lt;|url|&gt;) — — and controls the massive data ecosystem it built with its existing Google Play Store.\\n\\nEither way, when it comes to the app economy, the future is darker. The dark forests are growing thicker. It’s hard to know where to turn when it comes to app stores, but I think it’s safe to assume it’s either a) Google’s Pixel phone, or b) a [$io.ai](&lt;|url|&gt;) thing. Neither are likely to arrive until well after the iPhone remodels.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Apple will continue to have the App Store, will continue to have the iTunes store, and will continue to have the App Store itself. The iTunes store is such a recognizable piece of Apple’s crown that it’s one of the only direct competitors in terms of user experience. The iPhone has traditionally been marketed as the dark forest, the one where you can be confident it’s safe, secure, and listening to you through a [privacy](&lt;|url|&gt;) that comes second to convenience. With [offering iPhone’s](&lt;|url|&gt;) dark forests, Apple is trying to tell a different story.\\n\\nIt’s easy to forget that the [products Google and Apple are announcing](&lt;|url|&gt;) could all grow from the same source. The [google A.I. assistant](&lt;|url|&gt;) will be able to generate music and videos for your taste, while the [a $1,199 TV remote](&lt;|url|&gt;) will feed your nostalgia for a show you saw on Netflix when it was just released. With [artificial intelligence](&lt;|url|&gt;) as a means to communicate with distant sources, the long march to market saturation could be — or perhaps even accelerate. The sun is rising, and while it’s still just a few years away, it’s already too late.\\n\\nThe sun is rising, and while it’s still just a few years away, it’s already too late. The dinosaurs have already crashed onto the land; the dinosaurs already have their own apps, like the new [Dino](&lt;|url|&gt;) Life Editor, which allows them to add text, music, and a few movies. The only real downside of having an Apple TV in your kitchen is the poor, dangly quality of Apple’s TV app. On its own, it was a fairly decent TV app, one of the best I’ve used. However, Apple TV’s abysmal performance as a standalone media player is such that I’m looking forward to seeing it take on more serious competition.\\n\\nIts competitors are already preparing for their own 6.9 updates. The Google Huay offer 4K streaming content right now. The $199 Apple TV+ will get regular updates, along with content from other services around the streaming service. There’s also Sony’s [southскина Nio](&lt;|url|&gt;), which has just announced a service called [Sampden](&lt;|url|&gt;) that will stream content from services like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. These will all use Apple’s A.I. to learn your habits and segment you accordingly.\\n\\nFor Apple, there’s no better example of its rivals’ willingness to trade on personal data and A.I. supremacy. The Cupertino, California-based company famously [goosed its smart-home platform with a service called HomeKit](&lt;|url|&gt;) in exchange for access to information about its more than 2 million customers — including sensitive information like when you bought that new car or paid your student loans with Apple Pay.\\n\\nGiving away your information like that is a big deal for Apple, which has been criticized for taking advantage of the seemingly amorphous iPhone market. More broadly, Google and Apple have faced similar criticisms about their respective A.I. investments. Google CEO Sundar Pichai [called](&lt;|url|&gt;) his new voice assistant Cortana “[an artificial being](&lt;|url|&gt;)” seen in many public and private projects. Apple’s Siri is also part of the family, thanks to her smart-assistant-turned-collaborator Chris Pratt.\\n\\nBut there’s no denying that Apple has, year after year, shown a willingness to throw its weight around in exchange for cosmetic changes. When was the last time you heard someone say they really loved an iPhone before they got a Pixel? I certainly never would have believed them.\\n\\nEven if you believe Apple watermarks the wall off of voice assistant history, the acquisition of Siri is a clear sign that the company is starting to value some of its past success more. Yes, voice was important to driving sales, but that’s really all we have to go on. Apple has, year after year, shown that it’s willing to shed its skin to make a profit. It’s a sign that there’s money to be made moving physical products, and there’s no reason to think that won’t continue.\\n\\nFor consumers, that means prices will come down, and they’ll be forced to pick up more and more of their old phones to get used to them. If you’re used to monthly software updates for a flagship device, it’s hard to imagine how that affects average usage.\\n\\nIt’s the nature of enterprise software that causes prices to crash. When costs are low, consumers are more willing to upgrade to a new model. On the iPhone, that’s typically the case. Apple’s AirPods are getting updates all the time, and with each passing month, the cost of the new model — which includes the cost of the battery — drops.\\n\\nIn that sense, the AirPods are like hotcakes: Updates hurting the brand, while now selling for about $250, are just keeping pace with the price of the old technology.\\n\\nAffordable products are disappearing all the time. I’ve seen every iPhone from the mid-1990s and up to the present day listed for sale. Even my Intel Pentium 4 is no longer affordable, but it’s not dying, either.\\n\\nOur relationship with social media is changing. The push notifications that accompanied news and sports are relics of a bygone age, but so are ads for McRae’s bars. The Instagrammable era has been replaced by the hyper-organized internet. What mattered to those early adopters is not the quality of the content, but rather the speed and scale of the content.\\n\\nInstead of just getting by with less technology, older people are increasingly concerned about how their involvement with the internet is affecting their lives. It’s not just the media, but also apps, apps, and the fragmented nature of software. It’s a question that has become increasingly relevant in the wake of Apple’s [$12 billion acquisition of Siri](&lt;|url|&gt;).\\n\\nThe seeds of this problem were planted more than a year ago when Apple first unveiled AirPods. The multibook accessory was meant to offer something unique to the Apple earbuds market, since Apple doesn’t have a great track record for other than to make [basic ](&lt;|url|&gt;)earbuds generic.\\n\\nAirPods quickly became Apple’s top earbud. Their competitors were quick to follow.\\n\\nInitially, the conference earbuds didn’t have much going for them. They fit better than people expected and have good sound for their size. Sound quality is good across all music genres, and the pickings are well-below average for early-stage audio. AirPods are only going to get better with age, which makes them better value for people who don’t already be in love with Apple TV+ or have $200 earbuds.\\n\\nBut Apple missed an opportunity to differentiate their product. The earbuds are a no-frills product, but the look and feel are unmistakably Apple. Plus, AirPods are individually rechargeable. There is no doubt that Apple could, in fact, sell the same product at different times.\\n\\n$199.\\n\\nAirPods, no wireless charging case, and no real exterior shell. That’s what buyers are looking for. Add that to the mix, and you’re looking at an awkward fit and awkward device to hold in your hand.\\n\\n$149.\\n\\nAirPods, on the other hand, are slightly thinner than AirPods but with a third-party cover that hangs around the outside edge, making them comfortably comfortable. They do not tap into Siri’s ears and rely on the second-party Siri’s remote for voice control. That’s a selling point, but Apple missed an opportunity to differentiate their product.\\n\\n$199.\\n\\nTo its credit, Apple’s iPhone doesn’t just look like a premium device as Google’s [Stadia](&lt;|url|&gt;) does. That’s because AirPods, by far the [most popular wireless earbuds](&lt;|url|&gt;), are actually pretty good at what they do. Their selling point is simply that they’re purely wireless (no Bluetooth), which on further reflection feels like a dangerous bet since [attacks](&lt;|url|&gt;) by wireless-equipped assailants are on the rise.\\n\\nStill, despite the price, there’s little reason to think Apple can’t pass on its AirPods ideas and manufacture a truly killer product. The Beats X have been a long-time favorite of mine and I’ve had the privilege of reviewing their flagship headphones, the Beats X, for years. They’ve always been honest and reliable. Even so, they came up short on key audio features, like Apple’s use of the haptics to control your music. This may have been overlooked had the Beats X not come first to market.\\n\\nMore importantly, AirPods, by far the [most popular wireless']"
