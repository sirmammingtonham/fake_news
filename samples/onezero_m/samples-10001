 as an individualized “Big Data” data collection — a notion [first articulated by the founders of Amazon Lumière](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a *Scientific American* article back in 2018. At the time, Amazon Lumière was engaged in just such a transaction, creating and managing a publicly available array of health apps. Its pricing structure was designed to mirror that of a drugstore: If you’re willing to pay a monthly premium, you’re better off for the end result.
> We have no idea what Jawbone is doing, and the idea that it’s some kind of Big Pharma company speaks to something more fundamental.

It should go without saying that all Big Pharma companies must undergo rigorous transparency measures, which include periodic audits, annual public accounting of sales, and meaningful disclosure of affiliate relationships. As Vox’s Sarah Parcakos recently [reported](&lt;|url|&gt;), the existence of affiliate relationships was even a part of the complaint the Food and Drug Administration leveled against Amgen after it emerged that the company was billing Medicare for some of its own drugs, which were obtained from the vendor’s patent portfolio.

This isn’t the first time Amgen has come under fire for this kind of behavior. The company was hit with a [$57 million fine](&lt;|url|&gt;) from the FDA earlier this year for misbranding some of its products as generic versions.

The new round of scrutiny by the FDA is a natural expansion of what the agency did with Turing. The earlier settlements led to the company’s recall of its entire product line. But the scope of inquiry into Valeant was unprecedented. The drug’s entire business relied on the relationship — or lack — of business with Amgen. The existence of such a close business relationship with a particular drug’s manufacturer ensured that demand for the drug was high, and the incentive was to frequently switch from generic to patented drugs. And patent eligibility is a key factor in driving up prices: If an Amgen drug isn’t patented at some point, it can be made cheaper by selling more of it to Amgen.

There was also little need for Valeant to sell its product to the public in the first place. The company relied on sales pitches to convince Medicare that it was worth their while to pay for their medications. And the company made it very difficult for its patients to make such informed decisions. I spoke with one patient who described seeing a doctor in his own words, and another who agreed to an Amgen pill only when they were both told they would be taking an anti-balding drug, a far cry from the deadly combination of anti-malarials and Valeant eyeglasses. These patient stories add new perspective to the idea that there is a public sector drug out there, and linking Valeant and Amgen is like linking Las Vegas and the Pokemon Go Store.
> # Not even Big Pharma can match A.I. The ability to build anything without a market is limitless.

We cannot know what patients will actually be told on their own, much less be told by a doctor, bar none, about an Amgen drug. It may be too expensive, or it may be too difficult for patients to make an informed decision when a decision needs to be made, and the reasons given for making such a decision are clearly not worth millions of dollars. Providing an alternative is out of the question.

Asking people to take a pill to combat symptoms of serious disease is harmful, unhelpful, and, in my experience, somewhat fraudulent. A.I. is still far from being able to outperform human beings in all aspects of life, and will always have limitations that cripple what A.I. can already do to make the world a better place. But at some point, we have to ask if it is really the pursuit of a better place that is so compelling. We have made it our life work. Now, let’s make it count.<|endoftext|>

A major cornerstone of superhero entertainment ended this week — and no, it wasn’t the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With the finale of *Gotham*, we lose a wild TV show that knew how to make comic book material work. It’s a shame
