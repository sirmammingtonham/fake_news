�s about the only thing anyone ever said to me that’d make me a better designer. I was always looking to the internet to find inspiration, not to answer an ad, and my mother had created an entire digital print catalog of her artworks.

I’d also met a few women working on social media, like me, who are the exact opposite. When I first heard about social media influencers, like myself, and realized what an influence we could have — and still have — in a culture that has embraced online influencers in a way it’s still not completely accepting of online influencers as creators, we just felt like, well, the people who are creating the influencers could be men and women that don’t want to be called “real” people.

You can’t “like” someone on Facebook without them realizing it, or on Instagram without them knowing that someone is into them or posting about them. You literally can’t tell. The more that we embrace these influencers, the more opportunities we have to create an audience just for ourselves online. And that audience size is huge, because once you have too many people in the audience, what they post becomes public, and it can be seen — and that’s when it starts to snowball.

So we do see the same kinds of things coming from men, too. I remember when I went to New York Fashion Week in 2013 and they had the issue where there was a whole runway show called “The Trinity” with people in suits and ties, or women in dresses and tops in an issue that was all about representation. And I remember how they tried to pull the cover of one of those issues and it just sat there, unsold, for months, and then someone finally figured out that it was a hoax. Then, five months after, it came out.

This year’s New York Fashion Week, the issue didn’t be real, but it did have a photo of a model in an issue of GQ that was just about representation. And if you go, and you go to the website [GQ.]&lt;|url|&gt;, there’s a photo that’s attached called the “Miracle on Bleecker Street.” It has the caption that reads, “The most incredible people, most beautiful faces, and the perfect bodies of women will be created digitally.” (To quote a giddy verse from *New York Times*magazine).

And that spreads from really basic things like how you can only appear gorgeous if you have the perfect body online, and how everyone has been conditioned to think that. There was even a photo shot for GQ in 2015, taken in a Los Angeles salon, that supposedly inspired my husband to delete his account. His account was completely wiped clean.

I went to my very first Twitter Q&A on Tuesday, and it was exactly the kind of unexpected and illuminating question one might expect in the same venue at Cosmopolitan to confront with a woman in her thirties doing stand-up. It was just me and her, and a microphone in front of a live audience, saying hello to the internet’s only woman on the planet — and it didn’t even require an explanation or a password.

And it’s really just a reminder that our digital devices — the things that make us human — can be incredibly dangerous, because of the way we consume information, the way we amplify everything, the way we build networks and expectations around a certain event. We need more conversations around this, because it’s clear that we have to get beyond the “make believe” phase of our digital devices.

I know I missed it. And there are lots of other things that I don’t go to Twitter Q&As to ask. A lot of people I talk to say they don’t bother anymore, because they just can’t seem to get their ducks in place.
