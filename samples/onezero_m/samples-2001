“So, why are we going to have to [sign our children up for this special stuff](&lt;|url|&gt;)?”

That’s a great and simple question. Yes, we are, and we’ll have to (withdraw the same amount of money — more like $50 — each year). Yes, we do this because a) we like the fact that they have the option, and, b) it’s a great way to help spread the word about being a smart, healthy, fun child.

And we’ll do what we can (a lot of us). The “science” of being a smart, healthy toddler is a hotbed for pseudoscience, and there’s a certain condescension about being the center of attention — well, actually, there’s a kind of condescension at least.

We’re going to have to sort through all of it. But I think the answer, at least for me, is to have the courage to be me, and take a day off from work. I know why you did that.”<|endoftext|>

## A Fictional ‘War for the Planet of the Apes’

### We know, from films like *Avatar* to television shows like *The Gifted,** **and the upcoming movies *Avengers: Infinity War, the Last of the ‘He Who Must Not Be Named,’* that humans can and do get super-powered, but this war feels different. But are it right to put our children in danger?**

“War is hell in the real world,” the ancient Chinese proverb goes. But in a fantastical new world created by a group of kids on the internet in 2012, it may be worse. For we know, thanks to the power-ups, superpowers, and missteps of other *Wizard* fans and a fictional organization called Guardians of the *Original *Apes,* that humans have indeed gotten super-powered.

War is hell in the real world, where children, in a never-ending war for territory and resources, are exposed to biological weapons, radiation, and their very real but very controversial ability to turn into androids. Hell in the real world, too, is filled with threats, both organic (think killer bees) and inorganic (think evil robots). Just in time for the celebrations of *The Powerpuff Girls’ 35th anniversary special this fall, there have been [Halloween spooky stories](&lt;|url|&gt;) of children in the real world being turned into something vaguely creepy, with the writers deciding to hang a few scare quotes around their necks.

“[Wizard and Glass creator J.K. Rowling said](&lt;|url|&gt;) in ‘80s television series *Twilight* that she felt the show deliberately twisted the real-life events of her ‘90s kids’ pop culture crossover, ‘98% Invisible,’ to make them into teenagers. Now, kids will watch these movies and read the books and have their own take on what being a wizard or a girl-next-door is really like. In fact, the movie version of *The Gifted *deals entirely with the fear that young girls will be taken by wizards and men will try to seduce them, turning them into something evil and scary. When a human man gets turned into a mouse, he’s turned into a mouse — and anyone who’s not a wizard is probably scared the hell out of them.

Which brings us back to the weirdness of this new *Apes* movie.* When it’s said that humans can be given superpowers at will, that seems rather out of left field, although this is the *G* franchise, and kids have seen almost everything in the rebooted *Avengers* movies. There’s one small quirk in *Apes*, though: In the *G* movies, Professor X never gets a happy ending.

In the films, when Beast tumbles into the magical world and kidnaps the boy Jason at the school dance (voiced by Michael Fassbender), he freaks out, thinking he�
