ooters. I know the company that makes them knows that I like to look at my phone. Why would they design them this way? It’s a shame these kinds of questions aren’t being asked more often and more broadly.

I’m a West Point graduate, and I serve in the military. My dad is a Marine officer, and he lost his when a heart attack knocked him out of his life in 2007. I don’t know what to believe anymore.

### **Are children on your team reading these words?**

Not really. They’re just having fun. They’re putting on a performance piece for the world to see.

### **So if they’re having fun, why are they having so much fun?**

We’ve seen teams dedicated to [taking selfies at the White House](&lt;|url|&gt;). We’ve seen people volunteer [making murals in schools](&lt;|url|&gt;). And we’ve taken part in making sure that our kids are behaving like adults in order to motivate them into [smugglers’ tricks](&lt;|url|&gt;).

### **Are kids showing you the same behavior?](&lt;|url|&gt;)

Not really. Recently, they’ve stopped. It’s kind of scary sometimes.

### **Are you more worried about them?**

I’m more worried about them.

### **Well, I know that you’ve got people who aren’t participating in this game. And I know that there are people who are giving this game away for free —**

A lot of people are giving this game away for free — and they’re doing it in a way that’s very clear and very visible.

### **What’s the app you are giving away for free?**

[Cifaldi’s App](&lt;|url|&gt;).*

It’s not a game. It’s a way to release the stress of not knowing when you’re going to get a text or a notification from your phone.

### **It sounds like you are giving your child a gift.**

I am giving my child a gift: Time. This could be the thing that [breaks them]. Imagine if you were to put your child in front of a fire in the evening and ask them, “Would you like to eat more chocolate cake or more Oreos?” If the answer was always Oreos, the child would become addicted to chocolate and Oreos, and they’d become frustrated simply by not having the next fix. If you’re patient, they will learn to look at the screen time is being spent and make decisions that benefit them in life, rather than sitting there and wasting time.

### **How do kids know what to believe and how to behave towards adults in order to “keep you safe”?**

We don’t. Are you sure you want to get rid of that? I guess I would say that there can be some downsides to this. On the one hand, it’s nice that you have this conversation. On the other hand, if we sit here and have this conversation, we’re not finding the strength to come to grips with the fact that we don’t know what our true dispositions are. We’re not finding the strength to look at the real world and think critically about what we want to change.

### **Why are kids giving this app away for free and what are they gaining from it?**

It absolutely traps people in a cycle. I mean, if you don’t download this app, you are absolutely screwed. I wish I could give you an example of someone who has been using an app to manage their stress but has the app turned off.

I’d love to use App Place, to manage my stress, but my kids’ table manners say no. They’ll yell at you if you’re [banging on your phone](&lt;|url|&gt;). They’ll tell you to shut the app down.

So, I say, turn it off. This one time, I’m going to give it a try. And see what happens.

### **It turns out the app is helping you to have a better time of things. And it’s comforting. Thank you.**

Thanks.
