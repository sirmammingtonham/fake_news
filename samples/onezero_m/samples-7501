 at its event and is still working on its platform, said in a statement provided to CNET by the company. “To our knowledge, this is the only [disclosure] related to Facebook of this nature.”

This follows a week in which Mark Zuckerberg [published a long piece](&lt;|url|&gt;) detailing his new service, Stream+, in which he promised to build tools to help people cut down on excessive bandwidth and streaming costs by [trapping users in their virtual private areas](&lt;|url|&gt;) and selling them bandwidth on the open market.

While this may technically be legal, both the FCC and New York State police have registered a [conspiracy to disrupt the open internet](&lt;|url|&gt;) on their networks, something that both New York and New York City [have](&lt;|url|&gt;) registered. And while the FCC doesn’t have the power to compel these platforms to take certain actions under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, it can at least prevent them from ever making any policy that could be construed as a violation.

Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act specifically says that these platforms can’t be treated as conduits that connect us to each other, but there’s no suggestion in the law that they are. Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg themselves both say they want “an end to open internet” as a whole, but both remain unwilling to characterize what that actually means. In a statement, both Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg [said](&lt;|url|&gt;) that they are committed to “an open internet” in which everyone has access to the same content, but on which they differentiate by device. At a later point, Zuckerberg admitted that “it might not be practical to get every person to participate in, and we’re working on it.”

Under both the FCC and New York’s own Open Internet rules, all Facebook users must be at least 18 years old to participate in its Facebookplexes, and Foursquare requires that all developers partner with the platform to enable its desktop or mobile apps. I’ve been inside the Facebook ecosystem myself for several weeks and while I’ve met some truly interesting companies, I’ve met also a number of trolls and scam artists who want to ruin the fun by, for example, abusing the_platform_to_harvest_advertisers’ data or trying to get access to private messages.

Which brings us to a surprising new development: Facebook is also adding a secure tab to its app portfolio. According to a blog post published by the Facebook’s subsidiary, [Security & Privacy](&lt;|url|&gt;), the new tab will allow users to play video games on the background of posts, improving on the current practice of showing clickable content on the bottom of posts rather than the top.

This follows a similar development from the [veneer industry](&lt;|url|&gt;), which allows manufacturers to [embed animated characters in their apps](&lt;|url|&gt;) where they’re easily identifiable from the mobile web.

It’s not every day that you get the chance to see an app installed on millions of computers around the world — and it’s not every day that a security researcher can’t find a way to bypass the [online presence](&lt;|url|&gt;) barriers and infect unsuspecting users. With this in mind, the [Toby](&lt;|url|&gt;) project — which asks that you share your personal information — is clearly an intelligence-backed test to see how an app market research team can milks its results for sensitive information.

The app raises an important question: How big or small is the leap from spyware to genuinely useful products?

Before we answer that question, it’s worth examining the history of the technology itself.

What does a spyware product do?

In my 2017 **Fortnite *research [*In It Together](&lt;|url|&gt;) *series, I argued that *Fortnite *could be the perfect social game to test the waters of engagement and user engagement on, since it’s built with an infinite number of sources (through multiple authentication mechanisms), and because it offers the community a completely different gameplay experience than other social games that have tried to replicate its addictive qualities. It’s a fun streaming game that’s built to foster social interactions, not to create a social network that’s modeled on Facebook’s News Feed.
