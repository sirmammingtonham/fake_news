 different state data (for example, sunrise and sunset times) and [also provides access](&lt;|url|&gt;) to other state and county-level data sets.

The transparency project also turns on the business logic of government. The more we know about our state and local economies, the more we can design them better. The beauty of state data sets is that they’re intentionally obfuscated from public view. When we see the actual numbers behind a particular state or county’s statistical profile, it can feel scary, like we’re watching some sort of international crime wave that we’re powerless to stop. But at the same time, we should never underestimate the value of our data. We should strive to keep it as private as possible, because that’s precisely what we’re doing right now.

This piece has been corrected to state the correct state Senate number. It initially stated that Measure 64 would prevent local governments from using your name to set their own rates. This has been corrected to [clearly say](&lt;|url|&gt;) that cities cannot set their own rates. The legislature has, in fact, been discussing solutions to this problem for years.](<|endoftext|>)*

## Your Dirty AirPods Are Grosser Than You Think

### Here’s what lives on your earbuds — and how to clean them

Take a good look at your earbuds. Is the mesh clogged with earwax? Is there a strip of dirt or lint lining the plastic seams? Maybe there’s even an oddly intense and dark dust clinging to the interior edges of your AirPods case.

If your earbuds are disgusting, know this first: no shame. This is an obscenely common issue, an element of high-tech hygiene that is, oddly, overlooked, given how ubiquitous buds have become since the introduction of the iPod in 2001. But these little hunks of plastic, mesh, and rubber collect particles of dust, lint, earwax, metal, dirt, and pollution all in the name of “innovative technology.”

How dangerous is all that crap on your earbuds? The answer is complicated, but at the very least, you’re unlikely to get ill from the months-old gunk left to build on the plastic and mesh. But there are certain circumstances in which you could be at some risk, so while there’s no need to panic — or, God forbid, remove the buds from your ears, which might mean you have to talk to somebody — it’s never too late to start a healthy earbud-cleaning regimen.

It’s obvious a lot of us could benefit from such direction. I received at least 50 images this week of people’s gunked-up earbuds, and while I have truly no intention to shame anyone, I have to admit that some of the pictures were alarming.

One woman’s third-grader brought home his earbuds looking like this:

And, of course, there were plenty of photos of earwax left to collect on the amplifier mesh and surrounding plastic.

Most of the people I talked to never cleaned
