 was a big-time-traveler, though not by much. I’m from 1981 to 1987, and I went from being a regular customer of AirPods to a full-time wireless audio accessory sales representative in 2017. Back in those days, you needed to own an iPhone to be considered a serious wireless audio accessory sales representative. Today, you can still find a wide variety of AirPods and their associated accessories, including some that retail for upward of $120. Some of them, like the original iPad Air, still sell well today.

Did I need to own an iPhone to be considered a good-to-work wireless audio coder? No. The answer is simple: AirPods, and the accompanying charging case, required iPhone users to have an iPhone. Apple didn’t introduce third-party charging cases for the iPad Air, nor did it, for that matter, make the case for the Mac, nor did it, for that matter, for the simple cable that came with it.

The pairing process and overall cord are, of course, slightly different depending on which model of AirPods you have. If you have the smaller, wireless iPad Pro, the cord will be completely hidden under your AirPod socket. In contrast, if you have the larger, wired iPad, the cord will hang straight down behind your ear, right where your ear would be if you were, say, listening to an iPhone XS, which already has a tight series-long cord.

This means that, no matter what iPad Air Power you plug into, the case and all the wiring will be there. Even if you pop that out and hold the case in your hand, the cable will already have gone through the bird. And if you slowly unplug the AirPods while the phone is powered off, they will, surprisingly, remain firmly attached to the case for as long as the case is able to.

This is somewhat puzzling, because we normally think of computer parts as being disposable, but as soon as you power them up, they become hard to put back together. When your iPad Pro debuts, you can basically start to try and reassemble it anywhere you want, to make it work for as many uses as possible.

While this might seem fine to some, it’s actually kind of crazy. In my case, there are actually two cases of AirPods 2 lying next to each other on my desk, protected by a plastic “bong” style rocker. In another room, stacks of old AirPods lay strewn across the floor, strewn with what appears to be 100- or 200-gram pieces. There’s such a mess of ungainly white and blue blankets! How can this be?

If you’re accustomed to tidy, color-rich devices like the iPhone XR, the situation might seem slightly different with AirPods 2. The white wires, however, are longer and thicker than with the original AirPods, and there’s no way to easily plug them in or remove them. Though, that’s not such a big deal if you’re accustomed to iPhone XR camera coverage.

In fact, that’s exactly what I was looking for when I went into my local Apple Store a few years ago. There, next to piles of iPhone XRs, was a fresh batch of iPhone AirPods. As I reached inside for the first time, I shook my head and rolled my eyes at the same time.

At least, most of the time.

I had tried (and failed) to get the first AirPods out the door earlier in 2016, when Apple invited me to a New York event to show them off. At that show, I did just fine, and then some. Apple CMD [is](&lt;|url|&gt;) the only person to have an iPhone XR, but he did sell some early AirPods at a New York event a few years later (some [of which [still](&lt;|url|&gt;) have iPhone XR camera issues).

In any event, I have no ill will towards those AirP
