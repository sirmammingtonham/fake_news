 new of a time](&lt;|url|&gt;),” he says. “You have a phone in front of you — is there more that you want to look at?”

To be fair, Facebook did pull one interesting stunt last year: It had [a programmable stand](&lt;|url|&gt;) that you could use to make handwritten lists and labels, respectively. But we can probably safely say that this feature won’t be effective in any of the end (or any of the beginning) versions of the platform.

Instead, what may be most useful are MCAS’ [multitasking capabilities](&lt;|url|&gt;). If you open Slack, you can work on multiple branches of the same app, with different emojis and stylesheets. And for apps that support multiple branches, you can group them together with a single “@mention,” which identifies specific content that needs to be seen. For example, you might not be able to use the @mention feature to mark tweets as embarrassing material or posts that need to be read. But if you’m looking for something specific to read on a particular issue, you can get it by using the annotated RSS feed that Pages supervenees.

It requires coding, of course, but across the board, security features that come from a multilateral developer coalition — developed by Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon — would help.

## **Uses and obscurity**

Even if Facebook’s new features are more practical in practice, they’ll be less useful in practice than they are in theory. Projects that require more work to implement will almost certainly get more attention on the ground. A [2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that a combination of public awareness campaigns and intensive media attention can improve health outcomes, even if those outcomes are personally measured against the high-risk end of the spectrum. But the study also warned that “media attention alone may be insufficient to achieve its desired outcomes.”

## **Meaning and why**

The study posited that a lack of motivated reasoning could be a hindrance to the development of new technologies that are geared toward improving lives at scale. The study posited that “misdiagnoses, or bad choices, could undermine the public health messages of these digital technologies.” Bad decisions, in other words, could keep people from making smart, informed choices that could have positive consequences in the real world.

There are risks with advancing technology like this, not least the potential to introduce a terrifyingly unfair bias in how health information is presented to consumers. NCTE foresees that “wealthy individuals, defined as individuals who have assets that include land, income, or wealth, may find themselves underserved or undersung.” An analyst at the not-for-profit trade-aid organization AgeWorks American estimated that if current trends continue in the coming years, “By 2066, nearly half of all U.S. adults will be living in poverty (adjusted for purchasing power parity) at a median income.”

And if and when realty is invented to make health care more accessible, the problem will only intensify. NCTE, for example, recently [published a white paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) proposing a system to help finance private insurance as well as pay for private insurance. The paper envisions a world in which people can get health insurance from an external source, such as Medicare, and buy it through an insurance company — both of which would then sell the same policy to people. The buyer is so attached to the paper that they may or may not even see the person whose health information is being obtained. The insurance company is in league with Girlfriend Sixix, a sex toy company whose mission is to help people achieve long-lasting, healthy relationships through a comprehensive package of health services. NCTE’s vision of a post-work sex toy store is not an uncommon one.

“What if you were caught by a phalanx of armed private insurers with hush money?” Girlfriend Sixix’s Rob Burnett [told](&lt;|url|&gt;) the *Huffington Post* last year. “If I were married to the person I was going to marry, I would be more inclined to say, ‘Have some fun and let me set the price.’”

Her proposal echoes an argument that some sex workers are making — that sex work should be decriminalized to help increase the supply of sex workers in need. Marlowe, who is trying to immigrate to the U.S. from Ecuador, [told](&lt;|url|&gt;
