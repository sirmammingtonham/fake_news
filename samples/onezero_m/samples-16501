 If they get too big, they just lose a important part of their insulation.

The packaging for the Prism are a lot like the packaging for another of my homes:

The wallpaper is soft pink that also appears as part of the wall behind it; I like it because it contrasts the subdued green of the flooring and the brightly colored walls (bright enough to read on a Kindle).

I have no complaints about the exterior lighting in this particular space, which is downright gorgeous. And maybe I’m biased toward the warmer shades because I live in a building that is part of the Snow Globe family (though I’m also part of the Ennis-Hadas-Wright architectural dynasty, which includes elegant stone buildings). Nonetheless, I can easily envision complaints about uneven contrast and reflections, particularly in the case of the former. Hopefully Apple addressed these issues when it included color in its last screen, and I would love to see more vibrant options like it.

Finally, a Prism Mini camera. It’s like the ultimate in compact, powerful photography.

## **Fill in the blank**

So, let’s start with what’s not in the photo: My trusty iPhone 6.

It’s not the first phone I’ve had in my hands in a week, and it won’t be the last. With its fatter, curvier edges, and no lens, it’s not the first phone I’ll ever take to the office. It’s the phone my grandparents would use, my parents would use, my students would use, and so on. It’s the phone I would use, need, and want to use the most, if only to escape my guilt.

So, why not just buy a real iPhone?

Performance is fast, the camera is sharp, and the display is crisp, even if off a few pixels too often. Over the course of a day, I got over 200 images copied from my iPhone. If I was using the equivalent process on an iPad, it would be a lot more efficient using the iPhone’s built-in Camera app instead of the built-in Camera app. It would recognize my finger on the screen just as I would a regular camera, except instead of snapping a shot of water on a cliff, the photo would be saved to the cloud. The process would also let me capture a little more detail, even though the camera was never truly off.

Using the Prism Mini with mixed reality makes it even easier to document your environment. Just note the environment — you won’t need to set it up specifically for underwater photography. I also think it’s an interesting idea for a future mobile app.

The stereo speakers also let me reinforce just how much I know about my home screen. I can turn off automated reminders in the app if I want to. The Classic lets me know that I need to create a password for everything, including the calendar. I didn’t set it that particular account. It’s a simple enough password that I can remember right on my first try.

Then, once I’m in the app, I can start creating passwords for the things I want to access. There’s so much stuff I want to do with my password manager that I don’t know how to do properly, so I need assistance. The best way for me to learn how to use a password manager is to watch the VICE videos about using them [here on Medium](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [here on YourTango](&lt;|url|&gt;).
