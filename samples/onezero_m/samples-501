 their second-longest streak of record-tying consecutive shutout streaks; he even added that the streak began on Monday, Oct. 22—a month earlier than the team’s previous streak. But it quickly became clear that was more of a marker than a trend.

On the day this streak snapped, I had not eaten. I’ve been trying to lose weight. It was kind of like I just wasn’t getting the energy for days,” Brown explained. “I’m like, ‘This is not happening. This shouldn’t be happening.’ And then like 15 minutes later, the phone rings and the fans are screaming for me.”

This morning, Brown tells *The Verge*, he called his management team and said his phone was ringing off the hook. The next day he was on the phone all day—he wouldn’t give them another chance. (His callers included his team manager, the coach Steve Kerr, along with the team’s president of basketball operations, Billy Donovan. It seemed to Brown like a typical day, but it wasn’t — the phone kept ringing.)

“I’m getting frantic,” he told the paper.

He told some of his caller-sourced sources on Twitter, too. “I’ve been on this quest not to lose weight, but to lose 40 pounds, one step at a time. So I am already feeling super good. All day Monday my phone was chirping with fans.”

“The hardest part is not working out,” he added in an email. “In the end, it’s about eating well, not feeling tired, not looking good, and not not being hungry.”

For Brown, the phone call was the perfect distraction. “I was like, ‘Yo — where’s my phone?! You’re going to get an earful!” he said. “Just being able to talk to the fans, I don’t think it’s a good idea to be trying to get into a rhythm and not listen. My heart was pounding, and I just couldn’t focus at that moment. It was a bit weird. The phone was kind of like a mental health device, but in a good way. There’s no real downside to that. The hardest part is not working out. The hardest part is to continue being myself.<|endoftext|>

## How the Super Bowl Hype Machine Works

### The game's biggest moments reveal a deeper truth about the sport

Over the years, I’ve interviewed thousands of athletes about Super Bowl XLVIII while also following how they felt—and did—in this historic moment and countless others. We all have different ways of expressing our feelings about the game. Some cry, some tweet, some keep in touch, all the while others don’t leave their hometown, rarely to this city and state for the NFL.

This year, a new interview with former player Jonathan Jones gives me an opportunity to ask players directly if they’n’ve ever thought about the outcome, and whether it actually counts. He’s on the verge of a comeback and wants to return there for one last trip to Super Bowl LIII. But he will only bring it to Houston. His hometown.

* *There’s a line I see more frequently during Super Bowl halftime performances. People start singing an acoustic rendition of the national anthem because their heart is pounding so hard that the stadium sound designer can’t find it, and the crowd goes ape-shit crazy.*

It’s an easy line to adopt, and I’d be surprised to hear anyone don’t know, too. It’s an easy line to adopt, especially in the midst of an emotional event with a loud and passionate crowd and a star-studded halftime show. It’s a line you’ll hear a lot during the game, with all of the players from around the league talking about it.

That’s because this season’s Super Bowl halftime performance was an emotional one
