 app can also track our locations, but that data is used to provide targeted advertising — which the FTC has labeled as a “search tool.” While Google has for years collected massive troves of user data via the Google Analytics suite, users also agree to let companies harvest data about their internet usage. Even when companies don’t share any information about us directly, users still agree to let them [read their emails](&lt;|url|&gt;), [listen to their voicemails, or[ take pictures](&lt;|url|&gt;) — information that Google regularly [talks to](&lt;|url|&gt;) the families of the people it’s targeted.

There is one exception: when we share data “with family members or caregivers when the person dies, and then with the rest of the world,” according to [the FTC’s privacy policy](&lt;|url|&gt;). The policy provides few details about how this would work at the death and then turns over to the next “step” of the grief process, which is generally when a [company puts out a paper detailing the person’s life and career choices.](&lt;|url|&gt;)
> # In a similar vein, some tech companies offer tools within the platforms to help families deal with the loss of a loved one who leaves behind tech records.

This third such exception highlights another troubling trend: leaving behind tech-enabled records of everything from where a loved one was abducted to their educational background. While parents may have copies of all their emails, photos, and documents — albeit mostly from school — they may not always have copies of how long they spent at each location, where they went, or what they did for a commute. In an effort to fill this gap, some tech companies are offering “momentum,” or the amount of time users spend on a particular platform versus the total time they spend on the entire site. This second exception highlights another concern for platforms and apps that hope to make money by offering parents targeted advertising.

Imagine you’re a parent, wanting to track how your child is spending their free time — checking their social media accounts to make sure they aren’t leaving school without a clear record. Or perhaps you want to keep track of how much sleep your child gets each night, so you know how much attention they need from the right app. Or perhaps you’re looking to follow a child’s example of “[account creation](&lt;|url|&gt;)” so that you can dedicate the next time they go online to tutoring, which they [quickly sign up for](&lt;|url|&gt;) at a [really affordable] price,” then you need to keep track of how much time they spend on platforms, so that you can dedicate the appropriate amount of time tuning them for the right behavior. This is especially important if the parent is a Goldmember child, as I’ll go to Montreal this weekend to see my wonderful Brittany and co-worker Adam (on location later this month at the Museum of Sex at the Ontario Science Centre).

## **Keeping track**

I’m trying to be prescriptive here, so let’s assume all these parents have a goldmember account. This will indicate to the child’s platform — and online learning platform — that there’s important information to track, including the day of the week, how often the child uses the app, how often they use the chat function, and what portion of the chat window they spend most time in.

This third example is even more revealing. Although the parents in the photos shared their email addresses and passwords, they didn’t attempt to hide their actual location. As soon as I ran the IP address or username through a piece of software, their phones started buzzing with activity. “Is that my ip? How do I know that?” I mumbled, trying to sound as unintelligible as possible. At that point, the “ping” protocol sent a ping every few seconds, always identifying me as the person being monitored. As soon as I began to notice odd activity, my wife tapped me on the shoulder to confirm it had been a real ping. Then, she checked her notifications. No, it wasn’t.

Every once in a while, I would get a text message from Brittany, alerting me to notifications that the app was sending me, whether it was accepting them or not. Typically, these notifications would be nothing more than quick looks at my phone before it began sending me a message. These notifications made me feel like I was still being followed, and I could rely on the fact that they were there when I put my phone on speaker or on mute. In those
