 apparent of a long-standing assumption among marketers, users, and architects that when a design concept satisfies its users and fulfills its purpose, then the design will work. Even if users don’t fully understand why they’re excited about the concept’s initial elements, they’ll quickly adapt the design to achieve the intended purposes.

The most effective use of advertising is, of course, the one that generates the most revenue. The more effective your advertising is, the more sales can be made — which means the more revenue you can drive, and the more profit you can make, and the more opportunities remain for you to sell your product and make money.

“The fundamental problem with advertising is the content of the ads,” says Steven Pinker. “If you make an ad which works because it is catchy and relatable, then that will persuade people to click or show their support by making these people want to support the company in a more tangible way.”

We don’t yet fully grasp the extent to which visual cues, such as the use of colors or shapes, can shape our motivation, our consumption, or even our consumption of content. However, they do at least work in some situations. A study published in the journal *Nature Communications* last fall [found](&lt;|url|&gt;) that exposure to images of violence — and, specifically, images of violence through the use of graphic icons — can influence human motivation and choices.

In 1997, the advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather opened my office from the inside out. Its mission was to help editors discover new talent while preserving as much of the old best practices as possible while digital technology changed the nature and meaning of traditional print production.

My agency was part of a wave of startups that transformed traditional advertising from innovative experiments to essential businesses. Adjectives like “innovative” and “essential” became shorthand for how much the digital ad industry needed the help. Even if the work was done ethically — and many of the ad pioneers of the early 1990s — the work of creatives was essential.

The digital revolution changed the role of advertising creatives and how things were done. But it didn’t make the creatives any better off, and it created a sense of relief in the writerspace where creatives could work on challenging tasks without fear of burnout or the loss of their jobs.

I now teach a course called “Creative Writing: A Human Need,” which is supposed to equip students to cope with and overcome the shift from traditional advertising to the digital age. For many students, this transformation is a simple and obvious one: As the economy is transformed, writers are transformed too.

Creative writing today is fundamentally different from the art school days of the 1950s and 60s when it was primarily a way to bridge the achievement gap between the privileged and the unprivileged. More people than ever are coming into the writing space and learning the craft in the private community of the writer, which is increasingly defined by peer groups and shared expertise rather than by formal education alone.

But while there is increased demand for writers in the new digital media sector, the demand and the need isn’t necessarily for writers as it once was. The demand today is more about the communicators, the communicators the audience wants and needs. Advertisers and their brands are becoming larger and larger, but there is no escaping the fact that this is the digital age. The writing space is in a space no longer defined by academic and technical expertise, but by the social. The audiences are more mobile and ephemeral. Technology moves us from being objects of inquiry to objects of consumption.

Creative writing has always been a community effort. The writing community in the '60
