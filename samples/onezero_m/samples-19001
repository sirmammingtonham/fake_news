# Email Autocomplete Is Sucking the Life Out of Communication

## The new services turn email into bloodless business speak. So why are we allowing Silicon Valley to dictate what we say?

If you’ve used Gmail any time recently, you’ll probably be familiar with Smart Reply and Smart Compose. Smart Reply is simple. Whenever you receive an email, the first thing you should do is *Think’t Email*. Here’s how to create an account:

* Use your email client of choice to display the message’s subject and message. *When prompted by the user, choose an “I’m sure this is secure” box. These two components are integrated into Gmail, so simply tapping the magnifying glass within the Be app will display the message you want to send.

* Click on the “I’m sure this is secure” box. This will bring up a page of your emails that you can easily read for relevant links.

* Click on the “Sign me up” button. This is actually just a normal Gmail button, with a few handy badges indicating the type of email app you’re signing up for.

* Click on the “Sign me up” button. This is actually just a regular Gmail button, with a few handy badges indicating the type of email app you’re signing up for.

It’s a pretty quick process, save for a required firmware update that occurred shortly after connecting the Oculus Quest to the internet. I had a similar experience with my Microsoft Exchange account. That said, I can’t recall exactly how we ended up here. I suspect it was something to do with the ~$600 Oculus Quest per Oculus Go headset. If you’re interested, here’s how it happened:

I returned the Oculus Quest to the Oculus Store, where it sold for $599.

Oculus informed me that the system “resides in the real world” and that I could download apps from the Oculus Store, but I don’t know enough about the system to know what I should do. Also, I don’t know how to install apps using Oculus’s SDK (software development kit) on a PC, so I used a Windows laptop with OpenCV (a cross-platform framework) running Microsoft’s new copy of Windows on it. That is the approach I took.

Samsung’s dual screen device, the 7 Pro, launched late last year. The larger of the two, it’s more impressively gorgeous than the 6.3-inch Infinity, which debuted alongside the Galaxy S10 in 2016.

The 7 Pro will be Samsung’s second-generation phone, following the [Galaxy S10](&lt;|url|&gt;). The larger also better meets [the company’s new guidelines](&lt;|url|&gt;) for choosing AMOLED screens.

There’s also the oddity of needing two screens to run the 7 Pro. One is used for social media, but the other doubles as a new revenue-sharing program for Samsung. There’s no doubt the company could make this a co-brand, but as of yet, there’s no indication it’s willing to give away anything substantial for the foreseeable future.

The co-brand is, however, a virtual reality (VR)
