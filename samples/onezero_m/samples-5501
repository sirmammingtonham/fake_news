 upon them and to be more active in their digital worlds through apps like Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube.

In other words, as the world shifts over, we shift our norms around what counts as personal. Our definitions of personal are wider and more imprecise than ever. But the shifts we make in the culture represent the sharpening of our senses, in part through online tools and in part through the internet’s amplification of traditional gender norms.

As Sune Engelhardt, a technology policy expert at the [Centre for Democracy and Technology](&lt;|url|&gt;), explains, this is both a cultural phenomenon and a serious problem. “We’re becoming increasingly aware of how digital devices are distorting and classifying large swaths of our society,” he says. “We have very little time and space to reflect on and understand why this is the case and to plan for these problems.”

While it is certainly true that the norms we shift by through the internet are less relevant today than they were five years ago, this doesn’t mean they aren’t still important. Nor does it mean that the specific issues of personal data privacy and cyberbullying don’t exist. Both Engelhardt and I are contributing articles to the forthcoming issue of the [journal](&lt;|url|&gt;) *Nudge*, which will examine the specific challenges of each facet of digital capitalism and its potential impact on our lives.

I encourage everyone who might be interested in reading this to do so. It’s our job to make sense of it. And while I wouldn’t advise it right now, there’s no situation that’s guaranteed to bring more awareness and discussion of these issues, at least not compared to the [moving](&lt;|url|&gt;) around Trump and ongoing investigations.

So, if you’re in the mood for more nuggets, or if you just want to skip to a particular quote, here’s a quick rundown of what you might find in Engelhardt’s and Ryan’s articles:

* “The war for your soul” is at least partly a fight over power dynamics between two factions within Facebook: a faction led by Mark Zuckerberg (of all places) who wants to curtail what he terms the “alt-right” movement; and a more stable faction of the Facebook community, led by Channing, that believes in staying connected and participating in online spaces.

* “As long as we’re tied to one another, it’s hard to get away from it. The [alt-right’s] toxic rhetoric isthmiches together with the kind of people you’d be comfortable with at cocktail parties. The whole thing just seems like a ton of shit.”

* The dynamic between these two factions isn’t exactly friendly, but it’s also not hostile. Alt-right supporters cheer the adoption of new Twitter restrictions, such as [“filtering tweets after hours”](&lt;|url|&gt;) or [“reports of serious crimes”](&lt;|url|&gt;), or the adoption of an [increasing list of things](&lt;|url|&gt;) that seem designed to hamper expressive activity on social media.

* Given how powerful these two factions are on social media, it’s reasonable to assume that these two communities would find some comfort in one another.

It’s a storyline that Facebook and Twitter would have probably considered both facts and drama-producing opportunities in the current political moment.

For Facebook, the storyline is its continued attempt to purify its user base by failing to understand, court, or control extremism. (Remember the [aluminum backbone memes](&lt;|url|&gt;)? The “you were never one of our friends.”) Tommy Vietor and Kara Swisher, the groups’ creators, respectively lead and [co-chairs of the Facebook Public Policy and Facebook Diversity task force](&lt;|url|&gt;), respectively, have [both quit](&lt;|url|&gt;) the company over the last few years.

It’s a similar story on Twitter, where Facebook diversity expert [Kosta Kushlev](&lt;|url|&gt;) and Adam Buss, a long-time engineer at Facebook, respectively, have alleged that chief product officer Alexis Buterinitch — who left the company in February to become the president of product [creation and expansion](&lt;|url|&gt;) — has kept the social media news feed overflowing with
