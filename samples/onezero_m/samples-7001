 depending on the platform as well as the specific product and service.

And those products and services — as well as the privacy & scalability of their offerings — are often proprietary, built for a specific purpose, or suited to a particular type of service. Consider LinkedIn’s [personalization and automation tool](&lt;|url|&gt;), which was [designed to be a tool for journalists](&lt;|url|&gt;) but is today being used for automation in the cloud. Or consider Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, which is really a tool for developers and marketers to test out ideas and ideas. Or consider the forthcoming debut of the blockchain-powered delivery app [Wink.](&lt;|url|&gt;) In other words, we’re entering a new phase in the history of our species. During this phase, we’re making sweeping technological changes across our economy, but without major systemic shifts, these changes will be incremental and incremental. We’re not making any sweeping structural changes right now. But sweeping technological changes can be deceiving — that’s why we have so much data in the first place.

### **The “Great Acceleration” ended in the 1970s, but didn’t last long. What happens in the next decade, especially in light of the [rising cost of living](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [growing cynicism](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the economic system?**

In the late 19th century, there were few if any serious predictions for what the economy would be like in the next century. But what we have now is the product of a half-century of observation — the sprawling constellations of electronic data, the speed of technological development, the endless stream of analog information, the economic complexity of production and consumption, the human and financial complexity, and so on. Every decade or so, something new comes along that makes those predictions wrong.

For example, the Apollo program was a huge disappointment. It seemed to promise technological breakthrough after technological breakthrough, but the costs outweighed the benefits for everyone involved. Obviously, once you have something new, you don’t want to try to predict what it will mean for a specific problem. You want to build tools to help you solve the problems you’re facing today.

About 60 years ago, the United States installed a communications satellite in every state but one. It was called the United States Naval Observatory, and it was the only way that anyone could communicate with the president. Since then, the number of people who can communicate has grown drastically. NASA employs hundreds of people to coordinate, support, and direct the project, and it’s where most of us get our start in space science.

If we look back to the 1970s, the military projects that would make satellites—long considered impossible—are still unmatched in scale and complexity. We have the experience and knowledge to analyze and understand how to build the satellites that will allow satellites to be launched into orbit, and to communicate with Earth. But there are some challenges that remain.

One of the biggest challenges to building accurate and usable space-based tracking satellites is the latency that they all require. Latency is the only real cost of moving hundreds of people to orbit, so the more satellites you have in orbit, and the more data you can collect, the more it’s going to cost you.

But that’s a cost that most people don’t consider—and it’s a problem that affects both satellites and people.

### **It’s affecting satellites, but **​ it’s also affecting the operators.**

Satellites are not mobile, and so as they travel across the sky, they create thrust which adds to the total cost of operation and delays the deployment of the satellites. This means that when a satellite is in space, it’s less of a data acquisition mission and more of a science and exploration mission. But NASA has identified this as a problem that will increasingly become a challenge, as the cost of acquiring satellite parts and data to put into space becomes more costly.

### **What happens when the data from a satellite gets corrupted?**

If a satellite is in space for more than a year, what happens then?

### **Probably pretty high in the atmosphere, and the clouds collect that water and create ice—nitrogen, of course. That ice clings to the surface, and as it’s covered by a layer of ice, it grows back and creates more cloud. The water becomes trapped and creates a nitrate drip that sucks the oxygen from the air and creates ozone, which we then release into the air.

### **What happens then?**

The satellites get any messages from Earth, and from Earth you can either destroy them or capture
