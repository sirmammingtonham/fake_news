If you’re a company like Uber or Lyft, it might be tempting to just drop MEW and MALTZ and start churning out smaller, niggle-at-a-ride applications like Speak Now or iMessage. Drop MEW and MALTZ, and you’re probably getting someone else to fill that need.

While [people have been using VPNs for years](&lt;|url|&gt;), Apple has seemed to prioritize these kinds of services over all others. Consider iMessage, for instance: You might use iMessage to text someone that you’ve just met, or to chat with a friend about something that went well, but it appears you’ve agreed to two drinks shortly after. Clearly, you’ve been told, and it appears to be coming from your partner.

iMessage is the default, even though virtually everyone uses iMessage in different ways. Some people messages through iMessage, others do not. It depends on the app you use, but according to Ryan Milner, an independent researcher into the iMessage ecosystem, more than half of all U.S. adults still using iMessage, or almost all of them, are using it to call someone else.

And why not? iMessage is available right now on iPhones and iPads, and it’s considered one of the most secure apps on the platform.

But security is a matter of visibility. If you’re lucky enough to be in an Apple Store, you can pick up iMessage for $7.99 a month — and for good reason. It’s a far cry from Facebook’s $15 per month or the $19.99 monthly subscription offers from Facebook and Google.

iMessage is also much more accessible than Facebook or Google. The web version of iMessage is imposed on third-party apps like iMessage, Facebook, and Messenger. The Android version, meanwhile, is available through Google Play and some third-party apps. Apple has even offered iMessage on its own App Store.

Apple has done this to attract developers that might use its competing services, like email, News+, and Apple Maps. iMessage can’t directly force companies to use its push notifications or location services, but it does have the power to influence how those apps behave. For instance, it’s used to [block iMessage apps](&lt;|url|&gt;), which prevents them from accessing your Mac’s files.

Twitter has also leveraged its push notifications from the App Store. In exchange, Twitter gets access to data about how visitors use the service, and it can use that data to [improve its other offerings](&lt;|url|&gt;), like segregated chats or push notifications.

At this stage, Apple’s push notifications are less intrusive than what third-party apps can do. But it continues to insist that users must fork over their data to third-party apps.

And, of course, it’s still free.

### **Granted, there are some concerns around the app market for developers: Is it too late to the party?**

Well, it depends on which end of the spectrum you’re talking about. If you’re referring to the App Store, then no. In a world where you don’t know what the next update will be, or if it’ll be at all, then no. But if you believe apps are a vital part of your user experience, then [Apple is doing everything it can to head off potential backlash](&lt;|url|&gt;).

While it may keep selling hardware until it’s too late, Apple is clearly doing everything it can to ensure that customers don’t have to. The company has invested in voice control and a physical Siri button, both of which could make it more difficult for users to switch to Android. It’s also integrating Siri and Google Assistant into the Software App Catalog, which could make it more difficult for users to identify which apps they’re missing out on.

Obviously, there are some limitations to how Siri can be used in the United States. It can only be used to access your Siri and Google Assistant on your computer, and it can only be used within the confines of your iPhone. It therefore feels less United States-centric than, say, Google Assistant or Google Maps.

However, if the plan is to eventually bring Google’s Shopping, or even Amazon’s Prime Now functionality, to iOS users, this could change the use of those services in an truly global marketplace. By integrating them into the App Store, Apple will be able to offer a more comprehensive solution for consumers, with product-specific features
