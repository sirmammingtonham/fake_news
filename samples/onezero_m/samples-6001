 Say, you’re not surprised if someone asks you, ‘Hey, man, do you smoke?’” But I never got the answer. What was the connection?

“How do you feel about watching Lena Dunham on HBO?” the guy wrote. “*Silicon Valley*” is, in fact, a show about people hacking their phones, one where the at-risk geek patriarchy somehow manifests as a show about women and girls and women who are trying to figure out how to join the women’s rights club.

A quick survey of the top 10 most popular board games revealed that *Quell* came in at number one, followed by *Alone*, *David* (number two), *Internet of the Third Person*, *Planescape: Torment*, *Dungeons & Dragon*, *Red Orchestra 2*, *World of Warcraft*, *Watch Dogs*, *Kirby Adventure*, *Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Blue, and *Donkey Kong 64*. The most popular board games of all time, according to Comical? *Master of Sword *Samurai Warriors: The Precure, *Pinball Construction *and* *Pinball Arcade*. The most popular board games ever, according to Comical? *World of Warcraft*, *Kirby Starfighter*, *Donkey Kong 64*, *Doom, *and* *Elite.

Comical is hardly the first website to run across these names. Early Comix* *and *Comic* (both founded by the same person), both sprang from the 1990s web boom. They’re still relevant, even though, as Comical points out, their archives have historically been dominated by spam and bots. Meanwhile, more mainstream outlets, like *The Escapist*, *The Mary Sue*, *Ms. Saturday* *and* *The Mary Sue*, have traditionally published more “serious” games.

But this brave new wave of board games journalism isn’t just about putting up a silly comic strip. These smaller publications have policies that every publication should follow: No nudity, games that last less than two hours, rankings of how long they’ve published, and reviews of the games themselves. They also have policies against gambling, search engine porn, live streamables, selfies, and general nonsense.
> # This brave new wave of board games journalism isn’t just about putting up a silly comic strip. These smaller publications have policies that every publication should follow: No nudity, games that last less than two hours, rankings of how long they’ve published, and reviews of the games themselves.

Because these publications have policies against nudity, policies against violent games, policies against dating, sex, and relationships, the overwhelming majority of their articles about games are utilitarian: They provide brief, generic information about the game, or provide insight into a game that other people have played.

It’s why when *Vice*’s Matt Miller tells the story of how the video game *Fortnite *s Helix Nebula let players dress up as superheroes, rather than the actual game itself, it fits right in. The comic tells the story of someone “dressing up” as an actual superhero, and it’s built around a compelling premise — *Fortnite *s overwhelming popularity makes it a perfect jumping-in comic book. Most of the game’s official partners — Apple, Ubisoft, Warner Bros. — have also put significant time and effort into ensuring their games are available for people to play. If you stream or sell through Comixology, it’s Comixology — not *Fortnite*.

When you consider that people can watch dozens of hours of YouTube videos per day, it’s clear that there are profound informational and commercial reasons behind why people buy these titles. These companies know that people want to see their games — and even if they don’t officially fit into one of these boxes, people will still buy it. It all comes down to that one thing: exposure.

*Fortnite *s exposure comes from its massive community of fans, whom the game immediately and intentionally connects to, and it’s through these followers that the *Fortnite* franchise is most valuable. Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and *Twitch.TV* all rely on advertising to drive ad impressions, and all three have experienced massive consumer backlash thanks to their placement in the “Ads not in this space” category. In the past, YouTube has allowed for ad-free viewings of *Fortnite*, but recently, Facebook has removed this feature. In a statement, Facebook said, “We recognize that ads are a key component in helping people find new channels to play with and we’re looking to improve our ads-based review system.”
