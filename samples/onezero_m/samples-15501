The Apple Medical Project is not just another company’s vision of providing an alternative to traditional high-tech care. Apple CEO Tim Cook has pledged that Apple will replace the traditional doctor’s visit. He’s also offered $999,000 to cancer patients.

“This year, we ran a medical team that included two cardiologists, one on-board surgeon, and one quality assurance person,” [wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a letter obtained by *OneZero*. “The journey was an emotional one, but the end result was worth it.”

Apple’s innovation chief, Jose Luis, is already working toward replacing the traditional “patient encounter” medical model with something more akin to collaboration and empathy. He wants to sequence a person’s DNA, attend cancer screenings, and monitor their diabetes with their wearable bandages. He wants to build trust in people through mobile health technologies. He wants to know what makes them healthy and then deliver predictable and confidential care.

In a world where Apple fails to come up with a new version of itself — maybe because it’s too expensive — its innovation chief, Kun-Jie Lee, will be in charge of iPhone cancer. He’s also part of a growing community of tech executives, politicians, and regulators who are open to digitally fixing the problems of health care.

“It’s clear that there is a historic disconnect between the professionals and consumers on this issue,” says Lee. “Companies need to be thinking more broadly about who they are and what they do to build a business case for why people should pay a little more or feel good.<|endoftext|>

# Snapchat’s Gender-Swap and Baby Filters Doubled Downloads of the App

## But can the company build on that momentum?

Last month, Snapchat achieved the kind of virality most companies can only dream about.

On May 8, Snapchat released a photo filter (a “Lens” in Snapchat parlance) that, by rounding a users’ face and smoothing away their wrinkles, transforms them into a toddler. Over the next two days, Snapchat also debuted a pair of gender-swap lenses, which either gave users a square jaw and stubble to look more stereotypically masculine, or a dolled-up, soft glow to look more feminine.

The lenses unleashed a torrent of content, mostly people showing the world what they’d look like if they flipped genders. Men “joked” about being attracted to the female versions of their bros, while women trolled their boyfriends with their rugged good looks. Many engaged in catfishing “[pranks](&lt;|url|&gt;)” (some of which [backfired spectacularly](&lt;|url|&gt;)) and others professed to [wanting to literally go screw themselves](&lt;|url|&gt;).


The internet usually churns through viral ephemera in a matter of days, if not hours, but the gender-swap filters have had surprising staying power. The filters have ignited discussions about [the mutable nature of gender and attraction](&lt;|url|&gt;), and the [arguably transphobic](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [sexist](&lt;|url|&gt;) manner in which some people have used them.

The filters also seemed to drive a sharp increase in the daily downloads of the Snapchat app across iOS and Android. Snapchat was downloaded across the platforms an estimated 41.7 million times worldwide in May, more than twice the number of downloads from the previous month (16.8 million) and in May of last year (17.6 million), according to third quarter estimates from Sensor Tower, a mobile app market research firm.

Prior to the baby and gender-swap filters, Snapchat was being downloaded approximately 600,000 times per day worldwide, according to estimated data provided by Sensor Tower. By May, the app had reached more than 1 million downloads, bringing the platform to a staggering $5.9 million in revenue, according to third quarter reports.

As such, the company faced the prospect of a slowdown in downloads, which could hobble what little revenue the app has. While it has enjoyed growth lately, Snapchat’s performance this quarter matched those of earlier periods,
