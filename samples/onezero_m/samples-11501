# Instagram’s Latest Anti-Bullying Moves Still Fall Short

## The image-sharing website announced new tools and policies designed to curb harassment, but users still aren’t safe

Earlier this week, Instagram finally announced plans to launch a new anti-bullying feature. In a recent[ blog post](&lt;|url|&gt;), and as reported by the[ BBC](&lt;|url|&gt;), new Instagram head Adam Mosseri said, “Bullying is a root cause of many psychological disorders, so we want to build a new strand in the internet that will benefit both kids and adults.”

Mosseri’s words made me think of Instagram’s existing mentoring program, which seeks to equip young people with tools to cope with rough patches in life. A large portion of Instagram’s 2.7 million members are probably found among its 2.7 million followers on Flickr, a popular image-sharing service.

Instagram faces a similar problem on its new parental controls feature. Its parents can opt-in to pre-screen content for their account, which appears to be helpful, but parental controls are a step too far.

Most people expect photo storage on their smartphones to encourage social interaction and instill a sense of permanence. But if Instagram is serious about helping curb bullying, background information could mean instant deletions of offending images, blurments, and other flaws.

This feature sounds fantastic, but it’s not new — nor is it new to users. Background checks have been a standard part of the social media landscape for years, and they’ve been an increasing burden for everyone from grandparents to teenagers.

As technology has advanced, we have become accustomed to looking at the world through filtered bubbles of information. But once those perspectives are skewed or controlled by factors outside our control — be it climate change or the spread of misinformation, say — we can’t expect those bubbles to bend or change.

The only way to fix a problem like this is to actively find and punish the people who create and maintain the biased information. The only way to ensure the integrity of the channel and its ability to spread harmful and inaccurate information would be to have a healthy dose of humility, humility, and openness about the facts, as users would inevitably fix things.

Right now, there is a concerted push to make Instagram more media-savvy and approach Facebook in a businesslike manner. The key to success would be to teach the former how to behave like the latter, to avoid the “cost-benefit” spiral of becoming rich and creating unnecessary suffering.

As I wrote last week about my own struggles managing my messy, awkward teenage life, I recognize the inherent value of being exposed to others as human beings, no matter how different they might feel or how much they might need to learn to behave in a socially acceptable manner. But we often fail to emphasize how important it is to learn to deal with our own emotions as adults, especially when it comes to the negative impacts of misinformation.

As adults, we want to protect our relationships with friends and family members, yet many of us don’t have the luxury of being carefully nurtured insecurities to match our emotional equilibrium. Insecurities can spiral out of control pretty quickly, and even if we manage to stay secure in our emotions, they can quickly turn toxic. This is especially true if a significant portion of the population is highly educated and engaged in online discussion.
> # What can one say? Suffering, even if it’s a justifiable emotion, can quickly turn deadly.

As I said last week, I don’t want to live in a world where government regulation would inevitably strip citizens of their Second Amendment rights. I actually prefer a world where citizens are empowered to defend themselves in a way that protects their emotional well-being, and where each situation is assessed on a case-by-case basis. As I pointed out last week, I don’t want to live in a world where someone could go to jail for telling me what to think was a waste of time. I want a world where we have the scientific evidence to back up my claim.

We don’t have a war on misinformation, and we don’t need another one.
