 “If we lose 50,000 drivers, it will mean a $50 million to $60 million difference in lost earnings for the company per mile driven.”

Uber, Lyft, and Waze are all struggling financially right now. According to a *Fast Company* [report](&lt;|url|&gt;) from earlier this year, Uber laid off 450 workers in February. The loss is substantial, particularly in the automotive sector, which Uber previously stated it would enter if it laid off 500 workers. Recent job openings have shown that many of the job losses are due to the bottlenose pool problem, which allows passengers to drown in a water-craft or sink a fish in a bath of brackish water.

According to [a job posting on TransUnion](&lt;|url|&gt;), laid off Uber drivers can expect to [win out](&lt;|url|&gt;) on average of 15 percent more pay and benefits in the event of a loss of 50 percent of lost earnings in the first year, and 36 percent more in the following year. The posting also states that job losses can be sustained not only against workers lost in the A.I. division, but also against the loss of any union.

Laid off Uber employees receive little, if any, support in the form of job guides and any communication from the company. They also don’t receive any voice assistance when contacting their local workforce representatives.

“The company has made it its goal to hire well, but with so many people affected, it is apparent that the company lacks a strategic plan,” an employee at the firm wrote to a recruiter, according to a document obtained by a worker by the firm and shared with BuzzFeed News.

The letter, which the worker named Miguel Altozada requested to remain anonymous, outlined chronic labor conditions inside the facility and the treatment of African Americans employed by Uber. Allegations of violence and wage theft were common, as were claims of horrible working conditions. Workers noted that they were pressured to join or follow only certain drivers, and that they didn’t have the freedom to talk to customers or organize. They also felt underpaid, especially since they had just a few dollars in the cash for a meal. Deliveries inside the facility often left them literally running out of cash. By the time they got to the office, they were nearly in debt. By the time they left, it was too late. One worker, Amina, described how she was forced to take a two-day delivery just to cover basic living expenses. Addicted to fast food, she worked as a sex worker to try to support herself and her three children.

Altozada, 36, started working at the restaurant because he was “a part of the community,” according to a 2016 profile in the *Londoner*. “I started working at the Uber [company] two years after I graduated college. I had fun, but there was a lot of drama there,” she says. “You feel so sorry for the drivers, but there’s no way to protest.”

While drivers can expect to make minimum wage and Lyft-like wages, Uber drivers are not. (The minimum wage for tipped workers is $10.46 per hour, according to the [service](&lt;|url|&gt;)). To survive, drivers need to deliver newspapers, CDs, paperwork, and anything else that’s being prepared for delivery. They also need to keep themselves busy. “The library card sucks,” one driver told me. “You can’t really get anything done until you’re actually at the library. Then you just gotta write 'em out loud and then they’re done.”

While library cards are easy to come by for drivers on short notice, Uber drivers are in a constant struggle to be useful. “There are times when I get a few bucks on the phone, and I make a few bucks back,” says Sean Booth, a 45-year-old Uber driver who currently works as a part-time cashier. “But a lot of times, I don’t even get reimbursed for the cost of the cards every single time.”

Bracketing is easy for Uber drivers, since most get paid for doing so. Last month, however, Booth was approached by [R&B vocalist Kaytran](&lt;|url|&gt;) who asked if he could reserve his car for a longer shift. “I see a lot of white dudes in my area that do this all day,” he says. “I’d say those are definitely more likely to get left out.”

The problem is compounded when drivers aren’t paid for their shifts as much as they would
