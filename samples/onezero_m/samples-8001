offs and, especially in situations where there’s a lot of noise, to try and figure out the next best thing to try and avoid that.
> # This app, I think, really drilled into me: This is not the best app or the easiest app to use.

As a parent, I know the feeling — when your kids are playing video games and you expect them to be able to keep a straight face and not jump around and stuff — but as a parent, we look at our devices and ask, “What exactly are these apps doing?” What’s going on with the kids? Are they making eye contact with other people? Are they scrolling through Instagram? Are they Snapchatming? So it’s like, “Well, this app, I think, really drilled into me: This is not the best app or the easiest app to use.”

I looked at my own apps and saw a lot of red when I was like, “Oh my god,” I was like, “And it’s cyberbullying and harassment and abuse. And I was like, “Yes, please don’t do that.”

I’m like, “You know, I’m just kidding.” I’m just joking.

This is the first year I’ve seen our app, and I’m like, “You know, I only use this once. And it’s like, really slow.” And I was like, “Yeah, but it’s always been super-slow.”

I’ve just had the slowest year of my life. I’m working, studying, taking my exam, and then I get a text from my boyfriend — he’s away on a work trip — and he’s like, “Have some wine. Do you want to watch Netflix?” And I’m like, “Sure, why?” And he’s like, “Why, you know, Netflix.” I’m just laughing, and he’s like, “Oh, you like watching Netflix.” — and I’m like, “Oh, he’s watching *Westworld* because he’s afraid of robots.” I’m just laughing, and he’s like, “Oh, so, you watch *Game of Thrones* because you have too much fun on your hands.” I’m just chatting it up and he’s like, “Oh, you watch *Game of Thrones* because you have to.” I’m just laughing, and he’s like, “Oh, so, you watch *Game of Thrones* because you have to.” I’m just laughing, and he’s like, “Oh, so, you watch *Game of Thrones* because you have to keep up with all the tweets and stuff.” I’m just joking. But he’s like, “That’s not funny. That’s not funny.” I’m just joking.
> # “What’s the app?” I’m watching *Lord of the Rings* in full, and it’s the epic fantasy story that’s been on my home screen since I was 10, and I still feel like I'm reading epic fantasy novels and stuff, so I can’t help but think that maybe this is where I go — maybe this is where my door is.

## **Netflix in particular**

I think Netflix is this megahit that’s on-brand, and I think because of the platform it’s on, it’s the story that they tell. I think it’s something that’s intrinsic to watching it is binge-watching. I used to watch the occasional *Game of Thrones* episode, and that’s about it. Looking at it now, there’s a whole season that’s been on my radar, and I sit there and watch that entire season, and I get distracted by the tweets and all the things that go on behind the scenes. I feel like I’m losing my mind, and I think that’s what people are looking at: all the tweets and the comments and the opinions and the analysis. I think that’s what people are looking at, and I worry that we’re losing that disconnect. That’s what this app is trying to bring back, and I worry that we’re missing some of the good stuff.

### **I think it is a success, thank
