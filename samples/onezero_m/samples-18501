�s so different from how the phone industry views things. Back then, you had to use a “blue bubble” to indicate that you were close to bursting. Apple was able to use this new technology to change the way people think about bubbles in general. When bubbles are small and thin, it’s hard to see in front of our eyes.

Today, we ask our smartphones to “talk to us.” While the Nokia 7110 got by with a measly 4G signal, the Google Fios A12 will work with 4G at 70 Mbps. Even the Google W1 Ultra HD has no problem displaying 4K resolution. Remember, all of these devices work with 4G only.

When the communication is a mere 5 Mbps, the idea of 5 Gbps might seem unimaginable. Today, we routinely use 800 Mbps Ethernet cables. If you multiply this bandwidth by four, the resulting 10 Gbps is still not quite enough. Our smartphones are getting even more congested. Consider the top 100 apps in the world: Twenty four think they can fit more than 600 MB of data into an hour-long cable, while eight others reach 100 Mbps. Consider another eight apps that use 1.5 GHz of ram, and how many calories they burn in an hour of ramming.

Outside the United States, you can expect to see prices start at around $40 per month for content moderation and entertainment. Networks like stadia and xiaomi are offering much more for consumers to pay for end users — some to support their families, while others to streamers. What used to be an iPhone exclusive is now an Android app, a Google Play Store, and a number of other devices. In all, the ecosystem has mushroomed to include everything from laptops to smart TVs to refrigerators. Naturally, there’s a struggle over how everything fits into this scheme.

But consider this: In just the past decade, Google has offered every player in the world a single 11.7. A decade ago, the closest the company came to consumer pricing was an [innovative video streaming service](&lt;|url|&gt;) called YouTube.com. You may remember YouTube from its heyday as the place you could watch Dennis Crowley on *Medium* and still be able to download *The Magicians* as a free update to your phone. Well, it’s worked exactly fine for consumers who want to stream or download something, but it’s just not very economical.

Most mobile games today use the in-app gaming platform that came with Android, which means they don’t require as much data or processing power to run. One of the problems is that they’re expensive to upgrade. In 2017, Google fixed this with [a device upgrade](&lt;|url|&gt;) that dropped the price of a $60 phone to $400. However, the problem remains that it’s difficult to find game software that isn’t open-source. Companies like Google are putting their money where their mouth is when it comes to game streaming.

Without a standard way to pay for access to a library of games, it’s difficult to force companies like Microsoft, Ubisoft, or Take-Two to move to any of the platforms that offer the most to the most number of people on the most available platforms. It’s great for streaming to have options, but it’s still hard for most people to make the leap to streaming without a more complicated set of connections.

Regardless, it’s great to see companies like Google, Ubisoft, and Take-Two looking to the future of game streaming. It’s the best way to encourage the development of new ideas, especially around social VR. Augmented reality — such as [tying](&lt;|url|&gt;) virtual objects with real world elements, [motion sickness](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [visual fidelity](&lt;|url|&gt;) — could all be used to better assess how well people are able to handle the complexities of living in a multi-cultural, multi-awesome world. Improved data and better algorithms will tell a better story. Better to speak with one voice, hear one tune, and dance with one of your friends in the real world.<|endoftext|>
