*: “It’s an awful lot of work and talent to be able to do anything at all, especially as a woman.”

While there isn’t a lot of literature out there on preferential treatment of women, we do see some progress recently. In 2017, *Nature *exposed researchers at the Labor Experimental Facility in Chicago to their own unique blood testing technique, a technology called whole-body chemistries. With the exception of a few small studies, they never revealed their true identities. But by studying blood flow in the context of a heart rhythm, the scientists were able to discover that people have exactly the same blood-flow pattern across their entire bodies.

“The real difference is the measurement, and the community has good techniques for assessing the variability in blood flow rates between individuals,” Conroy says. “The best way to lead is to do large, representative studies that capture a wide variety of people over a long period of time.”

Conroy’s’ team has been in touch with several health organizations, national training organizations, and patient advocacy organizations to learn more about how women’s health is being represented in digital health care. Although the companies selling digital health care themselves don’t sell direct to consumers, they do negotiate deals with retailers like Amazon.

“Consumers are willing to play God — it’s a pretty good business model,” Conroy says.

But for Jill Ross, a black woman in her mid-40s who needs access to prescription antibiotics because she has a chronic infection, pregnant women, or ill patients, digital health care is not well served by modern technology. Complicating this further, digital health care operates across multiple dimensions: access, affordability, quality, and timeliness.

“I come from an all-women’s health team,” says Ross, who has affiliations with [multiple national organizations](&lt;|url|&gt;), including the American College of Cardiology and the New York Heart Institute. “Most of the employees who work at tech companies are women, and [one in five](&lt;|url|&gt;) is a woman.”

While it’s not clear how widespread this gap is, it’s not hard to imagine how it might be affected by the next presidential administration. Abernathy says that the topic is coming up in conversation with colleagues, but hasn’t came up yet in health care professional circles.

“It has come up in conversations within the health care industry,” she says. “There have been discussions within the industry itself, and there have been a lot of articles [about the topic](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

But this question shouldn’t be coming up for a presidential administration, says Alessandro, who notes that the work to improve access to health care has been taken up by groups like the [National Institutes of Health](&lt;|url|&gt;) and the World Health Organization.

The NIH team focuses on using NIH-funded research to improve health care, but its [NIH-funded ](&lt;|url|&gt;)Evolv X-ray machine can detect whether a patient is likely to require more medical attention. The machine was developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and partners at the University of Washington and the University of Tokyo.

The team hopes that in the future, if information from these machines becomes necessary for more complex medical procedures, they may be used to predict which patients will be most responsive to their findings and to suggest specific medication regimens. For example, if a heart rhythm helps predict whether a person will be a victim of a heart attack, the people who have a high risk of developing cardiovascular problems may need more careful monitoring.

Researchers are also pursuing more specific applications of the future health care analytics in the context of modern medicine. For example, it may be possible to identify which patients in a hospital really need urgent surgical interventions — that is, critical care patients. These are not, as yet, standard medical procedures that take place at the hospital emergency department or in intensive care units. But the machines may well be able to identify which patients are at greatest risk of worsening or getting ill from complications of disease, or even from the use of diagnostic tests.

“This is a wonderful example of combining data from patient portals, such as medical records, in-person interviews, and online clinical data collection,” says Alessandro. “All of this technology can be beneficial in identifying patients at greatest risk, and guiding decision-making about care.”
