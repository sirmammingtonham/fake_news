 to get [to] that [point](&lt;|url|&gt;), it’s the responsibility of companies like [Google](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Amazon](&lt;|url|&gt;) to take responsibility for their products, policies, and services. The problem is that while companies like Amazon and Google are beginning to produce goods that are more environmentally friendly, cleaning supplies firms like Unilever and Clorox are at the front line.

Unilever’s Clean It’s campaign focuses on providing individuals and families with easy on-demand access to reusable shopping bags for each day of the grocery store. The grocery industry is attempting to compete in the increasingly discerning consumer world with services like AmazonFresh and DoorDash, but the onus is on these companies to ensure their products are environmentally friendly.

Clean It’s grocery stores have been [largely left alone](&lt;|url|&gt;), at least since 2000. According to the [World Wildlife Fund](&lt;|url|&gt;) (WWF) [project](&lt;|url|&gt;), just 1% of Amazon’s global sales are now done in containers, down from 2% in 2010. The reason for the decline is pretty basic: consumers are afraid of losing things that would hurt their feelings (worthlessness), posing a danger to infants, and making thieves of themselves. For most people, it’s expensive to clean reusable grocery bags, which reflects their anxiety about losing what they bought.

Amazon started offering its own brand of diapers on its Fresh Direct website in 2014, with the promise that these diapers would not only recycle, but would also go back to the source. On the eve of the debut of its new diapers, Amazon had shrewdly marketed them as if they were some kind of extended family heirloom, the kind of cloth diapers that have been popular for generations. But parents looking for the same affordability and versatility as their traditional formula are often met with disappointment.

Some companies are trying to counter this disappointment by introducing innovative features designed to encourage children to chew through objects like leaves, dirt, and small bugs. In 2016, [Kiki from Urban Outfitters](&lt;|url|&gt;) introduced the Baby Alight, a folding stool that turns its poop brown to match its diaper. And in 2018, [FitNish](&lt;|url|&gt;) — a brand of flexible sunscreen sticks marketed to parents who don’t want to take their children to the beach — introduced the ability to automatically clean diapers, saddling up with life preservers.

Yet while companies like Kiki are trying to introduce the concept of naturally occurring, in-between diapers, others are more modest and are taking a more deliberate approach. Appliances are still sold without detergent, but in an era when disposable products are increasingly being replaced, these diapers are something more valuable — and dangerous.

Drones may have gotten bigger and cheaper over the past few years, but in the real world, diapers are still something disposable. And some people find that taking their children to the beach is no longer as “easy” as taking them to the doctor or having them at the emergency room.

“Dry diapers make resting and changing diapers much easier,” says Lulu Carden, a Brooklyn-based mother of four. “I feel so bad for the little ones that have to be brought in by the beach when their dads dry them. I wish it were otherwise,” she says. “I would love to have something that’s a little more complicated than just a regular pair of underwear.”

Carden is not alone in her feelings about underwear. Many women share their frustrations about the status of women in tech, politics, and entertainment. And while underwear is a status symbol, the stodgy underpinnings of many of these relationships are under attack.

Take the [stupid subreddit r/creepshots](&lt;|url|&gt;), which is basically a place for creeps to bitch about the pretty faces and sexual content of adult content littered across the internet. Complaining that a relatively unknown adult film heavily promoted scat footage of child actors makes perfect sense, because online creeps are out there.
