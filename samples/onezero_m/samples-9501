 out, the question of their ability to produce a quality product is moot. They have the technology, the design, the financing, the management skills to get things done right. It’s time to retire the hyper-optimistic rhetoric and stick to the science,” he says.

Of course, things don’t always go according to plan and it’s no big surprise that Theranos ended up losing the case. There are inherent difficulties in running a company like Healthvana and balancing the many simultaneous demands of marketing, PR, and actual scientific research. But the party line is that the company would have marketed its product as soon as the Massachusetts Supreme Court decision (in this case, it was the Massachusetts attorney general that initiated the investigation) as well as in the context of the campaign contributions the company received.
> # It’s inevitable that things will go south from time to time. But the tide seems to be slowly rising for the health care company.

Despite the resources at their disposal, Theranos has so far resisted calls to change how it uses its technology. The company is being funded by the Harris Foundation, a major philanthropic organization in California, and has committed to using the technology to address the flaws in its product. It’s impossible to say whether that will be a core tenet of the company’s future strategy — to use science to inform product improvement or use fraud and deception to further government goals?

Change is coming, though. Accenture, the technology company founded by the future Tesla CEO, predicts that in the next few years “health care will become a dying breed.” Like so many of the other sectors of tech, the cost of health care will skyrocket as a share of GDP. In the United States, the rate of health care inflation has [performed relatively well](&lt;|url|&gt;) over the last few decades. Healthcare providers, however, will continue to fall behind in quality — and most of the world is closer to universal coverage than we are — due to the unaffordability of our medical records.

Accenture, which likens itself to the medical tourism industry, isn’t the only company building digital health care empires. [Google is connected to health care providers (Heartbeat, Smile, Jawbone) as well as the care coordination systems needed to accept and communicate using electronic health records, and it has a presence in many new spaces, from Big Apple to the remote villages of Papua New Guinea](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Even as a health care provider, the experience can feel stale and out of step with the times. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist at Onassis Medical Center, has had his practices interrupted or forced to change locations due to anti-tuberculosis drugs and other new strictures. As a result, many surgeons in New England are abandoning the laptop and mobile devices that they have for decades.

“It’s inconvenient,” says Gorski. “I think there’s a real danger that this is going to put people in a position where they’re not necessarily going to be able to use the internet or mobile devices the same way.”

In the future, as health care providers, we will depend on office workers, telemedicine platforms, and other digital tools to communicate and accept patient information. It won’t be convenient but necessary. And it will become essential as our health care industry and the health care market merge.

“It’s vital that this time we’re secure,” Patten says, “because otherwise ‘something terrible could happen.’ And it will.”<|endoftext|>

# The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet

In his sci-fi trilogy *The Three Body Problem*, author Liu Cixin presents the dark forest theory of the universe.

The dark forest theory of the universe holds that anything that moves andna takes the place of the things that are left,’s there to capture the predator’s attention and prevent them from escaping. This is the background to the universe being what it is now — an ever-lingering black box that only the protagonist can unlock.

The Three Body Problem is concerned with how an all-seeing, all-knowing machine could be compromised by the constant threat of surprise attacks. So, how could an all-knowing machine be breached? By some mysterious force that no one can explain.

Liu invites the reader to consider the possibility that there might be ways to connect everything from the user’s
