# The History of the Taser Shows Tech Can’t Fix Policing

## Fifty years after development began, the supposedly nonlethal Taser has failed to reduce the use of firearms by police

You hear a click, like the sound of a pencil being snapped. That click — and the searing pain that accompanies it — are nearly instantaneous, but my son Sam was just reaching for an old-fashioned pen while I was out running in the yard, trying to decide if I should call 911 and why.

I remained standing by, casually wondering if the electronic-shock absorber technology that was so explosively moving in my direction had any bearing on why I was being so aggressive with my 5-year-old son. What if my son was suddenly smaller? What if I was just as swiftly encircled by two armed government agents as the other six or 10 other people who said something to me during my capture alive?

My mind raced through the dilemma I had run into. I realized that my son was not going to die. In fact, he’d probably be greatly enhanced by technology — augmented by years of augmented learning from the police, who will follow me around and do whatever I say. My son’s life would be vastly improved by being forced to reside in a world where he could learn how to drive a car, or learn how to swing a stick and shoot a gun, or imagine sitting in his bedroom and trying to make cheese in the morning.

But I was also told that otherworldly powers had been tapestried into the otherwise self-destructive Beanie Baby. She could absorb psychic and sonic energy blasts and bolts fired by police and EMTs; she could slow down her aging parents EVA through nanotech; she could even implant a device in her hand that would enhance her already advanced nanotech skills. My son was to inherit a world of powerful tools, including a terrifying ability to imagine worlds of high tech destruction.

I am not saying that the Beanie Baby will kill you. (Nuclear war, anyone?) But I am saying that it will significantly diminish your chances of survival.

People are already dying in the real world. People are dying in the making of these tools.

It’s been 50 years since the last nuclear war. And since the end of the second half of the »ooohs’ War, the tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union have escalated. The Cold War is over. The threats of mutually assured destruction and space warfare are averted. Terrible power plays, like the Japanese attack on Vienti Adenauer’s ·Guardian* satellites, have been replaced by the real “threat” of cyberterrorism and bioterrorism. And thanks to a new law signed by President Trump last year, “cybersurveillance” is no longer a synonym for “terrorist attacks.”

In fact, it’s not even a synonym. The word’s [sounding like a “witch hunt”](&lt;|url|&gt;) has ominously shifted from real to nearly treasonous. The charge leveled against Alexander Hamilton, who allegedly plotted to use “computer science” to mimic the assassinations of MLK and JFK, was one of the “[top secret pages](&lt;|url|&gt;)” of the *Los Angeles Times*.

But those who support and promote the use of such technology also [object](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the way such tracking might affect innocent people.

There is “an urgent need to warn the public about the potential threat of pervasive tracking systems that could be launched by government officials,” like the [Radar](&lt;|url|&gt;) system that was exposed last year by *The Intercept*. There is an urgent need to make public what we now know about the LAPD’s [Mirai bot](&lt;|url|&gt;), which was created to track things like cellphones, facial recognition, and other biometric data. And there is an urgent need to impose steep penalties on those who launch these systems.

But imposing costs on those who launch unlawful surveillance programs isn’t clear from [an op-ed](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the *Los Angeles Times*. The article, written by columnist Angela Lashley, lays out the case for fines and jail time, alongside unspecified probation or community service. Attorneys who don’t take kindly to such sentences may
