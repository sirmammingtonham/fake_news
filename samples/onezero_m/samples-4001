 world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s a framework, but it’s not quite complete. There are still a million little things I don’t know how to.

**Hawkeye:**I guess the biggest obstacle is just figuring out how to tell a story on a television screen. Because everything else is just story.

***Hulk:**Because of the way he’s portrayed in the comics, he kinda looks like he came out of nowhere.

He has this incredible upper body strength and speed that almost seems unnatural. The more realistic super-soldiers look for those things in their models, and the less realistic… people don’t really have those things. These are things that are built into the world of comics, but they’re not really in the real world. I guess my understanding of reality is that fictional depictions of superheroes tend to be pretty accurate, but they don’t really have the things the real world has.

**Captain America:**You mean, [the fictional company that makes the hero Captain America](&lt;|url|&gt;)…?

**Hawkeye:**That’s right. It’s in some comics, but mainly it’s kept out of the headlines because what you don’t want to see are real companies making heroes, or at least heroes getting involved in any kind of real-world business, and not just in terms of protecting the audience from aliens or some shit.

**Captain America:**That seems to be a legacy of the “real” comics, even though some of the earliest comics didn’t really have Captain America on the cover. Like, * Marvel Comics “The Incredible Hulk” *is the most recent *He-Man *title to the Incredible feat, but it’s been 10 years since this storyline has come to a close.

**Hulk:**I guess Marvel should have made him the Incredible Hulk. You know, the guy who could lift the entire planet. That would have made sense as a fitting title for a character who has very literally lifted the entire planet. But no. We’ve seen heroes lifting the moon. We’ve seen the US Avengers on the moon. It’s fitting that these two events be attributed to Hank Pym, because he embodies the key to both of their stories. He was the first human to ever walk on the moon. He also happened to be a genius.

**Captain America:**Yeah. That’s definitely what the script calls for. Also, it’s a good story, but we all know that if anyone ever calls Captain America a genius, we’ll punch them right in the face.

**Hulk:**I guess *End Times* would have a pretty good ending, I think.

**Captain America:**I guess so. It will be interesting to see where *He-Man and the Masters of the Universe* goes from here. It’s interesting because there aren’t that many established heroes left from the Marvel comics. There are a lot of MCU-bound characters, but there aren’t that many characters from the movies who have ever been the focus of a live-action movie. Also, this movie will be the longest movie in the series.

**Hulk:**I guess so. When the movie begins, there will be 52 films in total.
> # These are all stories that are essentially the same story across all three films.

**Captain America:**Yes, and we’re getting right into it.

**Hulk:**It’s clear that these are all story styles that are tied together. I don’t do solo superhero movies, because I don’t think the movies are that interesting. I think the story is interesting when one character is the center of attention, and that is a rare circumstance in superhero movies. When two or more films are doing well, that is pretty strong for me. I don’t know if you realize this, but I’ve actually never been able to watch two movies in one day. I had to be at the theater two hours before the *Avengers: End Times* started.

**Captain America:**That’s not unusual. You have to see both *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Thor: Ragnarok* in order to be a fan of the same film. So it’s a tricky thing for me. When you have a multi-billion dollar film franchise and a live-action *Avengers: Infinity War* sequel, it’s a different story. There’s so much interest in the *Infinity War* and *Venom in the Old Man of the Sea* stories, which are two of the
