For many companies, those early, big upfront efforts are crucial to determining whether their existence is in fact a genuine pursuit. Monetar paints a portrait of YouTube star Tyler [Charo](&lt;|url|&gt;) — whom he refers to as a “[former pro skier](&lt;|url|&gt;)** — as a young man on the rise:
> “I’m always a little skeptical about the altruism of companies when they have products in the market, but when they go global they have to hit the parent company.”

Charo is not alone in his assessment. Many in the ski industry are asking that question, and others have begun developing products to assess whether the incentives and support are aligned with consumer interests.

While not necessarily a marketer priority, sponsoring deals can certainly be beneficial to companies’ ability to educate and entertain their users. A strong start here could help ensure Aurora maintains a future as a vibrant place to stream. But the industry remains largely untapped.

Aurora was an early and successful company, landing big-name guests like Sly Stone, Joey Bada$$, Qui, and DJ Qui. The site allowed its users to queue up and reserve rides, and it even had its own reservation system. So why now?

As Qui told me over the phone, he appreciated being able to show his appreciation by purchasing a ticket to this exclusive event. However, he feels that giving fans something to do while they wait in line has never been the intention of the site. “We wanted to bring VIP experiences to the fans, just like any other party,” he said. “We have no interest in the original vision of the site, the way we want to present our product.”

While some may find the vision of a VR tour de force or a bespoke streaming app irresistible, Valve has shown in the past it is willing to listen to and engage with fans, even when they disagree with the direction the company is taking the platform. Look close, and you may see a face contorted into that of a meme. [Rare but effective](&lt;|url|&gt;) are the tactics the company employs to keep YouTubers honest. I have seen journalists and commentators [play this same game](&lt;|url|&gt;) and I have voted with my eyeballs for [censorship’s sake](&lt;|url|&gt;). I’ve [joined hands with a sad sack](&lt;|url|&gt;) and watched programmers valiantly keep things from sliding down the YouTube rabbit hole. I had [seen similar moves](&lt;|url|&gt;) on YouTube and was troubled by the prospect of a corporate ladder dangling from the faces of lesser known personalities. But I have also dreaded the prospect of my online identity becoming a footnote to this historic moment.

Valve and YouTube are both experiencing subscriber pain — YouTube is in [truancy](&lt;|url|&gt;) trouble and Twitch [comes under fire for abuse of its subscribers](&lt;|url|&gt;). It is legitimate to point out that these companies are primarily owned by a small number of shareholders, and that their CEOs are, like Donald Trump, [extremely vain](&lt;|url|&gt;). But it’s also clear that these companies are operating on fumes. Like cigarette companies, they need to expand and improve products to meet changing tastes. And like Netflix, they need to find creative ways to get the most from their audience.

It’s no accident that Facebook is re-evaluating its relationship with its community. The company’s changes could reflect a recognition that, while it still laments the fact that it can no longer micromanage how feeds are delivered, it no longer has the luxury of shutting down debate or of doing nothing to impede it. It is a testament to how things have changed since the original vision of Whatsapp, but also a reminder of how things have stayed the same since there have been versions of these features.

The features which remain on by default are rudimentary and thus unlikely to spur a paradigm shift, but they could help shape a conversation around what content should be part of social media — or not. The conversation could help shape how we understand our relationship with social media — and the extent to which it affects our lives. If Facebook is successful in its push to get everyone talking, this could help to do more than just boost conversation — which is what we’re here for.

And the company already has a plan B. Earlier this year, it announced that
