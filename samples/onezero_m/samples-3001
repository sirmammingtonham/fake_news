Apple CEO Tim Cook has been very clear that the company will not repeat the success of its cloud services: iCloud and iTunes. Apple chose a different business model. Instead of charging customers to store content, Apple built its biggest feature-rich service around a set of features called Apple Music. Apple built a set of competing streaming music services that compete with the Music app in a very literal way. Apple played with its product positioning to wow consumers — but it didn’t just do that.

This is what makes Apple Music so compelling. You’ve been warned.

Apple Music’s competitor is Spotify, which emerged to replace the [Waze navigation system](&lt;|url|&gt;) on iPhone and [Aksys calls](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the iPad. Unlike Apple and Google, Spotify does not offer in-app shopping or the Apple Watch’s main menu, but it does [close the door to the Apple ecosystem](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [pulled its servers off the Internet](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2015. This is not to say that Spotify’s practices are superior to those of Apple or Google, but because it’s impossible to compare servers, Apple or Spotify, for the tens of billions of users whose phone calls and content is funneled through the Apple ecosystem — and it is a [large subset](&lt;|url|&gt;) of those who are on iOS.

When it comes to the data that’s been collected by Apple and the people who rely on it, the case against the company is weak. The FBI has alleged that Apple systematically abuses its own customer by providing no benefit to them, and abusing its access to customers by doing nothing about it.

The EU has also criticized Apple for its [data practices](&lt;|url|&gt;), arguing that they amount to [a de facto ban on European citizens traveling abroad](&lt;|url|&gt;). The US case will look at whether those practices amount to data discrimination, something the [1970 Supreme Court decision](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the case of Abood v. Omaha Regional Airport Authority has [affirmed](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # I would argue that while building its product is a vital part of the success of the streaming service, it is also a major determinant of whether users will actually benefit from it.

In both services, users are invited to opt into “at will,” meaning they are legally allowed to turn off features that hinder their experience. In Apple Music, this is a simple, albeit troubling, tap on the Settings app to turn off the in-app purchasing. In Spotify, users must always become customers of Apple.

Ultimately, these streaming music services are the [largest single threat to Apple’s long-term success](&lt;|url|&gt;). With [overcrowded Playlists](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [deleting apps](&lt;|url|&gt;), Apple has effectively been able to drive a wedge between its users and those they have actively turned to over the years. Meanwhile, Spotify has [shuttered its desktop app](&lt;|url|&gt;), having lost support for every operating system since 2010. With the service falling off a cliff in 2017, Apple finally began to address its lack of a dominant position with [the iPhone XS and the Apple TV app](&lt;|url|&gt;).

All of which isn’t to say that there aren’t problems for either company. Apple has done a great enough job of building its own music service in recent years — something that will surely continue to attract subscribers who are tired of Spotify and Apple Music subscriptions, while Spotify has [played fast and loose with Apple’s music library](&lt;|url|&gt;) — but without the huge, ongoing investments Apple would need to make to even fully capitalize on the playlists it will launch this summer, many people are going to feel severely limited when it comes to how their Apple Music and iHeartRadio experiences will look down the line. And some, perhaps especially if it’s a one-off experience, don’t know they can opt out.
