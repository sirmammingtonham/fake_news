======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 than for a new baby. I put everything on the table, not just me. I take care of business. You could say I’m super busy. But honestly, I just want my kids to be okay, and I’m trying to do that while having the family I have now.

### **Right. I’m interested in your home screen. It looks like you have a meditation app on.**

I have a meditation app on, but it’s really to just turn it off. I know what I’m doing when I’m in the moment. I turn it off for Twitter, for Facebook, for iMessage, whatever. Anything that’s going to keep me calm.

### **I’m curious about whether or not you turn this on as a schedule.**

If I want to turn it on, I will. I will say, “Thanks for the feedback!” I’m always willing to listen.

### **And I’m curious about whether or not there’s any particular day that you turn it on.**

I will say it’s on all day.

### **I’m curious about whether or not you turn it off for any specific reason — whatever it is, whatever it is that you’re working on— and whether or not it affects your ability to’t think about work at all.**

I guess normally, I don’t have a work in the morning. So, I guess I can go to work and be with my son, or it turns on in my home office, whatever it is. I don’t know, I’m kind of a workaholic. I don’t have a proper office. I use the [Home Assistant] app, or Alexa, whatever it is. Honestly, the whole purpose of the Plex app is to make it so I can work on the Home Run.

### **What is this, Prime Now?**

Prime Now is like WorkBench for people who don’t know they’re supposed to be at work. They have this thing called QuickBooks, which are sort of like Project Stadia but for people who work remotely.

With a group of friends, I will go on a conference call and work on the conference call, or I will meet up with other workers or find a place to meet other workers, and they will give me this break so I can go to the store to buy supplies or do something else.

If I’m doing something else wrong, I will still get this break, because I’m not totally in the flow. Usually, I’ll catch up on stuff. I’ve actually trained myself to break things. I will usually catch up on work when I get home.

But there will be times when I will have: “lightheadedness,” or “fatigue,” or “everything” — whatever it is — I can’t relate to anything, I’m just like, I’m tired. I will take four or five siesta days, weeks. It’s just the nature of how I am. I will get to that edge where I am, like I’m going to sleep and I’m so tired. But I’m also like, I’m going to eat, I’m going to eat, and then I’m going to talk on the phone. If I’m tired, then I’m not going to be as effective.

### **I think about sending emails.**

Mm-hm.

### **Do you feel bad about that?**

Oh, yeah. You’re tapping into something, and then you’d better be careful about what you’re doing because I’ve tapped into something bad.

### **You’ve got an email address, of course.**

I, I, I… email address. *[Laughs]*

### **And you’ve got another screen on your phone. Do you check it every day?**

I mean, it’s me, me, me. I’m a workaholic. I’m literally writing down what I’m going to be doing. I’m not aware of what deadline it is, but I’m making plans. I’m trying to figure out what I’m going to be sending mail for, because I’ve already got an envelope of envelopes for that.

### **What are you writing about?**

I’m a heavy book reader. I want to read everything in
