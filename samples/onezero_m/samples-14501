’s about to find out.

### **Who’s your ideal audience for “*Lord of the Rings*”*

*of course* — I’m a big *Harry Potter* fan. But at the same time, I’m also a pessimist. You have to be a combination of the two.

### **Are you not doing any religious themed work outside of your movies?**

I’m not really a religious person, but my wife and I are very traditionalists.

### **Why do you think it was important for you to do this kind of movie screening at all?**

It has to do with the hope that you will see the movie again for the first time and that your reaction to the first time you see it will be similar to the second time.

### **What if two people are watching, but they’re not sure whether they should bring the curtain down on this friendship before it’s too late?**

If two people are watching, they can bring the curtain down at any time before the movie begins.

### **If two people are watching, but they’re not sure whether they should bring the curtain down on this friendship before it’s too late?**

If two people are watching, they can bring the curtain down at any time before the movie begins.

### **If you bring this up with your partner, what happens?**

They can go, “We know that you love the movie. You love the characters. You love the story.” But if they keep bringing it up, their silence is evidence that they do not love it, and they may not even love it as much as they claim.

### **I love this movie and all the people that love it, but I’m not sure that we should watch it.**

You should go see it. That’s fine. You should just enjoy it. Because otherwise you might not have enough material for Friday.

### **You said you’ve seen it. You listen to music during the movie?**

I have not seen it.

### **Does the movie have a theme?**

No, but it has a good theme.

### **What’s the theme of the movie?**

It’s a bit of a mystery.

### **I’m not telling you!**

To me, the mystery is the good thing.

### **So you think you could watch the movie again and finish it on your iPod?**

I hope not. I’m watching the movie now, so I can’t stop.

### **You must keep your eye on the movie through the entire run of the TV show.**

I would presume that the movie would end on a high note.

### **The movie sounds better on headphones.**

That’s a good point. I like the way Sony is putting together its sound picture album. It’s like a miniaturized, but it’s not so miniaturized that it fills the whole screen.

### **It’s like the movie is haunting you — is that a horror movie or a drama movie?**

It’s not a horror movie, but it’s a drama.

### **It’s a bit disturbing that the movie seems to be laying this track before the other nine episodes.**

It’s not horror, but I can’t really place my finger on any one of the other nine episodes.

### **It’s a good story, but the way the show presents it…**

It’s a good story, but I think the way the show presents it is way more confusing than it sounds.

### **What is it about the Chrysanthemum Cave that makes it so special, and so epic?**

It’s got that whole mythology involved.

### **I’m just curious, do you think the show would be interested in revealing its secret ending?**

Not really, not at all.

### **Then what’s the plot?**

We don’t know.

### **Why?**

We don’t know.

### **It raises many more questions than it answers.**

We don’t know what’s going to happen.

### **We’ve barely begun.**

We’ve barely
