 middle, and it looks even better from far away, despite the fact that it’s not my house anymore. It’s okay.

And then it kind of all just stays, still, and you just fall asleep, and it’s all beautiful.

### **You must be pretty ruthless when you get down to real life.**

I’d say that’s a little exaggerated, but I’m also kind of lazy. I’m not sure I’m an über person, I’m not a Sherlock Holmes. I’m a Jimmy Page. I’ve seen everything that I can imagine on TV, and I can do it in real life, too.

### **Do you buy stuff on your phone yourself?**

Oh, yes. Quite often.

### **What’s on your phone for real?**

### An interview with Daniel Tosh

![Daniel Tosh is hosting a WeChat conversation.](<|image|>)*Daniel Tosh is hosting a WeChat conversation.*

Chatting with a guy you’ve probably seen around town or worked with at some point in your professional life, and it’s so weird that you’ve eventually joined a company where you watch their shitty moonbats fly.

“I’m tired of explaining things in terms of business transactions and ethics,” says Tosh, “and so I’m extending my offer to all of society’s biggest problems: the spread of unethical business practices, the manipulation of ethical drones, and the outright abuse of ethical hosts.”

Chatting with a guy who probably thinks the same thing, and who I assume will have company at some point down the line, is a bizarre choice of guests. Sure, you can Google Munson Wong AKA Hunter Hayes, the blogger known for [writing drug tests](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [authorizing unlicensed medical procedures](&lt;|url|&gt;), and you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone at the WeChat dinner that doesn’t own a WeChat handle.

But WeChat is the exclusive real-life Facebook that will define the internet for a generation of Chinese internet users. It’s the only true social media device that has become so important that it has become this important. Facebook Chairman Sean Parker is [an Asian goat](&lt;|url|&gt;) (aside from the 44th president of the United States, Donald Trump.)

With 50 million users, WeChat has around [40 million daily users](&lt;|url|&gt;). That’s a lot of people, but WeChat’s brand is so iconic that it has stuck around almost a decade now. Parker is not afraid of losing users, because he has built a competitor that almost everyone is just happy to use.

Facebook is on a trajectory similar to that of Uber; the bigger, better version is the one that reaches people on more platforms, often with more buzzwords, than the original.

It’s clear that WeChat will only become more dominant over time, as it has already conquered the western world and is now the [second most visited website in the world](&lt;|url|&gt;). Interconnecting the WeChat network with Facebook’s other messaging services will only make things even more obvious. If you’re not already a WeChat user, you are going to be affected. The original experiment — launched in 2009 — was a failure, [one Schmidt and Facebook explicitly denied](&lt;|url|&gt;). Yet users flocked to the service’s official Facebook-like Welcome Center, where they were told all posts were moderated. They were also told not to worry, as long as they knew they could post unhappily.

Many users found that reflecting their anxiety and confusion in real life, they could see the logic in a seemingly self-aware moment. They were also, in turn, told not to worry, as the good guys all had well-funded lobbying campaigns.

I was an early adopter of WeChat, and while I still use the service today, full
