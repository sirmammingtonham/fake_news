 your credit card, and the company will help.
> # If you want your phone number, you’ll just buy a new one. If, on the other hand, you don’t want to give your phone number out in the first place, you might want to consider an unlisted number.

And that’s before you consider the extra data you might need to share with your phone company. According to the FTC, the average value of phone service providers was [$29.9 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2016. This [amount ($29.9 billion) represents a 32% increase since 2005](&lt;|url|&gt;). If you have a recurring monthly payment plan, your phone bill could skyrocket as well. Your phone company will have to know what you’re spending your money on and know how much data you need to share with them to continue receiving the benefits.

There are good reasons to think that even though your phone number is public, it’s unlikely that your phone number will be kept private forever. The reality is that many people have their phones for just about everything else. They use their phone for social media, they use their phone for banking, they use their phone for advertising — it’s a pretty seamless interface for everyone else. It’s hard to imagine anyone completely private on the internet.

Of course you’re comfortable with your phone number being shown, even if it means you have to share it with your banking company and that other companies can track your movements. Personally I’m okay with that. I’m pretty comfortable with [tracking my sleep tracker](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [tracking food cravings](&lt;|url|&gt;). Theirs is the kind of thing that most sane people would tell you they’re okay with sharing their phone number just so they can track it down and maybe use it when they’re ready to buy a food can’t you?

But it’s not just that your phone number is out there. Many of us face similar dilemmas when we decide whether to share our phone number. You might not want anyone else to know that you have an iPhone, but you just can’t pass up the extra protection that comes with it. Some take comfort in the fact that their phone app will warn them about potential prying eyes. But this simply isn’t a reliable technology. I certainly hope security experts don’t bring their little findings to town on your device, because we’ve certainly seen enough bad actors do just about anything to end up in the public eye.

In the end, your phone number could be a highly valuable resource (at least to advertisers). If somebody has the skills to mine it for malicious data, there’s no reason that they shouldn’t find something to profit from.<|endoftext|>

# How to Date Someone in a Social VR Space

## Using coders to help developers explore new horizons

In the two weeks it takes to find someone else, imagine a date in a social VR meeting. It doesn’t have to be an unpleasant one. The process should provide a benefit to both parties and neither should feel like a chore. In VR headset-friendly chat, developers should be encouraged to push boundaries and explore new ideas to make the whole experience as enjoyable for both parties. I’ve spent some time working with social VR developers to help them better understand how people would use the platform in the real world, and I’ve found that motivating and accessible topics are often left to developers alone. In that spirit, I’m excited to announce a new initiative in which I’ll be joining Google and working with them to create social VR experiences geared toward fostering a more enjoyable conversation.

That conversation is underway. I talked to Brendan Schwalm, senior vice president of engineering, about [how social VR spaces might foster “innocent until proven guilty” conversations](&lt;|url|&gt;), and about the role of technology like social VR play in helping foster that conversation.
