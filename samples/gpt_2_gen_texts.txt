# Getting Rid of Your iPhone

## If you don’t want to deal with all your data, ditch your phone.

I’m sitting in a coffee shop right now that overlooks a busy four-way stop at an intersection. I keep seeing people drive by, and as they roll to a stop, they look down at their phones, only to let off the brake and continue on their merry way, sometimes with their phone still in hand.

All I can think is, “Why, for crying out loud, is it so necessary to check your phone for two seconds?!” But then I remember that this is not the only situation where this behavior occurs, and smartphone addiction isn’t exactly a recent development. I recently wrote about [deactivating my Facebook account](https://medium.com/@jwilliamsonlee/what-went-wrong-with-my-facebook-account-d9a817a1ee) because of how it felt and how I felt about it, but I think that was the wrong call. I consider my phone a part of my day-to-day life now, and I’m glad it did, because it gave me the best amount of control over my life and made me happier overall.

So, if you happen to be in the vicinity, drop by and say hi — if only for a moment. And try not to pull out your own phone.

# Is Your Phone Killing You? The Answer’s Unclear

## Experts respond with skepticism to a recent New York Times story

Last week, the *New York Times* published a provocative Well piece about smartphones and death that laid out some fascinating points, but it probably belonged in the Opinion section. The article, packaged with the headline “[Putting Down Your Phone May Help You Live Longer](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/well/mind/putting-down-your-phone-may-help-you-live-longer.html),” draws on recent research to suggest that smartphone use causes a spike in the stress hormone cortisol, perhaps leading to a chronic problem that ultimately shortens one’s life span.

Sure, this could be true. Chronic stress is associated with serious health problems, “including depression, obesity, metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, fertility issues, high blood pressure, dementia and even heart disease,” as the article notes. But right now, we simply don’t know the mechanisms and the data that cause this stress. We are still very much in the dark.
> # “The author makes a very strong claim, a rather headline-grabbing claim, that as a scientist I immediately rolled my eyes at.”

I talked to several scientists for this story, most of whom study how people are affected by internet use. All of them, to varying degrees, expressed some degree of unease about the *Times *piece.

“I don’t think anyone can prove that phone use causes stress,” says Tamara Afifi, a psychology professor and director of the Stress, Anxiety, and Resilience Research Center at Hunter College who has studied how people are affected by internet use. “There is indeed a positive correlation. But I think we need more research to prove causation, at least for chronic stress.”

“The author makes a very strong claim, a rather headline-grabbing claim, that as a scientist I immediately rolled my eyes at,” says Tracy Dennis-Tiwary, a psychology professor and a co-director of the Stress, Anxiety, and Resilience Research Center at Hunter College. “I think there are legitimate questions about how much stress there is in the workplace, and whether it is caused by the phone or other digital devices.”

One of the leading experts on stress, Dennis-Tiwary says that the study is potentially a proof of principle that your phone use hinders productivity. “It’s certainly interesting that they did find a relationship, but I think we need more research, particularly this longitudinal, to really understand the extent of the effect. Because the work suggests that the stress of distracted work is the leading cause of stress in the workplace, that may be a more effective solution than more restrictions.”

[One such study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31341368_Cultural_and_Demographic_Factors_Influencing_Stress_In_Workplace_Challenges), upon which the *New York Times* piece relies, looked at the impact of smartphone use and subsequent stress on employee productivity. It found that while the impact of smartphone use and subsequent stress on productivity has been documented elsewhere, in this case, employees who took a one-week break from their phone use during the break were less productive than those who kept their phone calls, even if they didn’t break up with their friends. So, perhaps calling it a distraction is overphalling.

“I do believe that people who are suffering from mental illness can and should be externally focused on such issues,” says Tanya Fiszman, a psychotherapist and former associate professor of psychiatry at Stanford University. “For them, being on calluses and being on guard is just another way to stay in the moment. I believe calling attention to this sort of behavior is part of the grieving process.”

Of course, just because there aren’t long-term studies that look at how phone use affects mental health doesn’t mean that there aren’t long-term studies that look at how phone use affects mental health. That’s why the field needs more funding. It’s also why the American Psychological Association has put forth [an official definition](https://www.apa.org/standards-practice/speech-and-speech) of the term “[calluse](https://www.apa.org/standards-practice/speech-and-speech) of the term “[calluse](https://www.apa.org/standards-practice/speech-and-speech),” which is used to describe a “callused” state of mind.

Calling all “callsuse” calls, even when they’re not in a real physical space, is to give voice to the voiceless. Imagine being a Southie, riding along with a friend on a Greyhound bus. Or a Pierce Brosnan movie where the bad guys get the better foot-dragging plan. Or a real life conversation with a friend about the weather. These conversations can be anywhere from genuinely helpful (street level) to outright annoying (the guy who just wants to know if there’s a place they can hide from the cops). A gathering of “callsuse” calls, even one that’s supposed to be leading to an interaction, can turn into a shouting match within the same group. This isn’t just harmless — it can lead to new insights about the person calling, about their state of mind, their emotions, their words, their body language, their gestures — and, potentially, their [vulnerability](https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/your-call-outs-get-me-tougher-than-ever-67bbb7d9e1e) to their opponents.

​People shouldn’t just stop calling them. Don’t get angry or depressed about it. Listen to what they have to say and understand that they’re frustrated by it. Get to know the person and understand why they’re frustrated. This way, you can avoid the drama of feeling like you’re on the wrong end of a finger while waiting for a bus or limousine or whatever.

2. **The Talk:** Tell your friends and family you’re running a meditation retreat. Maybe you meet with some personal coach or dentist to figure out how to meditate. Maybe you go to a vegan restaurant and order takeout vegetarian meals. This way, you won’t have to anymore, and you’ll be more in control of your life and your wellness.

3. **The Price List:** How much are these luxury goods really worth? How much does the average person need to consume in total? This isn’t something I’m going to try right now, but I’m going to try to break down the buying habit and have some sanity when it comes to buying things.

4. **Freebies:** The list goes on — but it’s not exactly cruelty free. Where are they getting their products from? Are they organic? What’s the deal with synthetics? Are they made with genuine ingredients? Do they have actual toilet paper? Are there roll-ups and rolls? What kind of cushion is that? What kind of cushion is that? What kind of brush is that?

What kind of brush is that? What kind of gel-like material is that? What brand of primer is that? What kind of sunscreen is that? What kind of tinted glass is that? Are there perfumes and candles that supposedly help with acne? And what kind of vibrator is that?

5. **Genious Inequalities:** We are assuming all of our users are equally equipped to make decisions regarding what they want to use, when they want to use them, and for how long. But there’s still silence when you search “supercharging iPhone for half a second.” There’s also no WhatsApp or Viber here. Venteel is perfectly capable of providing what its users want without making them feel like they’re talking to themselves. Vivo is one of the most respected design firms in the world, and yet it still refuses to play nice with Apple’s HomeKit platform. Users will long ago learn to turn off the HomeKit toggle and use the screen to set what’s wanted.

When Apple didn’t design its own app store, it could have added a “thank you” button to each purchase, suggesting that each person feel good about themselves and their choices. Thank you, Apple. Thank you for being here.

It could have designed a dedicated app for users to make a small, token gesture of appreciation, like, “Hey, Siri,” or “Siri,” and let users know how much they use their iPhone, iPod, and Mac, as well as their respective services, such as Maps, Netflix, and Slack. In the end, it won’t be a big deal if users don’t actually earn badges or tabs or colors or levels. Apple will have surely done its research on how to design its own app store, and have implemented it well — if it ever decides to follow suit with its own app store architecture, which everyone (including Apple) will see.
