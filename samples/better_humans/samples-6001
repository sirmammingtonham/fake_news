 mind the negative connotations of using the word regret here. It’s currently against the law in the UK to sell or give alcohol to anyone under the age of 18. If you buy booze on the streets or try to arrange a glass with a friend at the bar, you could end up in jail.

**3. It’s better to smile less**

Surprisingly, smiling is correlated to a number of positive outcomes, such as happier mood, better work ethic and higher self-esteem. Smiling is a charming way to signal goodwill.

My santa kept all of these awesome smiles intact. And I bet if I asked her what her favourite part of her job is, she’d just give me back the nearest Sesame Street segment.

Later today, I hope to interview Lisa about her work with Shriners on The Secret at Google. Tune in!

## #5 Giving keeps us humble

A poignant passage from [a recent TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_goeke_philosophy_of_excellence?language=en)

In that talk, Dan talks about his own humble childhood and what it meant for him to achieve his goal of mastering the horse.

At that age, when he was just a pup, Dan was already a seasoned veteran of riding astride a giant steeds. When he turned 16, he moved to a farm in the hills just outside of Charlottesville, Virginia, and started training with a steed named Archie.

Years later, when Dan was just a lad, he and Archie would take turns guarding the gate to the farm. Day after day, they would ride the steeds through the gate, taking only the gall to charge across the field. Day after day, they would count the droves of sheep and the gumption to cross the lip of the dam.

By the time he was a lad up, Dan could tell he wanted to be a steedman. So he took it upon himself to study horsemanship and eventually gained the respect of the prestigious Cours de Justice.

At the age of sixteen, Dan was already a steedman. By twenty-one, he was a masterful rider. And by thirty-one, he was a man with prestigious titles.

Wherever he looked, Dan could see that if he pursued his own dreams, he could one day become the greatest steedman in the world.

That dream was in danger.

Suddenly, he learnt that his dream was not so unrealistic after all.

## **How a hopeless dream turns into a reality when we give into it**

*Looking back, I regret nothing. *I learnt that my ambition was bigger than myself.*

I learnt that my ambition was bigger than just riding a horse.

Or rather, it was bigger than just learning how to ride a horse.

I learnt that I could potentially ride a unicorn, or at least create my own unicorn, if I really wanted to.

But the bigger dream, the more amazing and terrifyingly wonderful **mystic ramble**.

Back then, it seemed that my ramble was getting louder and my determination to keep going was growing weaker. Every time I started using the word “unicorn” I failed to bring the dream to light. Even when it was obvious that it wasn’t going to happen, I still kept my courage up.

Practically, every time I would utter the word “I will,” the dream would go away.

For example, when I would think about riding a unicorn, my ramble would go something like this:

*[[wag]*][(1*w4C4b0L_z8LOH7LZn6qw.jpeg)*[wag](1*2s7LWqUglt4_5ahkfONlROw.png)*[wag](1*jr1LtDA93z2CaO9Sz14qkf6dLZ5w.png)*

What I ended up with was a hopeless, miserable ramble. The bigger dream was gone, but the *original* dream was not.

## **But I can still take my big dream away**

What happened to my unicorn was not a dream.

It was a lesson for me.

A challenge.
