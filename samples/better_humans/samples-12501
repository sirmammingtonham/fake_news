======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 a thing.

* Do something

* Be someone

* Let someone tell you what you can do

You’re already doing a huge disservice to yourself, not to mention the thousands of impolting opportunities you waste because you can’t plan for the future and *do* nothing.

As a parent, I feel the devastating effects of · piling stress on top of stress.

I feel the pain of not having [enough time](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mayov4K0IL1rh5mp6o1_500.gif) to myself. And I feel the pain of not having [enough time to grow my own food business](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mayov4K0IL1rY48g_1148.gif).

I feel the weight of not having enough time to enjoy life at the moment. I feel the heat emanating from my computer screen. I want to spend every moment doing productive things.

*Stop doing something so soon as you can!*

The answer isn’t “never!” *It’s **pursuit of pleasure** that poisons us, but rather **deliberation and mastery of the means**.

As a parent, I feel the devastating effects of · putting our foot in the drain when we’re trying to save money.

I feel the siren’s song of *customer satisfaction paradox*. Why is it so hard to do the simple things that make life worthwhile?

*Ask yourself: am I going to do this?*

*Is this thing really worth the stress and frustration?*

*Is this going to make me happy?*

Then, add a “Yes” to every question.

**At least this is how most of our readers answer.**

## The Most Important Trait of a Leader

When you’re trying to get more things done — whether it’s to save money, to be more mindful of our environment, or simply to be more mindful of our own lives — there’s a paradox that often shows up.

What you’re doing, ultimately, is asking for more help.

You’re asking for help from others who have already gone through the same trials and have come out with the same insights.

And it’s not at all surprising, as Richard Feynman’s [better humans](http://betterhumans.coach.me/why-am-good-humans-good-for-you-295831cff6f) have shown us.

In [The Power of Habit](http://betterhumans.coach.me/why-good-humans-good-for-you-295831cff6f), it’s shown that we really do [have a lot in common](http://betterhumans.coach.me/the-power-of-habit-exchange-be-great-for-you-6ccb2829c4003) with regard to how we think and behave — we’re both big fans of positive thinking. Just take a look at our data, and you’ll see a theme.

Also, since quite the contrary in some cases.

When you’re trying to change your diet, one of the first things you’ll do is to start gaining weight.

And this is *really* the stupidest thing you can do.

After all, if you’re currently eating junk food, doesn’t it make you want to eat more of the same?

No.

You can’t.

Actually, you can’t.

Honestly, you can’t.

If you want to lose weight, gain some height, and be a healthier version of yourself.

An unhealthy relationship with alcohol will make it harder for you to achieve those goals. And an unhealthy relationship with positive thinking will make it harder to move forward on those projects as well.

So, let’s get to the heart of this.

### What you can learn from this experiment

As I mentioned, I had a lot of fun with this experiment. I got to observe and talk to people about their addictions, and I’ve learned a lot. You’ll see that there’s a theme that repeats itself, and that even if you separate yourself from it, it will return to haunt you.

Don’t be like me!

Get back to your addiction!
