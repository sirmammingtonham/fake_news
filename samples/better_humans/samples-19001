* I’m willing to learn from what I hear.

When we’re willing to dive into something new, when we’re willing to truly listen to the people in our lives, we aren’t simply throwing dice into a hat.

We aren’t choosing the topics we’re passionate about one hundred percent of the time.

And when we do it – even inadvertently – we aren’t choosing the topics we’re genuinely interested in.

## **2. Give people power.**

In business, power is the bridge to more productive behavior. It’s the one skill more important than all the others that combine to form a strong foundation for strong performers.

Powerful people also have deep seated beliefs that feed back into their daily work habits. Those beliefs have formed because of their deep rooted beliefs in the things they** prefer**.

In his book [*The Righteous Mind](http://www.amazon.com/The-Righteous-Mind-Philosopher-Richard-Day-ebook/dp/B006WAIV6M)*, University of Virginia professor [Jonathan Haidt ](https://twitter.com/jonathanhaidt)refers to this part of our brain as the “poisonous serpent” because it is so addictive.

When we are motivated to take action, our brain likes to associate with things that make us happy. This is good news for us!

In *The Righteous Mind*, author Richard Herridge explains that feeling of power as the difference between feeling like you have a purpose and actually having a life:
> *“Do you really know what you are doing? You know what you are doing, but you’re not sure. You’re not sure if you are doing well or if you’re doing badly. Either way, you are doing very well, and that’s hugely exciting and humbling.”*

## **3. You can’t have fun just being happy.**

I’m a big fan of my colleague Paul Offutt’s concept of “Hedonic Optimization” ("how the human brain gears in on the optimal performance of each task they are asked to do).

Using this strategy leads to productivity surges in the deep states of productivity, which can “restart our brain and find creative solutions to the problems we encounter.”

The author is kind enough to not only create a brain dump, but he shares it with his professional colleagues, friends, and family!

This is a good routine that can help you adjust your brain in a way that makes optimal performance an integral part of your daily life.

If you like the idea of hacking your brain, or if you have been elsewhere in your mind, this may be worth a shot.

# This is How to Stay Productive Every Day

## This is How to Stay Productive Every Day

I think it’s appropriate for where we are to share a few stories here about what we think is the best approach to living a productive life.

*At [Coach.me](http://coach.me/), we’ve been wanting to [take the world by storm](http://www.coach.me/plans/10k). So I did a [test](http://www.coach.me/users/coach-me-designs-communications/coach-me-communication-1011707.html) of just one simple goal:
> # To make everyone feel heard at work.

I admit in my heart I probably could have written more coherently, but I wanted to give something back. I wanted to share with you the power of internal guided thought, by showing you exactly how to do it yourself.

## I Created My Own Mindset

In my own life, I am not sure I have created a more productive environment than the one I have created for myself. I have written about the various tricks I have used to be more productive over the last six years, but today, I am happy to share with you the exact mindset I used to be successful.

### The Productivity Mindset

In his book, The More Productive You Think (3), author Steven Pressfield explains what he calls “the productivity mindset”:
> “The goal of the productivity mindset is not to reach one perfect solution to a vexing problem or vexing problem. Rather, it’s to simplify the way you think about and write about yourself.
