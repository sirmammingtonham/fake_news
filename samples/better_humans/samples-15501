What’s the best tactic to use for increasing your motivation?

Let me frame it for you. There are three approaches that you can use to achieve your goals:

1. **Upgrade your mind.** You can do this by thinking about yourself in the context of your goals.

1. **Practice, practice, practice.** You can do this by reflecting on and practicing your goals.

1. **Don’t think and just do it.** Action without thought is power. Having a plan and a strategy is power.
Practice, practice, practice.

**Note:** I am not a nutritionist or a healthcare professional. The strategies discussed here are ideas that you can use to improve your own motivation, and I suggest you try them all.

1. **Goals outside your comfort zone will change**. As I mentioned above, many people start without goals; so the strategies discussed here are likely to help.

1. **Assessment and validation** by approaching your goals from a realistic and sustainable perspective. What do you want to achieve, in 5 years? How badly do you want to achieve it? Get to know it intellectually as opposed to just riding the wave of it.

1. **Work for change**. Realistic changes require action; so working for change will prompt action. But without action, how will you know you’re on the right track?

1. **Validation by peers**. You won’t get validation from telling your friends, loved ones or your family. Your main source of fear might be other people’s perception of you. Let me speak for all of us; your mind will not stand for what’s different. Your soul will not accept it.

1. **Hypothesis vs Reality**. In science, theory is the ultimate guide for how things work. It is hard to be a scientist and bring to pass what you read from a theoretical point of view. You must take it as Supported by Science. You must apply your scientific mind to everything you read and figure out what is supported by science.

1. **Hypothesis: My idea is to start from scratch and see how far I can push this idea.

1. **Verse: My idea is to simplify life as much as possible.

1. **Lets start from scratch and see how far we can push this idea.

Hypothesis: My idea is to start from scratch and simplify life as much as possible.

In the first game, you can see your mom and me kicking butt together. This is where most people think they learn about the importance of taking care of their body from you. In reality, you learn it from watching your mom and me do it. It’s the perfect metaphor for the way we humans are poised to impact the world and ourselves.

As for your future, guess what? It’s a blank canvas. There’s just so much i$$ to do, yadda yadda yadda. Well, at least as far as you can manage to do it. Most of the time, you’re going to be okay.

There are 8 billion of us on this planet and no two are the same. We are all going to be left with nothing but time and doubt.

It’s time to start making some art, gathering some inspiration, and putting together a plan of action. All you need is your vision and a hammer.

### What You Vision

Take my word for example. I’m gonna use my word from beginning:

* I’m gonna see myself reflected in the mirror at night, looking in a mirror.

* I’m gonna put my hand out in front of me and say *“I want to take a picture of myself from the outside.”*

You see how in the picture I’m standing in front of myself, in my free time, mostly alone. I don’t have a laptop, I’m good friends with lots of people, but mostly alone.

And you can see it coming, already. You see it in the reflection of the pond, or the scary guy looming over your shoulder. You don’t have to actually “go” to the park, or to the other guy’s house. You just have to imagine.

You can start drawing pictures and placing them in your journal or blog, or whatever else you do to get constructive input. I always enjoy sketching, either as a source or as a lead-with.
