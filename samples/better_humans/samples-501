======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 my way out of the city, he pulled me over, made me sit in his passenger seat next to his, and said I was a very busy man and shouldn’t be bothered. I didn’t even notice the car was off the road for a split second, because the man was staring at the ground in shock and disbelief. A moment later, he told me he thought I would have forgotten something and was waiting for me in the airport, so he would return and take care of the rest in person.

My friend came home the next day, and we both were devastated. We had tried everything, but we never believed it could be as bad as it was. There still wasn’t anything we could do. We were in a state of disbelief. It was very hard to get over the pain of losing our friends, even though we had tried to hold on by doing everything in our power to try to find them.

The hardest thing of all was convincing ourselves that it’s ok to go somewhere and not be bothered anymore. We couldn’t even think of why the person would even think to do that, and yet we believe it’s still ok to do this. We are so programmed to be in this kind of situation where we expect to go home to them, right? The problem is, when we’re in our state of denial and in denial of our surroundings, there it is, all around us:
> # Our senses tell us otherwise. It’s not always easy, but we always end up finding a way to get around it.

There was no way back after what happened last night. We didn’t know what to do. We didn’t feel happy again. We were just devastated. What will our lives be like if this never happens to something else? We don’t know. Maybe next time? Maybe not? Who knows? There is a good chance we could make it through one of these situations alone. The chance is small, but knowing it doesn’t matter. The worst thing to happen is not to get home, but not to be around people who need us. Not when we know we can rely on them to get back up the next time we need them.

We don’t have any plans to get out of town soon. We don’t even know if there is anything to do to visit or anything we want to do. We are just doing what we can to make things better in our lives and get better friends. When you need something, you get it. It’s ok to miss work on some days, even if you think you might have missed something. There are going to be days when you are just so exhausted you won’t be able to go anywhere. If you are ever in a place that has to be postponed or delayed or pushed back, always know there is a plan for you and you’re the one who will get hurt.

When you feel like your life isn’t getting better and you try to change, be grateful you had your own plan. Don’t just wish things were all better then they were, but put your life in a better direction first. Trust me, I had no idea how to get out of the city and I am glad it was a plan that was set up as they were the safest way to get out of the car accident.

Sometimes we have to fight the good fight in order to save lives. If you ever need any ideas, get on the #metrohelmet. You can find it on a city bus, at a gas station, an airport, or just in your own backyard. Stop trying to make everything better, and start doing the simple things first. I wish I knew how to do this, the best way to do it is by doing.

# A Short History of the Modern-Day Gym

## The Gym

Gymnastics originated in 1896 in New Zealand and has since been played by athletes in Rio’s Olympic Stadium. The sport uses weighted plates and cables to improve performance by increasing the intensity of each workout.

The popularity of Gymnastics has increased since its popularity increased when athletes were brought back from World War II. In 1955, the U.S. Olympic team became the first team to win gold medals in the event. In 1976, the US was the first country to win gold in the event and in 1989, the first woman ever to medal in a gymnastics event.
