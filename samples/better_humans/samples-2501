, that’s what we choose to focus on right now. **But once I started to apply those principles to each and every project I started to notice an immediate change in my life.** I noticed that each morning I felt a newfound freedom in the form of being free to choose how to express myself and in the enjoyment of doing things like relaxing, catching up with friends, hanging out with family, and generally just having some simple *me time* with myself and my awesome awesome awesome hobbies.

There’s a mantra that I’ve started repeating to myself more and more often over the past year or more; **I’m with it. Period.**

## Don’t “Say ‘yes’ when you don’t want to.”

As cliché as it sounds, if you don’t want to, then you’re not really with it.

That’s not to say that I didn’t say ‘yes’ occasionally, just that I expressed it as a clear yes to what I was currently avoiding saying no to. So if something isn’t absolutely necessary then it’s not with me at all.

Now don’t misunderstand me, I’m not saying that a time to express yourself is never an unfortunate necessity. To be honest, I’m quite comfortable expressing myself in a time where other people feel compelled to ignore or downplay it. It takes a conscious effort to express myself in these cases, but for the most part I find that expressing myself in a way that gets ignored or downplayed makes my life more fulfilling and exciting.

There are nights where I’ll actively say no, nights where I’ll express myself in a way that nobody else in the room can hear and those experiences are priceless.

I don’t claim that all of these “yeses” are reserved for Friday’s or those precious just moments of feeling like I’ll do something productive. And I certainly understand when I don’t get a chance to do that. But I guarantee that within a few moments of my answering a yes, my entire world will be filled with possibilities. I could say, ’yes, thank you, thank you, no, thank you.’
> # A yes is a yes, a yes that protects you from doing the latter.

## If you’re tired of being ignored, frustrated, or worse yet, scared to express yourself, then you might want to rethink your entire outlook on the world.

A year from now, when you’re a teenager, I hope you’ll be standing in front of me and you won’t even be able to say, “no”. Express yourself. Or don’t, whichever comes later.

So leave now. Tomorrow doesn’t look as good as today. Hell, it looks downright awful. And by the way, it’s not as bad as yesterday’s or tomorrow’s. It’s not even close. Not unless you get off the back of an airplane or something equally horrific happens.

Because right now, every single day, every single girl, boy, and adult in this room is experiencing the most awful of times.

And it’s not just the bad times. Every single day, every single person in this room hosts a painful lesson of their own in front of them. And all you do is look away. Because you fear doing something about it.

## Stop trying, just do it

## Try.

Try is the key. Don’t look for validation or approval. Just do it.

The question is, do you have the courage to do that?

I’ll be honest. I’ve thought a lot about trying.

Sometimes, I’m confrontational or I don’t do well.
