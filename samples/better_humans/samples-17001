======== SAMPLE 1 ========
: When the computer thinks you’ve finished a task and you try to get it back on, you can’t help but feel annoyed and confused. Why can’t I complete the task I feel incomplete because I keep putting things off?

A simple solution could be to think about tasks in the morning and the evening, when you’re waking up and finishing your day.

## 4. Set priorities for your day

Prioritization is a crucial part of learning, it lets you focus on what matters most.

If you try to do a lot of things and put them all off until the morning, you’ll get drained of energy and stressed. On the other hand if you start catching them in one swoop, you’ll have a much bigger chance of making progress and hitting your goals.

So how do you know when to start working on those important things?

Basically the way is to think about what’s important to you in your day and what’s not.

For example if you feel energized and decide to write an article in the morning, you can do that by thinking about 7–8 things that are *important* for you.

If you don’t know what those things are, that’s a red flag. You need to find out more information [here](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-find-out-more/).

Similarly if you’re trying to get in shape, you can do that by thinking about things that are *important* for you.

If you’re working to get in better shape, you can do that by doing a [habit](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-start-habit/).

The habit thing is definitely worth mentioning. The payoff is huge.

When you do the reminder in your mind and think about things that are important to you, you start an internal motivation to get even more motivated.

And once you’ve got that internal motivation, you won’t want to miss a day.

### 5. Use visuals to get thoughts out of your head

One of the most efficient and recognizable ways to do anything is to think about a [visualization](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-practice-mindfulness/).

Even if you can’t articulate it in writing yet, it’s very easy to do.

This method can also work really well for [shaping the design of your environment](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-change-your-habits/).

Here’s an example of a habit that I’ve been working on:

**I want to meditate. **I know what I want to do, but I don’t know where to start. I always struggle with staying motivated when I don’t feel motivated.

So I come up with some visualizations to help me visualize what I’m going to do.

For help, I refer to the [coaching program](http://www.selfication.com/coaching/) and the concept of visualization [**CMD](http://www.selfication.com/cmd/)**.

**CMD** represents the start of the program. It takes some effort to get going. You wake up and get ready for meditation. But forget about meditation. Instead of focusing on your breath, you shift your attention to the muscles around your body.

**CMD tells you to watch a calming video. **There are two explanations for why you might want to switch from meditation to a routine of deep breathing.

The one I’m using is grounding-walking. During meditation, your attention is directed to your body. As you descend into the plane of consciousness, your awareness is left behind as your body descends.

In reality, you’re really directing your attention to your breaths.

## #4. Breathe in Headspace

If you’ve ever been guided by a sense of adventure, resistance, or other mental state, you know how important it is to become aware of these states.

When we meditate, we lose control of our breathing. We can’t control how we feel or what’s going on in our heads.

So how do we regain control over these cascading emotions?

We breathe in headspace.

[Headspace](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-calibrate-your-head-space/)

allows you to see, feel, and control your breathing.

Think of it as the headspace of your mind.

When you breathe in your head, your body
