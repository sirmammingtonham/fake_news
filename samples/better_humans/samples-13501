 change that. You could keep your original resolution, modified only by my actions in the mirror.

Or you could completely change your resolution to be better at sports. Become a better powerlifter. Speed-train your way to fitness. Or eat better. That last one will take time, and it may cost some important nodes.

Confidence is a big thing, and it goes to show that even if your resolution is perfect, there will still be areas of your life where it will be difficult, or even impossible, to make it happen.

How much more confident would you be if your resolution was perfect?

Bottom line: As long as your resolution is solid, you can expect disappointment.

## 2. You have no clue what you’re doing

When you set out to try to accomplish a new habit, you expect to learn as much about the process as you do about the outcome.

If you’re trying to build a new habit, you can become very good at it in the beginning.

There’s a process for doing that, and it depends on a lot of variables that are out there. In the process, you learn valuable lessons about how to manage your emotions, to be more attuned to what’s going on in your life, and to be more on top of your game.

### 3. You freakin’ love it when it’s easy

The other two processes are directly related to each other.

### 1. Your Momentum

The moment you start on a new habit, you’re in a good place to start.

It’s quite an adventure, filling a lot of time and energy looking up at the sky in awe of the newness.

If you can see it clearly, you probably already have a pretty good idea of what action will get you the most bang for your buck.

If you’re working on a new habit, I highly recommend doing it with a timer. It makes it a lot easier to [practice and track your progress](http://lifehacker.com/268412/rookie-tech-in-your-life-must-support-your-purpose).

# What Makes an Effective Morning Morning?

## 

Much like any other habit, your morning routine should evolve with the times. With that in mind, I have compiled a list of useful things that have been found by myself over the years that have made my mornings more productive. Many of these ideas are no longer being practiced, but may have been discarded in favor of newer, easier ways to practice or react to waking up.

Here are a few ways you can use those mornings to spark a new morning routine:

1. If you aren’t using meditation, you could [just read](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-practice-mindfulness/). I find it to be extremely beneficial because it helps you diffuse the energy of meditation into something more general. Another amazing way to [practice](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-practice-mindfulness/), is using an app like Pavel’s Mindfulnessr. I find MindfulnessR to be easier to use than the guided meditation app because mindfulness helps you go deeper into your learning and study material. I find it to be a more powerful way to react to a stressful situation.

1. If you aren’t using a phone as your alarm clock, you could [try switching on your phone while you are getting ready for bed](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-switch-off-your-phone/). This will take less than 5 seconds per day and will help you sleep better.

1. Lastly, use your voice. No matter what you want to do, try to envision a specific result and create that result using only your mind.

Results!
