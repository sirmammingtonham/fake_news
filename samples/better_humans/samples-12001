Even in the presence of catastrophe, the need for change and the excitement of the new finds, it seems the universe is not ready to hear it.”***—J.K. Rowling

We are so programmed to not ask for help. We’ve been deaf to the obvious evidence that major corporations have poor employee and HR policies and personnel. We’ve been blind to the evidence that blind people absorb errors. We’ve even been blind to the evidence that color blind people perceive color blind.

The truth is corporations *expect* you to be color blind. They have literally programmed you to think only in terms of shades of grey.

Recently, a customer asked me for an recommendation on a product. I reviewed the product and provided the following feedback:
> *Overall, the R9 column represents the number of steps it takes to learn 4C11 (27561321) — that is a 10% suggestion to IMDb. I would suggest trying either color blindness or being purposely vague. There is a lot of hype behind color blindness, but the reality is, you have no idea how to go about learning this. My advice would be to leave the hype at the door. Trust me, you will come across people who can easily identify all of the facts in this application of vision. **I have coached many people who have been able to identify their CEO, they do it anyway. So don’t hide the truth. ***Read the manual. ***Seriously. Every single one. It’s scary.

# How to Be an Extreme Night Owl and Fail Miserably

## 

You *want* more.

You want *to* sleep better.

You want to lighten your mood.

You want to have more energy.

You want to love.

That’s right.

You want to be a “night owl.”

You want to be a [Sensation](http://www.themonklife.net/so-does-meditation-really-work/) by noon.

You want to be a [Movement](http://www.themonklife.net/movements-and-mentzer-mori/) facilitator by late afternoon.

You want to be a [Fearless](http://www.themonklife.net/fearless-mountains-7-mountains-mountains-clever-and-mountains-2/) hunter by late evening.

You want to [Work on your Journal](http://www.themonklife.net/how-to-focus-mentally-9-mountains-mountains-writing-a-journal/) by noon.

You want to [Play a Lot](http://www.themonklife.net/5-minute-philosophy/) of chess.

OK. Okay. I admit it.

I was still working toward my goal of morning journaling when Coach.me kicked me off.

Suddenly, I had a craving to [Play a Lot](http://www.themonklife.net/5-minute-philosophy/) more, so I sat in front of my computer and attempted to set aside 15 minutes each week to study.

I failed.

To save me from having to leave my home, my wife and I decided to try morning sessions. I tried making it a habit to go to the library and exercise machine, even though I didn’t feel fazed by the thought. I tried putting on a pair of fresh, sport shoes. I tried tying my shoes before going to bed.

The following day, about an hour before going to bed, I remembered that night owl.

The next morning, about half way through my habit formation, I realized that I hadn’t taken the class that day.

I browsed the class ratings and found that it wasn’t as bad as I thought it might be. It wasn’t as hard as I thought it was. It wasn’t as draining as I thought it was.

If anything, it was a little easier than I initially thought.

## Lesson 1: The Classroom Curriculum

This is the easy lesson to learn:

*During class, make eye contact with a member of the class and ask them a question.

*After class, don’t respond to a question from a member of the class.

*After class, don’t participate in a mock exam.

*After class, don’t study the material that you were assigned.

*After class, don’t participate in a challenge.
