======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you’ll need to change your breathing habits.
​

### 1. Starting Fresh

A lot of people get busted breathing on a daily basis, so to speak. It’s pretty awesome, right? Busted! — Let’s say you wake up and before you know it it’s 1:00 AM on a Monday and you don’t feel like doing anything. You feel like you’re going to die. So you double check your breathing and make sure you’re breathing correctly. When you check your breathing, make sure you’re breathing in the correct rhythm.

​ If your breathing pattern is very predictable, it’s very hard to change. You won’t be able to breathe rhythmically and you’ll need to use special instruments, such as the [Breathalyzer](http://www.expandbeyondyourself.com/five-tips-to-be-more-happy/), to make deeper breathing sounds.

### 2. Using the Terminal Positions

A very common mistake people get into when trying to find their true happiness is that they don’t account for the gap between their current situation and their goal. They think they will always be happier if they fall back into a less desirable role. Remember, you never truly achieve your goals unless you consistently choose to do so.

That space is extremely valuable. Employ it for what is important to you, not for what is convenient. If you can’t do anything else, then you’re effectively stuck.

## Step 3: Look for the Opportunity

Now, with your lungs full of air, you are about to take a huge leap forward. Before you can do anything else, you need to realize that it’s a start. You’re stomping all over the place. Here are some guidelines to help you make sure you don’t take another risk:

* **Start small.** Before you know it, all the goals in Step 2 are already accomplished. Go for it. Don’t wait for it to all be well known. Set it and let your imagination run wild.

* **Don’t let the unrealistic goals of your past actions derail your efforts.** The only way to deal with a situation like this is to remain open-minded, not settle for what’s right and push harder than you think.

* **Remember that it doesn’t have to be the same for all your goals.** If you’re going to lose weight, make sure you keep track of your progress accurately. Set limits and don’t be afraid to part ways.

* **Don’t let the past or future hold you back.** Nothing can be gained except through continued effort.

* **Focus on consistency, not results.** You have more control over the results you get than results you’re expecting. Check out [this 5-step process](http://www.expandbeyondyourself.com/form/53a9733261/1) to help you stay on track.

* **Create a to-do list.** Schedule it. Create a [compliant list](http://www.expandbeyondyourself.com/article/816783147169/), wrap it up with a date and put it on your calendar.

* **Don’t let your negative habits hold you back.** Positive habits are the secret to success. They’re the fuel for growth and progress. When you have high fuel levels, you don’t have to work to keep moving forward.

* **Focus on consistency, not results.** You have more control over the results you get than those who do the same thing over and over again.

* **Change your mindset.** Acceptance is a mindset. Make sure you use it to stay ahead of the curve.

* **Change your actions.** To change, you must ask yourself the difficult questions that don’t feel comfortable or comfortable to you. Make them part of your daily vocabulary.

* **Don’t let the results scare you. **Big results doesn’t mean no one will appreciate your work. It means whether you will be able to bring small results. It also means that you’ll have to change your ways of thinking.

* **Learn to accept that you don’t have control over your results.** That you will have to experiment with different approaches to get better results.

* **Don’t get fancy.** Being fancy will only work in so many cases. Learning to accept that you don’t have control over your results will help you learn how to manage the fire effectively.
