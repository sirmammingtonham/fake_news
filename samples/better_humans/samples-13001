 way it would go as she put it, and she proceeded to do just that.

I, for my money, am a Zagat user. And that’s the name of the app that makes me smile with intent. (Oh, and it’s great because by syncing with my vault, I can see how much I suck at life.)

After she was gone, I decided to turn on my computer to log some basic nagging at work. (By “basic nagging,” I really meant “basic grunt work.”) So I accepted an invitation to join a Skype call, and promptly added four links to texts from people that were saying something like “I will check back in later,” or “I will give this guy a real test.”

The next thing you need to do is make sure your voicemail is being heard. If you send an email and don’t get a response, it’s probably not going to get through. If you find out that your original email was just a whine, and you don’t want to spend more time doing it.

Start with a short survey. Conduct a poll on okcompanies like Facebook, and then [write down your reasons](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-change-your-habits/).

Then start applying the principles from [The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.selfication.com/what-is-highly-effective-people/).

You don’t need super genius or super clever. I’m talking about really basic common habits here, like choosing your first companion, having a more intimate relationship, or leaving a legacy.

These will help you build trust, and give you extra motivation, if you need it.

### The ‘Do Something’ Option

Many people give up on reaching their goals, because they are going to get frustrated and burned out. And the thing is, frustration is a sign that you already have what it takes.

And if you are going to lose your sense of purpose and drift away from the things you are willing to do, it’s probably time to turn up the heat a little bit.

What could you do to fuel that desire to finally stick it out? What would you do to show up and do the work in your increasingly meaningless existence?

Perhaps you could spend more time with your family. Spend more time with your friends. Make more time for yourself.

What’s stopping you from doing just that?

# Find the Time for a Wandering Mind.

## Mindfulness helps us meditate, focus, and rid ourselves of stress and anxiety. But at what cost? Focus is an in demand commodity today, we all want it. So why *is mindfulness so necessary?*, when does it suit us?

As I’ve mentioned before, if you can’t let the mind go, you can certainly make it go. All you need is the single smallest moment of diversion, and you can get so good at it that people will recognize you as a meditator.

Yet people find ways to cut you off. I remember having a chat with a recent hire — and seeing how quickly she could cut off all of her other social activities.

“I just can’t … I just can’t believe it. I never wanted to be so vulnerable…”

She quickly added, “What if I just stop posting on Facebook and start doing pushups in the mirror?”

Yep. That’s exactly what I did.

For that last three months, I sat down with a vision of how I want my life to be. In my vision, I want to devote more time each week to working on my back, exercising, reading, and simply having a sense of being more present.

At the end of the experiment, I compared my visions to how I actually dealt with life. On average, I felt pretty normal checking my phone, having a beer, and scrolling through Facebook.

In my vision, I dedicate another 20% of my time each month to working on my back. And within that 20%, I also figure out how to devote that time each week. The rest of the time should be devoted to mental and physical preparation.
