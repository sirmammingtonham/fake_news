 now, it’s a new planet to me.”

“I understand. Then I will leave.”

The doorbell rings, and I get an epiphany. I’ve been lounging about the entire time, not paying attention, not caring if what I’m watching includes Formula 1 commentator, or Formula One commentator, or even Game of Thrones’ ...

## Et tu, mon ame?

I’m not quite ready for what’s next. I don’t want to offend anybody. But I can’t for the life of me.

### Am I ready for what’s ahead?

I’m very aware that this preparation is a bit tiring. It’s a reason why I don’t do it often. But there’s also something rewarding (to me) about pushing yourself to see the big picture and not paying attention to small details. It’s the biggest picture, right?

## So, what’s next?

I’m still on track to hit my biggest milestone of my life this coming Friday. It’s an exercise of patience, honesty, and a willingness to share regret with the world.

And there’s nothing wrong with that. A bit repetitive, a bit superficial, a bit apologetic would be better. We need to let these things lie.

What’s really “redemption”, however, is to step forward into growth and onward into happiness. That requires *quality programming*. It requires self-awareness — and the ability to critically evaluate what’s working and how.

Above all, it requires courage. The challenge is to be self-critical and share that growth with the world.

So, my advice to you is to hone your critical awareness, and trust your judgment — not just your gut.

## How to Figure Out What Virtual Assistants Can Do for You

I’m a big believer that [working with virtual assistants can increase our wellness](http://justrollingwith.it/virtual-assistants-and-wellness) by helping us -

1 — Unclutter our minds

2 — Steal time back

3 — Reduce stress

### Because Your Life is Unique and Changing You Need A Virtual Assistant Mindset

To begin working with virtual assistants and enjoying these benefits, the next time you want to grab a pen and paper and brainstorm several ideas for how to be more productive, consider hiring a [brainstormer](https://www.jobexiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BRAIN-17.pdf) for your own state-of-the-art brain.

What’s your preferred method of briefing your clients?

In a word, “fuck it.”

Or maybe “sucks”.

We want to make sure that what we’re offering to you is good enough to convince you to stick with it, no matter which mode you’re in.

That means sometimes you might have to fend off unwelcome advances.

If that’s the case, try using pre-filled summaries — like this one — that players are already familiar with.

Because no matter how good the AI becomes, it will still likely struggle to meet real life obligations. So instead of trying to meet them, try offering them something that they’ve been asking for but have been unable to receive.

It’s their choice whether they’ll stick with what they’ve been getting, or whether you’ll free up more desk space.

### How to Figure Out What to Ask Your Virtual Assistants

Start with one or two of the following scenarios.

If you’re volunteering as a nanny anymore (you probably have a lot of those now), you might want to look at other areas of your life where you can find virtual assistants that can do more useful work.

If you’re an IT consultant, you might want to consider hiring a VA who can help with whatever IT support you need — but don’t send them for the office environment.

If you’re a parent, you might want to consider a virtual assistant who is dedicated to making your child happier and doing more constructive work.

The world’s growing digital office is full of complex, sometimes toxic, and sometimes even criminal behavior. Repeatedly limit the resources you give your virtual assistant to the tasks they’re already good at.

But most importantly, adjust your mindset so
