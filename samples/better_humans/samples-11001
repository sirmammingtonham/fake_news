The results? Life, it seems, is not fair. And I have a hard time with “I’m better than you”.

I’m happy you asked. Sometimes you’re right, and other times you’re not.

That’s okay. It’s okay to ask questions. When we do, we’ll learn something and it will come out in the end. But it’s not okay to focus on the **bottom**.

Most of the time, we’re going to want to get our ego to explode in order to resolve the conflict. But don’t hold back.

Get your ego to let go so you can consider the strengths instead. Identify the areas of your life where you can make improvements. Critique them and make the improvements you’d like to see.

After all, that’s how any good learner – and there are plenty of them – uses the feedback to continually improve. Over time, that feedback loops back to you.

So, what do you do with your ego in order to actually learn something?

Is it time to blow up your resume? No.

Is it time to start your own business? Of course not.

Is it time to become a triathlete? Of course not.

The answer is a clear and concise one, <strong>) no to all of these things.

So…

What are you doing to actually **get better at what you do?**

## This program will make you superhuman

I am writing this announcement to announce a major change within our company, [Coachella Valley Hardware & Tech Co.]. We’re looking to add 1,000 more square feet to our current 66, which is already one of the largest brick and mortar companies in the country.

This increase in size and scope will help our company grow from a handful of designers to a leader in the growth of personal and professional hardware and software.

We’re also looking to add more versatility and allow our teams to customize the solutions to meet the evolving needs of their businesses.

The change we’re looking for is deep and wide ranging — from the standpoint that everyone in our company is a designer at heart. That’s a designer in every sense of the word — someone with an idea and passion to bring to life.

We’re deep into our technology startups. We’ve got a big team of developers with years of combined experience. Yet we’re finding ourselves with some serious design challenges. We’re trying to carve out a niche and make a difference.

At Coachella, we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to connect with our customers and help our users lead more productive and happier lives.

We’re passionate about showing our customers how innovative our solutions are. That’s why we’re constantly working on bridging the gap between what our customers are able to deliver on their own, and what we’re held back to write our way into.

At [One Habit, Here Are 100 Habits](http://onehabit.com/100-habit-here-are-100-habit), we do an in-depth dive into why we believe habits are so important. It’s a habit review—a way to learn how to start and how to continue. The in-depth dive into why we believe habits are so important is a big part of why I believe habits are so important. So go take a look at the big picture and why habits are so important.

In the meantime, I challenge you to create a habit that will take you 100 steps beyond the first.

## This the Most Fun Way to Improve Your Life

Imagine. You’re a vegetable taster. You’ve just ordered an awesome new salad. You’ve got it ready to go but forgot.

**“What’s the key here?”**

The salad bar at the Coachella Valley Yacht Club is ready and the salad lovers among us can be found. But what’s left? A silent but nevertheless satisfying sigh.

Featuring: Arugula, artfully placed salad blades, hand-rolled sushi, artisan breads, cheeses and a truly outstanding cocktail. Sounds good, right?

With one quick call and go, I’m ready for my day at the deli. I’m also ready to order some pizza
