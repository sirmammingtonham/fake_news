When you think you’re not ready, you remind your brain that it’s already there.

Here’s a theory of cognitive development, named for the [Oracle’s formula for human growth — OR, as Richard Dawkins put it, “because OR is often true.”) In his book, [The Self-Actualizing Genius: Richard Simmons on the Science of Willpower (4)], Simmons writes about how the human brain has changed a great deal since it was created:

In the pre-smart phone era of 2009, neuroscientist James Watson discovered that the [social] perception of “intruder” was much smaller than in [the pre-smart phone era of 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intruder_(architecture) — in other words, we’re no longer pre-familiar with how to interact with others. In 2009, [Simmons & Co.] created the [Interpersonal Communication Checklist](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/stop-calling-all-you-interpersonal-communication-comparative-psychology-ii-ii-iii-e-fear-non-response-or-empathy-instilling-values-imperceptible-to-cognitive-disease) to help us better manage our interpersonal relationships. And, a mere 4 years after that, [Simmons](http://psychology.uchicago.edu/faculty/jason-simmons/422/jason-simmons-and-non-response-intruder-emotional-support-to-intruder-emotional-supporting-intruder-emotional-interviewing.html) published a seminal article on the science of non-verbal communication [here](https://psychology.uchicago.edu/journals/cog/action/happiness/2017-05/22/when-does-speaking-actually-mean-being-happy).

And just like back in the day when Watson discovered that our emotional intelligence increases with the number of times we log on to the same workplace, [recent research](https://psychologicalscoops.aol.com/index.php/news/non-verbal-signals-immediately-naive/) on online dating has shown that it’s possible to predict the outcome of a relationship solely by checking the dating app: the app predicts whether the sender of the message is successful or not.

The takeaway here is that, whatever we do, we cannot afford to be complacent. Asking someone out on a date will result in several missed opportunities.

# Want To Be More Productive? Let Yourself Get Food Poisoned

## Want To Be More Productive? Let Yourself Get Food Poisoned

### And make it easy for yourself to quit.

You’re probably familiar with the concept of “letting go” (1). What does letting go do exactly? It just means letting go of something in your life that you don’t need anymore.

Here’s an article that, while being a bit theoretical, sheds some light on the concept.

### Why You Should Be As Productive As Possible

Let’s face it. We can’t muster the willpower (or even the ethical fibre) to engage in the seemingly impossible task of letting go.

In the words of the great [Ram Dass](https://www.ramdass.org/), “let’s do this together.”

The question is, how do we make the task as easy as possible for ourselves? How do we create the necessary conditions so that we can let go?

### Let’s Do This.

For each of the following seven weekdays, you should make a conscious effort to *let go*.

**1. By 7:30am you should be doing things you enjoy. **This includes relaxing, exploring, exploring new places, sharing experiences, clearing away, cleaning house, exercising, meditating, doing the dishes, eating, shopping, visiting a friend’s hometown, and de-cluttering your home. See this as a process for letting go.

**2. By 9am you should be asleep.** This includes not just falling asleep on your couch but taking all of your devices out of sight and your laptop out of mind. At this point you are probably operating at a relatively low level of consciousness, barely getting by
