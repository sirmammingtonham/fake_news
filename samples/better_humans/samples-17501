# A Simple Plan To Win The Year

## A Simple Plan To Win The Year

### For Ages 26 And Older. Or Younger.

There’s this pithy quote floating around the web that I really like:
> In school, you’re taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you’re given a test that teaches you a lesson.

The one thing I *don’t* like about it is that it makes it sound like you have to wait to be given the test either way. You don’t. You can decide to take your own test any day of the week and when you do, you’ll learn a lesson instantly.

At first, it seemed like such a great idea. Would using a test mean that I’m not taking the test anytime soon? Or would I defer the test indefinitely?

To test, I picked a Novice account and immediately regretted it. The reason given was the fear of failing the test and hanging my head against the desk. But I still owed it. So I was determined to never disappoint my newest charge.

I created the Novice plan and timed the meeting with the test. I inadvertently wrote down the whole thing in an email on the day it was supposed to be posted. Damn, that’s fast!

## What You Can Learn From People Who Imitated Classic Books

If you’ve ever borrowed a book, you can learn something from people who did the same thing. Especially if they had a similar goal or habit to the one in the book.

So, I tested a bunch of things.

* Jill Thompson, author of the *Here’s Jill Thompson’s latest book *Here’s Life: The Gifts of Giving*

* Tim Ferriss, author of the *Uncommon Gifts*

“I’m the book you don’t read. It’s a personal project, meant to be shared, not consumed. That’s okay. I’m not trying to force people to. Don’t worry, I’ve tried and failed.”

So, if you don’t have a goal clearly defined, how can you start to know what to do with it?

Thinking ahead is a great way to satisfy curiosity. But it’s a flawed way to understand the issue at hand.

I challenge you to use my framework, and let’s face it, I’m not going to lie to you. There are no easy-to-master principles. It’s just a framework to guide your creativity.

Below are my three pillars that provide your structure for your survival. By the end of this post, you’ll understand how to start, and how to master the road to your dream.

## Your Goal Isn’t the Issue

I know it sounds cheesy, but seriously, I don’t think that’s it. You don’t have to have a huge goal in mind to be successful. What I do is that I purposefully set mine so high up that it feels like an adventure.

It’s always nice to get creative, but I prefer to use my plan to build the actual adventure. At the end of the day, **I’m just on the edge of it.** If you’re genuinely interested in getting there, you’ll feel right at home in the success or failure of your project.

If failure happens suddenly, you won’t be surprised. And if success is a gradual process, you won’t feel like you’re doing much at all.

## LESSON 1: SHIT HAPPENS. GET OVER IT.

Please don’t get offended by taking the time to get things done. But if something happens, immediately apologize for that and move on. That’s usually the best way to learn that failure doesn’t have to be your enemy.

## LESSON 2. ITS OKAY TO SAY NO.

Nope. Forget the negative votes. This is just the price you have to pay to not just be successful, but *important.*

**Being prepared** means you don’t feel pressured to do what everyone else thinks is best for you. And besides
