 you for taking your first step. That’s one of the most valuable experiences you have in life. ‘Success is like a camera that has never been opened. Sometimes we will hear something, only to discover it wasn’t there.”

## How you can turn your camera into a journey tool

If you’d like to learn more about how to become the best version of your character and use your camera to conquer your fears, here are three articles you might enjoy.

## 1. A point of view from the other side

A [series](http://www.mckinsey.com/research/vision_center_online_comparison_series_hbr_view_point_a_videa_1/) of films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_33) exploring the lives of astronauts and the human experience that takes them to another world. One of the heroes of the series is played by [Tony Curtis](https://berniew.jpl.nasa.gov/~dancenvs). In addition to being an amazing actor, Tony is a huge sci-fi fan and writes sci-fi adventures for a living. He also happens to be an incredibly articulate, likable person. [Tony writes for himself and[ appears on the final episode of the series](http://www.mckinsey.com/research/vision_century_ii_spy_jr_tony_curtis.html).

We first met Tony as he was walking out of a café. We asked him what his favorite breakfast was, he said “Mick’s Eggs.”. He also loved M&M’s and was loving his coffee (a roasted Arabica coffee, triple-blended) and the banter with his companion, the polite gentleman who stopped by just to check out. He told us about his travels. Here’s what he told us, [in his own words](http://mattdavidson.com/2012/03/19/what-makes-a-polite-gentleman-and-why-i-endured-7-months-of-cucumber-sauce-and-just-rolled-to-my-job-2-grades-in-the-mountain-high-hills-of-columbus-cantina-the-restaurant-still-be-open-the-restaurant-is-still-open-too-would-i-use-a.html):
> As a kid growing up in Manhattan, I was a big fan of the [Cup & Noodle House](http://www.thecupandnoodlehouse.com/) where you could sit on a warm brown leather seat, eat a large ceramic bowl of soup and listen to the New York Philharmonic. I was always wanting a true experience of that. I loved the ambience of the room and the conversations across the table.

I don’t remember the name of the hostel, it’s not on the menu, but I assume it was a Holiday Inn or a Comfort Inn. I walked in with a group of friends. We sat at a gorgeous mahogany counter in the lobby. They set up booth after booth of brightly colored booths. I didn’t recognize any of them. They pointed outside and my friend pointed behind them. We both froze. I walked back outside and my friend was gone. I couldn’t believe she had left me behind.

I walked to a little corner of the lobby, in the middle of the street. I saw a silver Honda CR-V moving down the sidewalk. I stopped my car and gave it a concerned glance. It’s a new concept — a cross-over to another car? — but I didn’t really see how it’d work. Then I remembered — I need to take this! There was some money on the seat. Maybe she had made a special payment to the Hostel.

*My brain instantly’ linked the two cars. I think it’s because of my car’s electrical system. The seat is wired to the car’s electrical system. If you plug in, it sends a signal through the chain of alarms to turn the car on.

**One-way tickets are cheap.**

**Even a one-way ticket? How much money?**

Oh my god, my god, this car must be so expensive! How did I not notice this!*

It’s like magic, really. The car’s in perfect working order; no wires. Every bolt is locked in place. I see my new car like this every day.
