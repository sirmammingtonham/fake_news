# If you can handle a drink, you can handle a life

## If you can handle a drink, you can handle a life

### If you like drinking games, you will be able to handle a life

They say, “Don’t drink until you’ve had a few too many drinks.” And while certainly you can “undo what you’ve done” by going back to your game, it is *not* an obligation to drink.

It is an internal commitment to never drink alcohol again. This is a commitment to not get sucked into preoccupations about alcoholics, chronic alcoholics, and the like. This is a commitment to self-determination and independence.

Self-determination and independence are not the same as admitting defeat.

A common misperception is that being intoxicated makes one stupid and incapable of making decisions. Well, DUIs are not an invitation to be indecisive. It is a warning that we’re about to make a choice that will result in danger or embarrassment.

What’s more, *any decision that results in danger will be reversible*. If you decide to abstain from drinking once you’ve dealt with the emotional, physical and psychological effects, you will learn how to make that choice later.

Sounds boring, doesn’t it?

Well, it is to some degree, but let’s not confuse the word “blundering” with admitting defeat.

Honestly, I’m not totally sure I [read](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-read-more-books/), but if I were to summarize what I read as a sequence of brain dumps, I’d simply describe it as “watching the sun go down under the bed at night.”

Brainwaves.

There are a number of brainwaves associated with different aspects of self-determination. What follows are descriptions of these brainwaves, which can be helpful when discussing the details of each variant of self-determination.

**A.T.**

* Attention — We’ve all experienced this thought that our conscious thoughts are going to affect the outcome of events in some fundamental way. Budgets are affected, ideas come to fruition and dreams become a reality. Keep this option on for now, but pivot to a less important brainwave during times when attention is required.

* Awareness — We all have this thought that only after doing yoga or taking a nap can we appreciate the magnitude and the reality of what we’re about to do. Naps cause immediate brainwave changes that can elevate and contrast with the surroundings. Thus, it’s easier to focus on the objective that needs to be accomplished rather than reacting to the environmental demands.

* Presence — We all have this thought that unless we’re in a state of flow, there isn’t much purpose to our existence. When we are in a state of flow our brains are simple and our minds are in a state of deep focus. It’s said that if your mind is clear, you are no longer think about what to say, but about what to *do*. *Think*.

* Knowledge — We all have this thought that because we don’t know the first thing about something, we assume it’s alright to just do it. When in reality, there is some trepidation, some doubt and a fair bit of apprehension. We need to be *handled* by those who know — and who won’t shirk responsibility.

* Experience — We all have this thought that because we haven’t experienced it, it must be *bad*. It’s a negative frame of reference that prevents us from being constructive or accepting of new ideas. We need to be more self-aware of what we’re trying to achieve and how we might fall short.

There are endless examples of what successful people do and how they got it.

From Abraham Maslow to Steve Jobs to Tony Robbins to David Allen to David Blaine to Tim Ferris — everyone who gets up every morning has a morning ritual which includes some sort of induction.

Have you ever been mindful as your idea was being debated before it was announced? Were those moments of awe and fascination you witnessed?

If so, there’s a good reason for that. Those moments were not just the highlights of your morning. They define the rest of your day for when you actually wake up.

Your morning ritual is a testimony to your mental state on waking.

Now as you begin your day — a physical representation of what your brain is doing.
