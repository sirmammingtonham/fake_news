======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 A whole lot of new things will start to happen.

Do not live in the present moment, but later.
The past is never behind you, no matter what moment you are in.

Just because you were born in the 80s, doesn’t mean your future is headed in the same direction.

The past is not behind you, your future is out there, and the future is yet to come.

The only thing you can take for granted is the time in this world, and the ability to wait for the next one.

Don’t buy past due dates, don’t set immovable reminders, and don’t think of your future self as a screen door.

As much as we want to control our time, we are far more concerned with how we spend it.

If we understand how to manage our time, we can be prepared for the many conflicts that arise out of wanting more things done simultaneously.

Our brains are strongest when we’re tired from long hours, in environments that make us work for free, or have relied too much on the machines in the past.

In a world of constant change, managing our time is far easier than it is for us to maintain the flow of events in our heads.

Our lives are full of passing thoughts, but little to no self awareness. We may be aware of the times when we have time to use our time better, but in that moment we’re focused on what’s immediately in front of us.

With that mindset, it’s easy to get carried away with projects and deadlines that are quickly becoming – difficult – second nature.

In reality, you can have more important things than your time. Time is what gives us meaning and purpose. It’s also flowered nicely through my past relationships with my parents, who have both been phenomenal role models for me. I owe a lot to them, not least of which is the time I spent away from them in a bubble, far away from any distractions, and far more importantly, I don’t even have to think about them anymore.

# How I avoided a successful career in Silicon Valley

## How I avoided a successful career in Silicon Valley

In 2004, the age of twenty-one, I set out to create a career in the computing industry. In five years, I had built something that I thought was revolutionary: [a searchable knowledge database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchable_knowledge_database) that allowed anyone to search vast swaths of the Web for any piece of information.

With the help of a few hundred thousand hits, I knew I had something special going on. I called it [The Information Self-Driving System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Self-Driving_System) and it was my single greatest success yet.

The first time I used the system was to create a short film about the ins and outs of personal development. It was a fun, tongue-in-cheek way of saying, “What do I have to do to get ahead in life?”. A Google search brought up some videos about Tom Cruise, in which he would demonstrate various self-driving car concepts. I found the videos of Cruise in the US and thought, “That’s cool. I bet he’s driving a self-driving car somewhere.”

Soon after that, I got another idea. I could have the system search through my knowledge base, and if it found something I hadn’t posted yet, it would suggest I create a “notebook” section about that topic. At the same time, the system reminded me of the richness of my knowledge base. As I entered my thirties, it was already becoming easier to archive important pieces of information. As an example, I had a personal website with book summaries for many subjects, and it was easy to build a notebook around topics I wanted to teach.

A few years after I’ve posted these notes, the system reminded me of what an information sponge I had become. If I can help people by answering a few questions, that’s one more step closer to being an expert.

## The Ultimate Multitasking Profiler

The system also keeps track of my email inbox, which has always been a problem. With too much email, the whole system got clogged. To get rid of the unnecessary emails, I had to [pull all my emails out of my inbox](http://careerchoice.com/take-15-the-retirement-market-view-pseudonymously-naturally-selected-201306.html).
