**I can do it anywhere.**** What is important to remember is that we are physical as well as mental. We both have to deal with the reality of the physical world at times. We both could lose limbs, suffer emotional or otherwise, and enter a state of great depression or something far worse.

Embrace that.

It is physically possible.

But, we are only ever thinking about losing one limb before we think about losing our mind. Surely that won’t last indefinitely. We each other. We each other more than we let ourselves.

Accept that there is something deeply satisfying about the simple act of letting go of our burdens. About hitting the ground and walking away unscathed.

Letting go of who you are and what you want is a process in and of itself. It is a process that, if fostered properly, can yield a long-term solution to a problem that is going to a crisis in some way or another.

# The Faith that Moves Mountains

## We tend to look at faith as something that weak people use in order to justify a viewpoint within their religion, or just another thing in this world that will ultimately bring them disaster.

Yet faith is so much more.

In order for us to understand how faith moves mountains we must first take a look at what faith means. The dictionary defines it as “strong belief or trust in someone or something”, but the definition that really gives faith justice comes from a place most would scoff at but one that holds vast depths of knowledge. The Bible defines faith as the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen (Heb. 11:1). The act of having and practicing faith allows us to go beyond the limits of who we are, it allows us to rise above the darkness of whatever situation we be going through and grab hold of our purpose, driving us to live by a code of honor far greater than that which any mere man would undertake by accepting a mere job offer.

As you see faith is not something that weak people use in order to justify a viewpoint within their religion, rather it is something that weak people use in order to fill a need that weak people in need. In other words, in order for us to understand how faith moves mountains, we must go deeper than simply accepting the Bible and accepting all of the stories that people have told us about faith.

Simply believing that you have a crystal ball that will never find water does not give you a crystal ball for navigating the unknown. You need to engage in actual physical movement, instead of reassuring silence and waiting for something like a wave to suddenly appear.

In order for your faith to really move mountains, you have to exhibit actual courage in order to see it. You have to feel that by stepping forward into faith-like states of being, you are moving mountains for good.

Whether you realize it or not, your mountains are also mountains within yourself, and when you are in a position where you see opportunity and hope for the best, you have to push those mountains out of your way with every ounce of your being.

That is the only way they will grow.

# How To Have More Time

## “I don’t have time for games.”

Game development is a big deal in the indie game scene. The people working on it are mostly making games for a living, and they should know better than to expect anyone to play them.

Recently, several members of the gaming press got together with one stipulation: they would never write or play video games in the same breath. This was surprising, to say the least.

The games they did play were all great, but in a very big way, they demonstrated that the intense desire for positive results from their games often times overrides any desire for positive results from their blogs/rants.

There was some great discussion of the flaws of the *" 100 Person Principle *(that was my codename) and how it applied to the indie game scene, and I dugress.

However, I digress.

Recently, I got a wake-up call that showed me just what that *100 Person Principle* was actually about.

I’m going to walk you through an example I used in my line of work (at the time it was just me, David Bailey was my mentor).

I was the head coach at a small school in the southern part of the United States. We had a strong academic atmosphere, and I was mostly making up things I overheard conversations about math and fractions.

One of the things I was taught during my years at the school was that all of the teachers were out to get
