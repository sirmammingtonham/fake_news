 emotional and a work-a hard schedule like a car assemblyman.

I know you’re saying to yourself: “That’s too bad, Ron. Too bad.”

You’re wrong.

Getting organized and checking off an assignment is good news. It signifies that you *are* continuing to make progress towards your goals. It also demonstrates to others around you that you *are* taking action towards your goals.

**It’s also a great way to face off against [the tendency](http://www.selfication.com/the-small-dissent/) to act impulsively.**

If you’re born with ambiguous gender identity, there’s a good chance you’ll develop your own unique opinions and become a unique personality.

Now, though, that’s not a bad thing.

The ability to play either "straight" or “gay” has no effect on the achievement or enjoyment of any kind of programming.

If you enjoy original programming and you identify with that, there’s no reason why you can’t also do collaborative and text-based programming.

Gender-neutral language and imagery have a huge effect on the quality of life experienced by all gender identities.

It’s not a coincidence that the [highest performing quadrant](http://www.cnn.com/oettingen/practice_math/transgender_identity.html) is also the most feminized body of work.

## **So who’s at the other end of the rainbow?**

As a freelancer with no time to lose, I was curious to see which gender you work for.

*I’m not suggesting you get married and have children of such and such. But if you’re 21–30 years old — or anywhere in that age range — you should be able to sit down and say: *“I’m willing to compromise my principles, but only in certain areas.”*

*That’s exactly what some of my clients advised me — that I should [start slow](http://www.selfication.com/AKA/consistency/) and [smile at yourself](http://www.selfication.com/issuing-fear-karma/).

*Instead of saying “I’m sorry, my principle” just say: *“I’m confident I’ve recently completed my activities. Now I’m just waiting for you to let me know how I’ve done so.”*
