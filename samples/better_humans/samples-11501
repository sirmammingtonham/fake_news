## The Power of “I’ Am”

This concept of “I am” was first articulated by the late Albert Einstein in his book Meinong,”[3](http://www.amazon.com/Meinong-Career-Back-to-Articulating-Creativity/dp/0399176136/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400930439&sr=8-1&keywords=I+AM%3A140021339)!

Throughout his life, Einstein dedicated significant time and effort to developing this idea. It is believed that he started his day by writing his journal every day.

Next, he collected his journal daily for a total of nine months. Here’s what he said about writing for a while:
> “Inner Critic: I find difficulty in getting started. My mind jumps all of the time from sentence to sentence.”

Einstein went on to explain that in order for a new idea to have merit, there needs to be a sufficient number of participants in the execution. Only then will the project be realized.

At this point, if you are sitting on your couch doing nothing, there isn’t much point in practicing unless you are actively moving towards, and not dissolving in the process.

## 4. Practice Vivid Emotions

Visualize or internallyologue your feelings. Are you sad about something? See yourself reflected in the mirror for a split second. Is your mouth dry? You can see your thoughts through your eyes. Sometimes we don’t even realize we are feeling that way.

Sometimes we will jump into a rage because we don’t like the idea of being reticent or something negative. But the more active and involved in the project, the better the mood will get.

## 5. Let Go and Get Creative

While you are executing your morning routine, you are also doing a lot of other things. So, it is very likely that some other tasks will get done as well. Externally, we get anxious when faced with new, unforeseen challenges.

So, in [**these times](http://www.selfication.com/you-are-not-asking-too-big-of-the-quest-why-can-we-be-so-concerned-about-asking-too-big-of-the-quest)**, it is vital to develop a way out, so to not let the impasse create the crisis.

Here are some of my favorite ways to clear my energy and bring a creative mind to bear on an issue that concerns me deeply:

## 1. Do not be afraid to switch things up.

When I first started waking up early, I’d wake up every morning, scrambled breakfast burritos, and a cappuccino. The only thing I had on tap was breakfast burritos, which were already getting hard to make because there were so many other things on my plate.

Things to do:

*Wake up and drink a glass of water, while maintaining a consistent schedule.

*Cut out or cut back on the coffee.

*Limit the number of times we can each wake up.

*Plan out ahead – I had gotten used to 9am meetings, but I could hardly get out of bed. I began rolling three times a day.

*Breakfast burritos with my kids (I made a simple dish of grilled chicken and beef, and it was good enough for two of us),*

*Fill my belly with oysters (I grew up eating them),*

*Cook a bigger pot of lentils = I had leftover beans from my black bean burrito.

*Plan ahead – I did not want to overwhelm you, but since I was a weekday, I didn’t feel rushed. I felt relaxed and prepared.

## 2. Start ahead of time.

This is useful when you are in a funk, and the beginning of your day drags on. By putting coffee in advance, it helped me to taper off the intensity of my burn.

### Food – Drinks

*Tea and coffee were the most popular drinks during my three-day meditation retreat.*

*Both drinks energize and relieve stress, and both drinks also provided a quick hit of energy without the buzz of caffeine.

*The first tea cleared my mind abruptly, but rather than struggling to get it, I realized I was more than ready to leave the retreat.

*Since I had planned to workout, I decided to take a light lunch rather than a full meal. This gave me more energy without
