## Step # 5: Get crystal clear and specific

Before you write in your journal, ask yourself, “What would a 10-minute journal really look like?”

Don’t just sketch ideas or put words in your mouth.

Ask yourself what you want to say in your journal.

For example: I want to talk about…

* The importance of self-care or self-improvement in general

* The challenges I’ve had to deal with as a freelancer and (in my personal opinion) how finding clients was a key to my success

* The value I can add to my community, or company

* What collaborations I’ve had (webinar for example)

## What is your Ideal Day/Hour?

* What are you passionate about doing?

* What are you eager to learn about others in your network?

### Trace your dream in glass

After you have collected all the information below, it is time to put everything together and enjoy writing what you do.

**It is not easy to write in one go, but it is easy to do it.**

Happy Journaling!

**This is how I tracked my progress.**
