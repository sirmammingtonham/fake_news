## To be Honest and Not Lazy

### “Don’t be like Joe, you’re always wrong”

Have you ever noticed how other people are always so quick to tell you how *you’re** ‘smart, handsome or a good boy’ when you look so stupid? (I’ve never personally seen this, but if you’re making jokes/offering advice it could happen.) But their only point of view is theirs and theirs only, they will tell you to stay calm, you look so sad. You’ll never be heard from again, no matter the amount of awful that you do.

And here’s the funny part: **they’re the same ones that tell you how amazing you look. Or tell you how you could do a lot worse than ‘get a job, be a ‘professional, have children, fly through the air to the office, do your work, puttan’, and so on, until you’re so good that people want to [hold your hand](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108574/).**

They are the ones that tell you your life can ‘be so much better than this, you could’t do anything but live it up to their standards. And when they’re right, you’ll feel so much better, you might even *act better*.

But, the real problem with these people is that **when they’re wrong, they make you feel worse, not better. Because when you’re right they make you feel great and worse, you know that you’re being lied to.**

So, **while you’re feeling really, really bad about yourself, you know what you’re going to do? **You’ll do something about it right now, you’ll do something about it tomorrow.**

And that’s the real difference between you and the people who know how good you *really* are.

**You’ve got this great potential that no one could ever [take you]down – so you’ll do anything to feel better **– because you’re doing it for their entertainment**.**

**Or more specifically, you’ve got this great potential they know you do not have. And neither do they.**
