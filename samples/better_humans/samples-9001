 going. This is why you need to be able to leave your body and feel – let go of whatever it is you’re doing and feel how it feels.

That’s what allows you to get into a flow state by taking a deep breath and letting go of all that.

Now, before moving on to your next project, I highly recommend you try the “let go of everything” approach. It’s the only way I’ve found to get comfortable with letting go of my internal and external expectations at the same time.

I’ve tried a number of different approaches over the years. I’ve tried entirely different meditation and yoga techniques. I’ve tried cognitive behavioral therapy, personal enhancement programs, role-playing games, and step-by-step deconstruction of complex systems.

None of them took me seriously as I believed they were all just ways to get more done.

The one thing that all of them have in common is that they actually worked.*

Some of them actually became a part of my life, some of them were successful and made a lasting impact on my life.

But, **nothing in between.**

I became the very thing I hated by trying different approaches.** And I still get annoyed by how long it took me to get to this point.

## When I had to say no, no one wanted to be left behind.

My mom used to say, “if it’s not me, it’s someone else”. And I always knew I was special. Whenever someone asked me why, I’d always say, “special.”

But after doing so much research into who I was, I realized something else.

I was leaving so much behind to both myself and eventually others that I felt like I was abandoned.

Not so much by myself, but from both a personal standpoint.

Looking at the list above, there are a tremendous number of people who have gone through something similar.

That’s not to say that those situations are not *normal*. It’s just that — in theory — if you have the right motivations and the skills to reach your goals, you should be able to overcome them.

But in the wild, all the patterns I observed and recreated in my head wouldn’t have me feel so fulfilled.

### The path you take to get where you want to go

The three patterns I observed are very clear and direct paths. But there’s a catch.

**You have to take a detour.**

Before you can take that detour, you need to know where it is.

If you keep going on the same path, eventually it will become a drag.

There will be days when you feel so much pain you can’t even stand up. When your goals are as big as your intentions.

At some point, you will trip and lose control of your momentum. When you can’t stop moving forward.

The cool part about these problems is that they don’t discriminate.

When you come to a junction, you can either continue straight ahead, or you can have a 180-degree turn.

Here’s what happens once you cross the fourth wall.

First, you’re trying to get as far away from the wall as you can.

Second, you have to trust that the person you’re talking to will not cross the fourth wall.

And third, you have to make sure they’re not someone you know.

**Because you don’t know.**

One of the most common questions I get is, **“so what? I don’t know you.”**

A safe gut response is probably going to be, **“I don’t know you.”**

But a truly terrible idea is also always better than a reasonably good one.
