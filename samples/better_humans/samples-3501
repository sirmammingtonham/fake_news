ieve ‘[Dangerous](http://www.dangerousart.com/)’, a collection of geometric, tapestry-like artworks created specifically to provoke thought through fear and uncertainty. Using video games, they provide an immersive experience and provocation for moving our physical body and our thoughts into the realm of the provocative. The artworks explore all the disconnectedness and strange landscapes that often go unspoken, and provoke a feeling of being *there*.

As an undergrad, my fascination with ‘bordering on surreal’ evolved into something more meaningful — exploring the tensions and seeming contradictions of the human experience in all its horrifying complexity. Ultimately, it led to the birth and discovery of [Concrete4Design](http://concrete4design.com/). I owe much of my artistic and conceptual development to this curiosity, and to my gradual learning to accept and deal with fear and uncertainty.

Throughout all this, the important thing has been that I not only let go of the fears and loathing for authority’s black sheep, but also with the gift of letting go. Of course, I won’t ever be able to rid myself of all fears, but that doesn’t mean I should beat myself up over and over again for not letting go. Often times, the path to letting go is as easy as letting go, and getting back to what matters.

To get there: Take care of your feelings, and let go. Become more aware of the beautiful-but-unfortunate occasions when you won’t always be able to enjoy the same opportunities, or be pushed to the sidelines because you don’t have the energy to protect yourself. Remember: It doesn’t have to be ugly, and it doesn’t have to be public knowledge. It may just take a little courage to bare your fears and grow into the moment.

## How To Become A Pro-Fitness Expert In Just 3-Minutes

### Become a pro-fitness expert in 3 simple steps

You should never give up on your goals.

We can never predict the future. You never know where your next step might be.

But you also never know when it might be.

With or without exercise, we lose 12 weeks of our life. We also lose muscle mass, which accounts for 15% of our total body weight, and we lose bone density, another 20% of our body weight.

All these changes come from increased bone mineral density, optimal bone health, and fewer bone fractures.

And, of course, exercise improves our general health and happiness.

So, what can we do to take control of these amazing gains?

## 1. Research the sources of your energy

We all seem to have an internal power struggle that tries to get hold of our *Willpower *the way we like it.

Research into the sources of our power seems to show there are three main groups —

1. The Power Generation Group

This struggle is centered in the prefrontal cortex, in the back of our minds, and happens when we are under stress or anxious.

1. The Power Performance Group

This struggle is also commonly referred to as the core group and is responsible for our overall health and well-being.

1. The Health and Relationships Group

This struggle is most often experienced by a father and his kid. It affects both parents equally.

The critical factor in this group is how stress
