“I think at first it was pretty funny—”

“But after a while, it just got real.”

We laughed a little harder each time we remembered that last night, but we still haven’t left Cumming and Bellamy, Colorado. We love them both, and we won’t soon forget their road.

“You guys remember Cumming. He’s a big time drinker. You remember Bellamy. He’s a small time drinker. You remember Ugg. They’re inseparable.”

“Hell yeah!”

We were laughing so hard we even laughed out loud.

“Well, you know what I mean? Those guys were saying, ‘Hey, look who’s in.’ Those guys were saying, ‘Hey, look who’s wearing what.’ Those guys were saying, ‘Hey, look who’s hot.’ Those guys were saying, ‘Hey, look who’s hot!’

Cool. Cool.

We’ve been collecting these instructions for over three years, and probably much shorter if you add those two pieces together. They are **examples of what you could do**, based on real life.

**And they can be used to declutter your life too.**

Here are three of my favorites:

### #1. Create a ‘do not fit in’ list

This one is a little tricky, since we don’t want to fill in all the blanks in our life chart with all the untapped potentialities that are out there.

Basically, **fill in the blanks as best you can.**

So, **this list is a good place to start.**

What do you need to do, in order to **fill in the blanks as best you can**? Basically, **pick one thing you want to eliminate from your life and call it your *New Self*.**

If you can see a bell curve on the graph, or feel free to skip this step, you can skip to #2.

## #2. Identify your ideal lifestyle

At this point, you may be wondering how one gets from Point A to Point B when there could be anywhere from two to five possible outcomes.

## #1. Set goals that are achievable, but not at all realistic

If you can see any bell curve in the graph, it’s probably the ones you set for yourself. If you know exactly what you want for yourself, it will be more inspiring to [someones](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-connect-with-others/), while not imposing your will on the world.

Set realistic goals that are achievable, but not at all realistic. For example: I want to lose weight. I know I can’t lose weight, but I want to eat better, sleep better and feel better.

Set your resolutions with a [comparison](http://www.selfication.com/the-metrics-behind-your-success/), to help you evaluate how close you are to achieving your goal vs. how far you are in the process.

## #2. Set goals that are mutually exclusive
