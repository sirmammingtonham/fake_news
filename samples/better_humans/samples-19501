 motivated and persistent

I’m always up for a conversation, sitting next to a cool new friend

Who’s constantly telling me how beautiful and successful I’m

Perfectionism gets a bad rap because everyone knows how it feels to be confident when you’re in the zone

But **I’ve never been confident in myself**.

I’m curvy, flat-bodied, years my head was spinning.

I’m wearing a crisp, white, high-top dress? Classic.

I’m standing in line for the doughnut shop KFC? RYM?

I’m not a masochist, I don’t like working long hours and I don’t want to compromise my health in a kaizen way (what the [blewfinding lab](http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/08/opinion/career-health-fact-sheet-be-awesome-for-2011-10-18/career-health-fact-sheet-be-awesome-for-2011-10-18/career-health-fact-sheet-be-awesome-for-2011-10-18/) would have you believe.)

**I work in the service and industry, which is why I get asked these kinds of questions all the time.**

And the bottom line is, based on my experience and the data above, I’m going to build confidence in saying “Yes” to getting things done.

Because you want real results. Real results that stick.

And as long as those columns are all positive, I’m going to keep saying “Yes” to steps outside my comfort zone.

Because I’m never going to get discouraged.

I’m never going to be satisfied.

I’m never going to be changed.

Results are more important than how good they are.

Real results are why we need to focus on the science, not the emotion.

We need to get science out of your head.

And that means we need to start being emotionally equipped to make intelligent decisions.

Because only when we become emotionally equipped can we have the potential to create and leverage every possible asset to our advantage.

Find out how to do that now.

​I’m not here to tell you, “It’s ok, you’ll figure it out one day,” or “where you are is exactly where you’re meant to be”.

But if you’re here to ask “What do you want to be when you grow up?” or “What do you want to do when you’re older?” I think you’ll find a lot of answers there.

After all, no matter how well we try to be, most things just don’t work out.

One of my friend gave me a link to a blog post he wrote about how he prepared for his son’s upcoming test drive. He figured
