It would go on to become the most viewed TED talk ever.

## **5. Use a Programmable Keyboard**

This is a crazy, but important tip.

When giving a talk, it is usually a good idea to minimize the number of keyboard shortcuts you use.

The reason is that it’s harder to remember which keys you use when you’re using them.

So, unless you’re already familiar with the layout of your keyboard, you’ll want to make sure you memorize it.

Just using the arrow keys to navigate would be better than relying on the arrow keys alone.

One big problem I see with this approach is that it makes it difficult to know where you are relative to other people.

If you start to feel too much pressure to remember every word and every sequence of events, you might forget what you are actually saying.

Meeting up with other people will solve this problem.

They are interested in your answer. Since you can tell they are curious, you’ll feel more qualified to speak up.

### **6. Speak up without relying on the audience**

People who speak up for one reason or another will feel very nervous.

It’s hard to say you’re nervous just by feeling like that you could say something wrong.

So, don’t hold back. Speak up even if you are the one being asked a question.

Even if you just casually speak for one minute, make sure you get a lot of responses.

You’ll feel incredible if you can get a solid 30 to 60 minutes of uninterrupted speaking.

### **7. Use a voice catcher!**

One of the most effective voices for capturing your point of view is your own.

Raúl Baz Suárez*“What I’ve realized is that we humans are beautifully flawed.”*

Indeed, we are flawed even more than our animals are.

I don’t suggest throwing yourself to the wolves here.

If you want to help others, be them. Be them.

However, if you’re going to be serving as your own, you need to know how to do it.

That’s what this post is really all about:

## How to Figure Out What to Do

In their book, The Happiness Hypothesis: Achieving Your Dream (3), psychologist Daniel Gilbert explores the idea of “true happiness” quite another way:

His conclusion:

To be truly happy, you need to enjoy what you do — to be fully happy, you need to enjoy what you love.

### **Enjoy what you do, because it’ll make you happier**

If you’re going to be having fun, you need to do it on a larger scale than just once.

You need to enjoy what you do, because it’ll make you happier.

It’s important to find something that you love doing, and to feel rewarded for your efforts.

### **Enjoy what you do, so much that you’ll actually LEARN to love it**

If you’re going to be constantly pursuing your goals, you’ll want to put some thought into how you’re doing getting there.

What’s the next big thing you’re going to be working on?

What is your ideal situation where you’re going to be happy?

What are some things that make you happy?

Think about those things, and do something to alleviate that state of mind.

### **Actionable Advice**

In addition to the things you can work on, you’ll want to work on is what you’re given.

If you're given a car, for example, how would you re-engineer it for public use? How would you make it fully self-supporting and useful?

We’re also going to need to work on things like training and equipment.

Anything you’re given can be worked on, but ideally you’ll want to make it so that you can take it on a trip or to go somewhere with just you and your camera.

### **Where to Get Your Ideas Out**

Once you have a solid plan, the next step is to organize your ideas.

What are some of the cool ideas you’re going to be working on?
