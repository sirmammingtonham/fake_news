 sure my efforts were worthwhile.

The next time you’re debugging a app, however, I highly recommend you turn on continuous notifications. Just entering the app and seeing what’s happening will really help put you in the right mindset. You might find yourself waking up in the middle of the night, frustrated and stuck, even though you have all the app’s most of the time.

Next time you want to wake up early, try waking up at different times throughout the day. Remember, we are wired to set very high standards. If you want to be amazing, be the most amazing human being that you can.

### Become the most responsible adult you can

As you take massive action, you’ll begin to question everything you thought you know about yourself. [We are incredibly lucky](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/2511316) to have parents, more like the artists we’re meant to be. If you’re lucky to have older siblings, it can be very difficult to be self-reliant as you grow up. If you don’t have any in your lives to guide you, it’s very hard to know what to do.

For example, in high school I was really serious about not bothering anyone, no matter how funny or awesome. I was very serious about not sneaking off the couch and putting on my pants. And I was totally serious about not using the bathroom.

Despite all of this, I was never *too* serious about how I’d eventually turn my awesome into my terrible nightmare.

I did, however, start becoming more and more serious about the things I wanted to do with my life. Including being serious about meeting people.

**Realistic and long term.** Some things will always remain within my control. No matter what.

I’ve been seriously considering going back to school for a degree for awhile. I’ve even applied to get a Bachelor’s degree myself. But no matter how hard I’d try, I just couldn’t get into school. I just couldn’t pass the class. And I knew if I failed, there would be no rest for me in this class. That’s why I decided to go after an industry cert as a pre-requisite instead.

You know what I’ve found?

90% of students pass this exam. Of those who don’t fail, 80% succeed.

What’s more, you don’t need a Bachelor’s degree to get into this. You can get a basic certification from your local certifying agency, for example, [www.simulationvision.com](http://www.simulationvision.com).

The question is, how much success can you expect from your first dozen or so attempts?

And how can you repeat the success?

Let’s consider how you can improve the process going forward.

## Implement the Saiyuan formula

The Saiyuan formula is the idea that “simulation can help us learn.” It’s named this because Chinese scholars used to endlessly discuss its meaning and produce nothing meaningful.

The formula consists of three parts:

1. The theory,

1. The formula, and

1. The results.

Let’s look at the first two.

## The Theory

The theory goes that there is an underlying level of conceptual understanding, which is superior to our conscious thinking. This allows us to manipulate our thoughts and actions more easily.

We’re conscious, but our thoughts about ourselves aren’t. We can’t see or feel our own heartbeat, for example.

The conscious mind is superior to our subconscious mind for two main reasons:
> # 1. We’re more organized,
> # 2. We can more easily control our thoughts.

Here’s how it works.

1. You have an idea.

2. You create an object or solution to your idea.

1. You then communicate your idea to 10 people.

1. They then decide to experiment with your idea.

It’s a brain... a brain is different from a rational or rational mind. It’s a programming language. Your 10 ideas are then become your 3 tasks #1 and your 3 tasks #2 are then your 3 tasks #1 and #2 respectively.
