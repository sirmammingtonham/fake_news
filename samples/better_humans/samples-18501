 way when all you have is one idea, or even very few ideas, for that matter.

It’s better to confront your fear with evidence, not words.

Of course, once your started to piece together parts of your idea, you could start to get really creative with the repetition of phrases from the previous scene, like “-2-1.”

Although it’s debatable whether 2+1 is a more accurate way to express it, I like to simplify it by replacing the noun case of the first idea with “–2.”

Once you have recreated the ‘what’ of your fear, the only question you have to worry about is “how many ideas you can think of that perfectly complete the picture?”

By allowing yourself to consistently stretch your limits throughout the day, you’ll push your limits and adapt to the new sensations — just don’t push yourself to your limits.

## 3. Wake up at the right time.

If you don’t get up in the morning, your whole day is a mess. You’re reminding everyone of your stress and interruptions. At the end of the day, you’re reminding everyone of your time and again.

It’s not a good idea to try to fix yourself by knocking on everyone’s door at the same time. While that might work for some people, it’s not a good idea for everyone else. Yes, it’s tempting to say, “*Just one more thing I gotta do before I can do anything else?” *But that’s not a good answer.

When you say “one more thing I gotta do before I can do anything else,” you’re actually saying two things. First, you’re reminding everyone that you need to do a lot of things before you actually start to do them. Second, you’re reminding everyone that you’re *asking* them to pay for something they don’t need to do.

It’s good to feel like you’re doing extra credit for the fact that you’re taking time off from childcare, but that’s not the only thing you’re doing.

## 4. Don’t talk about yourself by name.

Nobody wants to hear about themselves, but that doesn’t mean they have to be positive.

Talk about yourself how you want to be perceived, how you want to be appreciated, and lastly, how you want to be helpful, compassionate, and helpful.

This type of thinking is unique to you and your specific situation, but the principles are the same for everyone else — and there’s nothing wrong with that approach if you want to improve your particular social media or email setup, or whatever position in life you’re trying to fill.

Just remember, you’re filling a really big void and there’s a guy sitting right next to you who’s going to start telling you how awesome he/she is. Just because you “believe” that guy doesn’t mean you’re right or even that he’s even human.

All that matters now is that you fill it with the right people, and the sooner you’ve filled that role, the better your team will be.

That’s my message to you: Next time you have to say “Who?,” or “Where?” speak English right now and do not be defined by your accent.

# Lean for Good, Lose the Apple

## Lean for Good, Lose the Apple

### Exactly what is ↩ good lean?

A lot of people lean hard in terms of health and food security. But is it true that lean means eating a lot of low-quality, high-caloric food right next to your couch?

## Lean means meeting people where they are, rather than where you’re.

This sounds like a good idea for both health and food security. What are the chances that you’ll be meeting a person who is struggling with a cold or flu on a routine basis?

### Or, conversely, what are the chances that you’ll be meeting someone who will be helping you push through the resistance and get to the gym, and then running your errands around town.

### Or, conversely, what are the chances that you’ll be spending the evening talking to your CSA or First Amendment attorney.

### Good’s Badness
