### I’m Not A Salesperson… I’m A Salesperson

There is this idea that we should focus more on focusing on what’s important. Or, at least, make sure that your second and third thoughts go toward what’s important.

It’s tempting, isn’t it? To take shortcuts and shallow thinking that leads to superficial and meaningless thinking. We need to be so busy looking for meaning and meaning in everything that we never stop adding and doing work in whatever field we happen to be in.

But that doesn’t mean that we neglect what matters.

The work in that field may not be fun and easy to understand at first, but as we progress we may find meaning and meaning in all sorts of fields: marketing, architecture, interior design, personal development, production design, marketing, music, and of course, game design.

If we miss something and do nothing else, we might miss something and be nothing other than a scrub who does whatever they want with their time.

What matters most is that we give it meaning and attention. If we miss something and try again, we might miss something and be nothing other than a scrub who does whatever they want with their time.

## How To Do That

The first step to doing anything is to ask yourself what kind of work you can do. Once you have that list of what kind of work you can do, you need to decide what kind of person you are. You identify yourself and your role in the world.

Then, you decide what kind of person you want to be. If you are a player, you also need to identify yourself and your role in the world. Know who you are, and what you are capable of.

And finally, you choose yourself.

### Do It Right, And Sometimes Forget What You’re Accomplished

You do this process because success requires you to constantly improve yourself. To make smart choices, you need to be realistic about your own abilities.

In my case, I decided that I wanted a different type of personal finance: equity crowdfunding. I figured that out some time ago, and used that time to [develop an example for why equity crowdfunding is the right way to go about implementing your own ideas](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-start-your-own-investment-pact-f85cc7b36e62).

Other people may have different ideas about how to finance their personal lifestyle. But what are you willing to give up, in order to make sure you have something you truly enjoy?

### How Investors Can Help

In addition to helping you think about how you can handle the challenges you will face, investors can also help with the communication. Explain your purpose, why you are doing it, and when you’re going to do it.

It’s particularly helpful to explain your investment goals, as that will help set the tone and bring more investors into your business.

### Another Helpful Habit

One habit I’ve picked up several ways, is the **commitment tracker**. This is similar to the equity tracker, except that instead of tracking your progress, it tracks your *performance.*

You can track your progress in many different ways. One track is by using the continuous progress meter found on the bottom of the screen of your browser. The other, is the vertical bar at the bottom left of the screen that measures your progress over the past seven days.

Put another way: You can view your progress in terms of three important factors:

1. Whether or not you performed at your best.

1. Whether or not you delivered on your commitments.

1. Whether or not you improved your relationships.

I could keep adding more metrics, but I think the best way to do that is to think about how many metrics you’re interested in and write down the ones you’re most interested in.

For this exercise, I used [“Past**” as an example:
> MyToken represents my ability to perform at my best every day. If I perform 100% of what I promise, then I deserve to be awarded With Love and Happiness.

Then, I calculated that the habit had a high ROI (returning investment of at least $100k) if I focused on those two things.

Looking back, I think I overstated my investment a bit. I invested a total of $65k, which wasn’t enough to make myself happy, but
