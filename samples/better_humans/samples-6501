 we realize that our expectations, even when set directly by us, are often affected adversely by this natural inclination towards introversion.

So if you are often too self-conscious to express yourself clearly, you may find ways to do so through the use of symbols.

For example, the “I’m With Stupid” sign might say *‘eric w.’*

Or the ‘you’ might say *‘you’ teddy bear.’

The point is to associate the self with the thing or idea, not the process or goal.

## 3. [+Gratitude journal](http://www.themonklife.net/life-is-a-sequence-of-small-volts-a-kk)

There is a common saying in Buddhism that says “a grateful mind is like a newborn”.

This is a good idea for two reasons.

One reason is that a sense of gratitude often precedes the appearance of new knowledge. We begin to feel more grateful as we become familiar with something or someone that helped us in our life.

Another reason is that the act of gratitude involves accepting the presence of gratitude. Often this presence of gratitude is a subconscious process. We are more likely to appreciate the kindness shown towards us by those who are familiar with us.

So how do we become aware of these tendencies?

Well, we start by simply noticing.

In the section ‘How can I become aware of how I feel’, I mentioned mentioned above that I was curious about the existence of “gratitude journals”.

I discovered that many of these habits emerged out of my subconscious.

And it’s great to notice these things so that you can begin to dismantle the myth that you are powerless.

There are two ways you can do this.

The first way is to become aware of how you feel whenever you practice gratitude.

By noticing how you feel whenever you practice gratitude, you begin to dismantle the internal monologue that creates the myth that you are powerless.

And you begin to see that the things that you are grateful for are not the things that you are primarily grateful for.

This can begin to help you see the good that is in every situation.

By noticing the ‘why’ behind every situation, you begin to dismantle the powerful negative thoughts that are holding you back.

You begin to see how tiny blessings from a grateful mind can change the world.

## 4. Surround Yourself With Gratitude

You are surely aware that the circumstances of your life dictate the quality and enjoyment you receive from life.

And it is surprising how easily you can turn the insignificant tasks you do into the ‘happiness equivalent of an 18+ hour work week’.

The greatest thing you can achieve, however, is to surround yourself with genuine gratitude.

The best way to do this is to **use technology to my extent**.

That’s right. **Use technology to its fullest extent**.

Whether you are using an app to schedule a meditation session for later in the day, a digital to-do list to beat yourself up tomorrow or a chat to keep yourself busy, some form of electronic gratification is essential.

**Gratitude via electronic means is especially enhanced when coupled with a strong intention to succeed.**

By combining the two new technologies I described above, I was able to mechanize my daily work effort so that I could focus on completing the things I started with gratitude.

Now, instead of having to work hard to get my goals done, I focus on getting them done ‘I want to do it, not how well I do in office work**.

By breaking down my day into smaller manageable sections, I can start with the most important stuff first. This way, I don’t have to scramble to get my goals done if I don’t want to.

Also, I feel more empowered and healthy knowing that I have an accountability partner who will always help me in my efforts.

### How can you become a better gratitude convert?

By now, I should point out that the goal of becoming a more grateful person is not easy, though it is certainly attainable.

Rather, it is a lifestyle choice that you must [work on forming](http://www.the-mission-pundit.com/forming-and-transforming-your-life-ii-hope-that-matters/#snug-in-the-numbers-2234c2a3453446) into which you can eventually get to [grow your habits](http://www.the-mission-pundit.com/become-a-freelance-hacker
