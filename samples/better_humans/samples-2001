 to become, is what it is: your story is just that: your story, your nightmare might be, but your success, is yours to share. If you choose to embrace it, you will have lived the journey.

Whether you want it to be that way or not, your creative mind is powerful and self-referential, it doesn’t matter which side it comes from. It all depends on which end of it you’re looking at.

# What Would Elon Musk Do to Your Veins?

## 

Do you bleed blue or white?

That’s the question you seem to be asking yourself a lot these days.

You’ve probably heard someone ask this question a million times, and it’s probably said tens of millions of times.

It’s true.

I have a hard time with questions like: “What do I do to feel like a superhero?” or “What do I do to be more creative?”

For me, they simply aren’t important.

I can do almost anything and everything I want, so why bother trying to find out what does it mean?

Plus, the world would be a really boring and uninspiring place if everything I did were based on something that couldn’t be changed, what with life in general being what it is.

That’s why I’m asking myself this question.

I’m thinking, “How can I infuse my personal growth into the lives of others?”

And this is why I’m trying to figure out.

I’m looking for an identity that promotes my philosophy of peace, love, and curiosity, which is basically love of ideas, love of humanity, and curiosity as to what exactly is possible.

If you’re really wanting to find out what would you do, look at things like:

* Exercise

* Meditation

* Waking up early

Those are the 3 things I do that make me feel like I’m doing extra credit for my time and have actually increased my productivity immensely.

If you do these things and feel the same way, you should try the same tactics and see how they work, or use something that aligns with what you’re doing.

But ultimately, your answer shouldn’t be an obligation or a choice, but something that you’re choosing to do.

When you’re choosing to do something, you’re just following instinct; your gut; your biological imperative.

If you want to be more creative, create more work and stop trying. Just do it. Don’t think about it; just do it.

When you’re following your gut, you don’t have to think about it in the moment, you just do it. You just do it because it’s automatic. It’s what you’re programmed to do.

When you’re choosing to do something, you can spend more time doing it, or not do it at all.

It doesn’t have to be perfect, but if it’s something you’re going to give a damn about, it’s worth committing to doing.

Just be honest with yourself; do you really want to go back to the drawing board and start over from scratch, or do you want to just chill and make new stuff as you go?

Choosing to do makes you choose. That’s why I like writing to my own tunes, playing a lead role and giving my all.
> # A project that’s not fully chosen reflects back from doing.

Being able to choose how you do things reflects positively on you. Knowing you have more control over your destiny, makes you feel more in control.

By choosing to do, you are saying to yourself:
> # *This is what I want to do, *it’s what I need to do, *it’s how I feel like I have to do it.*

That’s a fantastic feeling, that’s what I like the best. It takes a reality check, gives me a choice to put my energy and attention where it can do more good, and gives me a sense of satisfaction from doing something I strongly want to.

Of course you’re going to want to do exactly this kind of work, it’s just how nature chooses to do it.

Don’t try to force your choices through, they are the natural choices that “gave birth to” your dreams, if you choose.
