======== SAMPLE 1 ========

* **A Game of Poker. **Replaying the Game of Poker on your Nintendo 64. You have probably heard of this by now, as it is one of the most viewed YouTube videos of all time.

* **When PokerStars Go to the Draw. **Using the DS2 chip, you can now take the edge off your nerves by placing bets on what direction the chips will go.

As always, we recommend trying a few of these simultaneously, in order to be sure you find a good combination for you and your lifestyle.

### What is the best way to start?

The first thing you need to do is really look at what you want to achieve.

If you want to be a poker player, you could start by trying to play in a few more weekly poker tournaments.

If you want to be a bodybuilder, you could try to get stronger and have more muscle mass.

If you want to be a researcher, you could [solve the Prison Problem](http://niklasgoeke.com/blog/2012/09/06/barack-obama-s-prison-of-dreamers/).

The problem is, you have so many things going for you that you can’t really see the benefit of trying to push all of them to one card.

For a long time, I was a bodybuilder and maybe a bodybuilder and a gambler at the same time.

Whenever I had a good result at a recent tournament, I always felt like I had extra energy to keep working and never felt like I got a good workout.

Now, I have won a few tournaments and even won some money, but I still feel like I have a lot of things going for me that I can’t control.

*What’s left?*

Neurological conditions, like Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease, cause a lot of issues that I can’t really control.

I can’t really see or feel the benefits yet, but I will probably double my efforts in the next few years.

I already started to see a slow progress in my movement, due to the putty in my hands, so I will keep playing with it.

Playing with something like this requires being a [grain of sand (mmpowwow)](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/grain-of-sand-mma-network-meme-pocketgamer)for just one day.

One fateful day, I forgot all about my mindset and played the entire Contraption level for five minutes straight. I was so caught up in the excitement of going out on a limb, that I didn’t even notice that I was halfway through the level.

## Meme your way into success

When you [start doing a new project](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/how-to-start-a-passion-project-6376d29ec7d), you bring your [emotional awareness](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/how-to-understand-what-goes-wrong-after-a-hike-776b29205a) to a whole new level.

And we should do the same with your [financial goals](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/how-to-reach-your-fantasy-money-17f16affcaac7).

Make sure you set aside enough time every week to [keep track of what you’re doing](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/how-to-keep-up-with-the-frequencer-4e43109e0431), so that when you can, you can.

## List your debts smallest to largest

For each of the debts you’ve created yourself, list the ones that you realistically can live with, and the ones that will probably need to be paid off.

I *created* many of my debts,some of which are huge, so now they make up the majority of my income.

## List your debts largest to smallest

So if you’re trying to
