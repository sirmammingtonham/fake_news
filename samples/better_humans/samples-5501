## #3: [**Use journaling as a delivery vehicle for your ideas](http://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/blog/use-journaling-as-a-delivery-for-your-ideas/)**

Whether you need a finished draft or are just flat-out curious about a solution, this approach to storytelling is going to help you create a better product.

Journaling as a delivery vehicle for your ideas is going to make it easier to communicate your ideas to get those thoughts out of your head and onto paper.

It also helps you to create a better product by making it easier to communicate your product idea to customers and to gain their trust.

A delivery model is particularly effective when you need to get ideas out of your head, and then bring them to the table for discussion.

## #4: **Monitor your thoughts.**

How do you assess a person’s thoughts? Is it positive or negative? Is it anger or sadness?

This is most likely what you’re thinking about right now, so it’s important you establish a baseline first.

You don’t need to win the argument or point out every negative thought you have. I know some people are specifically tuned to sound bite their opponents and create a distraction, but that’s not a productive use of time.
> # Negative thoughts cause pain, suffering and disillusionment. Accountability requires a negative thought. Accountability requires a negative thought.

The next time you find yourself in a negative thought loop, stop yourself and ask yourself how you can get back to being in the positive loop. Then ask yourself how you can make a temporary adjustment to your thinking so you can return to being in the positive loop.

It’s easy to get into a bad state of mind when you’re fed up with living and working, and you want to leave it behind. So getting into a state of positive thought automatically returns you to the positive state of mind.

As if the wait wasn’t long enough, my new born son was already out of the NICU. He was black and I was proud to see him. The incubation period for the disease is 40 to 50 days, so images of chaos burst forth. My eighteen months pregnant, however, seemed unhitching as I lay that night in my crib.

The next morning, I saw the first symptom: a shortness of breath. Even though oxytocin was pumping through my body, my lungs could barely take the pressure. The next symptom was achy eyes, aching muscles, and redness around the eyes. I knew something was wrong, but didn’t want to believe it. Feeling sick and dizzy made me want to run, which is what I did.

I was in a panic. I didn’t know what to do. I was hysterical. I couldn’t control myself. The worst was over in seconds.

My ex-boyfriend was freaking out. Not so much physically, but emotionally. I felt sick all over. It hit me how much I have to take in just to keep myself and him in the same body. It was hard to take in all that water.

How much pain was in my body during labor and delivery? When I would try to lie down on the couch, I couldn’t even sleep. I was so caught up in feeling bad about myself that I wouldn’t even get out of bed. My ex-boyfriend was there, doing the rocking, shoving his legs out in the air.
> # Not enough.

When I finally got out of bed, I vomited all over myself. At first it was just a trickle, then it came in larger spurts. It was like an automatic reaction to whatever was going on.

Do I have to do everything myself? Not if it’s just so I can survive.

How about if it’s so my husband can have sex with me that I don’t have to watch? I don’t think it needs to be done, but it’s better than lying down on the couch and waiting for it to happen.

How about if it’s so my son can have sex with him that I can have sex with him? That’s a no-brainer. It improves the situation and everyone has the best sex they know how to facilitate.

And if there is a better way to spend that
