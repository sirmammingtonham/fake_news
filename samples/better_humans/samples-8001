It can even be applied to team collaboration.
> # **If you have a list, let lists do the work.**

So if you have a list, insert the top three options into the list and press Cmd+D to concatenate the list.

If you are using PowerPoint, let the list do the talking. Otherwise, show the user the list first.

(Note: In Part 2 of this post, we’ll show you how to properly implement this knowledge to make better decisions.)

## Preparation

Before you start, you need to do:

* *A*

* *B*

* *C*

* *D*

* *A simple *weather update*

* *For each item, I write down the current temperature and add one for each day. (*For example, [this is my favourite temperature](https://unsplash.com/@tylerpackard86/for-beginners-evergreen-tickets-11343434883?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*)

* *A note-taking system* (*To do this, I combine several lists into a notepad* (*This is how I record my blog posts).*)

* *A list of my commitments (small and simple as they may seem)

* *These are the items that I feel most excited about.*

You can prepare this information ahead of time. I’m sure that [Bailee Meyerlein](https://www.instagram.com/bilee?ref=P7G1v), after seeing my website, already has all of her commitments in her notebook. I have her list as a bookmark, and she’s been storing some special information away!

# Superhuman — why you MUST leave your comfort zone to find happiness

> # “If you want to do something extraordinary, you have to leave your comfort zone.” —Sherman Cahill

I recently listened to a podcast called “The Sherpa Effect” where Sherpa Peregrine talks about his experience towards the end of his rope journey. He spoke about hunger, exhaustion, stress, and even his food. But what struck me the most was how he talks about his conscience.

*“If I see any of these five stars in a list,” he said. *“They’re not enough. I need to eat more, exercise more, and save more.”*

What a man needs to do is not think about these things, but just do *something* to elevate his consciousness. What makes you Sherpa than just eat better and exercise more?

Think about mathematics. He knows that the more you multiply and strive towards higher levels of achievement, the more you will reach your goals.

He thinks about intentions. He reads intentions. And he acts accordingly. He doesn’t wait for proofs or permission from above before he decides what to do.

### How Can You Leverage The Sherpa Effect To Enjoy More

We each have the power to change the environment where we are by forging an intention. But how?

How do you do that? Well, you start with your *intention*.

Believe in yourself.

Believe in the people around you.

Believe in the progress you make together.

Then, it’s time to **follow your *habits*.

Your habits start with “Just*.” They start with *going to yoga*, add bells and whistles, and subscribing to some silly ideology. Then they **subscribe** to the “Just cause” excuse, because you’ve become used to that routine.

You may not remember your Just cause, but you do remember how to keep your promise.
If you want to do *more* and make *more* with your life, you have to keep your promise.

# Make The Most Of Scarce Time

## Your poor choices cost you precious time.

Modern choice overload means someone has made an approximately *average* of your choices, and you’re feeling pressure to choose an option that’s either smart,
