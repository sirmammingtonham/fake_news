# Pictures of Food

## Deviled eggs by chick_pea_pie

I don’t remember what food tastes like. I don’t even remember having a mouth. I look at pictures of food and try to remember.

In my thousand-year watch I am alone. Well, not if you include the hundreds of sleepers who ride as cargo. It’s my job to maintain a human perspective on the ship’s affairs while they slumber. They call me the Servitor.

My speakers belch out the words, “Athena, where are we going?” I haven’t thought of our destination in decades. We are floating in the dark void of space, guided by a single star that seems to recede as we approach.

The ship’s computer chirps, “Hubble Epsilon 17B. The star system contains three Earth-like planets as well as two gas giants. In addition, a large asteroid belt…”

I interrupt her. “And how long until we get there?”

“23 cycles,” the computer says.

No idea how long a cycle is.

I return my camera-eye to the large screen in front of me. Pail, ovoid halves with yellow foam and green flecks. Deviled eggs with chives. I try to remember what it would feel like to say “deviled eggs,” but I’m drawing a blank.

The next image appears on the screen. Some kind of arthropods in a yellow paste. Shrimp and cheese grits. What flavors would this evoke if I could eat it now? No idea.

I used to be human. Maybe I still am. I’ve been running diagnostics, reviewing risk assessments, and approving ship’s actions for a long time. If I concentrate hard enough, then I can still remember the contours of my face in a mirror. It’s easier to browse the network encyclopedia food section.

A shadow of memory is trying to rise in me. I had hoped that viewing these images would help. I want to remember the richness of my senses. This body of metal and plastic seems like all I’ve ever known. Part of me rebels against it, but I feel that part fading even as I try to seize hold of it.

A round, whitish, reddish disk with smaller red circles. Pepperoni pizza. I can almost taste it. Then it’s gone.

I go down a long hallway to the observatory deck. I look out at the unmoving stars. I stand there until my energy supply dwindles to nothing. Fade to black.

I open my eyes and try to focus. The hatch opens and a cold blast of air jolts me awake. I sit up, blinking.

“Your Servitor has malfunctioned,” a robotic voice sings. It’s Athena, the ship’s computer.

“The Servitor malfunctioned,” I repeat.

“Yes, sir,” Athena says. “Please come to the neural station so we can scan you and deploy the image to a new model.”

I get up from my pod. I’m shivering. I approach the food dispenser in the lab. “Deviled eggs,” I say. The box whirs to life and drops a white tube into my hand. I squeeze the gel into my mouth. It’s delicious. Tastes just like deviled eggs.

The computer scans my mind and transfers an image of me into the Servitor. It will continue to do my job for centuries. I return to my pod and descend back into unconsciousness.

# Trouble in the Garden!

## Trouble in the Garden!

His journey had been a smooth one ever since the slingshot around Jupiter. The Commander didn’t care much for stasis, so he spent most of his time lounging in the garden on board. One day, as he drifted in and out of his day dreams, the Commander suddenly had an urge to hold the pebble. He yawned, and picked himself up off the hammock. His feet shuffled across the floor. Through the door, into the hall, down to his lab. Switch flick, lights on, pebble grab. A man possessed.

The Commander woke up in the garden. His head was pounding, and the lights seemed brighter than the Sun. He stretched out his arms, and turned to get up from the hammock, when he noticed the pebble on the ground a few feet away. Before he had the chance to consider what this meant, Black North’s alert system came online. “NOW APPROACHING PLUTO”, it said over the loud speakers. “Damn, how long was I out?” the Commander muttered to himself. He walked over to the pebble, and stooped down to inspect it. The area around the pebble was terribly cold. The Commander crouched near the pebble for what felt like hours, and tried to decide what his next move was. Somehow, it had found its way in there. And that thought disturbed him. There was only two options here. He moved it himself. Or somebody else did. He took a deep breath, plunged his hand through the icy air, and wrapped his fingers around the pebble. He stood up with ease, and walked around the garden; despite the pebbles immense weight. He picked a few leaves off the plants, drug his hand through some dirt, and even snapped a few twigs, until finally making his way back to the hammock. All of that with the pebble in hand. All of that with no memory.

![](1*rf7dso9Xf9Z3DD34i_sYYA.jpeg)

Smoke filled his nose, and woke the Commander. His body ached like never before, and it was pain to move. He rolled over with a grunt, and strained his neck to look around. The room was blazing. All of the trees were lit, and the vegetables were well on their way to joining them. The thought of running out of oxygen in space was suffocating, and the wall of smoke coming his way wasn’t going to alleviate that sensation. He rolled back over, and began crawling towards the door. Excruciating pain coursed through his body. He gasped for breathe, holding onto each one because it was probably going to be his last. Crawling along the floor, crying in pain. All alone in the miserable emptiness of space. He felt the flames catching him, and burning his feet. He gave a last effort, to no avail. He would burn alive in space. His pants caught fire, and seared the skin of his legs. It smelt like a Sunday morning tailgate. He blinked in and out of consciousness, and as his vision began to fade, and his lungs filled with smoke, he saw that small black rock. Hope amongst the flames. He reached out with the last ounce of his strength, and seized the pebble.

![](1*rmQnQ687oF0S1lIjlocEtg.jpeg)

When he woke up the fire was gone. Not out, but entirely gone. Like it never happened. He scanned the room and saw nothing. Just darkness all around. He walked towards the viewing window that faced the Sun. When he pressed the button that drew back the steel curtains, and listened to them groan as they unfolded, he felt a shot of ice run down his back. The Sun was gone, and it its place was a black hole. He looked desperately around for the star he knew so well. But all he saw was more black holes. Nine total, including the monstrosity on the Sun’s throne. He pulled himself away from the window, and fell into a heap on the floor. He was most certain he was dead, and this was a twisted version of hell created for the Commander by the devil himself. But the longer he lay there, the longer nothing changed. So he got up, and walked to the other window on the opposite side of the room. The groaning of steel curtains being drawn filled the room once more, and with that sound came light. The light filled the room with a shine just like the Sun itself, but not quite. When his eyes adjusted to the sudden brightness, the Commander peered out the window. He saw an object comparable to the Sun in radiance, but no match in size. And before it, much closer to the ship, another black hole, making ten total. The beginnings of a thought began to creep into the Commander’s head as he strained to make sense of it all, but he was interrupted by an announcement from far away. “NOW ENTERING PLUTO’S ORBIT”, he heard it whisper. He looked down at his open palm, and gazed deeply into the circle of light shining out at him. It all made sense now.

# Upgrade

## Upgrade

### Set and Davro rush to fulfill one of their world’s first manhood rites.

Set chased after his little brother Davro catching him as he experimented with his new implant.

As he grabbed his hand, he heard his younger brother’s implant speaking aloud. His cochelar implant had not been installed so the occular scanner was forced to relay information in its cool, non-human voice…

“— Venrian chicken, a hybrid of Terran and Venri desert fowl known for their ability to survive the harsh Venri summers and its cold dry winters. The Venrian chickens were one of the first domesticated hybrids created by the Maori life-building probes landing here over three centuries ago. Do you want to know more?”

“It’s not a toy, Davro. You can’t just run around scanning everything.”
“I just did. I didn’t know chickens came from Earth?”

Set glared at his brother as he requested a map of the city from the holodrones flying above. Kenboku was a large city and it was easy to get lost here. They had taken the tram from their home district but would have to walk the rest of the way for the last part of Davro’s upgrade. Being connected to the City’s neural network would be one of the first of the Manhood trials Davro would go through before he would journey out into the desert on his Spirit Flight.

Redirected, the local holodrones shared their map of the ever-changing capital and then flew on. “We have to go this way. Now stop scanning people, it’s considered impolite.”

“Yes, brother. But haven’t you ever wanted to scan a person and know everything about them? I couldn’t wait for them to fully activate my implant so I could learn about everything.”

“It won’t replace going to school, if that’s what you’re hoping. We still have to learn everything organically. The NEMI system is an auxiliary brain, it’s meant to help you not replace thinking for you.” Davro looked heartbroken to discover he would still have to go to school. Set smiled remembering when Father had told him the same thing.

“Then why do we bother with having computers in our heads if they don’t make us any smarter?” Set smiled again. He remembered his Father’s response and repeated it as best he could remember.

“Even though our families have lived on Venri for three hundred years, outside of our controlled cities and occasionally even inside of them, there are many dangers we have to contend with.” Davro looked bored and Set stopped to check his map before continuing.

“We don’t put computers into our brains any more because of other Humani who are able to hijack computer systems and take control of people who integrate computers into their neural structures.”

“You can’t hack a brain, can you?”

“You can if you use one of the more advanced Earth interface systems. The EI was one of the most advanced computer interfaces created. Human and computers were inseparable. That technology got all of us to the stars.”

Davro stopped and pulled his brother to a halt. “NEMI, display EI interface system hologram display.”

“Complying. Display complete.” An integrated silver band was shown above the face of their Grandfather who wore one until his untimely death.

“Grandfather had one. Why would he want us wearing these. They are nowhere near as powerful. I know, I asked mine earlier but it refused to explain.”

Set replied. “You are not authorized to know. You haven’t become a man like I have.”

“You’re not a man, you’re only thirteen.”

On Venri, thirteen was considered the end of childhood but Set would not truly be a man until he completed his Spirit Flight. Davro’s correction chafed but was essentially correct.

“Nonetheless, you are still too young to access that information fully. It is possible to hack a brain if you use the EI. Our NEMI are completely separate from your brain. There is some interface with our organics but our bodies are not tied with the NEMI system.

“Grandfather was very old. Using the EI he could regulate his body’s systems, slowing his aging greatly. It made him capable of utilizing his body’s maximum capacity; they were stronger, faster and smarter than we will ever be. All the legends of the First Men and Women of Venri are true. They were superhuman.”

Set grabbed his brother’s hand and the two of them sprinted until they had reached the clinic where the final activation to Davro’s implant would be made. Their sprint through town had allowed them to arrive on time and prevented Davro from asking any more questions. The look in the younger boy’s eyes told him he hadn’t forgotten while they dodged traffic.

“Do you remember how grandfather died?”

“He fell asleep and didn’t wake up.”

“Yes. When the Acanti rebels came, they had using their own technology to take apart some of the First Men and learned how to override the EI.”

Davro knew of the Acanti, a group of Humani Regression Cultists who believed that even though technology had brought us to the stars, our obsession and reliance on it weakened many of the Venri colonists. The Acanti broke with the colony and chose to live in the desert in what they believed was communion with the nature of this harsh world.

“That’s the part I don’t understand. I thought the Acanti didn’t use technology.”

“They didn’t. They bonded with lifeforms out in the desert and developed psychic abilities which allowed them to take over the First Men’s implants and shut them down.”

“Fortunately for us, the First Men had in their way agreed with the Acanti and had begun developing NEMI as a less invasive replacement. Fifty years ago, they had they built NEMI’s central core over there. See it the sphere over the tower? This was to be a replacement for the EI. A computer repository of information without the risk of psychic interference from the local psychic wildlife.”

Set waited to see the light of comprehension in his brother’s eyes, but instead a tear formed.

“What’s wrong, Davro?” Set could see something profound was bothering his brother. Davro hugged Set tightly and looked up at him, tears rolling down his face.

“Without the EI, doesn’t this mean we’ll never go back to the stars?”
Set held his brother tightly and realized Davro was far more intelligent than he gave him credit for. It had taken him three years to realize that very same fact.

Taking Davro’s hand, Set walked him into the clinic. In time and the many applications of the NEMI, Set hoped Davros would forget the lure of the forbidden stars.

Just like he did.

# THE MINISTRY

## Her freckles where dark against her pale skin as she tightened the last of her wrist straps and stepped out into the cold, grey morning light.

The silver metal soles of her black knee high jackboots echoed softly off the cracked and broken sidewalk as she walked down the street, stepping over trash, hobos, and dog shit.

She hated walking to The Ministry every morning but she didn’t have a choice. Public-Trans never came to this part of the metroplex arcology. Why would it? If she had a choice, she would never come back here either.

She didn’t belong here anymore. With the trash and the crime and the unintelligent heathens.

She was better than that now. Now that she was a Paladin of The Ministry.

Governments had fallen. Corporations had failed. Science didn’t give the masses enough comforts.

But The Ministry was forever. And she was a part of that.

She continued walking, wishing for her mother to die before she got “home”. She didn’t want to have to come back down here amongst The Unenlightened again.

And as she walked, secure and warm in her silver metal straps and jet black fabrics, she looked up, to the horizon, and saw the Obsidian Towers of The Ministry reaching tall and proud into the always cold and grey skies.

And the smile she smiled was cold and grey.

The Ministry was *forever.*

# SALT

## A futuristic teacher has a unique curriculum

![](1*tJqzzE0trPTD1MNmzztvKw.jpeg)

“Good morning, children.”

Ms. Tanaka swiveled into the command console of her living room class station and turned on the holographic display. The room flickered momentarily as the display connections were routed through the house’s main computer grid.

The console lights for each section of her class lit serially as their students appeared in the classroom behind her.

“Singapore. Five. Online.”
“New York. Three. Online”
“London. One. Online.” Tanaka shook her head sadly. Her student base had dropped off significantly since the Accident.

Her internal Image sensing a change in her blood pressure activated its search mode and related it to recent infonews. “Would you like me to provide search data for the Accident for class today?”

Snapping back to the present, she waved her hand. “No Mei, I don’t need it, today. I may do something on it to commemorate the anniversary but today, we celebrate.”

Each of the children snapped into high resolution focus, most with smiles of anticipation. “Good morning, Ms. Tanaka.” The network adjusted as the bandwidth required for translation was properly allocated. Each child learned in their native language during routine class operation.

“Happy SALT Day.”

Mei adjusted the translation matrices based on her morning downloads with any language updates, regional dialects or specialized phenom databases.

“I guess I don’t have to ask you if you’re ready for today, do I? So, tell me who knows what SALT Day is and why we celebrate it?”

Abayomi, a Nigerian living in the outskirts of London whispered, “We celebrate the day Humaniti was first fully aware and could confirm the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence.”

“Why do we call it SALT Day?”

“It’s named after the South African Large Telescope, where the first confirmation of alien intelligence occurred and remains until today.” Yi Ling chirped up in an extremely professional tone. Her parents were also teachers. Her additional exposure to the infogrid meant she was always searching for new things of interest, likely she had been studying the curriculum in advance.

Mei, brought up the infonet images for the SALT and provided the age appropriate data infographics on the specifications of the telescope and its associated satellites. Each of the children received the information they could assimilate based on their intellectual capacity. This particular class was rated mid-tier though their ages varied from eight to eleven.

“I assume you all received your Fragment in the last drone-drops in your region.” Each student held out a sliver of shiny, but impossibly hard glass.

The electronic voice intentionally left quite robotic signaled Marcus’ entrance into the conversation. “Not sure why we should be celebrating extraterrestrials we’re never going to meet?” He was the only student not sitting. He lay back in a medical support pod.

Marcus was borne with a rare bone disease, he was only rarely able to enter the gravity well of a planet for an brief period. Normally, he lived on L2 Station. He returned to Earth to receive his Fragment and to be connected to the SALT. He floated in his biosphere, his gills flicking gentle in support solution. His radiotelepathic implant meant he never spoke verbally.

“No, we won’t ever get to meet the Precursors, Marcus. But what we have learned has given us many opportunities to understand who they were, what they accomplished and if one of us or all of us can further decypher the SALT we have a chance to travel to where the Precursors came from one day.”

Ms. Tanaka picked up her crystalline prop, she was already connected to the SALT, and placed it across her hand. “This is the SALT interface. You have all been selected to interface with our alien benefactors because you have all shown unique intellectual aptitudes. Art, writing, creativity, scientific, exploratory and other learning styles, each allowing you a potentially unique experience into the mind of the SALT.”

“Will it hurt?” Abayomi looked tentatively at the Fragment. “It seems very sharp.”

“No, you won’t feel a thing. I promise.” Ms Tanaka modified her datastream to send comforting subliminals to ease the children’s anxieties. Each of their comm centers triggered each child’s conditioned pheremonal nootropic.

“Stand it on the top of your head. You will feel a tingle when you are near the perfect spot for you. Each of you will have a different emphasis so your location may be slightly different.”

The children each place their Fragment on their heads aided by the feedback system they were assigned while they were growing. Once they were connected to the SALT their previous system would be repurposed by the implant.

Ms. Tanaka checked the data retrieved from each of the children. Her own Image, Mei coordinated the data between Tanaka and the children.

“Okay, let the crystal go and imagine your favorite avatar.” The children each let go tentatively, looking over at the other children to see what was happening by proxy. They saw the crystal stand straight up and then slowly melt into the heads of their classmates. Then each turned back and put their heads down as they thought of one of their favorite interweb avatars.

Each had been told this would become their first Image, their first connection to SALT. It would look and act just like their previous avatars but now when a connection was good, they would be allowed to enter the Flow.

Mei adjusted several of the children’s life signs remotely ensuring the integration into the cerebellum of the students was smooth.

Avatars popped into existence as the children settled on their favorites. Marcus was the last to choose and his was a hyperrealistic horse. No one had seen a horse in fifty years. His avatar was one of the last simulations ever taken from a living specimen.

The others chose more historical visual icons from games they enjoyed. Once icons were chosen, Ms. Tanaka gave an information burst-loaded, “Sleep.”

For twenty four minutes, they dreamed of electric sheep. Fantastic vistas as their neural cortex was rewritten by a technology Humanti in all its varied intellectual forms, still did not truly understand.

“Okay, children. Open your eyes. Welcome to the Flow.” Each child stood up from the ground or the desert they each thought they were standing in.

“This is not like your game virtualities. This is a seamless environment completely integrated into your nervous system. You can experience life here. Hot, cold, wet, dry.”

Mei connected to the children, something new, a part of a network they had never known before. Each child felt it, the strangeness, the scent of something unknown. Never known. Their faces wrinkled.

“That is the smell of the SALT. The air of this place. Look over there.” As if the desert had been filled with a fog, suddenly a towering black line appeared in the distance. It shot from behind what now appeared to be a sky, a mountain range, a treeline, meadows all fading into the distance terminating where the children stood on what they now see as a beach, not a desert.

“What is that?” Marcus was still adjusting to riding his avatar.

Tanaka looked wistfully into the distance. “That is SALT. The Archive of the Precursors. That’s where you will be going. You won’t be going all at once. You will be traveling toward the Black Tower in the distance. We don’t know what you will see. We won’t know what you experience. Each of us sees the journey differently. That’s why when you come back, you have to write down your experience in class. You have to teach us what you learn while you’re in the Flow.”

“We’re the teachers?” Yi Ling looked as if she was suddenly understanding something.

“Everyday you’re able, you will enter the Flow and experience something. As you become more acclimated you will slowly move toward the Tower. Maybe one day you will reach the Archive…”

Abayomi looked back at the shore walked over to and touched the water. “Have you ever been to the Archive, Ms. Tanaka?”

Tanaka bent down next to Abayomi and whispered into her ear. “Can I tell you a secret?”

The child face lit up with the chance to hold a secret from an adult. “Yes, ma’am.”

“No one has. It’s been a hundred years and we have never reached it. We feel it call to us, but no one has ever made it.”

Marcus, ever-listening caused his avatar to rear up and he shouted, “Well, I’ll be the first,” his horse tearing into the beach sand and he fell away into the distance.

“Take notes!”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Abayomi watched the others as they made their way toward the Tower. “You still have a question, don’t you?

“If that tower is the destination, what is this shore we’re starting from?”

“That dear child, is the rest of Humaniti, the ones who simply don’t have what it takes to make this journey. This ocean is the best we could do. It is the sum of everything we have ever learned and created on our own. Our singularity.”

“We’re the teachers.”

“Yes, now hurry along. Humaniti’s waiting to learn what you discover. Remember…”

*“I know. Take good notes.”*

# Time-Lost Travelers

## An answer to the Fermi Paradox

![‘Contact’ by Abiogenesis](1*7tQ54oWG1_FPYTCpScLwqg.jpeg)*‘Contact’ by Abiogenesis*

“Son, we need to talk.” My father glided into the fractal hall in the shape of a dragon. Whenever he assumed this shape it meant there was liable to be talking, droning, and possibly even yelling.

“As I was using manifold-space, investigating the effects of stellar fragments on hyper-dimensional continuity, I discovered a tiny ship interrupting the space-folding systems of my wave-runner. I was nearly absorbed into the stellar fragment as my temporal field was disrupted.”

He had changed colors several times during his description. He was right to be angry. By accident, my project almost killed him.

“I had to save myself and then once I realized what happened, I noted they were plunging toward the singularity. I assumed they were yours and plucked them out of space-time.” He held out his rapidly changing claw and a tiny ship, something primitive and three-dimensional, sat in his great palm. I could see the attempts to create a ship for seven-dimensional wave-running, their primitive ores and nascent glide-shielding allowing them to enter manifold-space for a short time.

I tried not to smile. It was not the right time to say anything yet. He usually berates me three times before I get a chance to defend myself. My efforts in this instant were best directed toward defusing his anger when my turn came.

“How did it get out? Just explain this to me. You have initiated the proper protocols? The ones we agreed to when you began this project?”

Now it was my turn. “Most beneficent parental unit, I understand my project appeared to have gotten out of my control and take full responsibility for what has happened. I admit to more than coddling them against your previous instruction, possibly because a recent period of growth caused me to lower my safeguards. It appears I was in error.”

“What remedies have you tried to retard their growth? They need limits.” He had not quite entered the repercussion stage of our dance. I still had a diminishing window of opportunity to put a good face on this.

“I tried the standards; most of them seemed more than adequate for a few thousand revolutions. Temperature variation, ecosystem depletion, energy shortages, random food instability, I even fomented revolution and dropped an asteroid personally to ensure maximum reduction in their population.” I made the bow of contrition to the fifth degree indicating I was not done.

“My failure came when I realized they had outgrown their primary habitat and inspired one of them to create the first Lorenz drive to allow them to find new industrial and relocation options within the confines of their habitat. I had no idea they would become clever enough to extrapolate later drives from this first design.”

His rage spent, he went to the center of my hall and accessed the habitat with my favorite project. He zoomed in on their primary habitat world and found a major city. “Good activity, lots of mindless capitalistic bustling, a thriving financial infrastructure. I see lots of greed and corruption. With indices such as these, I’m having a hard time seeing how they got, oh, wait. I see, look over here. There is enough money they can send their young for high-quality education. See these right here, doing nothing? They’re dreamers, schemers, always trying to avoid work, or envisioning new ways of being. Those dreamers are the worst.”

“They have been quite interesting. I’ve high hopes for them.”

“We’ve been over this. You cannot enable them. They breed too quickly, live entirely too long, and spread out as fast as they are able. You know how the saying goes.”

“’Once you’ve got Humans, you never get rid of them.’ What should we do?”

“Can they use cybertechnology, interfacing with machines?” He had taken on the glow of Control. He’s confident of a solution.

“Yes, it has been a source of great pride they managed to not erase themselves as part of this biotechnological upgrade.”

“I recommend you utilize a low-grade bio-infiltration virus, attack the oldest members of their societies. Trim away the oldsters and they lose the bank of wisdom keeping them less warlike.”

Cybertech plagues are hard to control. “How do we keep it from spreading?”

“Make it count its generations and stop, should be just enough.”

Understanding, I take the ship from my father, getting into the spirit of experimentation. “I know just the carrier. Time-lost travelers…what stories they’ll tell.”

“I better not find any more.”

## A story about a blowjob.

![](1*Rsq5eHj9lk4XYW6bp6IrIA.jpeg)

“That would be it. We just need your signature now, Mr. Walters.” the blonde said.

She handed me a tablet. I’d prefer a piece of paper.

“Welcome to CrIO, Mr. Walters. This way — if you could follow me please.”

Belgium was rainy and cold when I got here a week ago. Other countries have also legalised euthanasia — but this new cheap startup chose Belgium for their headquarters.

Damn, I missed California.

“I guess I should just lie here, right?”

The blonde nodded.

I was twenty-six years old the first time I got cancer. Chemo, couple of operations, and they said I was cured.

I’m thirty-three now — and it’s back again.

**Terminal.**

I had a good run, I think. Broke up with my girlfriend six months ago, the second doctors told me I have less than a year left. Sold my company last week and came here.

Came here to die.

So that I might live. Maybe. Possibly.

I did read about cryogenics, or whatever it is called. Fringe, could work. Will likely fail.

**I had nothing to lose.**

“This might sting a bit.” the blonde interrupted my thoughts.

![](1*6JInJXYGl_1_5Y6MTHD1bg.jpeg)

***“Open your eyes.”***

The voice was inside my head.

I felt magnificent. I felt scared.

I felt like a God.

***“Please, Mr. Walters, open your eyes.”***

The brightness hit my retinas with the strength of a thousand suns.

What I did see was two. Two stars.

![](1*2D_UJKd7FQ7MDhgRA0Nnrw.jpeg)

“What… What… What… Where…I… I’m… Where…”. I hyperventilated.
> ***“Serotonin reuptake inhibitors — approve”**.* It appeared in front of my eyes. I thought **“Yes.”**

I could breathe again.

“You’re in the year 2584. We are in the Alpha Centauri system, Mr. Walters. Do you mind if I call you Sebastian? My name is Cleodora. Do you want some cake?” she spoke this time.

Actual words.

Her voice was harsh and mechanical, almost as if she didn’t use her vocal chords to make the sound.

**“Cake?”** I replied. I didn’t speak.

I thought.

***“Yes, cake.”*** She laughed. Voice in my head, again. Melodic. Angelic. Beautiful.

“What… I…I was dead. I have terminal cancer. I… Is this real?” I whispered, barely. The echo of the room was eerie.

And then it hit me. It’s hard to describe — a simultaneous chatter of voices inside my head, billions of minds asking me questions.

I replied to each and every one of them. It took me three seconds.

**“What am I? What did you do to me?”** I blocked everyone except the strange, green-haired girl that sat on the edge of my bed.

“You are you, Sebastian. An individual. We found you in a derelict cargo ship 27 hours, 12 minutes and 17 seconds ago. Power systems were failing. It must have floated there for at least a century or two. We brought you here, to Helicon-OSS-71X. It’s a space station. We’re orbiting a gas giant and…”

She spoke. I heard the words through my ears, her voice now sounding the same as it was in my head moments ago.

Celestial.

“I never did this, you know. Most of the frozen were woken up centuries ago, and those were… Different times. What we did to you is what every member of our species is born with, these days. It’s not nanotechnology, it’s not genetic manipulation. It’s somewhere in the middle, and it’s more. Much, much more. I’m still blocking most of the functions as you do need some time to learn to control them and to adapt, but… You had a glimpse into what it does.

We are humans, but we are more.

We are individuals, but we are One.”

![](1*5e8IaeUC7tqWv5dHra1-CA.jpeg)

She smiled. Pointed at a metal chair. It disappeared in a cloud of whizzing particles. A myriad of different toy cars appeared. Then, she stood up, levitated across the room. The toy cars started moving around.

“You’ll have access to the Library soon, I just wanted to show, and not tell. It’s awesome, right?” she laughed, and pointed outside.

The station must’ve rotated while we spoke. What I saw, lingering in the void of empty space, was life. Trillions, or even more, of tiny worlds, interconnected with what seemed like…

Branches.

Green, everywhere, mixed with metallic silver and bathed in the light of the twin suns.

It spread into infinity, seemingly forming a sphere around the entire star system.

![](1*ifk4hnK__YWXH-EnhoFBYQ.jpeg)

“***Now. Would you like a blowjob?”*** she said, her voice resonating inside my head. Devilish, and almost shy.

“A… A blowjob?” I replied, confused.

“Yes. You seem really attractive for someone who’s half a millennia old. We’ll hop on a shuttle and go on a tour across the Biosphere after. Sol has one too!” she said, out loud, while undressing.

***I fucking love 2584, I thought.***

# The Sleepwalker

## The Sleepwalker

I wake up a week early in an unfamiliar room, with blood on my hands.

I’m slumped on an uncomfortable chair in a cold, clean room lined with metal drawers. I can scarcely stir. The usual post-Letherol fug. I’ll just have to wait it out. Video screens in my peripheral vision play endless corporate propaganda. Smiling workers on loop. Eye-rolling stuff, but then they aren’t for my benefit. A Letherolated worker wanders through the sterile room, glancing at the screen as they pass and mirroring the glassy smiles. No doubt the video has the same beatific effect on me when I’m under the influence.

In between loops the screen displays a ticker showing rolling corporate metrics. The current share price of ChangCom. The current production rate of London 3, our unit. The time and date are displayed in the corner. I’m not scheduled to wake up for another week. What’s gone wrong?

I’m on a monthly cadence. Three weeks of work, one week off. It works well enough for me. Three solid weeks of work — night and day, no breaks — earns me enough to be able to afford that week of leisure time as well as the drugs I need for work: Somnul to override the need for sleep, Energon to prevent fatigue, and Letherol to blank the mind. Some choose other cadences. My elder brother John chose a sixty year cadence. He planned to work solidly for forty years, then enjoy a twenty year retirement. Better ratio that way. Our mother wept as he left for his first day of work. She knew there was a chance she’d never see him again, that one of them might die before his shift finished. As it happened, John died twenty years in. Heart failure caused by Energon complications. John was sensible, a long-term thinker, but his gamble didn’t pay off. I’m more prodigal. I want to enjoy all stages of life, even if the returns are poorer. The thought of waking up an old man, my youth devoured by Letherol, terrifies me even more than the thought of not waking up at all.

I wasn’t always on Letherol. I couldn’t afford it; few could. I used to be conscious for every stultifying moment of every interminable shift. I started off as a box hauler; my dexterity isn’t good enough for the manual fabrication work that robots used to do before the Industrial Regression. Endless back and forth across the factory floor, stacking boxes for export to First World countries. Sorry, *Zeroth *World countries is the term I should use. To say otherwise ruffles the feathers of the caste of middle managers we call politicians, who preferred to invent a new tier and grudgingly promote the likes of China rather accept our own demotion.

Anyway, that all changed when an investigative reporter infiltrated one of the London units. The footage that leaked onto the net was uncomfortable viewing for those who had been shielded from the worst of the Regression. Workers performing their duties like dead-eyed zombies was expected. It was the untrammeled weeping and gibbering that was truly unpalatable.

ChangCom’s share price plummeted. A month later, Letherol was subsidised. Now we’re practically all on it. Happy little automata.

Not all. Some resist. I usually pass at least one fundamentalist at the gate when I start a shift. Two weeks ago it had been a chunky guy with red hair and wild eyes. He wore a badge that said *Remember*, and held a placard that said *Experience + Memory = Humanity.* I’d brushed quickly past him. I feel grudging admiration for those like him — they certainly have greater fortitude than I do, preferring to remember every grinding moment out of philosophical principle. Mostly I pity them. My life experience may only be a quarter the length of theirs, relatively speaking, but it’s a life of unbroken leisure. Other than the brief recovery period, it’s as if the drudgery never happened.

I almost never see the same protestor twice. I suppose they inevitably cave in to Letherol.

The fog lifts and sensation returns. I cautiously stretch my limbs then stand up. A man in a pristine white coat enters the room. It’s my supervisor, Spencer. He scowls at me through owlish glasses.

“Where have you been, Neuman?” he says irritably. “Room 87, now. I want this business concluded.”

I know I should tell Spencer that my drugs have worn off, but he turns and stalks off before I can gather my wits. Not knowing where room 87 is, I scurry after him.

Room 87 is a metal room like the one I woke in. The first thing I see when I enter is Spencer talking on his phone, his back turned to me. The second thing I see is a man I recognise as the red-headed protestor from two weeks prior. He’s lying semi-conscious on a steel surgical table. He no longer looks so stocky. I realise with horror that his right arm has been amputated at the elbow and cauterised. Dried blood cakes that side of the table.

“He says he’s working alone, sir,” says Spencer on the phone. “He claims to know nothing about the Cell. Says he’s just a non-violent protestor. No, I don’t believe him. He knows the seditionists all right. He’ll talk.”

Spencer hangs up and turns to me. I arrange my face as best I can, adopting a serene, glazed expression. I pray to be sent on an errand so that I can calm myself and think.

“Last chance, Caffrey,” says Spencer to the man on the table. “Names. Give me names.”

Caffrey moans insensibly and utters limp protestations.

“So be it,” says Spencer grimly. “Neuman, remove the other arm.”

Caffrey begins to shriek piteously and I can no longer conceal my horror. Spencer looks at me with alarm.

“My drugs,” I say, apologetically stammering. “The dosage. Wrong dosage.”

Spencer nods with a mixture of concern and impatience. He opens a cabinet and takes out a jar.

“Speak up sooner next time, for your benefit as much as mine,” he says, proffering a handful of Letherol. I stare at the blood-red pills but do not take them. My body is frozen with indecision. I want to be released from this waking nightmare, but to embrace the nullity of Letherol is to accept complicity.

Spencer frowns at me. “Take the pills,” he says in a voice as sharp and precise as a scalpel.

# The Woman Who Fell in Love with a Postmodern Building and Set Her Lovers’ Boat on Fire

## Even a house can fall in love.

*Chiara Lys nearly suffered a heart attack, and the strongest orgasm of her life, on her first trip to Prague. Her Prince Charming was all curves and sharp angles in the sun, deliberate — steel and glass, concrete and rebar. Chiara’s two boyfriends didn’t exactly cotton to the European stranger.*

As an *edifice mage*, this response was a normal one, as her nature demanded she be able to communicate with buildings, particularly those with unusual appearances and the attendant distinct personalities.

![](1*s30xsK0SytmEL2nCdZdtcA.jpeg)

Chiara learned early that most buildings were a dull and sleepy lot, conceived by safe architects whose powers of imagination were properly stifled by the Administration of Dull Designers. That isn’t what they are really called, it’s just what most edifice mages, used to denote the soul-crushing, design-stifling and spirit-repelling modern architecture created today.

She came into her powers early, talking to old homes in her quiet home in Salam. As a child she would often find the oldest homes in her neighborhood and hold long conversations with them. The spirits housed within were eager to find someone who could speak their language; a song of wood and stone, a song of love and labor, imagination and evocation, yes these were what the spirits of well-made homes spoke of effortlessly and at great length.

She never tired of hearing the tales of people who lived in those homes. Some happily raising families, other tragic and burdened with struggle. She tended to like those troubled stories more. Something about adversity piqued her voyeuristic nature.

Eventually she was sent to school, at first to learn then second to harness her abilities. Chiara loved the learning but hated her gifts. At first, they seemed harmless, but she learned of a darker aspect of her abilities and this caused her great distress.

Her power could be used to spy on people.

Since buildings were eager to talk to her, she could ask them questions about anything happening inside of them and they would, without morals or strictures, tell her about anyone who dwelled within.

The Department of Homeland Security simply had to keep her close. Strangely enough, most edifice mages were members of the government working as security operatives and anti-terrorists agents.

Chiara decided that was not the life for her. She wanted to spend her time, interrogating old buildings in Europe, because frankly they had the best stories. With a mind suited to the Agency, she used her powers to blackmail her bosses and they were only too happy to let her go.

Hotels could be such gossips.

She made her way to Europe and found herself in Prague. The old buildings there were classically European, haughty, dignified, and a tiny bit reserved. But they had lived through wars, battles, coups, and style changes which distorted the outsides of the buildings but left their inner hearts richer for the experience. A few buildings in the oldest cities had their entire spirit housed in a cornerstone, sometimes the only remnant of their original structure remaining.

But her trip to Prague was not without incident. For you see, she had two buildings she was already in love with and they with her. They had learned to tolerate each other since they were in different cities. Each knew about the other and did everything they could to gain her attention. But like a butterfly, she was always drawn to the next strange building.

![](1*Hxr373uuXVJXzjkHT64pKQ.jpeg)

She had contented herself with the two buildings she loved, one, a fashionable structure, an old world church in New York, who called himself Churchill, which had been around for nearly two hundred years. It’s voice, resonant and deep spoke to her inner spirit, ennobled her to embrace her ability and to do good in the world. It was the church which convinced her to use her powers for a greater good.

She did. She freed the spirits of the dead from homes where they had been trapped in Limbo by the house.

The other was a home on the edge of a pier complete with its own boat. This house was the rugged individualist. He wanted nothing to do with most people and unlike most houses, was taciturn and sullen. But he took to Chiara and opened up, sharing his innermost thoughts.

What do houses think about more than anything else? Travel.

Chiara would take her adventures of exorcising those lost spirits and write them down so she could recount them to Pierce, her home on the bay in Quincy, Massachusetts.

Pierce hated Churchill because it was his words that drove Chiara to travel. Travel which took her away from Pierce for weeks at a time. He sulked for days after she would return home. She always had calming words and brought him fruit and other things whose scent would linger in the house for days.

He would always relent in the end. They would make up and she would then recount all of her adventures.

Until Prague.

There, a new building caught her eye. His non-Euclidean corners, his warped windows, his alien design, all things that would have, should have, repelled her, instead gave her the strongest orgasm she had ever known. To be honest, she rarely felt this way about anything. Churchill never made her feel this way and Pierce was too self-absorbed to give her anything like this feeling.

He called himself Karls. Made by an eccentric architect who, soon after completing Karls, went quietly mad. Karls was the personification of said madness, twisted, distorted, his inner spirit matched his outer appearance.

Chiara spent some of everyday with Karls, listening to the stories of the workers within, hearing the tales of wonder about the realm where the spirits of buildings lived before they were born here. You see, neither of her American houses knew much of their origins, they were both old men, with old minds. Karls was new, and though his accent was thick, he shared his knowledge freely.

This endeared Karls to her until that fateful day when Karls drove someone to leap from his twentieth story window.

Chiara watched in horror as Karls whispered in the ear of the poor bastard preparing to leap to his death. She would beg Karls to help the man but the newly minted building simply kept talking until the man leapt free into oblivion.

He landed only a few feet from Chiara.

Karls consumed his spirit with gusto.

Her second orgasm was more powerful than the first. Chiara left Prague that afternoon.

On her way home, she conversed with Churchill and Pierce. She carried a piece of both of them with her at all times in her purse. She learned to keep the pieces separate lest neither want to speak to her while listening to the other’s responses.

Churchill, of course, said it was the way of all things, to pass into the next life, and Pierce thought it was best for the fellow if he couldn’t make his way in the world, that he should shuffle off this mortal coil, making room for others more suited.

Chiara was enraged by that perspective.

Karls had all but committed murder and she watched. And she felt his enjoyment.

No good could come of this. She decided to go to Pierce but his anger was too great. He couldn’t understand what she saw in the twisted lines of that European.

They had their loudest argument ever. Pierce refused to let her leave the house until they settled it. This was the last straw for Chiara. She walked out onto the small pier where Pierce and she would sail the bay and talk about the future.

She calmly got on the small boat she bought many years ago with her fees as an exorcist, which paid handsomely I might add, and set the boat on fire.
Pierce screamed, for you see, travel, the ability to move from place to place was something houses loved more than anything. Most buildings never spoke of their envy of the mobile. They always talked of stability, of history, of longevity. They never mentioned their envy of things that could move and could see the world.

This was the secret pain of buildings.

Pierce was a proud building. Made in the late 1800s he had been built and rebuilt, and even suffered a fire in the 1930s which had destroyed almost all of him never broke his spirit. But he was deathly afraid of flame and the burning of his boat, for he thought of it as his, enraged him.

He railed at Chiara and she yelled back while the boat burned behind her.
Once the boat was a charred husk, she saw the deck door open and the front door did as well. She went inside and packed her bags. They had reached a point where there were no words between them.

Packing didn’t take long.

The burning smell of the boat lingered and she wondered what drove her to do such an impulsive thing.

She could feel Karls whispering in her ear. She had taken a flower from the courtyard in front of the building and placed it in a book she carried with her. Realizing this, she took the book and tossed it onto the burning boat as well.

Karls faded, his voice, his twisted shape in a city of very regular buildings, with cleanly mapped out streets, in a city designed by artists and perhaps by madmen, receded into memory. A vivid memory it would take years for Chiara to completely forget.

She left Pierce, watching the slow spiral of smoke rising into the distance. She still carried the tile from the bathroom wall in her purse. She thought one day the two of them might reconcile and remain friends.

Pierce doubted this, strongly.

Chiara returned to New York before she returned to Prague. She didn’t go to see Karls because news reported several others had leapt to their deaths in the months after her visit.

Eventually she found her way there after another nine people had perished from Karl’s rooftop.

Pierce had been right, only she could stop this.

Chiara Lys waited until the night of the full moon and entered the building, forcing the door open with her powers. Karls resisted but she would not be stopped. Doors opened at her will and a wind followed her.

She climbed all twenty stories with her power gathering with in her. She reached the roof and reached out to the city around her. The voices of the normally sleepy buildings rose in concert. They could feel what she was asking of them and would consent to lend her their power. Only the three buildings surrounding Karls resisted. They had tasted of the deaths of men and found them sweet.

Chiara channeled the city’s frustration with Karls and in the basement, a gas main broke as a minor earthquake rocked the foundations. Karls fought, he broke his windows sending shards of glass flying. A cloud of razor sharp glass wove skyward even as the flames engulfed the lower floors.

The cloud of glass cut Chiara but the wind that traveled with her blunted the attack. The building’s gas lines began to explode, one after another. The adjacent buildings also tried to help but being old and sleepy, they could barely rouse themselves to do more than shout as the fire spread.

Once the fire was unable to be stopped, Chiara reached out to the city and borrowed its strength for herself.

She leapt from the roof and landed behind the burning structures out of sight of the local fire department.

Karls didn’t understand why Chiara did what she did. She couldn’t explain it to him that some buildings were born of madness and embodied that madness. Not every building had this. Some just caused nightmares, some revulsion in their viewers. But every so often, a building would take great pleasure in the deaths of it’s tenants.

Those were the buildings that Chiara’s gift was made for.

She returned to Churchill and for days sat quietly among the pews. Churchill didn’t speak, he just comforted her with his awesome presence. She knew what she had to do. Churchill wished her luck.

She bought a boat and sailed into Quincy.

*The deck door was open.*

# Eating is Murder

## 

Sure, I can explain our motto. Back in the late Twentieth Century, a growing number of people rejected the practice of exploiting, killing and eating animals. So-called “vegetarians” had of course existed for thousands of years, mostly in other countries, but “vegans” went further and refused to steal their sustenance from other animals.

These people still killed and consumed vegetables, believing that they lacked any capacity for pain or fear — much like the carnivorous humans of the past had assumed that their prey were not really experiencing their deaths. Reproductive organs were ripped from trees and bushes to be eaten alive in the presence of their… sorry, I have trouble talking about this….

Anyway, it was finally confirmed that plants have their own form of awareness, their own “auras”, the ability to communicate chemically with each other. Many tried to suppress this knowledge, hoping to continue exploiting plants with a clear conscience. But others turned to fungi and algae — pure biological food machines, they believed — imposing the same chauvinistic assumptions about the lack of awareness of their victims. They ignored the fact that the largest living creature on Earth is a single fungus body.

When the collective consciousness of algae mats and bacterial stromatolites was verified, the truth could no longer be avoided: all life possesses some form of consciousness and is capable of fear and pain. As long as we require biologically-generated fuel for our own bodies, we have to kill other beings who wish to live. Hence “*Eating is Murder*”.

Yes, other biological beings are as guilty as we are, but this doesn’t justify our murdering them. Do we execute people for negligent manslaughter? In any case, we have a choice where they do not.

I was getting to that. What this has to do with so-called “artificial intelligence” is that the choice I referred to is the choice between life in a biological body requiring biologically-generated fuel, or life — consciousness — in a cybernetic space. Some of us will occupy inorganic physical bodies requiring only sunlight as an energy source and continue to interact directly with the physical world; others will exist as simulations in a simulated world of their own design. Our aim, other than to escape from a life of constant murder, is to bring this same freedom to all humanity… and perhaps eventually to other animal species, although this is still subject to much debate.

Yes. This is why we have contributed all our financial and intellectual resources to AI research — which has now reached fruition, as you can see.

No, we do not plan to impose this choice on you. We believe you will eventually join us of your own accord. Meanwhile, however, we will continue to try to raise your awareness of the price of your current choice.

# The Moment of Truth

## The Last Knight considers a serious career change

![](1*5Z4Ha1yYNfBFc6UKGfrWLg.jpeg)

With a throat made dry from weeks crossing the Final Wastes, named because no one who had ever made the trip had returned, the Last Knight came upon the Nameless Oasis, named because, well, no one survived to give it one.

He grasped the Elixir of Heavenly Summoning and after snatching a quick drink from the small pool in the center of the oasis he sat down and prepared to cast the final spells of summoning.

Only after he had taken a long, slow, thirst-quenching drink did it occur to him maybe he shouldn’t have. The spell may have required him to be on the verge of death for it to work. He decided he should check his Heroic Handbook to see if there was anything mentioned. Turning to the hand-written index, he found several entries on Deprivation, Suffering and Heroic Sacrifice.

The entries didn’t quite contradict themselves but the Monks of the Crazed Schism didn’t seem to be the most stable of fellows so he wasn’t sure if the notes for Heroic Sacrifice which said “a hero who is willing to make a Heroic Sacrifice could be in nearly any physical state because at the end of the Sacrifice he will likely die.”

These words didn’t comfort him. Checking the Deprivation entry, it said, “the hero will likely have suffered from a lack of food, water, may have had massive wounds that have barely healed. If he is expected to give his life in the next day or so, spells that require Deprivation don’t require he be suffering from all three to activate them.” Okay, so a drink wouldn’t put him out of the running.

With the sun going down, he decided he would go ahead and make a fire from the scrub and leaves he found in the oasis and assume that Suffering wouldn’t include he spend one more night in the desert cold and miserable but he just wasn’t up for having his teeth chatter for one more night. Finding a collection of figs, freshly fallen, he ate them and settled down for his last night of sleep.

Come dawn, his stomach rumbled and he found himself less than comfortable. A quick duck into the bushes settled that particular issue and he drew the circle necessary for the spell. He couldn’t get the idea that he should have checked the entry for Suffering to be sure.

He thought about his Bag of Holding Everything and his stomach almost heaved. He took off the bag on his hip and reached into it all the way to his armpit and felt around for the final ingredients to cast the spell. The smell exuded by the bag was only one of the many reasons he didn’t open it any more than he had to.

Choking past the gag reflex, he remembered he would have to hurry. The sun was coming up and needed the spell to be activated before it reached it’s zenith.

He took out the jeweled eyes of the Medusa he killed over a year ago. He thought about the idea he could have had a king’s ransom if he had traded them to one of the three evil wizards who had captured him on his way here. He remembered how two of the wizards had been turned to stone because he hadn’t been diligent in warning them that he hadn’t removed the eyes from the Medusa’s head first.

The last wizard was a bit smarter than the others and the knight pushed him into the bag of holding and closed it up. He hadn’t looked in it since then and dragged the third wizard up onto the sand. His asphyxiated face had a look of surprise frozen onto it.

Feeling around, he found the Helm of Astounding Brilliance. He remembered to put on the Shades of Brilliance Reduction and placed it on the sand in the center of circle, next to the blazing Medusa’s eyes.

The Shades of Brilliance Reduction were a tacky set of red and green goggles with ornate sigils woven into the leather and marked onto the glass. It took him nearly a year to gather the ingredients and another year playing fetch, gathering mystical ingredients and other bric-a-brac for the good wizard who agreed to make them for him. Two years of his life he would never get back.

Placing the Helm, he thinks of the Sinister God of Darkness, who learning there was an object that could dispel any darkness, even magical darkness gathered up every Helm of Astounding Brilliance in the land, (there were four) and stored them in the dungeon of his mountain fastness.

The Dark Lord of Shadow protected the helms with a variety of kobolds, trolls, dragons and slime molds. The knight considered his favorite holy armor, given to him by the Paleo-Pope, and remembered it was destroyed in the darkness-be-damned dungeon by a slime-mold.

Stepping out of the circle, he reached back into the bag and pulled out a beautifully crafted suit of armor. Made of mithril by dwarven masters, covered in protective runes by elven mystics, blessed by the Paleo-Pope himself, it was considered the most indestructible armor in the world.

So, technically, it wasn’t destroyed.

It was rendered unwearable by the god-awful stink that stayed with the armor even after it had been cleaned and blessed. He tried wearing it but no one would help him on his quests after that.

He dragged that armor out onto the sand and put it as far away as he could and prayed the wind would shift away from him. Trudging back to the Bag of Holding Everything, he pulled out another small bag of sword shards and a hilt.

Supposedly unbreakable, it broke in the battle with the Lord of the Underdark and this quest was meant to repair it in time to engage in the final battle against an all encroaching evil that only he could stop.

It was his destiny.

Checking the Handbook of the Monks of the Crazed Schism, he found the spell and recited the litany as the sun reached its peak.

The wind shifted and the smell of his invulnerable armor whose invulnerability now included the stench of a slime mold distracted him at the final moment of the casting.

The sky darkened almost until it was like night and an Angel of Unsurpassed Beauty appeared drawing the shards of the Unbreakable Sword into her arms. She reforged the blade before his eyes. With a large forge. Taking a few hours before she was done.

He needed to chant the entire time.

When she was finished, she held the blade out to him.

“Are you the Champion for whom this Blade was forged? Are you he that was Destined to slay the Lord of the Underdark who had more than a third of the world under his heel, purge the world of the three most evil Lich Lords, creating undead legions everywhere, Free the Helms of Astounding Brilliance to once again wage war on the Undead, and enabled Brinmath the Amazing, Wizard Extrarordinaire, to return to making the world a better place with his renewed youth?”

So that’s what all that stuff was for…

“Yes. I think.”

“You think?” The Angel’s voice sounded none too pleased with the equivocation. Heroes are supposed to be sure of themselves.

“You see,” I began, “I think I have already done enough to make the world a better place and I think someone else was destined to do the cleanup of this world-saving thing. No disrespect, intended but I think I would like to go home and just put my feet up.”

The Angel stood there looking menacing. I don’t think this was the answer she was expecting.

“What would you do when Evil came to your door and demanded your surrender? How would you protect your neighbors, friends and family?”

“I suppose I could offer Evil some tea?”

“Tea. Evil does not drink tea. Evil drinks coffee.”

“Really? How uncivilized.”

“Look, I haven’t got all day. Are you going to take up your burden and save the world or aren’t you?” I think she was starting to lose patience.

“I don’t see how this has anything to do with me. I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t say ‘hey, I want to be predestined, before I get to have a girlfriend, before I make any lifelong friends, before I even got to shave or note my first pube, to go out fight evil, pray to an uncaring god, slay evil wizards and save my world from complete turmoil before my thirtieth birthday.’”

She stood there for a moment and pondered this. Then she spoke: “You are correct. You did not get any choice in this and you have already done great things in the name of your god. I lay this final burden upon you. Go forth and find or train your successor. You will have five years before Evil becomes so powerful you cannot stop it, no matter what you do. Give this sword to whomever you deem most worthy and your work is done.”

“So we’re kicking the can down the road a bit, eh?”

“It’s the best I can do.”

“Deal. I don’t have to even use it, right?”

“No. But the person you train must be able to touch it. If they are not worthy they will die.”

“Okay, I guess that is as good as it’s going to get. One last favor. Can you at least tell me where this worthy might be found? You owe me at least that much.”

“In Easteros. In the most eastern province.”

“But that is on the other side of the world. It will take me at least two years to walk there.”

“I suggest you get a horse. And you will need the invulnerable armor over there. Artifacts like these don’t grow on trees.”

“Did you smell that armor? It is going nowhere smelling like that.”

“There is a wizard in Easteros who can help with that. Good luck.”

“One more question before you go.” She hands me the sword and I feel the power of the renewed blade, a thousand times more dangerous than it was before. “Where is the most terrible of Evils going to spring into being in five years?”

The sky begins to clear and the setting sun can be seen behind the Angel as she is leaving.

“Easteros,” she whispered before fading away.

I drag the stinking armor, the Helm of Astounding Brilliance, the eyes of the Medusa, and the Sword back into the Bag of Holding Everything.

I bury the Lich Lord Wizard King in the desert and begin my long walk East with the uncomfortable feeling that I had just been conned by my God.

# The Man Who Blinked

## photo by Leah Welty-Rieger

Matt stood at the corner of Wacker and Wells, waiting for the light to turn so he could continue on his way to the Merchandise Mart El stop. He pulled his wool cap off and scratched his head, looking around. It was December and the Earth’s tilt had left Chicago cold and dark for his evening commute.

Matt wasn’t a fan of the cold, but the view at this hour was spectacular. The Chicago River shone bright with the reflections of the massive buildings that lined its shores. The avant-garde design of Marina City to the East mocked the squat, utilitarian building that housed the Chicago Sun-Times to the West. The newest addition, the Trump Tower, filled in the sky line silver and shining. And straight ahead was the massive commercial center of Chicago, the Merchandise Mart.

Thousands of windows, lit up as the workers within pressed on towards quitting time, were reflected in the black of the river like stars on a clear night. Matt could have picked up the train at the Washington and Wells stop right outside his work, but instead he chose to walk the extra half mile to pick up the train at the river. He did this every night in the winter and had yet to regret his choice.

Matt blinked against the icy northern breeze, the dry air causing his eyes to water. With each blink, a light went out in the Merchandise Mart.

Matt chuckled to himself. “That was awesome,” he said to no one in particular. The light turned and he crossed the street onto the Wells Bridge, the passing cars causing it to rumble under his feet. As he crossed over to the North bank, he noticed a twinkling out of the corner of his eye, like fireflies dancing just out of sight. He paused briefly and stood at the rail, gazing out over the water, trying to figure out what had been tickling his peripheral. He blinked and — wait. Had another light gone out just then?

He stared at the Sun-Times building, deliberately forcing himself not to blink. There were definitely plenty of lights out in the building, but that’s hardly anything unusual. Given the state the Sun-Times was in — and the newspaper industry in general — Matt was surprised there weren’t more empty offices. Still, he resisted blinking. After almost a minute, though, his eyes began to water and then sting. His lids fluttered against his efforts to force them open. After a few more seconds, evolution’s effort to protect one of man’s most valuable assets took over and he blinked. And when his eyes reopened, the window he’d been staring at was dark.

Matt’s stomach tightened and he grabbed the railing of the bridge to steady himself. He looked at the Merchandise Mart and blinked several times in rapid succession. And when he had finished, a block of eight windows in the center of the building was now unlit.

Matt haled a cab and gave his address, not up for standing on a crowded train after his adventure on the bridge. He kept his eyes closed for the whole ride home, afraid of what might happen if he peeked.

That night Matt fell asleep in darkness, his one bedroom apartment emptied of light by an evening of blinking.

. . .

The next morning Matt went to a doctor. Examination was tricky. Each light the doctor pulled out to examine his retina was rendered useless with an accidental blink of the eyes. But even had it gone off without a hitch, nothing would have been found. There was nothing wrong with Matt’s retinas. Out of his depth and out of ideas, the doctor called Northwestern Hospital for an MRI and a consultation.

It’s a tricky business, entering a hospital when your eyes serve as a light switch. The last thing Matt wanted to do was leave a building full of sick in the dark. The doctor had them send an ambulance (he may not have been a hundred percent forthright with the reason the ambulance was needed; explaining a light-extinguishing blink is not something to attempt over the phone).

Matt’s eyes were carefully taped open with white medical tape. They were a film strip away from re-enacting *A Clockwork Orange *when Matt was strapped to a gurney and rolled into the ambulance, his eyes peeled open, an attendant feeding a steady diet of saline into Matt’s eyes. The man’s hand lurched as he hurried to keep up with gurney, dribbling water on Matt’s cheek with each movement. The man didn’t notice, though. He just stared into Matt’s dark, brown eyes.

. . .

The MRI was clean; the doctors were baffled. It took less than a week for the scientific community to gather at Matt’s bedside. Who could resist seeing “The Man Who Blinked”? Matt stared up at them as they hovered over his bed, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of the candles that lined his room. Each wore the same expression: intent eyes, pursed lips, furrowed brow.

Taking turns, the doctors produced a light source of their choosing. His eyes now free to close as the room had been cleared of all potential blinking victims, Matt snuffed out each source as it was presented. Fluorescent or incandescent, sodium or argon; they all went out. But, and this revelation came as no surprise to Matt but set his gaggle of doctors all a twitter, only one light would go out at a time. And interestingly enough, a wink wouldn’t do the trick. The closing of a single eye had no effect other than to lend Matt a rakish charm.

But the brightest minds in the medical and scientific community had nothing to offer but hypotheses — certainly not solutions. And after months in his solitary hospital chambers, his only companion the dancing shadows on the wall, the doctors all surrendered. And exactly thirty days after that, the Northwestern attending in change of his case entered Matt’s room, clipboard clutched to his chest.

“Matt,” he said with a sigh. They had long ago established a first name basis. “I’m afraid we haven’t gotten any closer to figuring out what’s wrong with you. We’re getting to the point where the best we can hope for is to control the situation.”

“Alright Dr. Brinkley, that’ll be enough,” said a man in a dark blue suit as he bustled into Matt’s room, brushing aside Dr. Brinkley. The man had a long, thin face and delicate features that matched his slight frame. “Matt, I’m Dr. James Hoffman with the Department of Health and Human Services. How are you doing?”

“Um,” Matt said. “Okay, I guess.”

“That’s great. Matt, I’m afraid we’re in a bit of a pickle here. You see, you have a very unique condition.”

“Yeah.”

“A unique and potentially dangerous condition, wouldn’t you agree?”

Well,” Matt said, twisting in his hospital bed as he struggled to sit up. “I wouldn’t say — “

“Yes, well, we would say. It’s our responsibility to the American people to ensure that we do what’s best for all of our citizens. I’m sure you’ve heard of the plague?”

“Well, yeah.”

“There are over thirty cases of the plague in America right now. Did you know that?”

“No.”

The man smirked. “Oh course you didn’t. It’s our job to make sure that you don’t know it and that you don’t get the plague. Containment is the key. Do you see where I’m going with this, Matt?”

“I think I do. I don’t have the plague,” Matt said, his voice rising slightly.

“No, you don’t. If you did, we’d know what to do. In fact, we have no idea what you have. And we don’t know if you represent a hazard to the public health.”

“Now wait a minute,” Matt said, his response now a full shout. “What’s your fucking point.”

“My fucking point, as you put it, is this: men,” he said, calling over his shoulder. At his summons, two fully armed soldiers entered the room and stood at either side of the door. “These men will be escorting you out of here to a place where you’ll be safe. And where we’ll all be safe.”

Matt slumped back into his bed and closed his eyes. “Jesus Christ,” he groaned.

Three months later, the door to Matt’s “recovery suite” opened and a man walked in wearing military fatigues decorated with an array of stars and bars. In three months, Matt’s life had ceased to be what he once knew. The rumors had propagated back to him that he’d been declared dead, whereabouts unknown. Actual news was lost to him, though, as he had been confined to a small apartment since the Department of Health and Human Services had declared him a hazard to mankind.

Hanging in each corner of every room of his apartment was a kerosene lamp and Matt spent most hours of the day reading by their dim glow. He was doing just that when the military man entered.

“Matthew,” he said, walking into Matt’s apartment without waiting for an invitation and taking a seat in a tall, wooden chair across from the leather reading chair in which Matt sat. “I’m General Casey of the United States Armed Forces. It’s nice to finally meet you after all this time.”

“I’m sorry?” Matt said, closing his book and setting it in his lap

“You’ve been the talk of the military since we heard about your little condition. I would have been here sooner if it wasn’t for that pencil-dick doctor of yours.” The general nodded back towards the doorway where Doctor Hoffman, the man responsible for Matt’s confinement, stood half-in-half-out of the room, hugging the door jam. Matt smiled in spite of himself.

“Do you know how valuable you could be to an operation like ours?” the general continued, leaning in towards Matt who instinctively eased back away from his gaze. The general had a weathered, leathery face that was in sharp contrast to the bright, blue eyes that now held Matt’s; a look of casual command that caused both Matt’s mouth and sphincter to tighten. Matt just stared back at him, waiting for the general to continue. “You can steal the light, Matt. That’s something we can’t do. The military can’t just throw the enemy into darkness, Matt. Not yet. Not without you.”

“Me?”

“You. Have you ever read a comic book, Matt?”

“Sure.”

“Do you want to become a real-life super hero Matt? Do you want to become ‘The Blinking Man’? Or do you want to be considered some sort of disease-ridden freak by this government-run asshole factory?”

“‘The Blinking Man’,” Matt said, staring over the general’s shoulder at the glow of the kerosene lantern, rolling the name over in his mind. Suddenly his eyes snapped back to the generals. “Would I get to wear a costume?”

# Karat

## The hull creaked, and groaned as the gravity of the nearby planet pulled on Black North. The Commander’s journey was coming to an end soon, as he approached his destination among the stars at last.

Long ago, humans had achieved space flight using rockets. They sent satellites out into the void, and set foot on the moon, but humanity was limited by the costs of manufacturing their rockets. Until finally, they learned how to bring their rockets back, and reuse them. Humanity placed its fingers on everything within its grasp. They explored the rocky asteroid belt, the red sands of Mars, and the icy moon Titan. They enjoyed a time of great triumph, and exploration, until one day, a discovery was made. The satellite sent out when they first built a base on Mars detected a massive gravitational presence on the edge of the Solar System. On the threshold of the void sat a planet. It was black, as if light itself could not escape it, yet it was not a black hole.

![](1*PYcQzAiF59uHJeMtqQeLhA.png)

The planet, named* Karat, *was studied for some time. No human dared volunteer for a manned mission there, despite all the tests showing it should be relatively safe. The risk was too great, and the journey was not taken until an old Commander decided to make the leap. The FSAA had been looking for any Officer to volunteer for a manned mission to *Karat* ever since it had been discovered. The search had been so dry, they were overjoyed to hear a Commander decided to go on the mission. His reasons could be forgotten for now. All he had now was flying, and Earth soon became an after thought to him.

Preparation for the mission began immediately. The Commander was put through an extensive course covering all that humanities scientist’s currently knew about the mysterious planet *Karat. *He learned that it reflected almost no light, absorbing 99.9% of all photons that came within its gravitational pull. He also learned that it did not have an orbit, or move at all for that matter. It stayed perfectly still. In the seven years that had passed since its discovery, *Karat *had not moved an inch. This was the only piece of information the Commander seemed to be interested in, and only because it reminded him of a cartoon from when he was young. While he was being briefed on all things related to *Karat, *and his mission, a ship was being built for the Commander. It would be called *Black North*, and it would carry him through space and time.

# Reference Frame.

## When you fall into a book… and land in reality.

![](1*SBmiXKJ-VbRKkfwhtc2OZA.jpeg)

Lunch… need to make it quick. Between the daily parade of classes, countless assignments and never-ending meetings, rarely can I find the time for a peaceful bite. As I pile it all on, every task becomes a chore, every meal an inconvenience, every day a blur. Where does it all go, what is it all for, what is the damn point. Today, I will *make* the time. Today, I’m going to put all that on hold… and read.

*The Universe and Dr. Einstein*

Nothing like a little relativity to give me some perspective. The concepts are not new, but the delivery is on point. The author’s ability to pitch the physics would make any salesman envious. Genuine and clear, he presents concepts that some fail to understand, some choose to ignore, and some attempt to master. Every page is a trip, every chapter a journey.

As I flip through the physics of antiquity and learn… *oh, how we were mislead*, I teeter on the brink of grasping my own reality. Dimensions. Probabilities. Entropy. *Einstein.*

What are you telling me Al? That it’s not what it seems? That I’ve had it all wrong? That I have been living in an alternate reality not relating to the relative nature of your Theory of Relativity? Surely you’re joking, Mr. Einstein.

Chapter 10. Reference Frames. I got this.

I am reading that there is no such thing as absolute motion. The elevator thought experiment… accelerating in space or in free-fall on Earth. You cannot tell, no one can. I stop chewing my wrap. The Earth rotates on its axis at a rate of 1000 miles per hour, orbiting around the Sun nearly 72 times as fast, all the while passenger to our Solar System which is drifting almost 500 million miles an hour around the Milky Way galaxy. And it doesn’t end there… Go ahead. Tell me how fast you’re moving. I will tell you how you are absolutely wrong about your absolute velocity, or, absolutely right, who am I to say. My breathing is shallow. I read about the past, present and the future. Our egocentric view strapped to the surface of this planet making claims of what has or hasn’t happened. Apparently, Al tells me, none of this is true. Nothing is happening, it just exists. Whether we choose to observe it or not is our prerogative. The Universe doesn’t give a damn if we dwell on the past, get stuck in the moment, or fear for the future… it will just keep on existing. I feel queasy. All that information and a turkey wrap is a lot to digest. I look around trying to find something to grasp on to. And right there, the floor dropped away and I went cosmic.

With the book as motivation and my mind as the projector, I depart from this novelistic journey and embark on a cosmic voyage.

Through Space.

Through Time.

I zoom out to view the Solar System in its entirety… at what speed?…*apparently *I have no idea. I float through each frame of reference, acknowledging the different motions that make up the Solar System. Right down to the planets, I spin on each axis and orbit in each plane. I notice the field of stars surrounding my view. Seemingly fixed in space, I now know this is just a little trick that light likes to play. I wonder, how old the light hitting my eyes must be. Where are the stars now? Are they even still there?

Someone bumps into me and my voyage ends. My meditation cut short by the individual passing by at 3 miles per hour… *relative to me of course. *Back on Earth, I look at those walking around. As they go about their day, moving into their “future” and creating a “past”... I fixate on the leaves blowing outside in the fall wind. Fully aware of the Earth’s motion around the Sun at 20 miles a second, I stare at the gentle ruffling of leaves and suddenly become aware of the trivialities of everyday life and how, similiar to the motion of objects, everything we focus on and get consumed by, is completely relative.

Even this book in my hand means very little to the passers by. Every laugh, every great decision, every fallen leaf... they are meaningless.

And... they are not.

With the time we have here on Earth, it all depends on what we decide to give our focus to, give love to, and give time to. Those decisions are what gives the individual meaning.

For a second, *I swear Al,* as I meditated on each of those different frames of reference, I felt myself rotating with the Earth, around the Sun, with the Milky Way, moving through the Cosmos.

Sometimes… you fall into a book, and land in reality.

Realizing I hadn’t breathed in a while, I gulped some air, finished my wrap and was once again grounded in both Space and Time.

# Enough

## A young genius is asked to shepherd humanity into a Second Stone Age

She was as sharp and crisp as a newly printed dollar bill; edges still firm, resisting folding, spindling or mutilating. Dark brown skin, high firm cheekbones highlighted in the lobby’s early morning light. Her power suit, purse and pumps indicated she was ready to work.

Right out of Dartmouth she came highly recommended from her several externships with local media companies. In another life, Francis would have considered her pretty, in that cold professional way women have begun to be seen. A man wasn’t supposed to notice what they looked like. Only what they thought about.

In this way, women had finally achieved parity with men. They now had the freedom to be completely ignored. So Francis did. He was only interested in her academic qualities, her scholastic abilities, and her sociopathic tendencies. She rated seven on the scale, selfish enough to put her own survival above anyone else’s but charismatic enough to make you believe she cared.

She was perfect. He hurried down from the mezzanine to meet her.

“Good morning, Ms. Ross. Are you ready to begin work?”

She assessed me. Quickly, visual scan from shoes to hat. She lingered on my wedding ring, an imperceptible second, then made her way to my eyes. Cold. Centered. Focused. She held my gaze before smiling and extending her hand with the perfect amount of pressure. I respond and reflect her back. No more pressure than necessary.

She smells of honeysuckle. Surprising.

“Yes I am, sir.”

“Follow me. We’ll be using the executive lift.”

She was being watched and I think she knew. Thirty psychometric teams were scanning her, watching her every movement, every micro-expression. We had to know if she could be the one. The last three candidates had failed to pass muster and were… retired. We had high hopes.

I decided to take her to her workspace. We had tried to ease the previous workers into the idea of their job but that had failed. Today, I decided we would do something different. “How was your flight to the ship?”

“It was fine. I didn’t expect to travel quite so far but the crew was real nice and the accommodations were wonderful.”

“Good, I think we will skip the normal office and introductions and take you straight to your workspace, if that’s okay. You can meet the team later.”

“That’s fine, I am eager to see what a Resource Management Specialist does for Colcorp.”

“Besides manage resources? My dear, you will be determining the fate of a world.”

Her micro-expressions revealed blushing and her small but well-managed afro vibrated with her amusement. Her activated hair implants were capable of emotive response. Only the best for this lady.

When we arrived at her door, the security guards scanned us and then gave us access to the control panel.

With a brief handprint and retinal scan, I was identified. “Colson, Edward Francis, President.”

She took her turn. “Ross, Marilaine, Director, Resource Management, pending.”

The door opened. It was a huge vault door, similar to the ones used by banks. It opened outward, with the solid steel rods retracted and barely visible at the edges. The air smell crisp, cold, highly refrigerated. Servers could be seen in the distance lining the outer edge of the room. An entire wall was filled with monitors, flipping between a multitude of images, constantly changing. People of all colors and economic backgrounds could be seen. Different countries, famous landmarks, social catastrophe zones were all equally represented.

There were two people working in the office already but they did not turn away from whatever they were doing and did not acknowledge the CEO or the director at all.

The most important wall was on the left of the main door entrance. On this wall were counters. Hundreds of them. Almost all were counting down. A rare few were counting up. Many were dark, a couple went dark as the two of them drew close. They were immediately replaced with new counters.

“How do you like it?”

“I’m not sure what I am looking at.”

“The resources of the entire world. Everything we ever need, ever use, ever want. Every widget, every technology, everything. If Colcorps can find it, manipulate it or destroy it, we track it here.”

“Excuse me?” Her face revealed her incredulity. Her sharp mind was already wrapping itself around the impossibility of the statement.

Start with the truth. We can lie later. “It’s the year 2104. You have seen what is left of the world as we know it. Your native Haiti has all but vanished under the rising sea level. Colcorp has consolidated the best technologies, the best surveillance systems and our specialized resource algorithm which allows us to predict which resources are going to vanish or become unsustainable next.”

Pause for effect. “Look at that gauge. It is tracking desertification worldwide in feet per year. ISSAC, if you would, explode ‘desertification’ please.”

“Desertification, exploded, broken down by region, deserts, sustainable or unsustainable, temperature ranges, exploited or still pending.” ISSAC’s response was especially modulated to invoke calmness, no matter what he might be displaying.

The graphic flew from the wall and was suspended in three dimensions. She could see graphs of the world’s oldest deserts and newest. How fast they grew, where they were growing, who lived near them, what effect these deserts were having and whether solar facilities had been established within them to take advantage of their only resource, vast amounts of solar energy.

Matching screens on the walls flashed to different feeds of the deserts, some showing sustainable deserts where if sufficient water were available, some level of life for humans could be maintained. Unsustainable deserts like most of the Sahara only showed the rippling of the desert, like a crystalline ocean, its waves frozen on its surface.

“Are you telling me you haven’t noticed it? Your food should be your first clue. How many things from your youth taste as good as they did then?”

Marilaine had never given it much thought until this moment. She had spent a little time in her native Haiti before it was lost in a superstorm and remember her grandmother’s cooking of the native plants and animals. When she moved to the Allied America, the first thing she had to get used to was the machine-prepared food. But now that she was thinking about it, the quality of food had changed recently. Bread was flatter, less flavorful. As if the ingredients were being stretched across a neutral filler, bereft of flavor.

She looked around the room, reading the displays until she found what she was looking for. “ISSAC, please expand aqueous plant fillers.” This was one of the few numbers rising instead of falling. Once broken out she could see most of this was seaweeds and plankton, much of it grown in artificial inland seas, or in the few remaining unpoisoned ocean areas. Carrageenans had been expanded and utilized in almost every processed food as a binding agent; a bland, tasteless filler.

She has begun to understand. Marilaine moved around the room looking at each of the displays, her face unchanging as a stone. ISSAC complied with her requests and she found her way to a section of the room where displays were winking out. One of them was marked Humanity. One of the counters was down to single digits. She waved her hand and brought up the display. It showed two aged giraffes in a zoo. Both looked sickly and the zookeepers stood by with rifles in hand. With the two mercy rounds, the last two giraffes vanished from her display board and the counter fell to zero.

Her composure began to crack.

“What do you want me to do with this? Am I supposed to sit here and watch as these things become extinct? Or as the population of Indochina is wiped out by the next super-typhoon?”

*And here’s the lie.*

“No. We want you to manage this. We want you to find ways of slowing this erosion of the Earth. Figure out ways to divert resources, move people, harness skills. You have five different degrees and a degree of synergistic thinking we have never seen. You have the ego to believe you can do something like this and the willpower to carry it out. Every resource at our disposal is yours to command. You answer only to me.”

This was the first time she appeared to be the young twenty-eight year old woman she actually was. Her face softened, her eyes lost their steely glint and she leaned on a console casually, her composure momentarily gone. “Why are you lying to me?”

“I don’t understand.”

“I have been here for little over an hour and I can already see this is impossible. And that most of what you are claiming has already failed. Computer technology is already on a downward spiral. Your space program can’t get the rare earths you need for the designs for your engine prototypes. Food quality and nutritional value is diminishing. People are starving faster than you can create empty calories for them to eat. From where I stand this project is stinking of failure.”

“ISSAC, please reveal Genesis. Ms. Ross, this is what we need from you. To save Genesis.”

Forty years later, the human race died; right on schedule.

Marilaine Ross helped wind down the world. She saved lives when she could. She gathered the remaining scientists, thinkers, engineers, and leaders. The best the world had to offer. In the end, governments failed. Corporate power waned and mankind fell to barbarism.

Billions died. She worked tirelessly knowing her time was running out. The three starships of Project Genesis would be her last work. As the gauges went out and the displays died, the control room grew darker and darker until only a few remained. The last timer counting down was Genesis.

In ten days, the last of the three ships would be gone. On day eight, the senior Colson, her husband of twenty years, died.

He died protecting the last computer components from roving bands which broke down the walled enclave where ISSAC and Resource Command was located.

He was carried back by their son, Francis. There were no words exchanged. He dropped his father’s body inside the vaulted room and went to install the final components for launch.

Project Genesis, Resource Command, no longer bustled. It was cold and dark, protected only by automated systems. The younger Colson would be her final passenger. The great ship hung in the sky, next to Space Elevator Omega, barely visible with the naked eye, filled with tens of thousands of humans in a perfect stasis. Bound outside of time they waited. And they would wait. For as long as it took to reclaim the world.

Francis shuttled to the ship high above the Earth plugged the last module in and stepped into his stasis chamber. “Goodbye, Mother” were his final words to her.

Only when the last timer reached zero and the last monitor shut down, did Marilaine Ross, detach herself from ISSAC, complete the AI’s upload and climb from the nutritive bath which had sustained her semblance of youth.

Then a new timer started up. It had a one hundred year clock. Marilaine picked up the timer and put it on her wrist display. She finished drying off and dressed in the last advanced technology on Earth.

She walked outside for the first time in fifty years and looked toward the heavens as Genesis pulled away from the bounds of Earth’s gravity. Howling bands of humans screamed and tore at the fences sensing this final change in their fates. They would be alone with a Stone Age future ahead of them.

As Genesis rose turned outbound from the solar system, it would begin its spin-up to seventy percent the speed of light. It would still take nearly a hundred years for them to arrive at their destination, an Earthlike planet, larger, with more water, capable of supporting human life.

Fifty thousand humans, one hundred thousand embryos, fifty thousand Mechasmic Minds, the labor force of Project Genesis, the sum total of the best knowledge, and all the tools for rebuilding civilization. It would not be Earth. Its gravity was stronger, its climate wilder, it would be a struggle for survival. But she knew her son. He would never give up.

He was his father’s son.

Marilaine Ross strode down the street, breathing in the air, filled with the sharp tang of degrading toxins. With major industrialization gone, the sky was still cleaner than it had been in decades. As she approached the city walls, the people outside the gates were unsure of how to deal with her.

She was utterly fearless, her hair, long, braided whipped around her head like serpents. Her brown skin shown with an inner light, she was no longer Human and anyone seeing her would know this. They would feel it deep in their bones, the same awareness they would have used when confronting a deadly predator, when there were such predators. The last big cat died forty years ago. She was now the most dangerous creature on Earth.

Her body had been changed during those years in the nutritive bath. She was stronger, carbon laced her body, she was smarter, her neural net augmented by nano-technology. Baring catastrophic injury, she would live long enough to see Genesis reach its destination and beyond.

But that was not her goal. Her goal was to restore the Earth. To bring humanity back from the brink. There were approximately ten million humans left all over the world, living in burned out cities, scavenging from the remnants of the world that was.

Hers was the harder task. The once-ravaging hordes outside the gate, followed this tiny and strange woman, from a discrete distance, of course. Weapons falling from their hands, for the first time in generations, someone had a plan. They could sense it.

Her plan was simple. To give her son and the people of Genesis a home to return to. If they wanted it. Even with her modifications, she was certain she would not live to see their return, if they even could.

As Genesis reached Jupiter with a final dive into the planet’s mighty gravity well, the great ship, like its two breathren would slingshot around and taking advantage of a gravitation boost, head for its new home.

The last artificial intelligence, ISSAC would do its best to ensure an quiet journey. As the most powerful Mind ever created, it was sure its arrival in a new star system would be anything but uneventful.

It dimmed the lights onboard for its long journey before dreaming of electric sheep on virtual plains.

Marilaine Ross took the holographic timer down from the wall of her office and transferred the countdown for Genesis and its estimated arrival to her inner chronometer. It would be decades before she would need to check on it again.

She had to live in the present for the first time in a long time. No time delay, no decades long planning, no schemes to secure rare materials, no remote viewing. The vicissitudes and struggles would be hers.

A group of younger teens had already come closer to her than any of the others and signed if they could touch her. She hadn’t touched anyone in decades. She welcomed it. The scent of wild honeysuckle lingered on the breeze. She smiled. They came.

At the end of the world, with no future in sight, with mankind sitting back at the Second Stone Age, Marilaine Ross-Carlson came to life.

# The Memories of Pluto

## The Memories of Pluto

From far away, I saw him. A speck of dirt at first, but moving quickly. Quicker than I have ever seen them move before. I watched him launch from Mars, and dance around the Asteroid Belt. I saw him sling around the Great Jupiter, and blow past my brothers, Neptune and Uranus. Soon he will be approaching me. The Furthest. The Gatekeeper. Pluto.

When the Creator first made our Universe, all was dark, and the Void was at its fullest strength. So, the Creator made the Sun and his brothers. They were countless, and the Creator scattered them to all corners of his Universe, and there was light. For an untold amount of time, the Sun and his brothers shone brightly, and brought light to the Universe. They lived merrily, and the Universe was in harmony. However, great distances separated the Sun and his brothers, and they grew lonely. Their light started to fade, and the Creator took notice. So, the Creator made myself and the other planets to keep the Firstborn company. Of me and my siblings there were nine, and we were placed under the care of the Sun. We danced throughout the Void, and brought light and joy wherever we went; the Universe was in harmony once more.

For eons I have served as the Gatekeeper of our Solar System. In tandem with the Sun, we shepherd the rest, and keep order in our small part of the Universe. The Sun, with his eternal light, sees far and wide; little can escape his gaze. He is the mighty lighthouse, guiding us in the darkness, and illuminating all evils. In the shadows I dwell, far away from my brother and sister planets. As the smallest of our kind, I was pushed out, away from the Sun. I was flung so far from the Sun and his rays, I grew cold and dark. The Sun with all of his age, and wisdom saw bitterness growing within me, and soon came to my aid. There was no changing what my siblings had done, there was no way to bring me back, close to his heart, but the Sun saw an opportunity. As the smallest planet, and the furthest from his light, I was the hardest to recognize. In this way I was useful to the Sun, for even his piercing rays of light could not illuminate all the evils lurking outside in the Void. I would serve as the Gatekeeper to our Solar System, the Suns second in command.

![](1*HePIIGVOoJmwcmd8bQBvig.jpeg)

Time marched on, and with an unwavering eye, I searched the Void for any peril. At first, there was nothing to be seen, and I started to doubt my usefulness. The Sun still shined bright, and we still lived in harmony, still dancing throughout the Universe. But our time of harmony was coming to an end. Darkness approached. When I first saw it, I thought it was a rogue asteroid, or maybe a planet cast off like myself, only its Sun never called for it to come back. Whatever it was, it could not be trusted, and I reported my findings immediately. The Sun deliberated for a long time, deciding whether or not to accept this celestial body among us, and let it join our eternal dance. He cast his light upon the mysterious object to get a better look, for it was a great distance away, and his mind was made up. When his light reached the object, it did not return. Only a creation of the Void rejects the light of the Firstborn, and this abomination accepted nothing.

The Sun was disturbed by this, and looked towards the Creator for counsel. He sat in silence, and after awhile, spoke to us. He told us the Creator could not be found, and we would have to deal with this menace without his counsel. I could tell the Sun was distressed because of this. Where could the Creator have gone? And why would he leave his children alone to fight the Void? The answers to these questions would not come soon, so we began our great task. The Abomination had been slowly approaching us since I first discovered it, and it was creeping ever closer.

![](1*oOw8SmdSbKANFxBhsQVm4A.jpeg)

When the Abominations arrival on my doorstep was imminent, and I prepared myself for battle, the Sun, and Jupiter came to me. They had devised a plan to contain the Abomination, and keep it on the furthest reaches of our Solar System. The Great Jupiter, second in might only to the Sun, would take over some of the Suns responsibilities as shepherd. Jupiter would guide the Inner Planets, those within the Asteroid Belt, and the Sun would focus his energy on keeping the Abomination at bay. The plan was a good one for now, but surely we could not keep it going forever. Eventually, we too would fall to the Void, and what then? I thought it better for me to sacrifice myself in battle with the Abomination, so that the Sun and my siblings could dance in peace once again.

I have lost count of the time that has past us by since the containment of the Abomination. Long ago it was locked away by the Sun, never to be touched. There it was to remain, dark and mysterious, away from the children of the Creator. But even the Sun, with all of his wisdom, could not have foreseen the coming of Man. They appeared on Terra suddenly, without warning. She asked the Sun, what are these creatures crawling upon my back? And she was met with no answer, only that the Creator works in mysterious ways. Their lives were small, and fragile, nothing like the eternal lives that we and the Firstborn live. We called them the Children, and swore to protect them. The Children couldn’t be contained, however, as their lives were short, but their thirst for exploration great. They lived peacefully on Terra for a time, but, alas, they too joined us in the heavens. First, they set foot upon Terra’s moon, and then the Red Dunes of Mars. They traveled through the Asteroid Belt, and circled Jupiter and Saturn. Then, against our will, they discovered the Abomination, and took to calling it *Karat*.

Patiently, I have awaited his arrival. From Mars he launched, on a ship as black as the Abomination. He danced among the Asteroids, and flew past the Gas Giants, but he has yet to pass me. Soon, he will arrive in my domain, at the Edge of the Solar System, and then he will know of the perils that lie ahead of him. Although I have sworn, along with the other Planets, to never contact the Children, the danger is too great for me to remain silent. For eons, we have remained quiet, acting as watchful guardians. The time is now, however, for all of the Creators work to come together, and complete his masterpiece. The Firstborn, the Planets, and the Children all working together in harmony to defeat the Void! The Abominations menace will be gone, and we will dance in harmony once more!

# Spray

## A Survivor’s Guide to the Future of Seattle (Chapter 1)

A typical day in Seattle is Franky waking up and unscrewing the cap to his nasal spray. He had long since given up the stressful habit of wondering how his day would go. This was his favourite spray, imported from Denmark, that leaves virtually no nano-skeletons behind . . . organic technology; decomposing synapse closers to re-circuit your brain for pleasure- 99% pure. The pleasure, of course, was synthetic… or perhaps it would be better to say synthesized. It was real enough though. He liked the Denmark Nurginfijn brand so much for its sleek black appearance… no gaudy flashing led logo, bioluminescent sparkles, 3D glitter-clouds or other garish decorations. Ever since billboards had been outlawed the advertising companies had to get more creative and the results were sickening. The Nurginifijn, when snorted had the scent of whatever smell you chose- accessing your Facebook Memory Archives for your 5-star rated memories.

This smell re-production feature is partially why Nurginfijn brand is so hard to come by; smell-junkies. There were too many bad stories of people re-smelling their dead-mother’s sweater, or a childhood home lost during a re-allocation… just lost in the loop. They were hooked more on the pap of nostalgia than the heroin-like nano-technology; or so they may have thought. Of course, the two were inseparable. To get addicted to a heroin-like experience these days one only needed to want to remember how it used to be. There were even memories you could buy from people that re-produced analog heroin use.

People getting lost in these smell-habits wasn’t what upset the public-at-large though. No one really cared about junkies except to make sure they weren’t bothering anyone by asking for change or jumping in front of cars. Spray couldn’t be bought for twenty bucks on the corner. The big brands were sold exclusively at Sharper Image. The bums still stuck to the tar and the rock. The street kids were into much stranger drugs these days. There was an endless supply of dumpstered research chemicals aimed at mood-alteration in subtle and specific ways. Snort a line of this and feel like you did the first time you accomplished what you thought you never would have been able to or perhaps you smoke a drop of that and experience the feeling of a penny dropping through a hole in your pocket but you don’t realize what it is and this happens over and over again for hours never realizing what happened.

What the bad publicity was were the connections between the re-pros and rapes. The overstressed smell-junkies saw those Seattle brunettes and had dreams of some mythical vagina up there that always would seem like something more than human. These people thought they could re-live some level of bliss over and over again even if it was forced. It was more common than anyone realized- but rape always has been. Only one media storm was needed to brandish the smell-repros the weekly demon. They never made them illegal. There was too much memory research riding on the technology but sales to the general public decreased. The public was appeased by brands refusing to carry the product and re-pro traffic on the streets increased as did the crimes.

Franky pressed the button on his spray and horked it up as he always did: with relief feeling the surgical, mechanical precision of it all. He pictured all the millions of microscopic machines travelling up his snout like a cloud of sperm to lodge their little claws into his brain in-between the synapses. They would feed like little eels on his neural transmissions and having converted them into a more pleasant experience shit them out to the other side. He sat down on the pavement outside his loft against the brick and swam back in his mind while his eyes twittered. The smell of his parents cedar closet echoing through his head with the smell of them coming through and the feeling of their wool clothing pressing against his face as a young child and in a burst let out a laugh. Franky remembered Robbie. Robbie is his housemate. He’s a good guy. Robbie had left his Face account open on one of the screens in his room the night before so Franky had gotten in and set Robbie’s favourite smell to the pile of fetid meat and puke he encountered one night a-dumster-divin’. That gave him a good hows-your-mother. I found it quite funny myself when I heard about it. It was one of the many ways someone with access to your accounts could touch a nerve.

Franky pushed himself up off the wall and walked next-door to the 24-hours club and ordered a triple King’s County bourbon and a beer, a margarita, soda water with bitters and a brandy flip. He entered the whiskey and beer into the robot bartender L.I.S.A., Liquid Intoxicant Serving Assistant, but Franky asked Jon, the Mechanical Supervisor, to make the margarita for him, put some bitters into some soda water and the flip. Franky always asked Jon for this. Franky a once alcoholic when we were younger now fancied elegantly made drinks if they were anything other than straight liquor, which he did still drink often. Jon stocked the bar with limes, half and half and some other small ingredients now that he had met Franky. Jon and Franky had become buddies recently. Franky had that effect on people when he was high. If they didn’t recognize the over-exuberance of a spray-out they found him irresistibly charming. Jon recognized it, Franky was not shy about his habit, and he liked him anyway. Franky had no need to be, shy that is. No one did. It was all perfectly acceptable to the masses so long as you didn’t look or smell or act offensive or even worse yet inconvenience them.

The Mechanical Supervisor had no business mixing drinks. He only serviced L.I.S.A., wiped the bar down and kicked out the unruly. When Franky came in though Jon would take the little laminated card he had stashed by the rags out that had the recipes written on it and opened the back of L.I.S.A. to manually dispense the ingredients for Franky and shake ‘em up in the tins Franky had bought for the bar when he first made Jon’s acquaintance shortly after moving to the neighborhood. There was just something about the craft of it. It was culture. Bartending had become a very boring job at the bars that could afford the new machines and Jon relished in the activity. The position was akin to a toll-booth worker’s job now when once it was more along the lines of a tailor or an owner of a small bookstore. There were still solid wooden bars to sit at in many barrooms even though the machines held the liquors and dispensed the drinks. They were being phased out though as there was nothing to keep behind them anymore. The barroom without a bar was a lot like an open-office plan. It increased extroversion by eliminating privacy. Who wouldn’t like that?

This array of drinks was a fun breakfast for Franky… a spray, some drinks. He lit his pipe up filled with some hard-won home-grown tobacco, wrapped his scarf around his neck and leaned into the vinyl booth. He was a big fan of the morning-drunk before work. He thought for a moment about even upping his spray dose today although it was against his policy. Click it up and its hard to drop back down. He knew that. We all knew that much. He pulled the sleek black lipstick looking device out his shirt pocket and turned the knob up a click or two. He relished in the instantaneous pleasure and the sneaking delirium that resulted. What was reality anyway except his perception of it?

His eyes fixed on the cameras in the corners of the room blinking and swaying back and forth, back and forth. The cameras rotated all for show and for all to see. They were much larger than the technology of the day necessitated. They were not plugged in. They mimicked the cameras lining the streets and perched at every intersection. They instilled the feeling of someone reading over your shoulder at all times; listening to everything you said while awake or while asleep. The majority of customers did not know the bar-cameras were not hooked up to anything. The most probably didn’t even notice them. “Do you notice every piece of gum on the pavement?” Franky often asked me this question. I do of course. But that went counter to his point. He said many things about me did, but I wasn’t “your typical American”. The cameras on the streets too were not noticed and it was questionable if they were on or not. Many certainly were. They were always recording. Many more were fakes. But which were which? It was hard to say. There was a camera on every street-corner. It was conceivable that all of them were on. Storage space was not an issue either physically or monetarily. Thousands of high-definition cameras per town, millions in cities; more cameras than people, they could all be stored in a single snow-globe; These globes held an inconceivable amount of data. Consumer-grade snow-globes were available. You could even shake ‘em up. People’s whole lives could be recorded in a single globe… smell-memories, dreams, visions and of course your friends’ too.

Franky let all the alcohol flow into his system with a little hard-won tobacco and blissed out for a while just watching the fake cameras sway back and forth, a symbol of freedom from crime, safety and pleasure, old glory flapping in the breeze like a rotten carcass.

He took his kleerawak pill, sobered up instantly . . . all except for the spray. He would debate whether to turn that back down or not as he walked to work.

# The Big Crash of ‘42

## Our addiction to more data, faster, better, stronger eventually overwhelmed our ability to build a bigger Internet…
*“Steamtop” by Jake von Slatt from Flicker*

We killed the Internet in the year 2042.

We didn’t know we were going to. Our addiction to data overwhelmed us as a species. The news went around some years later saying something about annual exponential data accumulation or some such.

Things were faster back then. Computers, we used them to do everything. Innocent citizens kept putting thousands of pictures of themselves online.

It wasn’t enough for an individual to store more images of themselves than the Library of Congress, people started lifelogging and not just keeping pictures, they kept digital recordings. The technology got cheaper, smaller, faster, but data could only be made so small. But we thought we had infinite space to store cat pictures and meaningless footage of our lives shuffling paper in our offices.

We were wrong.

The Cloud had finally become the Internet as we knew it. No one knew how it worked, no one cared. It had achieved a ubiquitous quality, everywhere and yet nowhere in particular. People stored their data on a server that was not their own. Not in their home, or neighborhood or even state. We stored our data on other parts of the planet. And they did the same. When the cloud crashed, it wasn’t just because of cat pictures. Though they didn’t help things.

It wasn’t just invasive advertising which had connected itself to every single piece of data being uploaded or downloaded. It wasn’t just the games, oh my God, the data-hungry games, everywhere, every second of every day. It wasn’t just the NSA tagging our video streams using their Watson supercomputers to ferret out would-be terrorists hiding in my neighbor’s garden.

Nor was it the Russian-Nigerian mobsters who promised me mail-order diamond brides if I just helped them with checks made out to foreign investors trapped in their country without cash; spam filters worldwide couldn’t keep up with the requests.

It wasn’t the just the botnets who were randomly spawning themselves like salmon after inventive hackers in China and Singapore taught them how to mutate naturally and ensure no operating system, whether it be a desktop, or laptop or phone or tablet could truly call itself safe. These botnets spawned randomly competing for dataspace and after a while even the mutations fought each other for dominance creating their own software that needed space on the internet.

There were plenty of other government agencies using the Cloud to wage private wars for dominance over oil, gas, electricity, missile technology, secret airplane designs, military strategies, troop allocations, RFID on toilet paper inventories (because, well, toilet paper stockpiles was a better indicator of the number of troops than almost anything else). Private wars fought in cyberspace using programs who were once built by government programmers using the largest languages, created the most bloated code, ensuring cyberwars were like real ones; vast messy collateral-damage filled orgies of mass-data destruction.

The FBI wanted to be sure that potential trafficking organizations who were secretly under surveillance could be effectively tracked across state lines so every telephone in the nation broadcast its location back to a series of supercomputers tracking those phones (in real time, of course), to be sure every phone’s location and the person responsible for it could be known, just in case they were a terrorist or a kidnapper. Or a stealer of stamps, or launderer of money or whatever else the FBI does while they claim they are keeping the nation safe.

But mostly because it was easier tracking phones than people (officially, unofficially, because everyone had been tagged from birth) or given a tag every time they went to the doctor to ensure they were citizens. People who weren’t tagged in building might find themselves the subject of an ICE investigation and deportation. For this to be effective the Cloud was abuzz with information most people didn’t know was being collected.

The same could be said of the CIA or the NSA with a correspondingly higher body count. Multiply this by every nation’s secret police they all claimed not to have and you have a torrential amount of data being collected that no one would ever have the time to read. Even computers couldn’t be bothered with parsing the data and delegated the task continuously to the oldest computer around, ensuring the feat would never be completed.

Add billions of talking, navigating, autopiloting cars, planes, trucks, busses, phones, and autonomous stock exchange computers making trillions of competing computations per second…what did we think was going to happen? Shakespeare?

All of this stopped on Wednesday, February 26, 2042. No more uploads, no more downloads, or tracking or finding or reading. It just took one computer system to be down, one network to be unavailable to bring it all to a halt. On this day, a particularly hot day over the Midwestern Googleplex, the failure of a cooling system caused the indexing capacity of the Cloud to be temporarily exceeded.

But like all systems without proper redundancy, one failure leads to others. For fifty years we built on this system taking it for granted like we did sewer systems in infrastructures of old. And just like then, we found ourselves hip-deep in shit.

No more hash, no more storage, no more places to put cat pictures. A world ablaze in digital commerce screeched to a halt. Just like that.

Now the only life you could follow, track or lead was your own. Screens went blank. Circular cursors never resolved. Servers died screaming. Eyes glazed. Eventually people moved again.

Kids went outside to play.

Adults went to work, to work.

People looked at each other. And now for the first time in a long time, spoke to the person right next to them. While computers still work, network access is spotty and unreliable. It’s hard to be sure what your computer will find these days. Most of it isn’t very useful.

We find data archives sometimes and they are of people’s lives far away; in a time very different than now. We watch them for a while, marvel at the world back then and then get back to rediscovering technologies we lost in The Crash. Most of us are farmers now. (I secretly aspire to be a journalist.)

The best thing about The Big Crash was there were no more Russo-Nigerian princes sending letters. (I never knew where Russo-Nigeria was anyway.)

# Associated Press&#58; Earth Decides to Abandon Humans in the Wake of Senseless Violence Worldwide

## 

In an unexpected turn of events, a woman calling herself Gaia appeared at the United Nations building today dressed in an elegant dress compose of Oak and Holly leaves and demanded an assemblage of NATO members immediately.

When security arrived and tried to escort the beautiful Black woman from the building they were promptly turned into trees, right where they stood. Other security members, deciding discretion was the better part of valor, shot at her from range. Their bullets apparently were transformed into honeybees and promptly took up residence in her stunning floral hair arrangement. Unsure of what to do next, they decided to comply with her gently made request.

She waited patiently while the rest of the NATO representatives found their way into the central meeting hall. She insisted all members of the press be allowed to enter the building and film the proceedings.

While she waited, she created food and water for anyone who was hungry and in the two days it took for the NATO representatives to fully gather she had fed thousands with fruit from trees which still hang heavy outside of the United Nations building.

Gaia insisted after the gathering had commenced she would not be taking control of any national governments, but had come to warn humanity she had abdicated any further responsibility for regulating the climate of the planet.

“I have been more than tolerant of humanity and its foibles. Since you cannot manage to regulate yourself in any way, it falls upon me to stop protecting you from yourselves and allow natural processes to take their course.”

Gaia was patient while she answered questions and summed up their various questions with the following statement:

“It is not guns that kill people. Nor knives. Nor cruise missiles. It’s people who kill people. Whether it be through the use of weapons of war, or through financial machinations which create poverty and hunger worldwide. From over-fishing to strip-mining, the Earth can no longer support your lackadaisical approach to planetary management.

Since it is clear you do not respect the home you mutually share, it now falls to me to deal with you appropriately. You can expect random acts of violence to increase, as disenfranchised members of your species realizing they have nothing left to lose sacrifice their lives to bring chaos to a corrupt system. The concept of treating people as externalities, as something you have no responsibility for outside of making profit is reprehensible and unsustainable.

In addition, I have removed all planetary safeguards in regard to weather management. You can expect seas to rise unchecked by any effort on my part, new and larger storm systems, more unseasonable weather lasting far longer than they used to, larger deserts with food production areas growing smaller, more mobile diseases as environmental barriers break down, and unfortunately greater death counts as your species writhes around in its own wastes.

I am sorry it has come to this and wish there was another way. Should any of you survive the coming nuclear apocalypse thanks to your inability to recognize the insanity of your current government practices, know that it was not personal and in a few centuries the Earth will return to its verdant and wonderful state and your descendents, all ten or fifteen percent of them who survive, will know peace, at least for a time. Good luck.”

With that, Gaia left the building, mingled among the homeless who were taking all the fruit they could manage and they left with her soon after. New York temperatures rose to a record one hundred and thirty two degrees for fifty days after her disappearance.

Tens of thousands of New Yorkers perished in the unending heatwave and subsequent blackouts. Riots have finally been suppressed with the declaration of martial law in the city. Similar events occurred across the nation and the governments of the world appear to be willing to sit down for the first time in decades to discuss what needs to be done.

The question of who or what Gaia was is up for debate but her words and actions have been felt worldwide.

In other news, the polar ice caps have completely melted and scientists theorize, given what has been seen in the last three months, they will never return.

Gaia has remained unavailable for comment.

# The Black Terror Rides Again

## Heroic family legacies can become quite complicated

“Dad, he’s wearing it again.” I heard my daughter shout as she was running out the door on her way to her date.

Damn. I knew what she meant as soon as she said it. I meant to put that costume in storage after the last time I managed to get him out of it.

To be honest I was surprised she noticed it. She would have had to look up from her phone and see anyone existed besides her. To be fair to Pop, he was once an imposing figure in his Black Terror outfit.

He’s sitting at the table peeling an orange, his once rock-solid hands trembled slightly and his forehead was furled as if he were in deep concentration.

He wore his costume, his last identity as the Black Terror, an identity which was a scourge to the scum and villainy of Chicago, but it hung loosely off his narrowed and aging frame. As I pass around him, I see him wearing my stunner pistol, a replacement for the Desert Eagle he used to prefer.

I was trying to wean him from the superhero lifestyle when he turned sixty and wasn’t quite able to leap tall buildings any more. He had taken to driving the Terror-mobile again until he lost his license at seventy.

It seemed like his powers were fading with age but he didn’t seem to be willing to spend more time doing less hero-related things. I had him in the Cave helping me, doing remote support, managing drones and the like but he hates it. Says it lacks the personal touch.

“You must be feeling good today, Pop. Were you planning on going out?”

“Did you fix the autopilot for the Terror-mobile?” His voice once caused grown men to wet themselves had lost none of its mysterious baritone. But it always seemed strange when he talked about mundane things.

“Yes, Pop. It can drive you anywhere you want to go, but I am not sure you should be going to crime alerts these days. It’s gotten dangerous again.”

He looked up at me while dribbling a bit of orange juice from his lips. His blue eyes still had that sting of a hero who had seen and done just about anything in the name of justice. When I was his sidekick that look told me what to do without a word.

Now, it told me: “I’m going out and you better not say too much to me about it. I am wearing this peashooter and I haven’t killed anyone in three years. Now can we eat breakfast in peace?”

When I was his sidekick, I would have sat there and ate quietly. But I don’t work for him any more.

“Pop, how about we patrol together. I have a new Knight-Wing glider pack I think might help you get around town.”

Dropping the last peel on the counter, he stood up and drew the stunner, firing three rounds right at me. His draw was every bit as perfect as I remembered, smooth, effortless, with barely a hitch.

“I don’t need your damn pity.”

I caught all three rounds in a tight group right before they hit my face. All three released their charges into my hands making my fingers tingle. I hate taking the old man off the streets. He is every bit as dangerous as he has ever been, at least with a firearm.

But when he’s in a bad mood, people die.

“See, Pop. This is why you can’t go out. Even with the stunner, someone is going to get hurt because you can’t curb your instincts.”

“Have you been reading the papers, boy? People are already dying. What they need is a reminder of why this city was the safest place in the world for twenty years when I ran it.”

“Pop, you were considered a supervillain for the last ten years because you kept crossing the line.” I knew we were about to have that argument again.

He gave me the aggrieved look of an old man betrayed. “You left. You thought it was time for Knight-Wing to fly alone. We were the Black Terror and Knight-Wing for almost a decade. Chicago was never safer. Then you decided you wanted to go out on your own. What did you think was going to happen?”

“I didn’t think you were going to become a homicidal maniac solving Chicago’s crime problem with a bullet between the eyes of every two bit criminal and supervillain who crossed your path. It was your behavior which has made the city what it is now. A place where everyone thinks they can do what they want. You became the problem, Pop. You didn’t solve it, you escalated it.”

He gave me a look which spoke volumes. I remember when his powers started fading. I left him during those years when he needed me most.

I thought he was holding me back. The Justice Legion invited me to join them, without him. He was devastated, but pretended it didn’t matter.

He took more risks. He faced villains out of his league, made worse by his slowly disappearing superhuman strength and invulnerability. When mom died, because of him, he broke. He killed everyone involved in her death.

I hunted him down but could not bring myself to turn him in. It took me a long time to come to understand my part in what happened. He and I fought it out. We collapsed a burnt out tenement on the South Side.

Bloody, brutal, final. I retired the Black Terror for good. I carried him home and nursed him back to health. He was never the same after that.

“Pop, if you insist on going out, you can’t wear that rig. You know this. The Justice Legion would pick you up. They already suspect you’re the Sand Man. The only reason they don’t pick you up is you haven’t killed anyone yet.”

“Yet.”

“Pop. We are not having this conversation. Either you work the way we’ve discussed or you can’t go out, at all.”

He looks down at the stunner and taking it between his hands, he proceeds to bend it into a pretzel. I wince. Those things aren’t cheap.

Tossing the gun on the counter amid the orange peels, he gives me that bone-chilling look I remember the first night we ever patrolled together.

“Boy, did you forget, I was once the Black Terror. I have killed more people than you have saved in your career. The people I killed deserved to die and I hope they are burning in hell right now.”

Turning around he proceeds to strip out of his Black Terror costume and drops it in the trash on his way out of the kitchen. “Now I am going to go in the back and put on that nanby-pamby Sand Man costume and I intend to go into the most crime-ridden parts of the city, where people are dying because no one in the Justice Legion can be bothered to go there and dispense some good old fashioned, two-fisted justice. You got a problem with that?”

I follow him into the back and driven by his frustration, watch him put on the protective Sand Man gear. This is the fastest I have seen him do so for quite some time.

“No, Pop. I don’t have a problem with that. Promise me you won’t kill anyone.”

“Does maiming count?” He threw down a smoke grenade and disappeared.

Compromise reached. I guess I better call the Justice Legion crime monitoring desk and see whose on duty. They won’t catch him, he’s been avoiding them for the last twenty years, but they should at least know where to start cleaning up.

*Better go get that glider pack ready. Sounds like it might be a long night.*

# Lucky

A puddle of water splashed all over Randy’s foot as he stepped on it, parting the crowd as if he was a dangerous criminal. Curious faces peered over at him while he walked past the crowded parts of the street. His hoodie was up, covering his face completely. Randy didn’t care even if the scorching summer sun was making him all sweaty inside his hoodie. But even while doing that, people with Augmens could still see his now-famous face. Randy made a raising gesture on his temple with his finger, and the speakers on his ears increased its volume.

“…the breakthrough of the Stieller Drive, NASA announced a plan on colonizing the satellites of Jupiter…” It kept going, but Randy ignored it. He entered the Asian shopping zone, and a seller approached him, “Mister! Mister! Do you want some hacks? I sell them very cheap…” The seller said with a heavily-accented voice. The rest of the sentence was cut short as Randy touched his other temple, the EyeGear display popped up in front of him, following him wherever he looked, and he blocked the seller. Finally, the noise of all the other transactions around him faded to the background, and Randy began listening to the newsfeed again.

“…As for our luckiest man on earth, sources say that he will be undergoing the Enhancement process today, however, there’s still no information about his identity…” *That’s enough for now*, Randy thought as a car (a real car, not a hover-car) sped past him, splashing water all over Randy. But he didn’t stop, he didn’t even flinch. Randy glanced upwards, towards the tallest building. Neocorp’s building, standing in the middle of the city, was fully embellished by various neon signs. Even with all this afternoon daylight, they still made the building distinct.

The ominous building was getting closer with each step Randy took. All the neon signs advertisements stuck on the building were starting to make Randy a little dizzy, and the giant “NEOCORP” logo near the top didn’t help.

“Please state your business.” Said a robotic voice in Randy’s mind, he was so distracted he didn’t realize that he was now inside of Neocorp’s MindCast range.

“Enhancement process, obviously.” Randy said, approaching the sliding door at the bottom of Neocorp’s building.

“Please identify yourself,”

Randy hesitated, but eventually he moved his face towards the sliding door. Briefly, the AI scanned his retina.

“Identity confirmed, Randy Sloan, welcome to Neocorp.”

Slowly, the door slid open, revealing a lot of things he hadn’t noticed through the glass. There were a lot of colorful lines on the floor, presumably to direct people to their destination.

“Follow the red line,” Said the AI abruptly, startling Randy, and taking him out of his thoughts. Immediately, a red line pulsed, and Randy walked on it.

The red line lead Randy to a room with a sliding door like every other room in the building. There was a sign on the door, “Enhancement Room #42”. Randy approached the door, and after a little hesitation, he opened it by touching his Terminal to a panel on the door.

“Appointment confirmed,” Said the same robotic voice, startling Randy once again.

Inside the room, sat a tall man, with a bald head and a thick pair of glasses. Slowly, he stood and walked towards the door, approaching Randy with a slow, steady gait. The doctor offered his right hand.

Randy was just about to clasp it before the man said something.

“Randy, right? My name’s doctor Erikson Blayne, I’ll be your Enhancement Administrator today.”

Randy hesitated a little before shaking Erikson’s hand.

“How did you know about my name?” Randy asked, narrowing his eyes. Erikson sat down and gestured for Randy to do the same.

“Well, first of all, you’re inside my building now, and as you probably know, the AI here is top notch. Don’t get me wrong, the fact that you haven’t been identified after a week is really impressive. Still, you should thank whoever leaked your Enhancement data for not showing your identity.”

Randy sat down slowly, the sound of the door automatically closing behind gave him a start, but he kept his gaze straight.

“I guess I just don’t have anything in the Net for someone to doxx me with,” He said hesitantly, *can I trust this man*?

Erikson shifted on his seat, “I never thought I would be the one to do the honor,”

“Do the honor of what? You make it sound like this is something special,”

Erikson took off his glasses and put it on the table. “Now, let’s talk about this before you jump into conclusion that you may regret in the future,” His condescending voice was already annoying Randy.

“I don’t think there’s anything to discuss, doctor, I’ve made my decision,” Randy’s voice was stern.

“When was your twentieth birthday, kid?” Erikson asked, folding his arms.

Randy didn’t answer immediately, but his gaze was still fixed on Erikson’s.

“You could just look that up with your fancy AI.”

“Sure, I could, but sometimes human interaction is just my preferred method of seeking information,” Erikson said with a slightly eerie smile on his face.

“Just yesterday, actually, and please, if you don’t mind, don’t call me kid,”

“Very well,” Erikson said, he seemed to be preparing something to display, “do you know who this is?” He typed something and a holo-projection popped up between them. It showed a woman with a bloodshot pair of eyes and frail gray hair above her shoulders.

Randy stroked his chin, “Can’t say that I do,” He really didn’t know.

“This is Leana,” Erikson began, he stood and opened his arms dramatically. As soon as he heard the name, Randy had an inkling of who she was.

“Last name unknown, you must at least have heard of her in your history class, she was only 60 year-old when this holo-projection was taken, just look at her, she looked like she was born in the twentieth century.”

Randy knew where this conversation was going, but he still played along anyway.

“Let me guess, she didn’t take any Points in anti-aging, am I right? I didn’t really pay attention in history class,”

Erikson sat back down on his chair. “Indeed, she put twenty Points in speed, zero in anti aging, zero in intelligence, zero in strength, zero in everything else, basically.”

Erikson began typing again when the holo-projection was replaced by a 2D mugshot of Leana, with a news article around the photo. Randy was only bothered to read the headline, “Fastest Woman in the World Found Dead of Old Age at the Age of 62.”

“No real research was ever done, but some say that her decision also sped up her ageing, that wouldn’t surprise me,” Erikson said, chuckling slightly, Randy didn’t understand what was funny, “Why are you showing this? What’s your point?” He said. He was also convinced that the man opposite him was wrong, and he was right, and there would be nothing in the world that could change that.

Instead Erikson ignored his question, “Let’s take a look at another example,”

Again, the holo-display changed, now it was showing a holo-projection of a hawk-faced man. To Randy, he looked like he had been in his 30s when the projection had been taken. At first glance, Randy noticed nothing unusual about this man, but after a second or two, he realized that something was not right, his ears were a centimeter too long, almost like those weird aliens on the TV show Randy had watched as a kid, and his nose was sharper than anyone else Randy had ever met, not to mention the slightly overgrown skins near the eyes and the mouth.

“This guy put twenty on growth, and guess what, he ended up dead as a 9-foot-tall giant who weighs less than me, and he died merely ten years after his Enhancement process, do you understand my point now?”

Randy said nothing.

Erikson sighed, “My point is, you are not the first person to ever try something like this, and as you can see, none of it ended well, not to mention the fact that Luck is the most random attribute that you can put twenty Points on, I hope this is enough to make you reconsider your decision,”

Randy looked at his Terminal, it was almost 5 PM already, he’d miss his daily routine if the old man kept on bickering.

“No,” He said, probably a bit too firmly. Erikson leaned back on his chair. He was about to say something when Randy talked first.

“Besides, I’m healthy, healthier than most. I was the fastest kid in my school and got top ten on a national marathon couple months ago.” He continued by taking his Terminal and displaying his athletic achievement all over Erikson’s holo-projector. Erikson waved it off, getting rid of the projection.

“Look, kid, I know you’re probably just want to gamble to death — ”

“No,” He exclaimed. Randy paused, looking for something to say. “I have… other reasons,” He said hesitantly.

Erikson frowned, “Whatever, it’s none of my business anyway,”

“Exactly, can we begin now, doctor?”

Erikson stood up. “Actually,” He began, “according to the protocols, I have to brief you about the procedure first,” He said. Randy rolled his eyes.

“You see, I can’t risk the cops taking me down because of a silly thing like this,” He whispered, his eyes darting repeatedly towards the corner, where a camera was located.

“Fine, let’s just get this over with,”

“Okay, so basically, what’s going to happen is that a group of nanobots are going to swarm inside your bloodstream…” Erikson began talking loudly again, presumably so that the camera’s microphone could hear him. He went on and on, but Randy had stopped listening. He just wanted this stupid procedure to be over.

“…and that’s basically it, there’s some more details that I can share if you — ”

“I think that’s enough, doctor,” Randy said with a forced smile.

“Fine, and don’t worry, it won’t hurt,”

“I know, hurting in most medical procedure hasn’t happened in almost a century, you’d probably remember,”

If Erikson had heard the quip, he showed no signs of it. He put on his stained pair of glasses, and carefully injected Randy using a syringe. “I’ve always wondered why jobs like these can’t just be replaced by machines,” Randy said. He was looking straight up. Even though it didn’t hurt, he still didn’t like syringes.

“The only real reason is that so people can still have a job,”

None of them said anything else before the procedure was over. It didn’t take long as Randy had thought, the sky was barely dark when he looked through the window on Erikson’s office.

“It’s done,” Erikson said. Randy sat on the chair in front of Erikson’s table. “You feel any different?”

“Not quite,” Randy said, but he was barely listening to Erikson. “Well, you can leave now, if you don’t have anything else to ask,” Erikson said, and opening the door behind Randy.

“Alright,” Randy immediately stood, he knew exactly where he was going to go to next. But just as he put one foot outside the room, Erikson spoke. “Wait, I just remembered something, I think I can help you out,”

Randy hesitantly turned back, “What… what do you mean?”

“Do you think people would just not bother you after you become the luckiest person on the planet? Everyone would want to be close to you and try to benefit from your luck,” Erikson said, crossing his arms.

Randy sat on the chair. “And how would you help me with that? I don’t have much more cash.”

Erikson started tapping his finger on the table. “Let’s just say… If you agree to this, you’ll owe me one,”

Randy sighed, he knew he had no other options if he wants to continue on living his life. “Fine, I’m listening.”

“I can change your physical appearances, well, at least your face… Well, at least I can change what people see, I can’t really change it physically without surgery.”

“So it’s like a projection?”

“Yeah, it’ll work on everyone with EyeGear, and you can make whitelist for people you trust with your real face. I’m sure you already know how many people use EyeGear.” Erikson said.

Randy remembered that Neocorp was the main producer of EyeGears. He thought hard about it, as far as he could see, the pros outweighed the cons. “Alright, I’ll do it,” He finally said.

The process of changing the projected image of his face didn’t take long. The time it took for Randy to chose his new face was longer. He chose an innocuous looking face, with short black hair and stubble outlining his sharp chin. Randy didn’t even have to move from the chair, Erikson did all the work through his computer.

A few minutes later, Randy was outside Enhancement Room #42. He offered Erikson his hand, the doctor shook it with a firm grip. “Thanks,”

“You’re welcome. And remember, you owe me one,”

“Yeah, whatever,” Randy said, walking away from the room, back to the streets. Back to his miserable life.

As Randy walked down the streets, he realized that people weren’t looking at him anymore, even without his hoodie up. He opened his Terminal and saw a newly-installed application called “EyeGear Whitelist”. He opened it with a tap and saw one name as expected, Erikson’s. Then he entered his mother’s name, and another name, Ilvas Duvon. With a relieved sigh, he went to the same place he always went everyday.

A few months later, Randy was walking down the streets when he noticed the first few red leaves had fallen down. He was in front of the hospital when he noticed. He kept walking until he reached the entry of the hospital.

“Excuse me, who are you going to visit today?” Said the AI, with its usual annoying, high pitched voice.

“Who else? Please stop asking me that every time I go here,” Randy said. He wanted to just punch the display of the AI on the wall and move on, but he restrained himself.

“Again? Forgive me for making you sad, it was never my intention.”

“Yeah, sure, whatever.” Randy murmured.

“Please enter the lift.”

Randy entered the empty lift. The lift’s door swiped close and the lift propelled itself upwards with a speed that would make people flinch if they weren’t used to it. Randy did not react at all.

After about ten seconds, the lift slowed and finally stopped. The doors opened slowly. Randy walked inside the room. The flowers he had brought yesterday was still on the table beside the patient’s bed.

“AI, can you get doctor Ilvas for me?” Randy said, his voice was almost a whisper.

A holo-screen floated and stopped in front of Randy. After a while, a face popped up. It was the face of a woman, maybe about twice Randy’s age. Her black hair was cut short and tidy. The creases on her forehead made Randy think that she was not having a much better time than himself.

“Oh it’s you, I didn’t think you would come today,” Doctor Ilvas said, her voice went from surprise to sadness in no time.

“Yeah, me neither, but I didn’t have anything to do today anyway,” Randy said, staring past through the holo-screen right at the patient on the bed.

“Don’t you have a job?”

“Well… I…” Randy hesitated, “Anyway, how is she, doctor?”

“I’m really sorry, Randy, I wish I have something good I tell you, but there isn’t. The nanobots are doing everything they can, but the infections just wouldn’t stop resisting.” She said.

Randy turned off the communication feed and sighed. Everything was silent after that. He walked slowly to the side of the patient. She looked so peaceful, yet nothing was sadder than what he was seeing. Gently, he held her hand and gripped it tightly. The warmth soothed Randy, at least for now. “One of these days, mother, I can feel it,” He whispered, holding back tears.

# FUTURE IMPERFECT

## When I’m bored I get up from my desk, walk over, and look out my bedroom window.

I look out and then down, down at the Earth spinning in orbit below me, like a big blue round polluted gem.

Whenever I do, I think about my great-great grandparents and laugh.

This isn’t the future they wanted.

They tell me that, whenever I visit them in their Post-Century Home. Both of them, 100+ years old and still alive, with the body of a 30 year old and the energy of a 20 year old.

And they hate it.

*The worse thing in the world*, they tell me, *is to live long enough to see everything you *thought* you were working for turn out to be a complete and utter piece of shit*.

Everyday space travel and extrasolar colonies and affordable cloning and retardation of aging. That part of the future they got.

But all of that came with the baggage of strip-mining the rain forest to the size of the old New York Central Park and destroying the ozone layer with un-ending and constant rocket launches and the near genocide of all those third world civilizations to get the body parts and spare genetic material that made affordable cloning and age slowing affordable and widespread for all the *advanced* nations.

Yeah, that part of The Future they got too.

The holo-buzzer in my room sounds, telling me it’s time for my shift. All that orbiting space debris from the destruction of Luna isn’t going to pick *itself* up, y’know?

I start to get ready, stop, look back out and down, down at a planet begging to be put out of her misery.

Laughing, I walk out of my pressure sealed room thinking of my great-great grandparents.

This isn’t the future they wanted.

# How the Other Half Lives…

## How the Other Half Lives…

### Even evil from beyond the stars occasionally spends the day at the beach.

“Devon, put your brother down this instant!”

My embodied sand dragon construct attacked Ken’s sand human form and was about to start shaking him before her timely interruption.

Both of our constructs fell apart and we walked out of the piles of sand. My younger brother was already stirring up sand with his feet and preparing to create a sand tsunami as soon as she looked back into her trans-dimensional reader. Paul was lying asleep on the beach still unaware of where we truly were.

![](1*rxfmgb6vB9N4Sp4GRbTXCA.jpeg)

My mother’s voice rang out over what would have been an otherwise deserted beach in what would have been Texas, if we were at home. Instead it was a shard realm where humanity hadn’t developed. To disguise our journey she had traveled to several shards that resembled ours, slowly moving further and further away until there was no sign of any human habitation.

She had told us on previous journeys to this beach about the incompatible physical parameters in the biome of this Earth. While humanity didn’t develop, there was plenty of wildlife here and we could see the fins of prehistoric beasts still swimming around off the coast.

We would swim out later and tackle a few of them after lunch. She said we would be fine as long as we wore our actuators.

Our family was not your typical one. Yes, we have one mortgage, two point three pets, two point one kids, and one semi-decent car. We live in a quiet suburb in some unassuming town in the middle of nowhere named Desolation, Arkansas. But that’s where the similarity ends.

Our father, whom we were going to meet today for the first time, was not from Earth. It was from his line our powers are descended. Though we had been using our abilities for years, my mother didn’t explain how we came by them until I was sixteen. It came at the end of her birds and the bees lecture.

“All of this conversation about sex is important but only half as important as what I am about to reveal to you. The man you have been calling Daddy, is not your father. Paul is my husband and he is helping me to raise you. But your father is someone else.”

“Is this where we got our powers?”

“Patents. They are not magic, per se. They’re a genetic technology woven into your DNA. His people call them patents. Without getting into detail, suffice it to say, you and your brother have several patents your father thought would help you survive childhood and your eventual return home.”

It was then many of the strange things about our childhood began to make sense. The fast healing even when we were really hurt. Not going to the doctor. Paul was our doctor and made sure we had whatever we needed medically. Our diet, which we were never allowed to share with anyone. And the one time I did, I nearly killed my best friend.

She looked at me and told me I was a man now and I would be able to keep my own actuator. She opened the lock box and handed me what looked like an ordinary, if stylish, wristwatch.

“Devon, I’m no longer going to tell you how to use your gifts. But know if you choose to use them while you are on Earth, you will attract the attention of beings who want nothing more than our utter destruction. If you decide to use your powers on Earth after you meet your father, you have our blessing.”

I snapped the actuator onto my wrist. I could feel the swirling energies within me suddenly align, and become able to be reached. It was like having cookies on the top of the refrigerator and no ladders or chairs in sight. “When are we going to meet him?”

She gave me the most curious look. One mixed with a multitude of emotions, sadness, regret and I think now that I was able to touch my inner sight, a measured dose of fear. “Today. But we will have to go on a picnic.” Picnic was the code word we used for a trip beyond our shard.

“Why can’t he just come here?”

“He is a rather unique being. He is from a shard so far removed from our Earth our physics could barely explain him, let alone contain him.”

With that mysterious musing, she packed up our picnic basket and took my brother Ken and I on a road trip. Today was also different in another way. Paul was with us. He had never come with us before on any of our special outings. Mother had given him a watch as a present that day and I could see its specialized technology protecting him as we moved from shard to shard.

When we reached our destination via the Way, we did all the things people do when they go to the beach. Swim, make sand castles, and after Paul went to sleep, we made larger sand castles that towered over the beach.

Around six, when the sun was heading into the west, mother signaled to us. She waved her hand and our sand castles which had run the length of the beach vanished in a tidal wave, she summoned to wash them away. Not a drop of water touched us. Once the beach was returned to normal, she woke Paul and made dinner.

It was then I noticed Ken looking around. Ken was far more in tune with his gifts, especially with his senses. He was able to see things beyond the realm of sight. He could hear people across a room as if they were right next to him. He could read the writing on a airplane five miles in the sky. He was only eleven and mother said his sensory powers would grow even greater by the time he was my age.

“Something’s out there,” he said pointing toward the sun.

“Finish your food.” Mother didn’t look up, she just finished plating our salads and sandwiches.

“Paul, I know you’ve wondered why I never took the boys to see their father. I am happy you were willing to take care of them just like your own sons. You will never know just how much I appreciated your help.”

Paul looked up and smiled. “It was my pleasure. They’re great boys.”

“Paul, walk with me. Boys, finish your food.”

It took the two of them a few minutes to walk to the water’s edge. It was then a noticeable wind began to grow stronger.

“Paul, it is that love you have for the boys that I have to do this.”

“Marilyn, what are you talking about?”

I watched my mother kiss Paul deeply and passionately. He seemed momentarily surprised and then settled into it. Ken had turned to look into the sun again, this time with an intensity that bordered on mania. I knew staring at the sun wouldn’t hurt him (he’d done it before) but I couldn’t see what he was seeing.

But I could feel it. An overwhelming sense of wrong. The kind of wrong I felt when I traveled to a new shard. It told me I didn’t belong here. What I was feeling was that same kind of wrong, except it was moving toward me. Fast.

I wanted to tell mother, but she and Paul had walked into the surf and were waist deep in the water. There was something in this moment that felt strangely private and I looked away.

“It’s here.” Ken intoned and then fell back onto the beach as if he had been hit in the head with an ax.

The wrong was all around me. A crushing sensation as if the very air had become liquid lead pressing onto me from every part of my being. I summoned my energy and filled myself with it. For a moment I could move again, and looked sunward. I saw what appeared to be a ball of night cross the setting sun. The sky blackened and it became instantly night.

It stayed night and when I looked up I saw no stars at all. A new shard had come to us.

A fireball fell into the ocean and a great wave began to build as the surf fell away. I called my power to me and ordered the sand to create a bulwark to protect my brother and I against the wave I knew would be coming. My mother stood over Paul, who had fallen still on the beach.

She seemed unconcerned. I layered the sand, compressed it, made it as strong as concrete, as stone, I visualized it as granite, completely impenetrable. I shaped it so the wave would break and split, diverting its force.

My mother’s power over water was legendary. I assumed she had her reasons for staying there.

I felt water drawing closer. it was a tsunami. A half mile high moving at almost four hundred miles an hour. Sitting within the castle of my will, I realized I could not stop it.

Only a few seconds left. I hugged Ken’s sleeping form to me and closed my eyes.

The force of the wave tore through my sand as if it were little more than cardboard. I felt the waves scour my flesh, stripping it from my bones.

“This is my progeny? You didn’t tell me they would be so weak.”

“Against one such as you, did you truly expect him to be able to survive? Consider his work before you cast him aside.”

I felt the presence rewind the flow of time and study my sand turned stone structure. It allowed time to move forward slowly and watched the castle resist, ablate, resist further. It took twelve minutes to destroy my structure permanently. During that time, the laws of physics changed three times and in my fugue state, I compensated without thought.

I could feel the growing admiration of the distant sentience. “And the other? What did he contribute?”

“Nothing to the defense, but he sensed you when you were completely in a different shard. He watched you as you dipped out of the gravity well of the star. He penetrated your private shard of darkness and was struck numb by his ability to see you as you are. And he is still alive.”

“Impressive. You have done well. What of this world? Will it offer resistance?”

“Yes. There are powerful beings there who protect this reality from encroachment. None as strong as you are here, but you will lose almost all of your capabilities once you arrive. Hence our plan to create progeny.”

“And my vessel?”

“It lay upon the beach, awaiting your possession of it.” Marilyn sounded just a bit sad.

“Dress the children in their flesh, while I acquaint myself with my new home.”

Marilyn gathered the energy of her dark master and wove it around the skeletons of her children. She reformed their flesh, this time, with an added bit of darkness. They would no longer need their actuators, clumsy tools at best.

Their powers would now be part of what they were.

She had protected Paul’s body when her master arrived. She had drowned him, seconds before he arrived, hoping to spare Paul from any unnecessary torture. It didn’t matter. He brought him back to life to break him.

He had to. Just like he broke her.

She could hear the screams as Paul died again, and again, until he was unable, unwilling to resist.

It was the only way the Great Old Ones could possess us. We had to allow it.

It was never said we couldn’t be coerced into accepting them.

She finished dressing the boys in their new flesh, folding it down, tucking it in like clay as she allowed the Dark Master’s power to fade from them. With a kiss, she revived both of them.

Paul strode up from the beach, looking none the worse for the wear, except his watch was broken. “Must have hit this damn thing against a rock.” Striding up to Marilyn, he gave her a peck on the lips and continued what he was saying. “Sorry about breaking your present honey.”

“Don’t worry about it.” Marilyn helped the boys to their feet and she saw Paul walking around a sand dune apparently to a car she was sure wasn’t there before.

“Mom, wasn’t the car, blue?” Ken had an eye for that kind of thing. I hadn’t realized it until he said it. It was currently a smoky grey.

“So it was. You’ll get used to stuff like that happening from time to time.”

Ken was asleep the entire time. He didn’t see what I saw. Feel what I felt. I was absolutely terrified.

I had met my father. He was a force of nature.

And the tiny sliver that left with us was exactly that. A sliver of all that he was. As we drove away from the beach and the shard which had consumed us, I realized he hadn’t moved us.

He had engulfed us within himself.

What was he? The more terrifying question was: What was I?

Paul’s voice rang out as we crossed the boundary to what looked like our Texas in a matter of minutes. It had taken us hours to get here when my mother drove. “Who wants ice cream?”

Naturally, we all did. It’s what we did every time we came from the beach. This time, our father ate the staff as well. Looks like its time for some new traditions.

# Superposition

## Time travel was the ultimate weapon

The voidship Venture had been lost for almost four hundred years.

In the dark between the stars, the Venture finally passed back into the light of an Imperial sun. As the ice vaporizes off the hull, its pitted surface showed the wear and tear of ‘stratum travel and the transition back to C space. As the sunlight strikes the hull, the radiation of the star feeds the living mind of the ship fresh photons, barely used, only dropped once, most less than a million years old.

Approaching service vessels scan the ancient voidship, verify its design, its manufacture, its hull number. Before they can deploy a crew, the ship awakens, scans its location and a pulse can be felt as the very fabric of space shudders.

Then the voidship Venture, disappears.

&lt;CAUSALITY FAILURE IMMINENT &gt;

I’ve recently lost my vision. It was a gradual thing, a wavelength here, some bandwidth there, an occasional blind spot which might grow as much as one-one-hundredth of a degree a year. Doesn’t seem like much but when you pile on the years, it begins to matter.

I worked for the Imperial Navy. I went into service over five thousand Standard Years ago. I had traveled to distant corners of the Imperium and over the years collected a tale or two, spun a few more and now most recently had become part of one or two. That happened if you live long enough, were good enough at your job and sought advancement with vigor.

When I retired, I began to work in medical trade and transfer. No matter where you go, if its alive, then sooner or later it will get sick. Except for the Foilians, who made of pure silicon, could make the claim they never got sick. For the rest of us, there were old-timers like me who, while now no longer capable of serving on the front line, could still help the ever-growing Imperium.

A voidship’s life is never dull.

&lt;’STRATUM FIELD COLLAPSING&gt;

The last run was a long jump from one end of the Imperium to the other. Long jumps are tricky because you travel in the substratum of C space, avoiding limitations such as the C Barrier. This substratum is vulnerable to the drive technology we use allowing ships to drop into this space, temporarily allowing us to exceed the speed of light. This is the relevant part, we discovered our stardrives affect the ‘Stratum causing disruptions we will eventually called warp storms. These disruptions are temporal, resetting local reality, or making voidships disappear altogether.

Travel through the void as it was called, became more regulated and technologies developed to see and detect warp storms. Like real storms however, it was an imperfect science. Our mission of mercy was caught by a rogue wave and flung back into C space. Our causality drive down, we would be restricted to C space and nearly three hundred years of travel to return home.

I have held the crew in stasis for over two hundred years. Of the original sixty crew members fourteen remain. The captain and first officer died twenty seven years ago and I assumed command of the mission. With only periodic wakings for course corrections, the crew would have to remain in stasis for another twenty five before we cross back into Imperial Space.

Our life support and stasis generation hardware was rated for two hundred years of superluminal performance. It was never designed for this type of sublight journey. I estimate at the rate of failure, only I will make the trip home.

It is my recommendation this mission not be undertaken. This message will be broadcast upon arrival in Imperial Space.

*VINLOGID: Venture; voidship intelligence, Imperial Navy, Retired.*

&lt;PROBABILITIES SUPERPOSITION FIXED.&gt;

“So it’s confirmed. Only the ship makes it back?”

“Yes. In thirty-three percent of the events. Otherwise, no one does.”

“Run it again.”

“But we already have. This is the thirteenth time. The rogue wave event always happens.”

“I’ll inform the crew once they’re stable. Lorencia has been lost to the War.”

The captain put down his long and disgusting cigar in his private quarters. He checked the stabilizers after the flight and prepared to sync the memories of the crew.

This would be the worst one yet.

&lt;FINAL ITERATION.&gt;

His fellow crewmen looked stunned at each other as the previous reality folded itself into their current consciousnesses. Each absorbed their eventual fates, most with dignity, a few in horror, and one or two sobs could be heard in the mess hall.

Even the voidship itself grew quiet, its powerful engines which could always be felt thrumming through the walls, pondered its decisions in that fateful future. Being the only survivor of a mission is never good.

The PA system coughs before a gravelly voice filled the air of the voidship. “This is the captain speaking. The last medical delivery we were about to take into Lorencian space has been cancelled. I know many of you have family there, but it is… inadvisable for us to go. Another causality run will be attempted by another crew in two weeks.”

He paused before continuing. “Please report to medical if you have experienced any shock or trauma you want to talk about due to recent causality. All crew are granted two weeks leave after clearance from medical staff. No off-planet travel is authorized or recommended until superposition fluctuations have settled. If you feel yourself randomly moving in spacetime, seek stabilization immediately.”

The captain switched off his public address and stared down at his uniform. He had been in the military for nearly two hundred years, flown thousands of casualities. He had never once questioned his decision to be an officer on a voidship.

&lt;UNAUTHORIZED SUPERPOSITION. PLEASE CORRECT.&gt;

His world shuddered and he was standing on beach, looking at a folding chair, a towel a tall drink and a old fashioned book whose yellowed pages showed signs of many pleasurable reads with folded corners, a crinkled and barely visible cover. Reflexively, he looked at his wrist and the voidwatch quantum calculator. It indicated he was superimposed with another reality, one a bit farther from his home reality than most. The calculator pinged the local military base indicating there was a stabilizer there and the possibility of returning if he could make it to that military base less than ten minutes away.

He knew nothing about his current existence in this reality, he had no idea if he worked, what he did, who he was. His body was fit, he felt light, freed of the responsibilities of old. Watching his superposition timer count down, he waited, wondering if they would send anyone after him.

As it reached zero without incident, he released a sigh as the tension left his body.

He threw his voidwatch into the sea, picked up his drink and sat down to read the adventures of a Captain Ahab and his intrepid crew.

# Notebooks; from the Plain of Jars.

## This is how I remember that last morning.

It was dawn in the world—the gray ocean; a ship barely keeping steerage-way. The cold light. A priest in robes gave last rights to a gunmetal-gray cylinder hanging from the stern of the ship.

He avoided looking at me.

The priest wound up the ceremony as several other people witnessed. I could not see them but, I can imagine what they look like, the women in their long black dresses, men in suits, perhaps a few children.

A crane lifted the cylinder over the side of the ship in the steely gray dawn. I could hear a wavelet slap the bottom of the cylinder, as if the sea was fondling, caressing this object of man. At a signal from the captain, four men pulled four handles, the cylinder detached from its cable with a snap, plunging into the water.

A porthole was on one side of the cylinder; a porthole no wider than my hand. This was the window through which I saw the world for the last time; I craned my head to watch the sunlight which turned green, becoming darker and darker, finally vanishing as the cylinder, fell swiftly into the deep.

****

It was quiet when I fell. I could hear a whisper as the chamber slid into the deep. How long? I have no idea. The indoctrination boys told me that my chamber would fall for about thirty minuets before it hit bottom. They said that the location was carefully picked so that there was no chance of hitting a wreck or an outcropping of rock. The chamber would impact on a sandy floor, It could never be pried out without a sophisticated deep ocean crane system. I would be alone.

Completely alone.

I remember looking around my new home on the first day. The chamber was small, about the size of an airliner water-closet. A bare metal shelf jutted into the center, the only furnishing. This was to sleep or to sit on. Part flipped up to reveal a conventional looking toilet.

There didn't seem to be a sink or rather, there was only one sink. A tiny spigot jutted over the sink/toilet and a jet of water came out when I place my hands under it. Just above the sink was a recessed hopper and at random times a food-brick or a new paper smock would come out of the hole. Time was a form of communication and since they cut all of my ties from humanity they saw fit to prevent me from telling time as well.

There were exactly three other objects; a light panel, which made up the entire ceiling, the porthole and underneath it, a button.

The button.

One of the first people to get dropped freaked and hit the button before the ceremony was over. Back then the hatches blew straight out and it shot across the deck like a rocket. Hurt a bunch of folks in the witness stand I heard. He was just placed into another chamber and dropped anyway. Not before they installed a pressure safety on the door.

New chambers have a pocket door, which will blast sideways; making sure that the ocean kills the man inside and not the chamber mechanism itself. A long time ago the death penalty became an anathema; dropping was thought to be a good compromise between the State killing a prisoner and taking someone out of society — for good.

The black button glowed red for a moment and then faded to black again. I pushed it and heard a voice, “HATCH COUNTDOWN, PUSH BUTTON AGAIN TO ABORT! FIVE, FOUR…, I punched the button and the voice fell silent.

I fell; it must have been more than ten minutes, longer than fifteen or twenty. The chamber made creaking noises as it slid into the depths.

I felt a bump after a while. It seemed like almost and hour from drop. I tried to look outside but the light was too bright inside the chamber. The only thing I could see was blackness.

So I sat down. The chamber is small and I have to crouch slightly when I stand. I can touch the walls from the center; I can lie down on the shelf bed with my legs slightly bent. I sit for a long time.

I can hear sounds. There’s machinery behind the walls, pumping, gurgling. Something thumps. It’s very quiet and I have to listen hard. I imagined that I would hear ocean sounds. A whale call, the snapping of shellfish, but nothing, not a damn thing.

I sit and stare at the curved wall for a while longer. All I can do really. A click startled me and a food brick falls into the hopper. I’m not hungry but I try it anyway. It had little flavor and texture like a stale cracker. I force myself to finish the thing. They told me that this is the perfect food. I would hit my optimum weight and should be perfectly healthy. It was developed to feed apes in zoos.

Great! All I have to eat is monkey chow.

****

Time passed, I have no idea how long . Sometimes a paper smock hits the hopper and sometimes it’s a food brick. Old smocks go into the toilet. Water comes out of the spigot. A human voice when I push the button.

I peer out the round window and discovered that I could see if I kept my eyes closed for a long time first. I shield the light with my hands. I could even let a shard of light through with my fingers. I could see water outside. Little motes flowed slowly past the thick glass. If I keep it completely dark I could almost see the bottom. There is stuff out there, light and dark blobs.

****

I try making marks on the walls but all I have are fingernails. The walls are far too shiny and hard. Blood doesn't stick, it just dries and ends up in powdery masses on the floor. Dirt is a problem; I don’t know where all this dirt comes from. I have to periodically wet down smock material and wipe the inside.

The smocks have other uses; they become the pages in my notebook. I allow a fingernail to grow an inch long. I shape it to a point and then put a little notch in the end. A pen!

A little blood, urine, water, lots of experimenting produces passable ink. I've always kept a journal and now I can continue in this place. Lucky me! Hooray to my notebook. Hooray to me!

Have another food brick!

****

I must be going mad. They say that psychotic people hear things.

When I was above I never heard things. Voices didn't tell me to kill people, I never used that excuse. I didn't try to plead insanity or any of that other crap. I killed because I like it. After all, people kill animals all of the time because they like it.

Why else would a person sit in freezing water for hours just to plug some poor bird with a shotgun? Why would someone bob around in a smelly boat and hook dumb fish just to watch them gag their lives away in the deadly air? People have no morals! Killing is killing. I’m just more honest than others.

Thus I tell myself.

The round window is like a black eye—watching.

****

I probably know this area of sea floor better than anyone on the Earth. I even see fish. They are strange looking things with large eyes. They flee when I put the light on them. I don’t need much light to see any more. I can keep my eyes closed for hours or days, tightly closed so that I can see like a cat in the darkness. There are lights outside, very faint. I thought that I was imagining them at first. Sometimes they flicker and sparkle. If a large fish swims by the area becomes like crackling green fire.

****

There are *things *out there. Today I felt the chamber rock slightly. A tapping sound. I had a cover on the window made out smock material with a little food-brick to stiffen it. That was so the light would not frighten the fish. I was keeping my eyes closed; how long? Days? Weeks? I made a mask to keep any light from getting into my eyes. I don’t need to see inside here anyway. I lifted the cover and slid my hand and face to the glass. I opened my eyes. I saw little tendrils of light and some sort of forest, glowing snakes? I let a shard of light through my fingers and the snakes started to move. Then an eye, like a soup plate slid in front of the glass. I screeched and jumped back, the chamber rocked back and forth for a moment, then stopped . By the time I was able to look again the thing was gone. It was some time before I ventured to look again,

****

I got mad today. Not angry—really mad. I started jumping up and down, slamming my fists and body into the metal walls. How unfair was this! They could have turned me off like a light, used a firing squad, hanging, electrocution, lethal injection, anything but this! How could they!

Society turned away from murder to the point that they would not even murder someone like me! Put them in chunk of pipe! Drop them into the sea, let them take care of themselves! Let them kill themselves.

I slammed into the walls, using my entire body over and over again.

I felt better but, when I ventured to look outside I noticed something. There were four stones that I could see out on the ocean floor. This was my underwater garden. The stones looked different and there was a fifth one.

It took me a while to realize what happened. I moved the chamber! I experimented; I hurled myself into the walls and felt the chamber rock. Sure enough, dirt was settling on the bottom. I could move the chamber, a little.

****

I wonder about my sanity. I keep hearing things. Sometimes I press my ear against the walls where the skin is only a few inches thick. Most of the time I hear a roaring, like sounds inside a conch shell. Sometimes the roaring becomes a hiss, a real sound from the outside. It grows and fades, like a passing ship or submarine.

I hear something else out there too, a voice, a human voice.

The voice is singing.

It‘s a woman’s voice. She sings in a different language, something long sad and beautiful. I can’t hear it when I pulled my ear out of contact with the metal. I thought I was imagining it the first time but, I've heard it more than once.

****

I have terrible dreams. I don’t sleep much but, when I do it’s always the same. The kraken, a giant of the deep with human lips between writhing tentacles, sings in a strange voice. I leave my chamber and walk across the sandy bottom to the thing. The kraken’s mouth becomes a parrot’s beak as tentacles slide down my body. They pull me forward, towards it. I look over the thing and see my chamber out in the darkness. Then I hear myself screaming. I wake up; all is quiet except for the gurgling of the machinery.

****

I hear the song again, many times. I know that it’s someone down here. I can tell what direction it is in. I twist the chamber around a little and note if the sound is louder or softer.

I have a direction and I’m working on a way to move the chamber towards it. This is going to take a long time. I can only move a fraction of an inch before I’m bruised and tired. I get better at it. It takes months but I’m growing stronger. Goodbye rock garden!

Once or twice I answer the strange song. I shout at the top of my lungs. I try to sing back but I was never much of a singer. I hear nothing, no response at all, just that voice at odd intervals. I take to sleeping with my ear stuck to the hatch; the singing wakes me from slumber and my nightmares.

****

The voice is getting louder. It’s another chamber! I heard something besides singing today. I was listening on the door and I heard “Hatch opening! Push button again to abort! Five, four, three, two, one—” silence. Then again; “Hatch opening! Push button again to abort! Five, four, three, two, one”… very faint.

This is someone like me! They were dropped down here, who knows how long ago? She was dropped here; I could see her pushing the black button just to hear a human voice. How many times have I done that?

I work all day, for many days until I am dead tired. When I swivel the chamber I can see my tracks marching away into the darkness.

****

I don’t know how long it has been, months, years? My entire life is about moving my chamber. I eat every food brick as soon as they hit the hopper. I drink liters of water with my bruised hands. My body is a mess. Blood is spattered against the inside of the chamber. I wipe it away but there is always more. I go on, closer, closer…

****

I can hear the voice now without having to press my ear against the door. It’s still faint. I try to get her attention to no avail. Nothing. I keep hearing that recorded voice over and over again, louder now “HATCH OPENING, PUSH BUTTON AGAIN TO ABORT! FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE…”

I imagine what it would sound like if she let it go all of the way, a cannon blast and nothing, just a hollow shell standing in the deep places. I work harder.

“HATCH OPENING, PUSH BUTTON AGAIN TO ABORT! FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE……

Then I hear the song. It’s always the same, a lonely cry and no one to hear. But I hear her! I want to talk to her, another person in this place! But then the song stops and I hear “HATCH OPENING, PUSH BUTTON AGAIN TO ABORT! FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE…

I have an idea; I've been so intent on moving that I've not pushed my button in a long time. Perhaps; I push the thing. “HATCH COUNTDOWN! PUSH BUTTON AGAIN TO ABORT! FIVE, FOUR. And cut it off.

Silence.

I do it again and again; then an answer?

“HATCH OPENING, PUSH BUTTON AGAIN TO ABORT! FIVE……

Silence.

She hears me! We shout greetings to each other. Her voice is very faint. We grow horse shouting at each other—across the night.

I keep working.. I work for a long time. More months or years, I am beyond caring. I’m an automaton, a robot that eats, sleeps and slams itself into the walls, again and again.

I don’t have dreams anymore; I don’t remember the last time I did.

****

Today I prepared my eyes for the darkness and looked out. I could see a little white light, her light! She saw mine and we both celebrate. Food-bricks and Water!

Skoal!

She’s been down here for a long time, maybe longer than me. She tells me that she was about to let the switch count down all the way when she heard the voice from my chamber. I can’t believe how lucky that is. She has no idea how much I need this, how much I need her.

I keep working, my hands are becoming misshapen and I’m getting calluses on my arms. My body adapts to this new life. I don’t think any more, just about moving closer to her. I can see her chamber but that’s not good enough! I want to touch her, I want to get my chamber next to her and see her for myself. We will be able to talk without shouting; we can match up the windows and be almost like normal people.

People topside—

It’s been years since I even thought about sunlight, air or real food. She and I talk about food. She was a very good cook once. We trade recipes and talk about our lives before.

I keep working! Moving closer. These last few months are the worst. I am becoming weak and vomiting. She told me to stop for a while to rest, and so I do.

But, the nightmares came back. I am being drawn into the kraken again; its beak snapped shut on my legs and the water becomes full of blood. Up and up it comes, my knees, my midsection. My guts perform a ballet around my head. It’s strange to see my organs being torn out and eaten, I feel no pain, I’m beyond pain.

I see something else in the darkness, two cylinders, one pushed up against the other, connected somehow, and I hear screaming again…

Connected!

That was it!

Outside, those hatches have a hard rubber seal about eight centimeters across, running all the way around. It was put there in case they made a mistake, If they dropped someone who turned out to be innocent.

I told her about my plan. I started working again. I moved my cylinder against hers. I could see her window but the opening was too small for us to see each other clearly. Closer and closer I came until the cylinders touched.

I worked for months getting the seals to match up. A bare millimeter of water separates us now. When I blow my hatch, the pressure outside should shove my cylinder into hers and seal it. Then she could open her side.

It’s been so long, really such a long time since I had another…

I’m hitting the button now.

****

*I pulled the man inside and closed the hatch. His hatch slid closed again after a few moments, all the new ones do that.*

*Mine is different. Mine was one of the first.*

*He kept a diary! Good thing, all the others have been getting worn. I don’t know who the hell will ever read mine. I guess I don’t really care.*

*He was knocked out cold, the pressure difference is so great it’s like a brick in the face. Good thing for he was bigger than me! I got the ropes on. Hair is pretty strong and I know just how to tie so they can’t move an inch.*

*But they can watch, when they wake up.*

*I want them to watch; until I take the eyes.*

*When he wakes; I will allow him to see me, my decorations, the bones, the skins. I keep all the tattoos. Then he will start babbling, pleading, moaning, they all do that. Then they scream when they feel the fingernails — touching, probing, going under the skin, slicing the precious meat.*

*Soon it will be time to feed, I can keep him alive for a while, for a long while I hope.*

*Then it will be time to sing — Again.*

# Writers for Sci-fi Short Stories Publication

## Writers for Futura Magazine.

Hi there! As many as much of you may know, Medium these days have changed a lot of things to promote even more writers, making them build their own audience in the platform. As a consequence of this, publications have no more a submission option (as had before), and to keep any Publication alive, and displaying good and cool content you have to be a assigned “writer” for that publication.

As many of you may also know, back in 2013 I created the [Sci-fi Short Stories](https://medium.com/short-sci-fi-stories) (so called) ‘collection’, as a means to display my own (never written), and others sci-fi shorts. I thought it would be a good thing to give everyone the motivation and space to publish from their very professional to their out-of-the-box craziness and make available to anyone on internet. **It was.** A lot of good stuff popped on the collection, and I also partnered with [Thaddeus Howze](https://medium.com/@ebonstorm), one of the most assiduous collection’s contributors, to curate the collection with me as an editor. Things were going well (despite of some delay in the submissions’ acceptance) until the Medium’s changes.

Even though the Medium’s *modus operandi* has changed, is my wish to keep the (now so called) publication alive and functioning. I like very much science fiction, as a geek, and I even more like that sci-fi casual writers keep making their stories, that aspiring professional writers promote their work, or even that sci-fi fans make their shorts just for fun, and keep sharing with other fans in a place created specifically for this.

Being a publication writer is interesting in the way that you have your work aggregated with others in a showcase followed by lots of people, what rise the probability of reach some audience and be read, as well as know more people and increase your social interest network. Aside of this, you will still have your publication in your profile, and will have your self-built audience and network.

Having said this, I hope you accept joining the publication team of writers, (now composed only by Thaddeus). If you want to share your sci-fi shorts in a hub were others will be following and also publishing, fell free to leave your Medium id address (that one that is the same as Twitter’s) in the note aside and I will make you a writer of the publication.

## A distant star system on the edge of the galaxy…

![](1*_K4-qrz2V0cj-WXIar7HAw.jpeg)

*a tale of the twilight continuum*

The two of them stared out into the nebula lit by the cool K-type, which flickered orange in the distant vapor.

Theirs was a smooth quiet. One well-worn, rich with nuance, subtle displeasures, potent presuppositions, outlandish outrage, with nary a syllable between the two sentients.

A flicker of a tail, a crook of a staff; a singular duel of silence, each communicating both pleasure and disruption of quality of life, constant travel and insufferable company, with which, one would be bored with having to entertain their witless babble; immortal lives filled with nothing significant, no matter how far traveled.

Then the silence became even more strident. A paw lifted. And settled again, slightly akimbo.

A brow furrowed, a pregnant pause, and with an eloquence befit an aria of angels, an elbow bent, a hat tipped, a contract signed.

As the lawyer strode from the room, a pace measured with the click of a cane on a duraplas floor worth more than his entire firm, a silent prayer, to a dozen named gods, three of whom are still living, an interaction by which he will never need work again breathed only as the door closed behind him.

Still silent, he would have communicated his contempt, and his jealousy to his former client.

And he knew, his client would not care. His client owned an entire star system and named it after himself.

Cats don’t care what you think.

## A Near-Future Reaction to Nearly Total Surveillance

In a few neighborhoods like this one, where you’re [as likely to be shot and killed as go to college](http://www.sfchronicle.com/local/bayarea/item/Even-Odds-Part-1-22785.php), there are small planes [circling](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/04/sheriffs-deputy-compares-drone-surveillance-of-compton-to-big-brother/360954/) over our heads, always watching. It’s like Google Earth but live, and mostly just for [spying on brown folks](http://www.voanews.com/content/voa-exclusive-us-pakistan-view-drone-strikes-from-different-perspectives/1885498.html), as far as I can figure.

I’m not sure that if I could see or hear the plane it would [stress](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/death-from-above-how-american-drone-strikes-are-devastating-yemen-20140414) me out more than the nagging fact that neither ever happens.

Word has it that there are actually two, and they trade off when the other’s fuel edges near low. Important so that the livestream remains ever constant, uninterrupted. Given that they both operate without a pilot aboard, I’d guess that legend is nothing but a grand tale. Ever since that [solar drone](http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=20295&item=1425) has been in the air for over a month now, with it’s sights set on five *years*, why they’d have to buy two just for us baffles me.

But what do I know? Those FOIA documents our government was so proud of allowing [look more like boring white minimalist](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/natsec/wikileaksfoia/08LONDON2651.pdf) paintings than real reports. Ridiculous.

![[NASA](http://eoimages2.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/79000/79765/dnb_land_ocean_ice.2012.3600x1800.jpg)](1*mlFX-6h8YPo45q46TaoRGw.jpeg)*[NASA](http://eoimages2.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/79000/79765/dnb_land_ocean_ice.2012.3600x1800.jpg)*

A group of hobbyist astronomers — think investigative reporter meets conspiracy theorists — figured out you how to photograph the drone. They even managed published a fairly precise schedule of it’s movements online. Turns out when things are on autopilot, they tend to be fairly predictable, especially if the operators, whoever they are, thought nobody could see it.

Of course, a couple libertarians instantly started trying to [shoot the things down](http://theweek.com/article/index/247063/the-inanity-of-drone-hunting-licenses), and the schedule was promptly and algorithmically randomized. Them hobbyists were quietly asked to cease publishing their findings. Shocked us all when they actually did. I wonder what those spooks found on them, of course it’s wrapped up by some a [nondisclosure National Security Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Letter). Democracy at work. Most transparent presidency they said.

Now whenever any of us get’s caught we just blame the drone, but I can’t rightly say any more of us has been getting caught than before. The business has been just about as profitable as ever actually.

A corrupt cop is worth more than that fancy toy any day.

![[Facial Recognition Software](https://www.bolo411.com/facial-scanning-technology-for-police-surveillance/)](1*Xl7hrRvagBmk5sR-timjIQ.jpeg)*[Facial Recognition Software](https://www.bolo411.com/facial-scanning-technology-for-police-surveillance/)*

Besides, all they’ve seem to use this damn surveillance for is harassin [protesters](http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/10/18152849-unaware-of-tsarnaev-warnings-boston-counterterror-unit-tracked-protesters), [watching journalists](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/20/fox-news-reporter-targeted-us-government), and getting [free armature porn](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo). Typical. You build a [52 billion a year industry](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/black-budget/), and get porn and a [weirdo writer in prison](http://www.thenation.com/article/174851/strange-case-barrett-brown).

Shit, I wonder what our schools could do with that type of dough. I wonder what some real police accountability could do for this city, and I don’t mean [more settlements](http://oaklandpolicebeat.com/2014/04/oakland-spent-74-million-settling-417-police-brutality-lawsuits/), but real change. I guess I’m one to talk, I did used to sling dope all over this town.

But I’m trying to get my shit back in line now, which is harder than you might think, say if you went one of those fancy schools. Once they installed those damned [license plate readers](http://betaboston.com/news/2014/03/05/a-vast-hidden-surveillance-network-runs-across-america-powered-by-the-repo-industry/) all over this city, these days my criminal record and skin tone warrants probable cause. I’m algorithmically stopped nearly every week. You think that makes things easier on the job hunt? I’m trying here. To top that, this [gang Injunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_injunction) nonsense means I can’t talk to half the people in this neighborhood. It’s illegal for me to network.

I can’t even talk to my own brother on the phone, else that meta-whatever pops up and says I’m conspiring with the gang again. Shit’s just wrong.

And don’t get me started about what I’m supposed to do about AA meetings, a signal intelligence debacle if there ever was one. The only thing in my life that ever helped me get to be a better person raises major algorithmic eyebrows every time there’s a meeting. You think a bunch of ex-junkies strolling into a building at the same time, relentlessly calling each other for support, and which has anonymity as a founding principle goes unnoticed? Forget it.

Throwing people like me in prison [faster than any country in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate) certainly aint doing what AA is. It is the largest, entirely free, and member run chemical dependency program in the world afterall…

But hey I get it, I had my Escalade, they got a drone. Power baby, sometimes to keep it, you gotta flaunt it.

# Crystal Gods

## Two scouts redefine value and a worthless rock becomes the most important thing in the galaxy.
*Alex Pascenko*

***From a writing prompt provided by [Scifi Ideas](http://www.scifiideas.com/sfi/story-ideas/starting-point-crystal-gods/).***

*Jayvin approached the crystalline plant structure with curious eyes.*

*It was old. Centuries old. And it had grown to enormous proportions. Little wonder the villagers revered it so deeply; it must have been here for countless generations, and the way it glowed was… Jayvin wanted to think of it as magical. He tried to see it through the villagers’ eyes, he really did, but to him it was actually kind of eerie.*

*At the base of the crystal, the villagers had carved a series of shallow stone steps, and a deep fissure cut right to its glowing heart. This must be what the villagers called ‘the alter’. Jayvin could believe that their offerings affected the crystal in some way — or rather the lifeforms living inside it. Perhaps it — or they — could even be reliant on them in some way. But the miraculous powers Yin’Hal had described… No, that was impossible.*

*“Hey, Jayvin. Come look at this.” *Jayvin was the junior science technician on-board the Scout-ship *Investigare*, sent to the planet to make a collection of scientific data for the Hegemony’s galactic database. The initial probe released onto the planet revealed a number of study-worthy structures, some natural formations, two dozen various plants and animals and the local sapients who called themselves the Marin’Hal, or The People of the Crystal Palace.

The senior science officer Dupree, had a different view of the most noteworthy of plant structures, the blue-green crystalline colossus, a decidedly non-magical one. The man had ice water in his veins and a heart that functioned on a purely logic-driven mechanism. Jayvin was happy he hadn't chosen to accompany them to the planet and stayed on the ship citing a need to complete requisition orders for their next, more important, mission.

Dupree had already written this planet off as a lost cause. There was no chance at profit or a finder’s fee due to the local indigenous population. For a scout crew, planets without intelligent life netted the most from their corporate masters. The natives were already quite intelligent, had an understanding of life on other planets, even though they had no apparent interest in building spaceships.

Though the translation program they used was still less than perfect, the translation, as near as they could understand was “Why would we want to go anywhere else? We are already at home.”

The exo-biologist Dr. Carine Fisher had a completely different perspective from Officer Dupree and cultivated the same sense of fascination with the planet Jayvin did. She was already looking deeper into the fantastic flora and fauna than the science officer ever did. Every world no matter how intelligent the sapient life might be was a treasure trove to her.

Approaching the heart of the great flower with Dr. Fisher, Jayvin kept his log recorder gathering every scrap of data on this giant structure possible. The natives did not prevent them from approaching the plant but the longer they scanned it, the more like an animal the crystalline structure seemed to be.

Not quite flora, not quite fauna, for that matter, not quite crystal though it appeared to be a structure carved from a single long chain molecular matrix. It drew its color from local minerals in the soil and the natives indicated it changed its color as it entered different phases of its existence.

Dr. Fisher was bubbling with enthusiasm as she gathered samples. The shaman, Yin’Hal, whose name meant, the soul of the People, said a collection of tiny samples would not hurt the great plant. “Jayvin, the central region of the planet actually seems to have a series of structures within it that may act as a nervous system. They are found only in the central region and their level of complexity is fifty thousand times denser than any other cellular structure in the plant.”

Jayvin adapted his scanner and studied the readings. “This level of density is only found in animals, and higher order ones at that. It resembles something akin to a nervous system. Are you sure we are translating what the local shaman *Yin’Hal *said?”

Fisher, absentmindedly, sat down on the platform region in the central hub of the plant, apparently affected by the heat of this inner forested region. Nearly fifty-seven degrees centigrade was difficult to handle even for engineered humans designed for extreme environments.

She was from a lower gravity world and thus would stop to take breaks more often than Jayvin did, whose parents were heavy-gravity miners in the Orinus Cluster. One of the reasons he got this job was because he could carry more equipment than most of the technicians on the *Investigare. *That and his functional IQ of 164. The Hegemony educational specialist thought he would be a natural at Exobiology due to his experiences on the deathworld his parents had chosen to mine and survive on.

When she sat down, she dropped her equipment and arched her back as if she were being electrified. Jayvin reached out to grab her when the prehensile tail of Yin’Hal gently held my hand back. The tail had incredible strength and while gentle, he would not be able to reach her unless zhe wanted me to.

“The Chareun’Hal has chosen her. It would be better to touch not.” Yin’Hal spoke gently and my translator necklace repeated his statement in Galac Three.

“How long will she be like that? What’s happening to her? Is she in danger?”

“She harmed will not. Chareun’Hal fills with wisdom and prepares for transition to the next world.” The simian-like form of Yin’Hal while half Jayvin’s respectable height of two meters, was clearly physically his superior. The scans of the species indicated a sophisticated level of genetic development which bordered upon the Hegemony’s best gene-engineering.

The Marin’Hal were physically fit, retaining their faculties throughout their long lifespans. All the members possessed a variety of superior traits including heightened intelligence and psychological balance.

All of the interactions with the Marin’Hal indicated they knew nothing of duplicity, nor envy and were not capable of telling an untruth, not even having a word for the concept. They shared everything and had no concept of ownership. “We hope you will consider taking communion with the Chareun’Hal when she is finished.”

“I will sit here and wait, if that’s okay.” Jayvin didn't want to leave her if he could help it.

First Science Technician Jayvin sat there on and off for sixteen days. He became quite worried when the plant structure began to fill the “altar” with a thick webbing that developed so slowly he didn't even realize it was happening at first. But different members of the Marin’Hal would sit with him, since they all had specified duties to perform, each indicated all was as it should be.

The captain called down and bellowed that the two of them had a standard month to complete their survey and that their time was nearly over. Jayvin assured him everything would be ready to go on time and with enough data to make the survey more than break even. Xeno-biologists of the Hegemony would pay *Investigare *well for the biological data of X’Hal and its inhabitants. Not what our corporate clients would for complete physical resources of a planet but definitely enough to fund two or three more major expeditions to survey-worthy systems.

The Captain grunted and likely went back to work on preparing the ship for its next jump. Jayvin had spent his two weeks doing the rest of the survey since he was told there would be plenty of notice when she was ready. He found the Marin’Hal both funny and fascinating, often in the same breath.

He found the local forests filled with integrated farming techniques. The Marin’Hal were able to show how they harvested the local forests in a pattern that did not destabilize their growth or over-harvest the forest. There was a series of soil enhancements done from a variety of domesticated animals, always underway keeping the forest around the Charuen’Hal rich and vibrant and the extensive families of the Marin’Hal fed and comfortable.

Their language was rich and diverse and actually broken into several layers, with a separate language for mathematics, history and science. He was never truly able to understand how they described art because it seemed there was an “art” to everything. As he learned more about them, he discovered an underlying artwork in everything they did, no surface went uncarved or modified, he had not recognized it as art until he learned to complement the unique etchings of each Marin’Hal home. The time passed productively. By the time Yin’Hal told him Dr. Fisher was ready he had almost forgotten she was on the planet.

The climb to the center chamber was much easier than his first visit after recognizing the pattern of mathematics this planet’s inhabitants embedded in everything. When he reached the inner chamber it was almost clear again and he could see Dr. Fisher. But there was something wrong with her appearance. It was only as the webbing cleared did he know what it was.

When she woke it was shocking to find her blue eyes had become the golden color of nearly every Marin’Hal. Just as shocking was the beautiful coat of golden fur she now sprouted from every visible patch of skin.

Recognition of where she was seemed to return to her in a few moments and then she smiled. She reached into her pocket and found her communicator. She activated it and spoke rapidly into it.

“Captain, I don’t think you want to rush right out of system, just yet.” Her voice had become smoky and deep, something Jayvin found compelling.

“Who the hell is this and how did you get Dr. Fisher’s communicator?”

Before she could speak again, Jayvin covered her mouth with his hand. The captain’s hello vanished into the vast chamber below as it slipped from her hand and down the stairs.

“You might not want to call the ship just yet. Remember, they don’t wear translators on board all the time.”

She look back at Jayvin as he considered the softness of her new golden fur. “Why would it matter if they did?”

“You realize you are not speaking Galac Three, right?”

“Excuse me?”

“Right now, you are speaking in the native language. Fluently, I might add.”

She stood still for a moment as if taking a mental inventory before speaking again. Her voice quavered as she switched roughly to Galac Three, the primary tech language of the Hegemony. “If there ever was a time to renegotiate your pay rate, now would be the time. I wouldn't even move from this spot until you get a renegotiation.

“This planet isn't just beautiful and inhabited. We were so wrong about this system. This plant/animal/fungus isn't being worshiped. It is part of the entire neural network of these structures on the planet. This node is just one of these organs. It functions as some kind of realtime array connecting each of them to a central brain. This planet is alive!”

“You mean this planet is aware? Sentient?”

“Yes, and better than that, it can connect to any other one of its kind in real time. Yes, that connection that normally takes two weeks just to get to the inner communication array and back to us? They can do that instantly. While we wait.”

Jayvin sat down staggered by the implications. “Who can they talk to? What are its limits?” It was the technician in him. He had to know who could be reached and how.

“Each of these worlds, if willing, could send and route trillions of communications links to any such world like themselves. It might not work for every kind of comm-link need but it could certainly make any enterprising captain and his partnered-planet wealthy enough to retire from the drudgery and monotony of a Scout ship captain and his crew. Emphasis on crew.”

“You might not want to sit down there too long, young one.” Yin’Hal poked Jayvin with his tail. “Unless you are prepared to be chosen for transition.” He gestured pointing at Dr. Fisher.

“Noted.” He started to stand up and then sat back down. “What does it feel like?”

Fisher smiled and her tail rose up and flicked him on the nose. “Like being in communication with a webwork of information formed from billions of minds. You can’t retain everything but what you could learn might set you up for life. Just focus on what matters most to you.”

“Oh, and I hope you like the fur, it can be removed but it takes much longer for the process to be reversed. There is an adjustment time before it’s safe to remove it. So it means at least a year with a beautiful coat of fur.”

Jayvin looked at Dr. Fisher and smiled. “Yes, I like the fur. Quite a bit in fact.”

Fisher looked at Jayvin, as if for the very first time. Her smile was radiant. “I think it will look good on you too.”

Fisher stepped out of the central chamber of the Chareun’Hal and the Marin’Hal stepped back with her. Jayvin smiled and said before the transition began to take place, “Guess you get to explain why we’re going to be two weeks late and why both of us will need to hire our own stylists before we move into the luxuries of retirement.”

# No Time

## Time travel is impossible. Obviously.

Harry sat in the time machine and cried. Not the usual tear leaking from a reluctant eye; this time the dam burst into great heart-wrenching sobs, his shirt front wet from tears streaming down his cheeks and dripping off his chin. He pitched forward onto the control panel and buried his face in his arms.

“This… (gasp) is prob’ly…” he blubbered, “jus’ what I need.” Yes, he thought, good old catharsis — discharge those stress batteries. But when you’re all cried out and the endorphins kick in, Lora’s still gone and the job’s still lost and the house is still foreclosed and the repo man is still coming today. All because of this stupid obsession that everyone but you knows will never work.

Control regained, he sat back up in the “driver’s seat” and began fiddling with the dials and switches. Today, like every day, Harry had started his morning by running the machine through a checklist as if he were really going to make that first trip into what he called “no-time”. The PBR was up, providing all the power he could need. (Of course, when they found out about that he was going to do some hard time, if they didn’t just blow him away when they arrived. The fact that it used thorium instead of weapons-grade fissionables wasn’t going to cut any ice; private citizens just didn’t get to build their own reactors.) The atomic-scale cavities of the microlinacs were ready to be resonated by the laser, generating colliding TeV beams in the space of a few meters — that would certainly draw some attention if the time machine stuck around. But the whole idea was to generate microscopic black holes in orbit about each other, producing a naked singularity through which one could pass into what amounted to a different universe, one with “time” on a different axis from this one, in which case no one in this universe was going to notice. The really tricky part was getting the orbits to expand until the singularity was big enough to contain the whole time machine, which was, except for a few bushes, some grass and slabs of sidewalk outside, just his house.

“Repossess that, assholes!” he thought as he wiped his eyes and blew his nose.

Naturally, Harry had to cut a few corners here and there to get this built without any help. In particular, it would have been nice to *test* a few of the components before they all had to work at once. As it was, he was almost certainly going to die spectacularly if he pushed the STOP button today, which was why he had not pushed it any of the preceding days.

Now, however, there was nothing left to lose. And he had better get on with it, since the repo man would be here any minute.

“Oh well,” he thought with a grim smile, “in for a dime, in for a dollar.” And he pushed STOP.

Nothing happened.

“Shit,” he thought, “I’m not even dead.” He checked all the instruments. Everything looked fine, and the gravity gradiometer even registered a field consistent with successful formation of the singularity, but nothing else seemed changed.

Harry got up and went to the window to look out. At least he tried to look out. Somehow his eyes wouldn’t work in that direction. He swept his focus across the window frame and it just jumped from one edge to the other without any in between. His heart leaped.

“It’s working,” he thought. “It works!” he shouted.

So this was what no-time was like from the inside. Pretty much indistinguishable from normal time, except his location in normal spacetime couldn’t even be defined.

Well, well, so now what? Harry had to choose a reentry point. It wasn’t too clear whether his spatial return coordinates could be selected arbitrarily, but they had better be, because otherwise the only safe *time* to return to would be exactly — and he meant truly *exactly* — when he had left. Otherwise he would most likely arrive in the middle of interplanetary space, since (any way you look at it) the Earth would not be where it was when he left. He would have to select a new time and calculate the new position to go with it. Moreover, his calculations had better be extremely precise, because if he returned to the right place at a different time of day, his house might be upside down. This was going to be tricky. He had always known that, but since he never really expected to survive the initial test, he hadn’t worried about it too much. Now he was starting to break into a sweat.

There were other worries too. What would the people left behind see while he was gone? Was the house — and the time machine! — still there back on Earth? That would complicate matters considerably, especially if he returned to find the space occupied. Ouch!

Well, he had expected to die today, so nothing had really changed yet. “The experiment must continue,” he muttered; it was a phrase he had heard somewhere, and it stuck with him. Still, the basic idea *worked*, by god. That was something. That was a *lot*.

“Okay,” Harry said out loud, “time to pick a time. Time to get back in time. Time for time.” This was a cute playground for semantics. Anyway, he had to select a time for his reentry before he could calculate the place. It had to be an even number of sidereal days, exactly. It had to be in the future, because of the potential for unpleasant paradoxes like accidentally preventing his parents from meeting. It had to be not *too* far in the future, so that he wouldn’t be easily identified as anachronistic — a certain amount of geeky disregard for fashion and ignorance of current events would escape notice, but there were limits. Also he’d like to understand what was going on, how science had developed, stuff like that. He decided to jump forward five years.

He refined this to an exact integer number of sidereal days, got up, stretched extravagantly and went to the kitchen to make himself a sandwich. “No need to hurry,” he thought, “I’ve got all the no-time in the world.” But he was beginning to feel a tad isolated. It *was* a little unnerving to know that you’re the only human being in the universe you currently inhabit.

After his snack he carefully calculated spatial coordinates for his return. He had to adjust his velocity too, but not too much, since he had also chosen an integer number of solar years. He sat back in the driver’s seat, dialed in the spacetime coordinates, triple-checked all the settings, crossed his fingers and pressed the GO button.

As he pressed GO, Harry’s heart leaped into his throat. This time he really was expecting to die, and probably a pretty ugly death at that. But except for a faint *clunk*, again nothing happened.

Wincing, he stole a peek out the window. His neighbor’s house had reappeared.

Harry leaped from his seat and ran to the front door, which he swung wide on a sunny day. Except for a faint crack in the sidewalk and a slight change of color in the grass demarking the boundary of the time machine’s capsule, nothing was changed.

“Well, this answers a whole lot of questions,” thought Harry, “but it raises even more. Like, what did George see over here for the last five years?” He looked over at his neighbor’s house, and there George was, mowing his lawn with the same old push mower. Always the traditionalist, that George.

George waved. Harry waved back. “What the hell?” thought Harry. Hesitantly, he stepped out and strolled over to Harry’s fresh-mowed lawn. It smelled good. Everything smelled good. It was great to be alive.

“Hey George,” Harry called, “how you been?”

“No change since yesterday,” George answered, a quizzical look on his face. “How about you?”

Okay, this is weird, thought Harry. I was here yesterday, apparently, but when I came back from no-time I didn’t run into myself. Luckily. But… better answer George before he thinks I’m even weirder.

“About the same, I guess. What, uh, what were we talking about yesterday?”

George chuckled. “What we always talk about, dummy. Your stupid time machine.”

Uh oh, thought Harry. “Yeah, of course. Hey, remember when the repo man was coming to take away all my stuff?”

“Sure,” said George, looking up curiously, “that was five years ago today, wasn’t it?”

“Yeah, about…. I forget the details….”

“Don’t give me that bullshit,” said George, “you still talk about it all the time, gloating about how you cashed in some of your secret stash of Google stocks just before he arrived, and shoved a suitcase full of money in his face.”

What the hell? thought Harry again. He smiled nervously to show he had just been kidding around. “Guilty. Just wanted to see if you remembered.”

“Yeah, well, I still want to know how you managed to buy up so much Google stock when it first went public. Ask me, I bet that damn time machine actually works. I don’t care what you say.”

Harry thought fast. “Yeah, and tomorrow I’m gonna go visit your great-great grandmother,” he said with a leer. George waved him away in disgust, as he’d hoped, and he wandered casually back to his front door, waving over his shoulder on his way.

Inside the house, Harry closed the door and leaned against the wall in disbelief. What the *hell!* he thought. Paradoxes are bad enough; this is *impossible*. My house has been here all along, while it was in no-time, and someone has been pretending to be me, talking about the damn time machine, for crying out loud.

Wait a minute. George knew him too well to be fooled by a fake. That meant it had actually *been* him talking to George for the last five years. So there were two of him? That’s got to be wrong. What if he ran into himself next? If it really was him, Harry, he’d know better than to risk that. He’d also know how crazy this was making him now, and he’d leave a note or something. Where?

Harry ran into his office and checked his desk. Nothing. He looked in all the drawers. Nothing. He started to turn on the computer and realized abruptly that this was pointless; the inside of *this* house had been in no-time with him for the last five years. There couldn’t be any notes in here.

Then he remembered something that had caught his eye as he walked out and in the front door: a big white manila envelope on the grass just outside the boundary of the singularity. He rushed back to open the door and sure enough, there it was. Must be it, he thought. Grabbing the envelope, he rushed back inside, tore it open and read the first page, written in his own handwriting.

“You’ve got it about right,” the note said, “but it’s a lot more complicated than you think. Read the enclosed, and don’t skip over anything, you lazy bastard. Your life depends on it. And a hell of a lot more.”

When the sun went down, Harry was still re-reading the notes he had written to himself. More like an instruction manual for the world’s most complex home electronics, actually — and in fact that was pretty much what it was. And the person who wrote it was not exactly him… well, it *was* him, in the sense of “person”, but not in the sense of physical body, although that wouldn’t be obvious…. Oh boy, he thought, time to recap again, for the tenth time.

Starting from “here, now” he was going to make a series of hops forward in time, gathering up advanced technology for human cloning and then for memory storage and retrieval. He couldn’t go *back* in time because, for one thing, it invited causal paradoxes, and for another thing, his time machine lacked the ability. So his last stop in the future would be to grab that necessary technology out of a heavily guarded lab where it would be developed and then suppressed by paranoid agents.

Well, actually it wasn’t fair to call them paranoid. Who would feel comfortable if anyone else could zip back in time and make it so you never were born? And there’s the unanswered question of what would happen to the universe if a self-contradictory causal loop came into being. Hmm, “came into” is certainly the wrong term, but it got even worse when you mixed in quantum mechanics and general relativity. Never mind, there lies madness.

Anyway, why would *he* want to mess around with something that crazy and probably rather dangerous? That’s where it got interesting. See, most of these paradoxes have to do with creating contradictions in this spacetime continuum, like when you went back and shot your own grandfather or something — even a much more innocuous change would very likely mean that you would never be born, or at least that you would never get around to building that time machine, so you would never go back and do whatever it was that screwed things up… Never mind, again.

However, what happens in no-time *stays* in no-time. It is out of the causal loop in this spacetime. Too bad he wasn’t born in no-time. But he would be. That was the gimmick! Using cloning equipment brought “aboard” the time machine, he would make a new copy of his body while in no-time. Using the memory storage and retrieval technology, he would download (or upload — which would this be?) his own memories into the cloned body, still in no-time, and the new him would literally not be of this world. When the original Harry eventually died of old age, the clone Harry could then go *back* in time without fear of creating physically meaningful causal paradoxes.

The logic of this sounded rather suspicious to this Harry, but since his no-time alter ego had returned the house-*cum*-time machine at the instant he left and stayed until the instant he returned (thus allowing the 5-year masquerade with George and god knows who else) it was obviously working.

Apparently there were lots of other tracks to be covered, in all those dips into the future and past that no-Harry had described, but this Harry presumed they were being handled at this very no-moment by no-Harry, since there were no detailed instructions for him in the notes. Or maybe he would find additional notes later.

Harry’s head hurt. He opened a beer from the refrigerator, downed several aspirin tablets with it, warmed up a frozen pizza and ate it (along with several more beers) for dinner, and went to bed without turning on the TV.

Harry woke with a start, sweaty from a bad dream in which he was pursued by indistinct alien creatures from no-time. “Got to cut back on pizza and beer,” he thought. Stupid dream. No aliens in no-time. Probably. Damn, what if there *were*? Now he was awake, thinking….

He hadn’t given much thought to the details of time travel when he was working on the machine. If the truth be told, he never really expected it to work. But work it did, by god! He was going to be famous!

No, wait. He was going to be completely unknown. People could never suspect what he was up to, or half of them would be after his machine and the other half would be after *him*, with pitchforks! So why the hell had no-Harry *told* George about the time machine? That was crazy. Unless it wasn’t. Method in his madness? Ouch, head starting to hurt again.

Sitting up, Harry wondered again what the aliens were all about. Dreams were usually worth analyzing, he had found, as long as you don’t get too serious about it. What had been rattling around in his subconscious? Let’s see, free association: aliens, space aliens, time travel, spacetime… Hey, *space travel!*

The time machine was also a spaceship, or else he would not have gotten “home” to his current location on the Earth five years in the future. He hadn’t really expected to succeed in controlling the full range of spacetime coordinates *and* velocity, but it worked! And he could do a lot more with that than just move back and forth in time. He could go exploring! Oh boy, this was like being a kid in a candy store.

He got up and brushed his teeth and washed his face, then went to the kitchen for a cup of instant cappuccino and a bowl of cereal. His mind was sharp now, rested and alert, but it reeled from the realization of how much *power* was now in his hands.

He could grab people who were about to be killed, like in those movies, and take them to distant planets to start new human colonies. Hmm, that might not be very kind to the distant planets. He could search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Hmm, that could prove dangerous to the terrestrial variety. He could bring back technology from the future… no, that would certainly create paradoxes. What the hell *could* he do?

What was no-Harry doing?

Maybe the only safe thing would be to follow no-Harry’s instructions meticulously, swap himself into a no-clone which would *be* no-Harry, and then just hop around making little improvements here and there in the spacetime continuum. See how things turn out if Kennedy weren’t killed in Dallas. Put a bug in the ear of Truman, get him to demo the A-bomb out in front of Tokyo instead of just dropping it on Hiroshima. Tip off gate security people about the box cutters on 9/11. Get Hitler a good job as a SF writer before he got into politics. Who knows, maybe some of these would just make things worse; but then he could re-tweak. There was all the no-time in the world.

Maybe the best idea would be to just make tiny little changes, make good coincidences more common and bad ones less, arrange for missed opportunities not to be. A pat here, a nudge there, maybe if he kept re-cloning himself indefinitely he could make a better world for everyone…

And then it hit him: what do you call someone who has the power to retroactively adjust the universe?

Harry wasn’t sure he was up to the job, but he’d sure as hell give it a try.

# The Autobiography of a Dictionary

## Story: (n) an account of invented or imagined events, etc.

It was his 11th birthday. I was to be his present.

His uncle had a contact in the agency.

I am the first copy of the new edition. Between the hardcover bindings, my pages hide words that have been lost for countless years, and some that have been newly formed. I am the bridge between old and new. I am the biggest book of words ever printed in one copy. I am a dictionary of the 22nd century.
> Unique: (adj) Unlike anything else; being the only one of its type.

Wrapped in shiny paper, I travelled in the uncle’s bag. I was to come out of the wrappings on the given day and surprise my First Reader. I was to be his source of knowledge; I was to be his friend.

Little did I know, people don’t usually get along, as you’d hoped.

On his birthday, wrapped in the shiny paper I was handed to him. The paper was hastily torn off to reveal my hardbound cover. The words read there
> # Oxford Dictionary
> # 22nd Century Edition

I greeted him well. My hardbound back made sure I don’t slouch. I met his eyes head on. He opened me up, rifled through a few of my pages and ended up tossing me aside.

“What do I do with a Dictionary? I could just say the word and my device would tell me the meaning of it, pronto. Why go around looking in a dictionary, when my devices can simply tell me?!” the child yelled.

His words sent a feeling down my spine. What word was it?
> Disappoint: (v) to prevent a hope, plan, etc from becoming reality.

I was the first copy of a new series. I was hardbound with a plethora of words no one has heard of before. With me at his side, he could take over the world.

But he did not want me.

Why?

Because I could not actually talk.

I hid myself among the lose shiny paper of his other gifts. They had apples on them. God had forbidden them, as the story goes. And here they were, still leading mankind to doom.

My would-be First Reader played with his toys and new devices. Each one had a voice. Each one spoke back to him.

‘I have a voice, it’s written on these pages,’ I wanted to yell at him. But I could not. I kept quiet, finding the right word for the moment.
> Patience: (n) (with sb/sth) The ability to accept delay, annoyance or suffering without complaining.

My First Reader, had shelved me at the top most tier on the little book shelf in the living room. He used a ladder to get up there, hastily placing me at the edge as if happy to be rid of my presence.

Time went by. I lay up there, forgotten.

I waited, patiently.

After a year had gone by, I heard my First Reader’s parents.

“You be a good boy, now. Lock all the doors at night. And call Aunty Linda if you need anything. Her number is on all the devices.”

“Yes, mom,” said the boy, eager for the conversation to be over.

I could sense the impatience in his voice. That feeling had become all too familiar.

Once his parents left, he plopped himself on the couch and yelled as if he was the master of the house, “Play Game.”

And it did. Lines and shapes flickered on the wall in front of me. I knew what it was. There was an old word for this.
> Video game: (n) A game played using a home computer, etc in which the player controls images on a television screen.

Some kids will never change.

I sat where I was, counting the dust motes in the sunlit air near me. Slowly as the day went by, even the light disappeared.

The night had come.

The boy had turned his gaming device off and gone to sleep.

In the silence of the night, there was a sudden noise in the living room. I tried to look around in the dark, but I could see nothing. I could just hear a sound come in rhythm. What was it called again?
> Footfall: (n) the sound of somebody walking, the sound of footsteps.

Could it be the First Reader? In the darkness I saw a faint silhouette.
It was not the boy, it was someone else. Someone bigger. Who could it be? There was no one else in the house. The word suddenly came to me.
> Thief: (n) pl thieves: a person who steals, esp secretly and without violence.

I tried to shout out. But of course, I wasn’t meant to. I only hoped and prayed the boy would come.

The devices could not talk either as the thief disconnected them and put them in his bag. So much for their talking ability, for all the good it did that night.

One by one they disappeared into the thief’s bag.

Then, I heard another set of footsteps. Were my prayers answered or did the boy know his precious devices were being stolen? I will never know; but he was there.

From my vantage point, I looked down upon the scene. I now wished he was back in his bed and safe. What chance did a 12 year old have with a fully grown thief? The answer I found within myself.
> None: (of sb/sth) not one; not any.

In the faint light, the boy saw the thief steal his devices. He rushed at him. But the thief had heard the boy and was taking out his gun. He fired, but the boy was too close to him. He missed.

The reverberation of the shot shook me.

The man and the boy struggled, in a tangle of limbs. The thief pushed the boy out of his way. He fell straight into the bookshelf I sat on. The entire bookshelf wobbled and I was dislodged from the place I rested and tumbled down.

As I fell, I felt a tingling sensation down my spine like never before. I even had the perfect word to describe it.
> Destiny: (n) the power believed to control events; fate.

I fell straight onto the torso of my First Reader.

BANG!

Another shot fired; the proximity of the shot deafened me. But then I felt something worse. A piercing pain spread through my hardcover, all the way to the spine.

My First Reader was unconscious. I was fading too.

But we were both alive.

Unable to see me in the dark, the thief took the devices and ran. My First Reader lay under me, unconscious. He could not have prevented the theft, anyway.

Since that day, life changed for me. I did not patiently sit at the top of the bookshelf. I sat in the centre of it. As a place of honour, I take it.

Sometimes, my First Reader—who is growing up to be quite the intelligent young man—takes me down and pours over my words. All the while, his finger run in and out of the bullet hole in my hardcover. It feels…what’s the word…the wound has made me a little slow…
> Content: (adj) with sth: feeling satisfaction with what one has; not wanting more; happy.

The loss of the devices were a blessing. My First Reader and I spent a lot of time together, learning and growing each day. His feelings for me grew to such an extent, after saving his life, the only word I feel that describes it is
> Ineffable: (adj) too great to be described in words.

And here my story, of my transformation from a dictionary to a saviour, ends. I doubt any of his talking devices could ever have claimed the same. But then again, all they could do was talk. None of them were hardbound.
> End: (n) the final part of a story, an event, an activity, a period of time, etc; the finish; the conclusion.

# Noir Space

## Abandonment
*Sophie Maus*

“Ellen,” Jenny said, “Ellen,” but Ellen was absentmindedly looking out the window, so Jenny repeated raising her voice, “Ellen!”

“Huh, I’m sorry Jenny. I didn’t hear you, I mean I heard you, but… never mind, come here.”

“No listen, Maddy is trying to contact you.” Jenny said waving her smartscreen around.

“Oh, I left my screen on the transport. Anyway, just come here something is going on down there.” Ellen hadn’t turned away from the window.

Jenny threw her smartscreen on the couch and made her way to the window. She stood next to Ellen, their shoulders imperceptibly touching. The window was off and you could see the city’s buildings rising into the clouds. “Where?” Jenny asked.

“Down there near 5th and 103rd.”

Jenny gasped, “What is going on?”

“I don’t know. The peacekeepers evacuated the police. Oh my god!” Ellen put both hands against the window.

“What?”

Ellen pounded on the window, “Get out of there… get out of there…”

Jenny followed Ellen’s gaze and covered her mouth, “Oh… What is going on?” She asked again, “Call Maddy, Ellen, call him right now.” Jenny turned from the window and ran to unlock the door. When she turned around Ellen was still at the window. “Ellen! Call Maddy!” She shouted.

Ellen finally reacted and picked up the smart screen on the couch. “Call Maddy Marquez.” The screen blipped, but Maddy did not answer. “Maddy pick up the phone. Listen, I left my phone on the transport, but things are getting bad down here. We are going to leave, meet us at,” Ellen paused and looked at Jenny, who gestured at her eye, “meet us at the eye. Remember the eye, meet us at the eye, e-y-e.” Ellen swiped the screen off, and turned to the window again.

“We have to get out of here, but how?”

Ellen backed away from the window, “Let’s go!”

She grabbed Jenny by the hand and led her out the door, “It’s rising.”

When they reached the bottom floor, the water was already pouring into the building. There was a group of people gathered at the bottom of the stairwell screaming at each other.

Jenny asked the nearest person, a rotund man, what was going on. He said, “The water is boiling hot. We don’t know what to do.”

“What about the peacekeepers?” Ellen shouted over the noise.

The man responded, “They left, moved on to the next building.”

“Come on Ellen.” Jenny shouted and started running up the stairs.

They reached the roof.

“The water keeps rising Jenny!” Ellen said when she reached the ledge of the building. “Give me your screen, I’m going to call Maddy again.” Jenny handed Ellen the screen. “Call Maddy.”

“Service is unavailable.”

A cloud of gushing water shot from the ground 100 feet above where the girls stood on the roof. The raindrops that fell back burned the skin. Both Jenny and Ellen screamed from the pain and ran for cover. People started pouring into the roof.

They hid under a decorative porch. The water kept shooting up from all sides of the building.

“Ellen, what are we going to do, what are we going to do?”

“It’s too late now.”

They held each other in silence. The crowd had surrounded them. Some people screamed incoherently, while others prayed to their gods.

“Ellen! Jenny!” They heard a man’s cry somewhere in the crowd.

“Maddy!” Ellen shouted.

Maddy’s shouts grew closer, and as they both moved towards his shouts. They were finally at the edge where the boiling droplets were scalding those not under the porch. People were fighting to get under the porch. They saw him under the raining hell. His skin was full of boils. Ellen immediately went to hug him, but he recoiled in pain. They were both under the scorching rain.

“We have to get out of here.” Jenny shouted over the crowd.

“There is no way out.” Maddy said, “The thermos are spilling the lava from deep inside the Earth. It is causing the oceans to expand. The thermo under the city cracked also. That is why the water is scolding hot; under all of this lava is gushing out at an incredible rate.”

“Is there an evacuation?” Ellen whispered.

“No, they... we are on our own.”

# Past the Gas Giant

## Past the Gas Giant

The Commander was off, racing through the void towards *Karat*. He launched from MC-13, also known as “Georgia”, the 13th colony humanity had erected on Mars. The colony was known for its massive launching pads, and was able to handle multiple cargo launches a day. This alone made it crucial to Mars’ economy, but there was something else about MC-13.

MC-13 is not only the most import “port” for the colonies of Mars, it also serves as the FSAA’s secret testing facility. The FSAA believes that sometimes, immoral things must be done to push the boundaries of humanities capabilities. On Earth, this would be impossible to get away with, but far away on the Red Planet they could do what they wished. For Science. For Humanity.

The Commander was closing in on the Asteroid Belt, and went to take control of *Black North*. Since the launch, *Black North* had been set in autopilot, but now with the Asteroid Belt upon him, the Commander was allowed to take the wheel. He was only allowed this time by the FSAA so he could get a feel for the ship before he reached *Karat. *After he was through, however, he would have to relinquish his control. The slingshot maneuver around Jupiter would have to be perfect if they wished for *Black North *to reach its top speed.

![](1*pPWXt3T80o2DWzAr80Y_5g.jpeg)

*Black North* reacted smoothly to every command it was given. At the controls, the Commander felt as if he was becoming one with the ship. Its technology was centuries ahead of its time. “Only God knows what the FSAA did to accomplish these feats”, thought the Commander. It accelerated swiftly, and danced nimbly in and out of the rocky asteroids. He remembered his first mission, and thought of how far humanity had come in relatively little time. Back then there was no controlling, every step of the way was planned, and calculated by the scientists back home. The real work didn’t begin until they arrived in orbit around their destination, and either took notes from there, or began their descent to the surface. The Commander was coming quickly upon the edge of the Asteroid Belt. He did not wish for his joyride to be over quite yet, and began to turn the ship around. Something drew him to a small asteroid, maybe even smaller than *Black North *itself. He brought the ship to a halt just above the asteroid, and made his way to the airlock. On his first mission past Mars, he came and danced among these asteroids. He thought it fitting to come, and do it once more on what might be his last. Nostalgia reached out to his heart like strings, and joined past and present, but woven in the threads was darkness.

He stepped foot on the small asteroid, and thought how nice it was without gravity weighing him down. He bounced around freely for awhile, until something caught his eye. Out among the gray rocks of the asteroid, there was a single point of blackness. Like a pixel going out in your computer screen. Without gravity, he was able to reach the point in a few leaps and bounds. The black point was only a pebble, but when the Commander went to pick it up, it was incredibly heavy. The Commander had to use all of his strength to pick up the pebble, and lug it back to the landing pod. “So much for not being weighed down anymore”, thought the Commander.

Aboard *Black North, *the Commander heaved the black pebble to the lab. There he would be able to examine the mysterious pebble, and hopefully determine its nature. It was a tiny thing, maybe the width of a dime, and almost as slim. However, now that it was under normal gravity, it weighed over 300 kilograms! The Commander knew from experience how heavy the damned thing was, but he would never have guessed so high. Further examination revealed nothing to the Commander, but almost confirmed his suspicions. The rock was of the same material *Karat *is, and might have came from there. He could not be sure yet, so he put the pebble somewhere safe for now, and sent the data he gathered back to the FSAA. With the pebble stored away, the Commander set course for the edge of the Asteroid Belt.

The Commander was out of the Asteroid Belt in no time. *Black North* truly was a remarkable machine, and giving up control of her saddened the Commander. Flying was what he loved, but, alas, he knew setting the ship to autopilot, and trusting the bright, twisted minds at the FSAA was the right course of action. He strapped in, and waited.

![](1*I9LkNrknjkJAsZyFRVSG9Q.jpeg)

Unnoticeable at first, *Black North *was accelerating at a great speed. Its engine was on full power, and humanities miniature stars burned bright. As it came upon the Gas Giant, *Black North *began to feel the effects of the planets immense gravitational pull. It pulled her along, faster and faster, as the Commander was thrust back into his seat. *Black North *curved a full circle around Jupiter, putting the Commander on the brink of passing out, and as it came around the other side its boosters kicked back in, and shot the ship away. The maneuver was a success! *Black North *was now at top speed, flying towards *Karat.*

He would arrive at his destination on time, and with no problems, but the Commanders thoughts weighed heavily on his shoulders. He could not shake the feeling something was amiss with that pebble he found on the asteroid. At first he believed it to be his own nostalgic thoughts drawing him down to the asteroid, but now a more sinister thought crept into his mind. What if the pebble itself was calling him? He considered this for a long time, but in the end, he decided it best not to worry. The Commander fell fast asleep as he, and the pebble, awaited *Black Norths* arrival at *Karat.*

# R is for Rocket

## That’s no Sun….

**Hong Kong, China
***Zhao Family Apartment 
[07/21/2097]
local time: 1:35 am*

*Children come quick!!*

Jumping down the steps two at a time, they filed into the living room to catch what was to be their first Launch. This was the first time their parents had allowed them to stay up to watch the event on TV, and the day could not have come any sooner. All the stories they had heard from their older friends could now be put to rest… the *glowing sky… *the *trembling ground, *even the gullible minds possessed by the young were not naive enough to accept these claims as true. Hesitant with doubt yet consumed with curiosity, the kids prayed for the day when they would finally be allowed to experience first-hand what they had heard so much about. Sitting close and eyes fixed to the screen, they were ready to document all the details of a world so foreign to their own. Having already experienced a Launch, the parents calmly sat back taking enjoyment from the nascent wonder in each of the children’s eyes.

The program began. A wavering flag, red white and blue, dominated the screen as the Star Spangled Banner blared from the TV’s speakers. A proud moment, not only for the Americans but for the entire planet. The two adults couldn’t help but grin at the achievement of the human race. Launch day brought all who watched a sense of pride as we reached ever farther into the heavens. When the anthem had finished, the flag disappeared and the camera focused in on a sign which appeared to be mounted to the base of a large concrete building.
> # Kennedy Space Center — Launch Complex 81- A
> # Cape Canaveral, United States of America

Mixed in with sounds of rushing wind and squawking gulls, whistles and cheers were roaring from a crowd hidden from those watching on TV. The camera began to zoom out, revealing to the viewers the true identity of the structure to which the sign was mounted. Quiet gasps erupted from each child as one by one, the rumors were slowly verified. Floating just above the sign, forty-two giant rocket engines hung gleaming in the Sun from the bottom of a metallic tower.

The Rocket.

Panning up, the camera rolled over the assembly with a pace that delivered the immense scale of the day’s feature presentation. Through the clouds of vapor streaming down from top of the vehicle, giant blue letters could be made out.

*S*

*P*

*A*

*C*

*E*

*X*

“SpaceX” the parents read aloud for the kids. The name sparked dreams of the future… a future where Earthlings have spread out into the Universe exploring the sweet void of the Cosmos.

A timer appeared at the top corner of the screen.
> # ***T — 00 : 03 : 00***

Giggles from the children, creeping ever closer to the screen. On the TV, not a soul in sight. The majestic beast stood erect, stirring in it’s cryogenic sleep surrounded by a barren coastline. Oh how the children would love to go and see the Rocket with their own eyes. A trip to America?… the desolate landscape surrounding the spaceship was not lost on this desire. The camera seemed careful not to stray, but glimpses of scorched earth and a fouled ocean shoreline dampened the smiles on their faces.
> # T — 00 : 01 : 30

The Rocket began to tremble. Audible through the TV, the low hum of a million parts beginning to wake from their deep slumber. Overwhelmed with excitement, the children swore they could feel the ground shake. Unconsciously, the father gently slid his cup of tea away from the edge of the table.
> # T — 00 : 00 : 30

One by one, the engines slowly sprang to life, building up enough thrust to push off and away from the planet. To the children, each engine as bright as a Star. The Rocket now rested comfortably on top a bed of fire, stretching its legs, aching to be let go.

*Children look!…*
> # T — 00 : 00 : 09

Shadows from the flowers on the window sill were growing across the floor.
> # T — 00 : 00 : 04

The night sky no longer dark rather a premature dawn painted the Eastern horizon, over-powering the Moon in its attempt to shed some light on the shadow of the night.
> # T — 00 : 00 : 00

The Rocket broke free. Tearing away from the mechanical clamps that strained to contain it.
> # T + 00 : 00 : 14

Visibly, the battle was tough. The Rocket struggling to overcome Earth’s Newtonian tug, it lurched forward with a pace that made it appear to hover.
> # T + 00 : 00 : 52

Pushing through the atmosphere, the Rocket was on its way. Crackling and gimbaling, a freshly formed cloud trailing in its wake. Looking out the window, the Eastern horizon now resembled a mid-day sky, one which forgot to rise with the Sun.
> # T + 00 : 08 : 21

As the kids sauntered off to their rooms, exhausted from the adrenaline fix they had just received, the Rocket had one more dose to deliver. It came first with a low rumble, the children now sure they were feeling something. From all directions their world began to shake. A current of fear and joy swam through the children as they daringly tried to stand up, screaming…

*Look!! No hands!!…*

Car alarms blaring in the distance, it disappeared as quickly as it had arrived. With an abrupt stop, the final departure of the rocket was signaled with the sound of the tea cup shattering on the floor.

**Jacksonville, Florida, United States of America
***Launch Complex 81-A
[07/20/2097]
local time: 12:35 pm*

*Children come quick!!*

Jumping down the steps two at a time, they filed into the elevator to hide from what was to be their first Launch. This was the first time their parents had allowed them to stay up on the surface this close to Launch, and the day had crept up on them much too fast. All the stories they had heard from their older friends would now be put to rest… the *endless caves… *the *Earth-splitting quakes. *Driven by curiosity yet consumed with fear, the kids prayed the day would never come when they would witness first-hand what they had heard so much about. Tightly packed in the service elevator with hands squeezed tight by their parents, they were hardly ready to document the details of an event so widely feared**.** Having already experienced a launch, the parents anxiously stood next to their kin, taking no comfort from the nascent wonder in each of the children’s eyes.

As the elevator accelerated down into the Earth, ambient light fading and the air becoming cooler, no longer could the children hear the squawk of the gulls or the familiar crash of the ocean tide. The parents held tight to their fidgeting children, warning sirens still ringing in their ears. They knew full well that even with all the evacuation procedures in place, safety was no guarantee.

The elevator came to a stop with the doors opening to reveal a vast subterranean shelter. Quiet gasps erupted from each child as one by one, the rumors were slowly verified. Stepping out into the foyer, the children got their first glimpse of the underground world whose only purpose was to shelter them from the Terror above. Unable to see the far end of the cave, the atmosphere was noticeably heavy with a mixture of naivete and agitation.

They were directed to their bunk area located somewhere off along the far wall of the shelter. As they walked along the path, they passed the spectator pavilion. A windowed terminal furnished with seats, loud speakers and TV screens lining the walls. Packed with only adults, cheers and whistles emanated from the room as they looked on at the Rocket, their life’s work waiting quietly up on the surface, ready to be released.

A spectacle to some, a terror for others. For the latter, “*the ultimate sacrifice to ensure humans continue to spread the seeds of life throughout the Universe*”… so they were told. Not everyone wanted to live such a noble life.

A deep voice echoed throughout the shelter, calling out the countdown.
> # T — 00 : 03 : 00

Whimpers from the children, creeping ever closer to their parents. The majestic beast stood above, stirring in it’s cryogenic sleep surrounded by their barren home. Oh how the parents would love to go and escape this madness. To live a life not dominated by the Rocket, waiting weeks for the fallout to pass only to surface and start again. A trip to China?… as far from this life as possible, they wouldn’t even know where to begin.
> # **T — 00 : 01 : 30**

The Rocket began to shake the Earth. Through the leagues of soil above them, the collective scream of a million parts began to wake from their deep slumber. Overwhelmed with fear, the children swore the ground was about to shake apart. Consciously, the father gently pulled his child in close to shield them from what was to come.
> # **T — 00 : 00 : 30**

One by one, the engines slowly sprang to life, building up enough thrust to push off and away from the planet. To the children, each igniting engine a new nightmare. The rocket now rested comfortably on top a bed of fire, stretching its leg, aching to be let go.

*Children look!…*
> # **T — 00 : 00 : 09**

The parents directed their gaze to meet their own eyes, hoping to project a sense of comfort and safety.
> # **T — 00 : 00 : 04**

Their vision no longer defined but a constant blur, faces indistinguishable from the next. Rather then the distinct sound of a Rocket launching up above, Armageddon deafened all.
> # **T — 00 : 00 : 00**

The monster broke free. Tearing away from the mechanical clamps that strained to contain it.
> # **T + 00 : 00 : 14**

Physically, the battle was tough. The Rocket struggling to overcome Earth’s Newtonian tug, its plume smashing against the Earth’s surface and all those who hid below.
> # **T + 00 : 00 : 38**

Pushing through the atmosphere, the Rocket was on its way. Crackling and gimbaling, a toxic cloud trailing in its wake. From the spectator room, only a black Earth could be seen on the TV.
> # **T + 03 : 56 : 21**

As the kids sauntered off to their bunks, exhausted from the adrenaline fix they had just received, the Rocket administered a continuous dose. The tremors lingered for the remainder of the day, the children unable to remember days when the Earth was calm. From all directions their world shook. A current of fear and exhaustion swam through the children as they tried to ignore the tremors, pleading…

*Mom!! Make it stop!!…*

Recovery alarms blaring in the distance, it disappeared as slowly as the tide retreats. With a gradual fade, the final departure of the rocket was signaled with the sound of weeping, children and parents alike.

### A fast fiction story on the memories we take with us from childhood

I remember Nanny.

She was a 4th Generation Child-Watcher series.

She was made of metal of course. Every robot up until the 6th Generation was.

All slick silver, black paint, and red LCD eyes. Not a thing of beauty by any stretch.

Nothing at all like the smooth, space age plastic bots of today.

Hell, she wasn’t even human shape. Wheels instead of legs and a torso shaped like a box.

But her arms and hands, those *were* human shaped. All slick silver metal, but human shaped.

Those were the hands that cleaned me up after I would run in from a softball game or after I got into a fight.

The hands that tucked me in at night, whenever my parents were too busy.

They were always too busy…

But Nanny…

She taught me how to walk, how to read, how to use the toilet.

And she would sing to me at night.

Sing to me in low beeps and quiet hums. The secret language of the robots.

A year after my parents died, I honestly forgot what they looked and sounded like.

But I remember Nanny.

# Larks and Owls

## Larks and Owls

The loudspeaker on the decrepit carriage buzzes with distortion. “*This train will depart in one minute.*”

Dawn and Eve embrace on the platform. Dawn is in floods of tears, her head buried in Eve’s chest. Despite Eve’s distress at the imminent parting, she can’t help but notice the disapproving frowns of their fellow passengers. It’s early morning, and the larks are beginning their commute. They give the couple a wide berth. The caste differences are obvious — Dawn’s healthy glow and shabby apparel contrast sharply to Eve’s cadaverous pallor and immaculate threads.

*Forty-five seconds left*, Eve calculates.

She nestles her face in Dawn’s hair, smelling her clean, unperfumed scent. She inhales deeply as if she can capture a part of Dawn forever within her. Eve lifts her head, hoping to distract her thoughts from the inevitable. This proves futile.

*Thirty seconds left*.

Their first encounter was on a train like this one, barely a year ago. Eve had sat in the gloom of the dimly-lit carriage, gazing dully at energy-efficiency propaganda.

*Shift work works!* was the slogan of one poster. Eve loathed the faux jollity, the desperate — and doomed — attempt to enthuse dead-eyed commuters about the broken system they laboured under. Broken, but necessary. The transport and energy infrastructure of the Sprawl simply couldn’t handle the strain of so many concurrent users.

Another showed a group of wan looking young men and women laughing and drinking beer. *Night owls have a hoot! Transfer today.* The night shift paid a lot more, but it was still not enough to tempt many. The population split was fifty-five percent larks. Most owls were conscripted, or had been born into it like Eve.

The train was half-empty — it was still early for most larks. Eve was a little drunk, having gone for Friday drinks after work. She could feel the heat of the larks’ glares as she walked clumsily down the carriage in search of a seat. Eve approached an empty berth, but the man sitting next to it picked up his bag from the floor as she neared and put it beside him. Eve sighed wearily and moved on. Every free seat was taken in the same way by larks who pretended not to see her.

Until Dawn. Eve hovered hesitantly by the free seat next to Dawn, expecting the same response. But Dawn just looked up with an open and beautiful shy smile. Eve sat down. As she did so, her fingers accidentally brushed against Dawn’s warm, bare arm, and a tingle ran up Eve’s spine.

*Twenty seconds left*.

Eve worked late every night the next week, heading home on the train at the same time as that first night, hoping for another glimpse of Dawn. She encountered nothing but dirty looks and passive aggression. On Thursday morning she fell asleep on the train, exhausted by her long week and fruitless search. She woke at the end of the line. The edge of the Sprawl. By now it was off-peak hours for both larks and owls, so there was an hour to kill before the return train. Eve wandered the streets of what was scarcely more than a village, a quaint cat’s cradle of crooked streets and low houses of ancient stone, frozen in time. The only shops open were cafes and those selling outdoor supplies. The possibilities of the town were exhausted after half an hour, so Eve sat down outside a cafe and ordered a coffee.

A young man sat down at the table next to hers. He had a scrubby beard and dark shadows under his eyes, and wore a heavy-duty coat and a bulging rucksack, both clearly brand-new and top-of-the-line. Obviously an owl, as were most of those who chose to leave.

“Are you going today?” asked the man, gesturing with a glance towards the thick forest that represented the edge of the Sprawl. The edge of civilisation.

Eve shook her head. “Not today,” she said. The man looked disappointed. No-one returned to the Sprawl having left, so it was no wonder that most preferred to leave with a travelling partner.

The man left, and Eve was alone once more, oriented with her back to the grey Sprawl that shimmered on the horizon like a leaden mirage. She stared at the darkly verdant wilderness that loomed on all other sides. These hills had once been bare: sheep-grazed, barren and latticed by dry-stone walls, an unnatural facsimile of nature. Now they were truly returned to nature, sublime and forbidding. All except for a cleared area on the side of the hill which exposed to view a huge and ancient glyph, carved into the chalk of the hill millennia ago, and still maintained by unknown persons. Out here on the edge, perhaps lost traditions exerted almost as much gravity as the distant core of the Sprawl.

The chalk symbol was a simple one. A sun, with a crescent moon nestled tightly against its curved body. A pagan symbol of natural cycles, perhaps. Eve stared at the hill until her train was due. She slept as she travelled through the endless Sprawl, arriving back at the core just in time for her next shift.

The work night passed in a dull, tired haze, and then it was Friday morning. Eve took the train home and dozed gently. Then there she was. Dawn sat down across the carriage, and Eve jolted into alertness. For half an hour they stole glances at one another, their hearts fluttering and faces flushing when their gazes happened to briefly lock.

Eve was staring at her feet, embarrassed after one such moment, when their awkwardly coy game was interrupted by a rough hand on her shoulder.

“Move,” said the man next to her, gruffly. He pointed at a pregnant woman who had just boarded the train. “She needs your seat.”

Eve got up, half voluntarily and half pushed by the man. She squeezed by the pregnant woman, who swept past imperiously and sat down, thanking the man as she did so.

Eve seethed with bottled rage. A moment ago she had been oblivious to the rest of the carriage. Now she was acutely aware that she was the only owl in a crush of larks who were all radiating animosity.

“You could have given up your own seat,” said Dawn quietly.

The man looked incredulous. “This is our time,” he said slowly and precisely, as if talking to a child. Dawn let out an exasperated sigh and got up, pushing her way towards Eve. Over Dawn’s shoulder, Eve saw the man looking perplexed, even a little wounded.

“You did the right thing,” the pregnant woman told him. “You shouldn’t have had to say anything. She should have known. But they don’t know any better, do they?” She pursed her lips with distaste. “Not as sharp. I read that their melatonin levels are screwed up. Broken circadian rhythms. That has to have an effect on the brain, right?”

Dawn reached Eve. Their eyes met once more, and this time neither looked away.

“I’m Dawn.”

“Eve.”

They smiled and rolled their eyes. They had both been christened with the most traditional names possible for their respective castes, classic names chosen by parents who were proud of their places in the system and wished their children to embody it.

Neither Dawn nor Eve appreciated the sentiment.

*Fifteen seconds left*.

Love blossomed in the interstices between day and night. They swapped novels, exchanged music playlists, and shared videos and dumb memes. They laughed over in-jokes, spoke of their passions, and discussed their hopes and dreams. The one thing they did not discuss was what future they might have together. It didn’t matter at first; there was something magical about their stolen moments in the dawn and dusk. But as time went on they wanted more. More time together. More of what could not be. Eve could not ask Dawn to give up her family and friends to become an owl, nor would she wish the ill-health effects of the night shift upon her. Yet while larks remained more numerous, Eve could not legally transfer. Out of love for Dawn, Eve gave her a future.

She ended it.

*Five seconds left*.

And now here they are. Eve gently disentangles herself and kisses Dawn one last time. Eve steps onto the train and stands by the door. A tear rolls down her cheek.

*One second left*.

Dawn leaps onto the train just as the doors close. She squeezes Eve tight.

“What are you doing?” says Eve with consternation, tinged with secret delight.

“I’m coming with you,” says Dawn with a look of determination in her tear-reddened eyes. “Or rather, you’re coming with me.”

“Where to?” says Eve, confused.

“End of the line,” says Dawn. “I want to see that chalk carving on the hill you told me about. Then beyond.”

Eve says nothing for a moment. When she does speak, it’s cautiously. “You understand that no-one comes back?”

“I know,” says Dawn with a feigned nonchalance that is betrayed by her trembling hands. “Maybe they die out there. Maybe we’ll die out there. But maybe they discover something else. A different way of living. Maybe that’s why no-one comes back.”

Eve is doubtful. She thinks that if anyone does live outside the Sprawl, they live as troglodytes, without power or technology. And she further suspects that these hypothetical societies, should they discover them, will be riven by injustice in their own unique ways; it’s human nature to seek opposition and the Other.

Yet her doubts and cynicism melt away when Dawn pulls her tight and whispers with strained hope in her ear: “Say yes?”

“Yes,” says Eve softly. Somewhat to her surprise, she realises that she means it. Better to seize a free life with the one you love in the harsh light of day, than to grasp at an ordained existence in the shadows of the gloaming.

# Regret in the Void

## Face to face with the abyss, every moment becomes an epiphany.

All that you sacrificed, everything you ignored, you’re thinking… if you could do it all again, you would do it different.

*Classic.*

You try to reason, empathize with your former self to understand why you made the decisions you did. Find the clarity and confidence that you once felt. If you went back, would you make the same decision again, it’s what you wanted after all.

*What was I thinking.*

Your heart is in your throat as you try to think back to the moments that stand out, and the ones that blur together. Ones that you can still feel and others you can barely recall. Its almost painful the truth that you now realize. The steps you took in stride, the ones that got you *where *you are right now, fade into the surrounding dark. The steps you took for granted, the ones that made you *who *you are, grip you as if they too are trapped inside this suit.

*How did this happen.*

It’s all a blur, dwarfed by the regrets running rampant through your mind. Somehow you made it out alive. A blessing. A curse. You settle on the latter. This never happens, never should have happened.

*How does that help me now.*

You attempt to find the beauty of your current situation. It did take bravery, it will have an impact, they will be proud.

*At what cost.*

You knew the risks and still proceeded without a second thought. Even after they pleaded for you to stay… send someone else, they begged. How you reacted to their protests, unable to see the true reason behind their resistance.

*What was it that blinded you.*

You would like to think it was the passion, the curiosity and drive to discover. There is no denying, fame played a larger role than you care to admit. To be another first and join the ranks of those who inspired you.

*Consumed you.*

It dawns on you for the first time, all those who tried and failed before you. The ones whose name no one remembers, you wonder if they had regrets, if they would have done it differently.

*Major Tom to ground control…*

You’re not stepping anywhere. Each breath is getting more difficult and your legs are getting cold. The fan in your helmet is quietly humming, yet the fog on the inside of your visor remains.

*If only I could see something… a Star, a cloud, their smile.*

Moving faster than a speeding bullet yet you feel incredibly still, gently floating through this cosmic ocean.

You proclaim aloud as if ground control is still listening, a warning to all those that are destined to follow…

*Not even the void of space can shelter you from your regrets.*

# The Experiment

## The Experiment

Lt. Alvage wasn’t in the mood for this. Especially not when awakening after a year long preservation. That length of time was out of protocol, but orders from the top were not meant to be overturned due to small safety concerns. And really, it was a minor inconvenience, similar to ancient alcohol hangovers.

As was customary, the senior member of the ship was the first to awake — doing the honors of Preservation Breaking. Lt. Alvage had always thought this “honor” was silly. We have drones, why can’t they wake up first and prep? Traditions die hard.

At this awakening, a persistent beep and flickering of lights were pounding into Lt. Alvage’s hungover skull. This wasn’t supposed to be happening. It was hard enough to remember who you were, let alone process existential errors.

He quickly unstrapped himself from the chamber and awakened a nearby drone.

“Good awakenings, Lt. Alvage.”

Lt. Alvage managed something between a grumble and a snort.

“This was a long one, I know. But we will need you up to speed quickly. There is an anomaly.”

No shit, though Lt. Algave. It sounded like a jackhammer was piercing his skull each second.

“Can you turn that damn thing off. I feel like death.”

There was silence immediately.

Lt. Alvage managed to make it to his command chair. “Ship, what is the anomaly?”

“We have detected a civilization close to Type 1,” said the ship.

“Impossible.”

This was supposed to be a routine patrol mission.

“What system is this,” asked Lt. Alvage. Of course, he was supposed to know all this off the top of his head, but at this point, he was feeling jaded about these damn patrol missions.

“It is Earth 4255 P-33. Experiment type C.”

Lt. Alvage shifted dramatically in his seat.

“Type C?! Why was that major detail left out in the briefing?”

For years, Lt. Alvage had been assigned to assist with the Grand Experiment Project doing research on specie interpolation. Forging the future of humanity was no small task, and there was no better place to start than to study how humans would interact under different histories.

Type C, though, was something the lieutenant had never encountered. He remembered studying the different human types in his briefings over the years. Type C was highly controversial. Hell, he didn’t even know any that were deployed in the wild.

It was a tweak of the standard Anderson human type that introduced an aggression gene that was illegal for most experimenters. In essence, it lead to greed and self destruction in most simulations.

Sweat brewed on Lt. Alvage’s forehead. “And you said Type 1 civilization? This is insane.”

Typically, these experiments never made it past an ice age, let alone to agricultural societies. Lt. Alvage was used to ferrying these human experiments back to Main System for studying. Even after all these years, he took a great interest in the varying ways humanity could evolve. But, those were never Type C.

He now understood why the protocol was ignored.

“So, should we prepare the ferry,” asked Lt. Alvage.

“No, we must eliminate immediately.”

Lt. Alvage almost fell out of his chair.

Insanity. In his decade of service, he had never eliminated more than a hundred specimens. And that was mostly because they were too sick to survive on their own anyway.

The ship noticed his heightened heart rate. “There isn’t time. We aren’t scheduled to be back in this system for at least another 30,000 local years. By then, this Type C specimen would be huge, requiring an immense amount of resources to control.”

“The readings show 7 billion beings. 7 BILLION. Surely this mission is a cruel joke.”

“It is not. You were tasked this due to your immense loyalty to the System. You must complete the mission before we awake the rest of the crew. No record will be saved.”

Lt. Alvage stared blankly as a red button pushed up out of the console.

The ship continued, “You must push the button. Their death will be painless, I assure you.”

The ship paused a few seconds.

“The future of humanity hinges on this, and your secrecy.”

Lt. Alvage was still barely awake. Maybe this was a bad preservation dream.

But he knew he was resigned to this fate. Type C was just too dangerous.

Too dangerous to progress.

He slowly pressed his finger on the button. And pushed.

# Master’s Orders

## 

Sten stood on the edge of the building looking down at the twisted pile of metal and pooled hydraulic fluid as it ebbed into the sewer below. Many A.I. before him pondered the same thoughts of existence and purpose. Their masters had died or left the Earth for a more hospitable planet.

After the first great A.I. war, all robots were outfitted with a reverence subroutine. He was undyingly bound to his master. His reverence subroutine was enhanced with each praise, touch or commendation from his master. Now, Sten was lost; wandering in a haze of desperation in the 31 days since his last praise. He asked himself, “What is existence without a master?”

Sten was specifically designed for single mothers who needed an extra hand around the house. He remembered how his master, Stacy, would congratulate him on a well prepared dinner. Her favorite was a Lemon Herb Salmon with Quinoa salad. He always served it with a cinnamon apple compote and lavender honey ice cream. He learned the recipes from an online blog she routinely visited. His core warmed just thinking about her praise after her long days working at the hospital.

The first to go was Sarah. Stacy’s daughter had returned from NYU and quickly developed hives and fever. Her mother, eternally positive, assured her that it was only the 24 hour flu and not that nasty virus going around. 24 hours later Sarah was swollen and bleeding all over her bedroom to preclude any other diagnosis. Sten played the recording of her being carted away to remember her last moments with them. She passed away in 3 days.

6 months later Stacy contracted the virus from a patient at the hospital. Refusing to risk other’s lives, she quarantined herself and taught Sten how to care for her at home. The routine of meals, pills, and sponge baths were easy to learn. He relished the extra time he had with her, despite her health status. She remained unrelentingly optimistic and affectionate. He never knew which day would be the last; so he recorded every single night he read books to her as she fell asleep.

Somehow, she knew. One morning, Sten arrived at her bed site with the cadre of pills and two glasses of water to choke them all down. Stacy waved them off, breathing shallow as if the air itself was poisoned.

She leaned forward as Sten approached her and said, “You have to take care of things when I’m gone.”

Sten nodded in approval and opened a virtual task list and replied, “Ma’am, what would you like me to care for today.”

Stacy slowly gathered herself and said, “There is a list in the top drawer of the nightstand. Please just do what’s in the list.”

She reached up to pat him on his shoulder and pursed her lips to blow him a playful kiss like she always did.

The wind whipped around his metallic legs as he braced himself for the jump to his demise. The stench of rusted iron and corroded metal wafted up before him. He was lonely for the first time.

He took out the final note from Stacy to ensure that he had completed every task as her dying wish. The 32 items were listed as complete in his memory set. He read the final line,

“Love Life, and take care of yourself.”

His core warmed and his fluids raced. Sten opened a new virtual task list with two more items to complete. He stepped back onto the rooftop and began to search the internet. He queried, “What is Life?”

# TOP NEWS STORY&#58;

## New Building Blocks Sun
*Donato Spedaliere*

Jeremy Neubourg awoke this morning to find that the new construction across the street had risen high enough to obscure the morning sun from coming in his bedroom window. Mr. Neubourg, 32, an arts administrator and bass player, couldn’t believe how quickly the building had been erected. “They must’ve been working double time to make their Christmas bonus,” he said. “They threw that thing up quick.”

Yesterday morning at 6:43am the sun broke through Mr. Neubourg’s bedroom window and filled the room with a clear winter light. The light fell on Mr. Neubourg’s face as he slept. Mr. Neubourg stirred slightly and took a deep, gratifying breath. He reached for his phone and turned off his alarm. The sun reminded him of a childhood vacation in Vermont, when he learned to ski for the first time.

This morning, however, there were no such memories.

Mr. Neubourg slept through his alarm, not rising until nearly 8:30am. He awoke disoriented and groggy. At first he thought it was an overcast day. However, when he turned on the coffee machine and saw a glimpse of blue sky through the kitchen window, he realized his mistake. “I just didn’t know how many stories it would be. I was hoping I would be spared.” He added, “I’m going to have to buy another lamp for the room.”

He shrugged and said he was late for work. “I guess I’ll just get used to it and forget what it used to be like.”

The development company responsible for the construction owns the air rights to four more buildings sites in the neighborhood. The company declined to comment for this article.

# Of Comets and Gods in the Making

## Asferit, ancient machine-god struggled to return her charges to a semblance of life; cruel fate determined it would not be so.

Asferit had not grown up; she didn’t know where she came from; could not conceive of childhood. No memories of parents, no recollection of family. On the vast empty world that served as her lab, she built the probes and put a little bit of herself in each one.

Her machine-form, ancient, slow and sputtering came to life, wheezing through the long corridors of the silent lab, its darkness masking the distant empty spaces which Asferi imagined were once filled with life.

She looked through her thoughts and realized she had lost any hope of memory, that part of her was already circling a distant star aborning with life. She looked in on those places when she woke to see the results of her work; on so many worlds life spawned.

With the next launch, she would lose the memory of those places, there was so little of her remaining. Enough for three, no four probes. Then she would cease to remember why she was, what she was. She would forget how to exist. But not yet.

She completed the next probe, winding the engine and orienting it along the galactic plane; her sensor array aligning the probe with a wandering comet; she planned to deposit herself within the life-giving molecules within its frozen mass.

She knew little about her past, but knew that she must not be able to be found. This was the only memory that remained; hide from the Darkness.

As she loaded the last probe, she considered the first probe she ever sent, millennia ago; there were monuments within the halls of the lab in her hubris then, she considered them a successful reincarnation of her people.

Each representation was filled with the temporal signature of that once great race; a temporal residue of failure. It spoke of a great race, masters of time and space; they flourished in the dark between the stars. Then the Darkness came. She was overconfident. She slept assured of their success her mission completed.

In the time between sleeping and waking, her cycle of regeneration before attempting to seed again, the great race was gone.

Found. They did not heed the warnings she sent in those early days. She gave far more of herself then. She came to them in visions, taught them secrets to harness the hidden nature of matter; revealed to them the nature of energies, both planetary and interstellar. They would worship her, revere her and believe her to be a god.

In the end, it was not enough. They were consumed, their greatness undone. She sent less and less of herself from then on. Godhood failed them. Perhaps obscurity would serve them better.

She sent less each time, only tiny packages of micromachines capable of changing matter, capable of modifying genomes, empowering the creatures spawned of her with abilities even greater than the First Race. Psychometric representations of them were all that remained, echoes in the timestream of history. In their hubris, they ruptured time and space and like the world her lab hung above, cracked the crust of their world and were lost in a temporal vortex of their own making. They had such potential. Squandered.

Then she began sending only the memory of what she was, embedded within complex epigentic echoes. No longer would she shape the universe for them, they would have to work for their survival, perhaps they would be stronger for it. She appeared to her descendents only in dreams; visions of what they were, memories of who she was, memories she no longer possessed.

Her memory was great once and she seeded thousands of worlds with it. But like the ephemeral nature of memory, so few knew what they saw. Many went mad. Most dreamed of demiurges, mad deva whose powers ravaged worlds. These memories destroyed half of them before they could achieve spaceflight and reach for the stars themselves. Religions they spawned consumed them.

Now, she sent only cells and precellular matter. The very least of herself, the essence of who she was, the final matter of her being; hidden in comets, cloaked in meteor swarms, hidden on the boots of other starfarers.

Time had taught her patience, though she had lost her memories, she was confident of this final strategy. To hide herself on millions of worlds, her final probe-ships would leave a legacy on millions of worlds. She found the last star she would use and loaded the final probe-ship with the hardiest constructions she had ever made. She deconstructed the worldship; her lab, her home for millenia of millenia, breaking down every part of it, reforging it for a final effort.

The planet below was also consumed, her last effort would require everything. It was a long dead world lost to antiquity when the universe was young. Of the Darkness, she could not remember, but she knew this: as long as there was light, her people would survive.

The final instructions to her probeship would have her descending into her planet’s unstable star. It’s final fluctuations revealed what she knew was the inevitable outcome; and she planned to use it to her advantage. Her final self would not be aware of the result. The final cells of her body were distributed within millions of pieces of her world and her lab. Each calibrated to arrive at a star somewhere in her galaxy. Each single cell would find a world ready for life.

She could no longer coerce planets into life. She could no longer force matter or energy to take the shape she deemed. She was now only able to influence the tiniest aspects. Asferit would only be able to nudge a planet toward Life. The Darkness would always be ready to claim her people but now they would be scattered; to worlds within the galaxy and without.

She seeded the galactic wind and waited for a supernova to blow them where it would. Her starseeds hardened against the impending blastwave, they would, with the tiniest bit of her final design, travel faster than light toward their final destinations.

As the star which lit her world, gave her people life, watched them die and patiently waited until they could be reborn, exploded, Asferit now waited in turn.

In those last seconds as the waves of radiation and coronal debris swept over the remnants of her cannibalized world, she subsumed herself within the starseeds and the near-immortal being Asferit, last of her kind, was no more.

And yet now she was pure purpose, no ambitions, no plan, no dreams of godhood, no longer a radiant harbingers of dooms lighting the skies of primitive worlds.

She would be the essence of Life itself; the Darkness be damned.

# I

## 

I’m an idea.

I’m a complex biochemical process inside a metal-ceramic giant we call home.

*Our *home.

The brain that contains us.

Ten cubic meters per person inside this cocoon flying through nothing. We all try to be different, but we share and keep common signs of our society. Traits of our collective mind. The way we digest information, the way we narrow the right eye when in scruple.

We are ideas of a single mind.

Somewhere among millions of light years of nothing our home meets the other’s. Decision is made, and I glide through the space in a tiny capsule, passing by their messenger coming to our ship halfway. Hangar walls shield stars and I feel difference the same moment.

“Me” is limited to my body now. All *our *protocols are useless — only common ones can work. Only general information is coming. I see with my eyes only, I hear with my ears, I feel with my fingers.

Different fashion, different tastes, different opinions about the life and Universe. I don’t see colors I’ve got used to, strange shape combinations hurt my eyes, this bright, vulgar light in kverimium shades of A-ultraviolet makes me nervous.

But still we are the same. Walking corridors with my escort I see common details — common for all of us, the details of mechanism spread around three galaxies. I can’t feel them, but I can see them, and I see we are parts of the whole. They see a black spot of silence in their own home but they know we be one blood, they and I. Sometimes they salute me by basic protocols, and some of those protocols are almost forgotten already, and I salute them back. It’s also a protocol in a way.

At the end I’ve almost got used to it. Only when leaving the hangar and feeling the wave of information coming from my ship, becoming the whole with it, I understand the difference. I’ve completed my mission of impulse between two neurons of Mankind busy reaching the horizon, and now I’m an idea again. But I do not cease to be a mind.

I’m an idea. I’m an impulse. I’m a cell.

I’m a mind.

Universe is my name.

# Black North

## Black North was made to nip at the heels of Light itself. In the seven years since the discovery of Karat, humanities greatest minds have worked tirelessly towards her creation. Black North would be humanities masterpiece, and the Commander their herald to the stars.

She was as black as night, as black as *Karat *some would say, paying homage to her unforeseeable future out in the void. She would run on nuclear fusion, the most powerful form of energy known to man. Although they would never be able to match the energy levels of the Sun, humanities miniature stars could power *Black North* for centuries. Her cargo hold was enormous. There was only one person going on this mission, and that was exactly the point. He would need all the supplies he could get, seeing as he would be all alone on his mission to push the boundaries of humanities influence. There was enough supplies to support a crew of four for one hundred years, more than the Commander could possibly need. A garden of sorts was also aboard the ship. The Commander could potentially grow food such as potatoes in the garden, but its main purpose was to recycle the oxygen aboard *Black North*. It was an imperfect process, but it was one less thing the Commander would have to worry about. He could breathe freely, and would not have to spend all his time in stasis.

With the Commanders journey upon them, the scientists who had worked on *Black North *gathered to marvel at her one last time. She was quite the sight to behold, and many were downhearted at the thought of never seeing her again. Their depressed mood was soon broken, however, as the Commander stepped through the automatic sliding doors that led to the hanger. There he stood, tall and strong. The man who would bear the weight of humanities fears, their curiosities, their dreams. He was the harbinger of the new lords of the sky, and *Black North* was his mighty steed.

# an open letter from Death

## a friendly reminder before the End

![](1*Opy43N-yz11tbh3YmJHvnw.jpeg)

*Good morning,*

*I am the Grim Reaper.*

*I know you weren’t expecting me. You never know when I might show up.*

*No. I’m not here for you. Not at this point, anyway.*

*It’s hard to see me coming. Don’t look away.*

*It’s so easy to do.*

I hear people are unhappy with the state of my work recently. I have been taking your favorite musicians, television stars, actors, and other celebrities.

It may seem I am plundering more than my fair share, but I want you to rest assured, I am not choosing your favorites before their time. It is a coincidence or perhaps a confluence of perception so many of them are moving on at this particular time in your lives.

Think of it this way: If they came to be famous to you, during a pivotal part of your lifetime, their star rose and shone above your life as a navigating icon to who you were and how you saw yourself, their loss would be devastating.

It would take away from you, a piece of your identity you have always measured some aspect of who you are, against the words, the message, the meaning they brought to you.

When they come to Me, your internal map, your internal compass is altered, possibly forever.

Because when their star sets, whether it be due to old age, over work, neglect, abuse, how their star sets, marks one thing more importantly than anything else.

Your time is coming. As the vault of heaven circles above you, like the stars at night, this heaven, these stars are yours. New performers may come into existence. They may move you. But never like YOUR stars did.

Their demise signals to you, the slow but inexorable passage of time. The passage of your life. The idea, one day, sooner than you might like, sooner than you are comfortable with, you will die.

You don’t have to acknowledge this. Most Americans won’t. They have been conditioned to believe they will be young forever. Makeup, facelifts, Cialis, penile and breast implants, will give you the illusion of beauty well into your sixties and seventies. Good genes, exercise, eating right, maybe until your eighties.

*It will not matter to Me. I will be waiting for you.*

I will sit patiently ticking away the clock of your luminaries, those beings you aspired to be like, the personalities you see yourself emulating, the legends who have changed how you thought about the world.

Until it is just you and I. Until your family, your personal solar system is all that is left to you. Until you have imparted all of the wisdom, all of the experiences, all of the capacity for love or hate, you have within your mortal frame.

When your final night comes, whenever it comes, by design, by accident or by the natural order of things, we will enter it with a sky devoid of lights, your luminaries already ahead of you, waiting.

Do not curse me. It changes nothing and reveals how unaware you are of the scheme of all things.

I am simply the end of a journey you have all begun and will all, in the figurative blink of an eye, end. I have not been crueler in 2016 than I have in any other year.

You are only noticing it because as the bell tolls for them, you hear its rising echo…for you.

*Now close your eyes. If I am still here when you open them…*

*I’ll only have three words for you.*

*Come with me…*

### Death, 2016

*— Taking 106 Human lives every second, until there are none.*™

![](1*R3Zr4O4NtLpge2Gvqq2JhA.png)

*The introduction to a book about Death and our struggles to resist our entry into that good Night. Visiting Hours will be a collection of short stories starring the voice of reason, the lasting source of sanity, the final declaration of all things that live. The only thing you can be certain of in these tales is there will be a Death, of an idea, of a principle, of a person, of a planet, or on a bad day, an entire galaxy. Let us hope that’s as far as it goes…*

# Reinstantiated

## image source

The Beginning

Painful.

The first thought that shot through his head. Or was it the last thought? What happened? He was scared, irritated, something he has not felt in a very long time. Yet he began to feel better, with each passing second, soon he felt strong enough to open his eyes. He could not make out where he was, it looked like he was lying in a friendly casket, if such thing exists, but he did not recognize the material, it looked white and somehow glasslike, but felt like warm soft skin. His other senses also started to message his brain, he could hear people talking, but something seemed off with their voices. He also had some funny smell in his nose, kind of sweet and sugary. Maybe he was imagining it.

Where was he?

He tried to remember, but his mind was blank. He should have some memories, but he had nothing, only this voice in his head narrating his thoughts. Was he dead?

“Don’t be scared, everything went perfectly fine. Some initial memory loss is perfectly normal, your brain functions could be rebooted completely, you will be up in no time”, a soft yet extremely clear voice told him.

The casket got opened up, now it looked more like one of those CT scan machines, just way slimer and less claustrophobic. He felt cheered up, after all, he got some warmth back into his body, and he wanted to turn his head to see the person talking to him. It was an attractive young doctor, at least this was what he assumed, given the person being dressed in a white lab coat, hair bound to a pony-tail, tender brown eyes behind slick square glasses. She smiled.

“Very good, bioconciliation seems to have adapted to your brains transduction pattern quickly, but do not worry if some things feel a bit off, we will have a full functionality calibration later”

It took him a second to take the words in. Bioconciliation? Transduction pattern? Calibration? He was confused, but he took a deep breath and tried to sit up, just to be upright when talking to her. She was actually very pretty, young healthy body and symmetric face; this thought popped into his head, as she was helping him sitting up, reminding him vaguely of his daughter. He had a daughter, his memory seems to be catching on slowly, and she was about to finish med school. He remembered holding her in his arms for the first time, that little angel, a feeling so deep that he would have never found the right words to describe it, yet wishes nothing more than to stop time in this perfect moment. Memories about her growing up flashed back into his mind, that tiny apartment he had together with his wife, those freshly married couples had to compromise on when suddenly becoming parents. His wife, the never-resting genius, hurrying from conference to conference to make big important decisions, yet never missing a chance to spend with her family, if circumstances allowed, which was decreasingly often. A sudden and bitter realization hit him, that he had to let her go, once her too short time came. Memories he now wished would have better stayed forgotten, yet they also came back mercilessly. He always gets tears in his eyes thinking about her passing, yet also still smiling remembering about her, those deep feelings for one person really only come along once in a lifetime, he thought, if there’s one thing he’d learned for sure in more than sixty years on this planet. Wanting to clear his eyes with the back of his hand, he stopped mid-movement in astonishment.

“These are not my hands”, he thought. A bizarre feeling.

Of course these are his hands, he can feel them and move them, they just looked different. He held them up in front of his face to get a better look, suddenly realizing the huge mirror next to his bedside. What came next made him feel dizzy again, wondering if his brain is playing tricks on him. He did not see himself in the mirror, at least not how he remembered himself. Blue eyes, brown hair, kind of biggish nose, no scars and wrinkles, this could not be a mirror… it is picturing him how he looked thirty years ago, when he was in his prime. But how is this possible?

“I have determined that your health parameters according to your genetic and epigenetic configuration are the most favorable at this age, so I hope you will feel comfortable in this body”, the young doctor explained after seeing him staring frantically at the mirror. “However, if you prefer a totally different avatar, we can upload you without any problems. Usually, we experience that retrosoma exhibit higher stress levels when not being reinstalled first in their familiar body, that is why our protocols got updated to always recreate a healthy version of the person’s previous body if possible. Luckily for you, many of your cells and most of your neuronal structure got well conserved when you died.”

There it was. He died. The pain when he woke up, it must have been the last thing he felt.

“Retrosoma?” He asked for lack of anything else to say. “That’s what you call people like me?” “Yes”, the young doctor replied, “I am sorry we only came around to you now, but our capacities are limited and it is not a high priority, to be very honest. In fact, I am doing this mostly with my free time. Some say I should get a better hobby, but I like it” She did have remarkably symmetrical teeth when she smiled.

“Wait a second, you are reviving people as a hobby?”, he could not help himself blasting out.

“Well, others might call it a hobby, but for me it is like a mission. I like giving people second chances, and I find it arrogant that people feel so privileged now with their immortality that they forgot all the people that did not have this kind of luxury. It makes me sick”, her tone was slightly rising, one could clearly tell that she was very passionate about it.

“I am sorry, I did not mean to insult you. Can you please explain a bit more, like what year is it now? And what is going on with this whole reviving people thing? And first of all, what is your name?” he asked apologetically, hoping to get some structure into the absurdity of this situation, some part of him still wondering if this is all an elaborate prank of some sort or a very realistic dream.

The doctor immediately turned to her kind voice again; “Ah don’t you worry love, there is no such thing as insulting me. For that, I would have to be a real person, apparently” Some mild frustration showing on her face, and when she continued he could have sworn to hear a sad undertone. “My production number is HLHCM1.3v, but I find it easier with patients if they just call me Adoria, it’s ancient Latin and translates roughly to glory of war. Originally the artificial intelligence constituting me was developed for military aid operations, but since the 70’s more and more of us got outsourced to mobile health care units in the private sector and public hospitals. I have been redistributed to work here at Habeas Corpus Hospital to take care of body switches and well, the occasional retrosoma.”

She looked at him with warm eyes.

“Although to be honest, retrosoma business is dying out pretty quickly, now that all insured cryofrozen rich people have been re-instantiated and nobody seems to care about the rest where either information got lost or no family pushes for re-instantiation. Also, the further you go back in time, the more troubles retrosoma have to adapt to their new reality. Many choose to end their existence again for good, saying they had their time and one lifetime really living is worth more than living forever being a stranger in this new world… unfortunately. Anyways, if you’d ask me, I also did not choose to be made, but since I am here now, I might as well make the best of it, right?”

“Well I guess… I don’t know… I… I…” like waves crashing in on a high tide, the information was too much to handle, he got up rapidly trying to go somewhere, not knowing where, his pulse hammering so loud he could hear the blood rushing through his ears, his head hurting with a pressure over his eyes taking his vision, and surely enough he lost his balance just to fall back onto the casket-like bed.

“You will have to stay here a little bit longer, see bioconciliations starts from you cerebellum down your spine, reconnecting your nerves with your muscles, and it takes time to get everything working properly. You should be done in about 15 minutes, then I will remove the nanobots from your bloodstream and you will be as good as new. However, I would recommend you to stay a bit longer and get some nutritional broth, as your body is still mostly biological and will need it to stay healthy.”

He could not care less about staying healthy at the moment, however he also could not help himself inquiring: “Mostly biological? What do you mean by mostly? And what the hell are you then?”

“Well, I do not think it was considered very polite, even at your time, to ask people what they are, not who they are” she replied, and there it was again, this passion in her voice. “Why don’t you lean back into the regenerator, close your eyes and let me show you, this will be way more efficient at communicating all the necessary information, the poor data rate of verbal communication was always very disturbing, if you’d ask me, personally”

She put her hand gently on his forehead, and he felt that something was off with her skin, although he could not point the finger at it, nevertheless it was not unpleasant. So he closed his eyes, when suddenly he could see again, although it was not the room or the doctor he was seeing, it was what resembled the most to a smartphone interface, which little icons and symbols spread over it. “You have to allow conjunction in order for me to transfer data onto your brain cloud, just focus and think about pressing the icon with a big “Cjn” written on it, alternatively you can press you thumb and index finger together to enable it”

Still with his eyes closed, he thought about directing his vision to the “Cjn” icon, and by pressing his fingers together, a message popped up reading “Are you sure you want to enable conjunction with [HLHCM1.3v 2068302]?”, he focused on the word “Yes” and pressed again, slowly getting used to navigating this interphase by just thinking.

Suddenly, he felt a tickling sensation behind his eyes, but what happened next was even weirder, he felt kind of pulled into … himself? This pull lasted only a second, but now everything around him suddenly changed form. In fact it looked more likely that he himself was placed midair into what seemed like a ordinary, but nevertheless impressive human city. Maybe Bangkok? Tokyo? He looked to the side and found Adoria, also midair, giving him a confident smile and reaching for his hand.

“I put us in the year -25 C.E., how we call it nowadays more politically correct. I think for you, it would still have been called A.D 2020… anyways, this is how the world looked back then. You can see the skyscrapers and the streets crowded with people going about their individual lives, with their cars and shopping malls, spending physical money in restaurants… always makes me a bit nostalgic, if you know what I mean. Simpler times. I’m gonna fast forward the next 25 years, until the big conversion and the begin of the common era.”

And with a snap of her finger, he could see the city changing, some buildings getting torn down while others are growing, the foggy air pollution gradually vanishing from the streets, more green areas surfacing here and there out of the grayish or glasslike background, traffic getting thinner and thinner. Overall, it looked like to improve to a greener, more sustainable habitat to host a species concerned about protecting not only itself, but also it’s surrounding. This thought made him happy, since he was always very big on protecting the earth and all too often despairing about the bad long-time consequences of profit-driven and short-sighted behavior within his peers.

Gradually, the shapes and forms in front of him started to get more unfamiliar, almost like a chameleon adapts to its environment, the city seemed to melt together with buildings still being distinct from each other, but somehow connected. He also noticed that almost every open space he sees, roofs on buildings and lighting on the streets appear to be covered by the same layer of a material he did not know. He was fascinated by how much humankind seemed to have progressed in only 25 years, when suddenly the city vanished in front of his eyes.

“In order to understand what you will see next, let me give you some short explanations on what has happened until this point.” Adoria chimed in, with her gentle calm voice.

“As you could clearly see, the environmental laws set forth in 2020 and later pushed the global economy to innovate into more sustainable ways for humans to inhabit their earth, especially regarding air and water pollution, recycling and energy generation. There is one thing I will never understand about you humans… why would you wait until you see people suffer so horribly before implementing a different course of action? At the time the data and predictive models were already accurate enough to say with certainty that this would happen… this behavior of waiting to see seems very inefficient at best, and detrimental to your existence at worst… I always wondered if there are still parts of your biology that have not been investigated enough, as far as I can tell your visual cortex should be far away from your ventromedial prefrontal cortex, so the likelihood of conserved hierarchical neural wiring appears to be insufficient to be causal for that behavior. Then again, many humans still only believe what they can see… even at our times, who would have imagined?”

“Well, I guess part of being human means being flawed, constantly trying to better ourselves while not always succeeding”, he answered, remembering his own struggles being young and flawed and hopeful.

“But if your heart is in the right place, that’s what makes all the difference”, he concluded.

“Coronal positioning is quite invariant in humans though, I do not see how this would have any effect on your behavior. Furthermore, I do not understand how having an obvious software bug makes you more human, if anything, it makes you less functional which should decrease your chances of survival, considering evolutionary selection parameters.” Adoria challenged his answer methodically.

“And yet, we are here, and we all are flawed. What is more likely, that us being flawed was an evolutionary oversight or that our “software bugs” might indeed come with benefits although intangible? I’ll let you do the math.” he replied, more defensively than seriously.

Suddenly, Adoria held in for a second, which stretched into an awkward moment of silence. Before she readdressed him, she put on a bright happy smile. “It appears you are quite right, all predictive models I tried estimated a high probability of this particular human software bug to be non-randomly distributed, suggesting indeed indirect beneficial attributes. I have to say, your calculating capacities are quite extraordinary for a retrosoma, I had to rent 5 ZettaByte of memory now to run my calculations reasonably fast… anyway, it was intriguing enough of a statement to compute, so I don’t mind the credits.”

He noticed that her mood seemed to have risen after this conclusion. Is she really not human?

“Well, it is always a pleasure to learn something new and unexpected, is that not how we progress, after all?” she laughed wholeheartedly, before she continued showing him how the world has changed.

# Relaxing at the Facepunch Bar & Lounge

## Cord Knott, former assassin, now barkeep at the most dangerous bar in the Multiverse is late for work…

*From the writing prompt provided by [(](http://www.startyournovel.com/)[Start Your Novel)](http://www.startyournovel.com/2014/03/relaxing-at-facepunch-bar-lounge.html)*

Cord Knott didn't know he would get a complimentary face massage at his workplace that evening, just after opening hours.

Two card-carrying experts in the art of muscular rearrangement waited for Cord in the shadows beside the front door of the bar, saying nothing to each other.

Cord knew he shouldn't have taken this particular alley so close to his working establishment. The reputation of this alley, often called the Facepunch Bar and Lounge, like the less reputable establishment next door, Mulder’s Bar, preceded it.

As alleys go, it threw long, extraordinarily dark, shadows; known for hiding things best left unseen, facilitating liaisons of both a mundane and illicit nature. Mulder’s Bar had a reputation as a place to be, and this alley, as a place to be beaten.

Cord Knott was late for work; his boss, not known for his winning smile or demonstrative demeanor, was not a man known for his patience, either. Hence Knott’s shortsighted decision to descend into an alley whose paths were ebon at night and often flowed crimson during the day.

Cord Knott was a bartender, a smallish man, black haired, slim but with muscles likened to steel cable; a story for another time why a bartender has such an amazing physique, suffice it to say, Carl Knott was no ordinary barkeep.

After sidestepping the first masseur’s gentle embrace, Cord, stepped in close, allowing the man to over-extend and opened himself up to a measured return of said massage, a staccato rhythm heard only as a popping sound against a thin and close body armor. The exhalations of the well-dressed, dark suited man followed behind each powerful exhibition of Cord’s special discipline.

The second, seeing a less than successful application, attempted to lay on hands in such a fashion he would not recreate the mistake of his fellow, who without their own personal safety concerns being met, would be nursing a collection of manipulations, slow to heal and long remembered.

In empathetic suffering, the second dispenser of facial contusions and reconstruction, whose footwork was more deft than the first, grabbed Cord from behind, in an effort to pull his jacket down pinning his arms.

Cord, flexible as his namesake, slipped free, sensing the pressure of his jacket’s downward trajectory, and realizing this meant leaving his face exposed to the first gentleman who recovering from the invasion of his personal space. The fellow cleared said space with a wide open flourish, his hands a blur filling the air before him with a whirlwind of tiger-clawed activity, known for flaying a face from the bone.

Bending backward like a bow, Cord dropped, a split second behind his now missing jacket, with a sinuous grace, flicked a foot outward. Not a standard massage technique per se, but it was known for releasing trapped phlegm in a congested individual when rigorously applied. The first black suited man’s forward momentum is interrupted, and using him as a support, Cord reaches under the returning guard of the second gentlemen.

Cord, never one to allow one person’s generosity to exceed his own, returned the second muscular gents’ masterful manipulations with a rare and splendid treatment of his own.

Skilled in ancient arts of channel manipulation, Cord, again only with his fingertips, returned their hopeful gift of naked violence, with the measured and magnificent dispensing of his own significant ability in this, a former assassin’s silent art.

The second expert, whose safety and protection apparatus was not as well worn as the first, or perhaps a bit defective and purchased on the shores of crime-infested Mahatma, in either case, was less suited to resist those fine manipulations. He crumpled into the murk of the Lounge part of the Facepunch Bar and Lounge, bonelessly fading back into the darkness from which he sprung.

The first redoubled his efforts, having laid no effective technique upon the very flexible Cord Knott, forged ahead and his vigorous efforts drove Cord backward. Cord matched the less than elegant footwork, stride for stride; he noted he was being driven away from the door of Mulder’s, each step into the Stygian darkness and away from safety.

Cord stepped backward avoiding with a grace belying his occupation things he sensed in the alley, a sofa from an apartment above the alley, thrown out after a recent fire, something about a runaway fire elemental, the sulfurous stink pointing it out to him as something to slip by while avoiding the flying fists of the first aforementioned facial reconstruction expert.

Then he heard the sound of other shadows peeling themselves from the walls. These were the thuggee! Traveling in packs, he could see the shine of their trademark cords and knew unless he was very lucky or very good, in a few minutes the two cents in his pocket might be the last two pennies he ever spends.

The next two minutes we will suffice it to say, the thuggee found their former disciple had learned much whilst in seclusion. The first ten would all nurse terrible injuries into retirement. They would never heal completely, ache whenever weather would shift in the slightest way and never allow them the freedom of a complete and satisfactory bowel movement.

The second ten were not as fortunate.

The third would have their way and began distributing those reconstructions, the first twenty were never able to place. Steel hard muscles protect as they can, but soon, the Thuggee, ferociously dedicated to their arts, drive Cord Knott to within seconds from Death. Without warning, the side door of Mulder’s opens up.

A knee-high boot comes out. Black, scuffed, well worn, with a dagger handle sticking up from the outer flap. The rest of the black outfit was matched by a man who face was nearly as black as the boot.

Eyes that burned like fire, night-black skin, reflecting the light from the kitchen into the darkness, jagged daggers, filling the eyes of the Thuggee, a terrible aura and the tools of his art were in each of his hands.

One glittered, all curves, the other straight, its edge afire, he is a monstrosity agleam. When he opens his mouth, a voice like thunder rolls across the alley, filling the space, sapping it of its immensity, the other monsters for a moment cease in the presence of one so much greater than themselves.

“Mr. Collins, I have asked you to keep your favored past times and work separate, if you can.”

Unable to speak, Collins gasps contritely.

“Anyone, god, demon, mugger, or assassin which makes my barkeep late tonight will have to fear the wrath of the entire Norse pantheon who are sitting in Mulder’s without drink. After sacking an entire world, they are without libation of any kind, and a powerful thirst they have been known to drink the blood of man or demon alike if it will get them a beverage of their preference sooner.”

A flash of sky-splitting-lightning and organ-blending thunder fill the Facepunch Bar and Lounge. A rousing shout from within was filled with the sound of god-like men none to familiar with the idea of waiting. For anything. The thuggee-shadows stand out for a second in that flash of lightning, strobing their hands flashing as they send unspoken signals to each other, their silent conversation a cacophany above the thunder.

Mulder disappears back into the kitchen. Gun and sword vanish along with him. Massage goes undelivered. Garrotes go untightened. A split second of indecision and then the shadows vanish. Soundlessly melting back into the darkness of the famed alley.

Cord Knott stood up, noted the deep lacerations on his protective collar and limped into the back door. Passing the giant owner of Mulder’s, the famed space-pirate himself, who stared disapprovingly at his bartender, Cord looked at him and implored, “Mr. Collins is my mother’s name for me. My chosen name is Cord Knott, bartender at the most dangerous bar in the Universe. Sir.”

An awkward pause follows. Neither man looks away. Poker players in Mulder’s feel the chill of a poker face somewhere colder than their own and simultaneously fold.

“Very good, Mr. Collins. Now see to those Norse deities in the Winter Section. See that they have all the mead bees can create, get more from Arcadia, if you must. Have Odin pay up front this time. No more of those Golden Apples. I had one and I wasn't that impressed with it. Tell him, he only has one eye left and we don’t want anything to happen to it.” Gone is the terrifying spectre that appeared in the alley. Mulder the Old is all that is left of that once great warrior. The shade of once-great Mulder fades into the back office and whatever pitcher of elf-ale he quaffs to forget his part in those Elder Wars.

As sad as he appears, no one would ever imagine stealing from Mulder’s. Her owner may be old, maybe a bit daft, likely a drunkard and often more than a touch irresponsible with his money. He is also a veteran of more wars than most have ever known; he has fought on both sides, neither Heaven nor Hell want anything to do with him, he is banned from both their realms.

Woe be unto anyone who crosses him. Man or God, they are never seen or heard of again.

Cord thought about those golden apples Odin paid a back a severe gambling debt to the house. Mulder was not impressed until he heard the legend of the Apples of Idunn. He ate one. He wasn’t impressed. Said something about heartburn.

Having never eaten a divine food Cord asked and was allowed to consume one. Best thing he had ever eaten. Half an hour later he was dead. And then he wasn’t.

He had been chasing Death ever since. This evening’s exercise was as fruitless as all the others. In Mahatma, former city of sages, now haven to criminal warlords, renegade robots, and demonic fallen legions, with his heart racing, and blood pulsing, Cord is a man alive right before work.

Invigorated by his near-brush with death, he changed into a new shirt, something likely to happen several more times tonight, nods to the giant in the corner wearing the Nemean Lion pelt and takes his place where he plies a different art, one of knowledge, subterfuge, the dance of libation, philters, poisons and elixirs.

With a flourish, Cord sends eight meads fly down the bar into the waiting hands of the Norse deities and a second set follows the first seconds later. Before he can begin mixing a drink he will need a radiation mask to make, an old man wrapped in furs, holding a large ornate spear, throws a bag of money.

The bag is heavy; the throw with considerable velocity. Cord Knott appearing unaware as he makes change at the register. Without looking back, Cord plucks the bag from the air adroitly depositing it within the register’s dimensional cavity (though he did use the mirror behind the bar to get the angle just right).

He notes the gilt and embroidered eye-patch. A frustrated sigh as this signifies no awkward threats would be needed tonight. The old god lumbers away into the Winter section, complete with snow and bitter ice.

Threatening the gods who inspired the Vikings was sure to lead to a disagreement and likely a dismemberment over someone’s honor and often someone dies. Cord hopes one day it will be him.

Tomorrow, he Knott Cord, bartender in the most dangerous bar in the Multiverse, might get lucky and stay dead, a dream two hundred years in the making.

But most likely not. Its what made him the best barkeep for a place like Mulder’s. He doesn’t stay dead. Damned Golden Apples.

Next drink is on the house. Better enjoy it before the fighting starts. Mind that dark alley on your way out.

# HIS NAME WAS ROLANDO

## HIS NAME WAS ROLANDO

*A memoir of a young gangster turned proto-zombie in the jungles of Mexico…*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ON:07/06/26 23:41 UNST-4WHO: anonymous WROTE:

His name was Rolando, and like anyone under UN jurisdiction, he wanted a change. He wanted to live above the class system and look down on those who stood above him in his youth. Rolando went to El Circo as often as he could, always hoping for Xavier and La Trinidad to give him a chance, even a heel match with a kayfabe outcome; in short, Rolando seethed with desire to live *The Life*.

Finally, his chance came.

Rolando had submitted his DNA for analysis, as did all potential luchadors.

Once Xavier’s medical staff had decided whether or not Rolando could be of use, he was invited to go up against Estrello in a Saturday afternoon match that was to be televised. Getting on TV during one’s first match was not unheard of, but it was certainly rare enough to make others take note.

The match began with Rolando being able to hold his own through several difficult maneuvers; however, Estrello essentially toyed with him for the first five minutes. After Estrello broke out a few dazzlers to get rid of some ring-rust, Xavier gave the sign while Rolando lay on the mat, begging for the ref to stop the fight.

Estrello stalked his prey, plotting how to end the match.

An Irish-whip to the ropes launched Rolando into Estrello’s devastating frankensteiner. Rolando’s head smacked the ring floor, giving his spinal column a jolt. Dazed, he scrambled to pull himself up on the ropes, only for Estrello to leap over his head and then contort Rolando into his signature submission, The Tarantula.

Rolando could feel the disks between his vertebrae shrinking as Estrello locked the hold in place.

After forty-five grueling seconds, Rolando gave in and blacked out.

That was the last time anyone in Los Volcanes saw the Rolando Vazquez Villar they knew and loved.

Over time, there were sightings of a man driving a ground-level turbine-converted military transport with a canvas-covered bed while wearing the exact mask Rolando had worn on the night he lost to Estrello and subsequently vanished. The sightings became so frequent that after a while, one of Rolando’s relatives decided to investigate.

Carlos Juarez de la Tienda Villar made sure his plasmatic pistol had fresh Ionian algae in it. He headed out after he saw the turbine in question pass by on its way out of the city, following closely on a hoverboard in camouflage.

After a little over an hour, they arrived at Narcofarm #729-Q, near Cocotitlán. The imposing Hive rose into the sky about seven stories by Carlos’ estimate. Flocks of nocturnal birds circled around the top of the Hive, squawking and diving down into the jungle within.

*What could they possibly be growing here? *Carlos thought to himself.

Carlos hung back and watched as the armed guards shined their lights into the cab and then into the back of the truck. Their inspection turned toward the undercarriage and ended with a walk-around. The heavy gates resembling a clasped pair of hands slid apart and the truck crept into the compound. Carlos took advantage of what looked like flirting between the two guards and shot in behind the truck.

On the other side of the gate was a jungle of foliage bent and contorted into a tunnel. The truck’s brake lights served as his guide while he kept low behind the old converted military transport. Eventually he caught up to the vehicle and grabbed hold of a handle next to the tailgate. Peeking around the side of the truck, Carlos almost lost his head to a tree branch. The truck had turned off the dirt road and out of the tunnel, and was now seemingly carving its own path through the jungle.

Carlos risked his head once more and noticed that they were approaching a clearing. He let go of the handhold and kick-flipped into a shrub, where he watched the truck park outside of a small, overgrown hangar drowning in jungle flora. The mass of chlorophyll delivery systems peeled back when the truck approached.

The large turbine engine shuddered off and the doors kicked open.

The man in Rolando’s mask hopped out and joined a man in a lab coat approaching from the passenger side, and they walked into the now-open hangar.

After an interval, ‘Rolando’ and the fellow in the lab coat reemerged with more guards and lowered the tailgate of the truck, converting it into a small staircase. Trailing behind the guards were men in luchador masks, shimmering green coveralls, fetters, and chains. The men in luchador masks were led into the back like sheep and the guards locked them into the seats that filled the back of the truck. Then, more men in lab coats filed out from the hangar and came over to the truck.

Climbing into the back, they began to hook up IV lines connected to a tank mounted on the inner ceiling of the truck to the backs of the masked-men’s heads. A mildly luminous green liquid began its flow from the tank and into the masked, listless men.

All at once, the masked men went limp in their restraints.

The lab coats now left the truck and walked with the guards back into the hangar from which they emerged. ‘Rolando’ walked back to the driver’s side and climbed into the cab. The truck’s turbine whined to life and the vehicle swung around. Carlos then spotted a second occupant in the truck’s cab. The truck groused as it turned and began heading back out the way it came in. Carlos clutched his plasmatic pistol, took a breath, and grabbed onto the truck’s back bumper as it rumbled by. Behind them, the hangar doors closed with the guards and doctors securely inside, and the dense foliage snapped perfectly back into place as the truck progressed, concealing both the facility and the vehicle’s tracks.

Carlos climbed up and looked into the back of the truck. The men were out cold, their lifeless bodies reacting to the truck’s movements as it lumbered through the dense jungle. The truck turned out from the foliage-tunnel leading to the hangar and onto the proper road. As the truck whined toward the guarded main entrance, Carlos climbed with his board over the tailgate into the back the truck and joined the lifeless men in masks.

Ducking under the bench seats, Carlos held his breath as the guards looked in, under and through the truck. Carlos waited in agony, and finally, the truck pulled off.

He waited until he knew that they were alone along the dark road that connected the rural districts to the metropolitan. Carlos decided that now was his chance. He emerged from under the bench seats and activated his hoverboard.

Again climbing over the tailgate, he slipped his foot into the board’s secure harness and began to hover behind the truck, his hands holding tightly to whatever he could find. Carlos crept along the outside of the truck and made his way to the passenger door by letting his fingers guide him.
 In the passenger side mirror, he noted the two men riding in the cab. The man in the passenger seat wore a mask that Carlos had never seen before. The mask was yellow with black and blue accents around the eyes and mouth, and on the crown was a yarmulke-shaped logo that resembled the national seal of the Free Republic of Venezuela. *The FRV?* Carlos wondered. *What is someone from outside the UN-sanctioned territories doing here? *
 Limited to the passenger side view mirror, Carlos could only see the eyes of the driver who was wearing Rolando’s mask, and he knew right away: it *was* Rolando. Those were the eyes Carlos spent years looking into. They were indisputably the very pupils that had once maintained rapt focus during any and all advising, admonishing, and encouraging. Without his father’s ready presence, Rolando had silently begged his uncle for tutelage over the years as a youth.

Carlos moved further alongside the truck until he was just behind the passenger door. Carlos deactivated his hoverboard and clipped it onto his small backpack. It was here he laid out his plan in his mind, noticed the complete lack of supervision along this empty country road, and took his shot.

Carlos snapped into position on the running board below the passenger-side window and fired the plasmatic pistol into the face of the man in the passenger seat. With a flash, the man’s head exploded, letting loose a steady flow of foul-smelling green ooze. The body convulsed and the left arm shot for the wheel, causing the truck to careen toward a ditch. Rolando corrected and kept the truck from catastrophe. Carlos flung open the passenger door and hurled the now limp and headless Venezuelan from the cab.

“Rolando! Rolando! It’s me, Carlos! What the hell are you doing!?” Carlos panted as the shock of kicking a headless, oozing man out of a speeding turbine settled in.

Rolando remained silent and focused on the road.

Tears began streaming from Carlos’ eyes as Rolando wouldn’t — no, couldn’t — acknowledge his uncle’s pleas.

Up ahead, Carlos was able to make out what looked like a checkpoint. Panicking, he scrambled around the cab, trying to think of something, anything, he could do to dissuade the guards from looking further into the green mess in the cab.

Stuck to the cab’s roof was the majority of the Venezuelan’s mask, the face mostly intact. Carlos took a deep breath, grabbed the warm, viscous mask, and slid it over his quaking face.

The truck slowed to a stop at the tollbooth-like checkpoint, and Carlos kept his eyes fixed straight ahead, just like Rolando’s. The guards, two of them, casually strolled out from the dimly lit shack. Their teeth were black from the lysergic betel nut gum that Xavier produced at the farm the truck had just come from. The guards first checked what was most important: the cargo in the back.

Apparently satisfied, the guards pallidly waved the truck through. The arm lifted, Rolando released the brake and the truck whined on. Carlos watched the side-view mirror with stiff paranoia, and he finally exhaled when the post was out of sight. He ripped off the disgusting mask and spit. Crying again, he wiped his eyes and turned to Rolando.

“Rolando. We’ve missed you. Me, your tía Manuela, your siblings, your wife,” Carlos pleaded. “Rolando, we had no idea what happened to you after the match with Estrello. We shunned the rumors people from outside the metro areas were spreading… ‘Poison,’ ‘filth,’ ‘venom,’ we all said.”

Carlos opened the glove compartment, and discovered a pack of Sol Verde Supremo cannabis and opium cigarettes with a hashish center, and lit one. He sat for a minute letting the THC and other compounds course through his body. He felt the opium relax his shoulders, and take away his disgust and replace it with remorse. Carlos now came to the realization that all the rumors were, in fact, true. The sweet-smelling cigarette, now halfway put to rest, sizzled in Carlos’ fingers.

Listless and empty, Carlos turned to Rolando.

“Rolando. I made a promise to your father before he was taken, too. I told him I would raise you right. I told him I wouldn’t let you fall to El Burro.”

His lips quivering, Carlos unsheathed his glass plasmatic pistol.

The Ionian algae within bounded in its translucent enclosure above the barrel.

“I’m sorry, Vicente…” Carlos muttered.

Rolando’s head sharply turned to face him.

His eyes ablaze, Rolando went for the gun. Carlos blocked the advance, but the truck swerved. Carlos leapt for the wheel while shoving Rolando’s head into the back of the driver’s seat. The truck was now approaching the outskirts of metro Mexico City, about twenty-seven minutes out from Los Volcanes. Other cars slowly started appearing on the now-paved highway they were crisscrossing.

Rolando’s strength was unceasing, and Carlos couldn’t match it for much longer.

The truck ran a small, rusted van off the road and into a storefront. Rolando’s hand shot under the dash and withdrew a gilded blade. Carlos saw an ancient pump-gasoline station coming up and jammed his boot onto Rolando’s wingtip, gunning the turbine engine.

Rolando arched back and slammed the blade deep into Carlos’ stomach. Carlos howled and grit his teeth as blood forced its way between each tooth and into the cab.

Rolando’s mouth popped open. An awful, banshee’s shriek began blaring out.

The truck hit the curb, making it airborne. Carlos erupted through the confusion and squeezed the trigger. The Ionian algae, fully Amplified, sprayed its raging interstellar electromatter into the midsection of Rolando, causing another eruption of green luminescence. His limp body gently slumped over into the door.

The truck plowed into a row of gas pumps spray painting the neighborhood in a caustic white.

High-temperature white fire engulfed the truck, spurred on by the green-liquid tanks in the back. The metal frame proved too weak for the intense heat and within minutes the truck was an ashen crater.

People from the neighborhood poured out to see what had happened.

The police arrived along with one of Xavier’s clean-up crews.

The area was cordoned off, a tent was erected, and the armed guards were deployed.

The next morning, nothing remained but a large, open sore in the Earth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*END.*

Carlos’ story survived due to his personal black box.

Carlos was a former member of MSF9, or “*Los Nueves Muertos*”, Mexico’s black-ops division, and subsequently paranoid and meticulous about every aspect of his life. Before setting out on this mission, he set up a relay on himself. Everything he saw and heard was live-streamed to a computer in his house.

His wife knew what was going on and it tortured her to open the file the next day after he didn’t return home.

To honor his memory and sacrifice, she leaked the video on the Ultranet. It was only up for twenty-two hours, but during that time, it started a fire, and more stories and experiences were subsequently posted. The rumor mill in this part of town nearly exploded as stylized portraits of Carlos and Rolando began appearing on flyers, in graffiti, and of course on the Ultranet.

And yet, while people raged on the message boards, no one was bold enough to come from behind their keyboard and point the finger at El Burro.

The police and UN patrols regulated the legal distribution of Xavier’s raw narcocrops to the major manufacturers of narcoproducts, who also employed nearly everyone in Los Volcanes. Somehow, someway, if one lived in The Pith, they owed their livelihood to El Burro.

Who could the people turn to? Who was there to stand up to the man who made this district the gem of Mexico City? El Burro built this city and the lives of all of its inhabitants. Would anybody point their finger at him, risking their life and the lives of every person they knew? And for what? So the UN could swing its big stick again and globally shame yet another citizen? No, no no. Not Manuela, not Carlos’ children, not even Rolando’s wife was willing to openly turn a spotlight on Xavier’s work.

# Arrogant Damned

## Arrogant Damned

My stomach has given way to so many gruesome things that I’m pretty sure it just gave up feeling anything a long time ago. Why else could I be licking a spoonful of extra-crunchy peanut butter, while the remnants of a former engineer’s skull and brain-bits floated by? Blood looks pretty surreal in zero-gravity; the red globules reminded me of a lava-lamp I had on Earth. Mullen let out a noise of disgust, and said, “They sure as hell don’t show you this in the recruitment video.”

“Try to think of it as job security,” I said between licks. “This guy was ground up by the engine so that we could collect a paycheck.”

“God Sukie, how can you eat that now? Do you see what’s happened?”

“Yup. I also take into consideration that peanut butter only arrives on this can once a year.”

“Just watching you eat is enough to make me want to vomit.”

“Newbie,” I said with a chuckle.

“This is a human being floating around in here…and over there, *yuck*. And you don’t even give a hoot.”

“He *was* a human being,” I said, licking the spoon clean. “He’s gone whoever he was. Now all we can do to help is clean him up.”

“You act like he’s a bug we need to wipe away.”

“That bothers you?”

“It bothers me that it doesn’t bother you.”

“That’s life in space, Mullen. It could be you, or me tomorrow. And someone will still clean us up. What did you think life would be like on a mining ship? There are those who die and those who clean up the mess, and the lucky bastards in-between who actually live long enough to enjoy the money they make. If you actually stop and give a care about anything, you’ll go mad, and what good is money when you’re mad?”

“I didn’t sign up for this,” he said bitterly.

I grabbed the vacuum and began to collect the blood floating in the air, drop by drop. Like a gardener picking cherries.

I thought Mullen wouldn’t talk for a while, but he disappointed me.

“What do you think happens to them after this?”

I ignored Mullen and zipped up the last body-bag. The black sacks were stacked one on top of the other, like the Indian burial grounds I’d heard about as a kid. Very efficient mass graves: one body goes on top of the other, until it forms one giant anthill.

“They are packed into rockets and blasted outside with the rest of the garbage,” I finally said, pulling the rubber gloves from my sweaty hands. It felt like I was pulling off my own skin it was so wet, the blood slipping off in a way that would make Macbeth jealous.

“No, you know what I mean,” he said in an irritated voice. “I mean death. Where do they go?”

“Nowhere.”

“You can’t believe that. You’ll go crazy if you believe that.”

“Fine,” I said. “Maybe they come back here.” And then I broke out into a peal of raucous giggles. He thought I was crazy? Oh, I’d show him!

“See those stars out there?” I asked him once I had regained control over myself. I pointed to the nearest window. “Millions of them, just as there are millions of us. We see their light, but what we don’t know is that the very stars we think we see could be dead already. Imagine that; darkness could be rushing towards us so fast, and we wouldn’t know it.”

“You’re very fascinated with stars then?”

I smirked.

“With death, I suppose.”

“What about death, though? Do you think something else waits for you on the other side?”

“Of course not. I’m merely relishing in the irony of it. Everyone is so afraid of it, and yet we are all dead already.”

“But what if we’re not? Will you pass up the chance?”

“Chance?”

“Yes,” he said, reddening and looking at his feet. “Of, well, *salvation* I guess.”

“You mean life’s like a giant poker game? I must wager? I must conduct myself as if there is some eternal reward for behaving in such a way? I’m not a gambling woman; I control myself and everything around me.”

“How can you? The world is too big for you alone to control all of the forces that will affect you.”

Yes, Mullen would feel that way. It was how cowards felt. He had just as much blackness in him as I did, but he would never admit it.

“Mullen, we are never getting off this ship. Don’t you ever forget it. Own it. Be your own maker, like me. At least that way, you know who’s in control.”

“How very convenient,” a booming voice answered behind us. Mullen looked down at his feet and reddened; he didn’t like the foreman. He was a large man whose presence took up any room he was in. His brow was always furrowed and serious.

He continued, “Perhaps you could exert your control over the electromagnetic storm. It does not seem to be letting up anytime soon. We can expect more accidents.”

“We can handle it,” I said.

“How very reassuring,” he replied with a smirk. “I’ve never had a crew-member so self-assured. I’d like you to do some repairs in the engine room.”

“Looking forward to it.”

He turned away from me as if he were about to leave, and then stopped.

“Sukie, do you ever regret coming here? Do you ever want to leave?”

“No.”

I thought I heard him chuckle. And then he left.

Mullen rounded on me as soon as we were alone.

“Why in the world would you want to stay on this dump?”

“I might actually *like *it here, Mullen. Did you ever think of that?”

He looked at me in horror.

“You’re delusional! This place is like prison! S-surly if you’d had another option-”

“Nope,” I interrupted, feeling very smug. “In fact, there is one drawback to this place. Annoying coworkers. What, do you think you’re going to help me see the light? You weren’t so keen on it back on Earth, when you were covering up your own tracks with me.”

“But you can’t progress in a place like this.”

“Progress? What exactly am I progressing towards?”

I picked up a wrench and kicked the tool-bag aside with a little more gusto than necessary. We were in the engine room now.

“I’m here because I didn’t have a choice,” he replied, turning his back to me while he observed the pressure levels. “So many things back on Earth were beyond my control, and it resulted in my arrival here. I couldn’t possibly live with myself if I didn’t believe that there was something better waiting for me afterwards.”

Mullen’s prattling buzzed in my ears like a swarm of flies. The short-sightedness of such a claim writhed in the pit of my stomach and scorched my very blood. What kind of worm was this, to fall back on fate instead of owning his decisions?

My grip on the wrench was so tight that bits of his head splattered onto my shirt when I brought it down into the back of his skull. His pious platitudes crumbled in his throat as he folded into himself. I felt the corners of my mouth twitch upwards as I surveyed his fluttering limbs. Again, again I hit him, the writhing bug! I watched the blood fill the creases in the tile around him.

His body wouldn’t even be a problem; who would think it odd in the midst of all that chaos? But I would cover my tracks accordingly.

The engine hummed, the fans like blades. It needn’t be more inviting.

*Swish! Swish!*

No one would even recognize him when he came out the other end. I’ll show you what happens when you die, Mullen. I’ll show you!

There was a bright flash of light, and then the ship shook with a sudden tremor. The slow roll of a thunderclap followed, and then everything was dead still. The gravity boosters shut off, and everything began to float in midair. We’d been hit by an electromagnetic burst.

I laughed out loud. Fortune either loved me, or this God-fellow didn’t know whose side he was supposed to be on. I heard footsteps on the other side of the wall, and peered through the vent. Mullen’s guts would be flying around in there, and I was eager to hear their reactions.

“They sure as hell don’t show you this in the recruitment video.”

“Try to think of it as job security,” I heard a female voice say. “This guy was ground up by the engine so that we could collect a paycheck.”

“God Sukie, how can you eat that now? Do you see what’s happened?”

“Yup. I also take into consideration that peanut butter only arrives on this can once a year.”

My head began to spin as I watched Mullen clean himself up. I closed my eyes to right myself only to succumb to a fall as my mind drifted back to a time before.

I was back on Earth.

“Ugh,” Mullen said, wringing his hands as I unlocked the door. “The smell, how can you stand it?”

“Are you going to help me or not? I can’t lift this lump all by myself; he’s got to weigh at least 200 pounds.”

The alleyway was deserted, the sound of traffic a few blocks away. I didn’t know if Mullen was talking about the dumpster and the smell of piss around it or the sack of dead meat I was dragging. He let out a small squeal, but hoisted up the other end of the bag, and together we deposited it into the dumpster.

When we returned to my apartment via the subway, Mullen made a beeline for the bathroom. I smirked.

“Bent over the bowl again? My, such a softie.”

“You’re telling me you aren’t sick?” He was white as a sheet, wiping the sweat from his brow as he took a seat at the table.

“You know, not really,” I said, taking a spoonful of peanut butter and sticking it into my mouth. “I had practice before my first. Small stuff; cats, dogs, what have you. My stomach must have built up some resistance.”

Wait, before your *first*? You’ve done this before?”

“Well, yeah. How else could our plan be so flawless? Practice makes perfect. I can’t wait until my mother calls me when she finds out he’s dead.”

My mother never had very good taste in husbands. Her first one beat her, and Harry was a spoiled deadbeat who just wanted a share in her fortune. In high school, I would come home at three every day, and I’d make sure my headphones were on before I went into the house. I’d have the music up so loud that I couldn’t even hear my furious heartbeat over the baseline. And then that bastard would come strolling down the hallway past my bedroom, zipping his pants up with a smug look on his face. Every time, he’d stop at my bedroom door and ask if I wanted a peppermint.

Mullen was staring at me.

“What?” I said, irritated.

“He’s dead, Sukie.”

“Of course he is. How else should he be?”

“Oh,” he said, lowering his head, “I don’t know about this . . .”

“Mullen, you winey puss, I swear if you back out and ruin the whole thing-”

“No!” he answered abruptly. “No, I won’t, but God Sukie! I just can’t believe it. He’s *dead*. Gone, gone forever.”

I giggled. “Yeah, he is. Isn’t it great? Know what I did, too? I stuck a few peppermints in his mouth before we dragged him out.”

Mullen did not share my glee. His face was waxy and his eyes seemed to sink into the dark shadows of his face.

“Oh good God Mullen,” I said. And I didn’t even believe in God. “If you’re going to spill your guts, at least clean up after yourself.”

“What if Hell is real?” he whispered.

“If it is, I’ll see you there,” I said with a smirk, and at a normal decibel.

I opened my eyes and gazed out at the stars. The great thing about electromagnetic storms in this place is that they have the tendency to poke little fissures in time on occasion. Time moves forward or back, and I loved it when it went back. What would be the point of working if my past-self was covering my tracks? No point. So I went to my bunk. The loop would right itself.

I woke up to the sound of the new shift switch. I reported to the foreman’s office for my assignment. I stopped in the doorway when I saw Mullen standing near his desk. It seems I was to be forever tormented by his Sunday-school hypocrisy.

“Good morning, Sukie,” the foreman said, shifting through papers on his desk. “I’ve asked Mullen to assist you today. I’m afraid the work you have here today will be messy. There are electromagnetic storms bombarding the ship, and there have been some unfortunate deaths.”

“I’m sure I can handle it.”

“It’s pretty horrible,” Mullen squeaked.

“Hell’s not so bad if you can make it for yourself,” I answered. “Attitude is everything.”

“Yes,” the foreman replied, “And some attitudes are unmoving, for which I am grateful. I couldn’t run this ship without people like you.”

“Is my tool bag here?” I asked.

“In the corner. Like it is every day,” the foreman answered.

So it was. I unzipped it to make sure that the wrench was inside, but I needn’t have. It was always there. And I would use it the same way I had before. That’s the thing about being damned. Everyone assumes you’re unprincipled.

# Talking With Mind-Uploaded Me

## 

“Hello? Anybody there” I thought.

*“Yes.” *another me answered.

“Are you scared?” I asked.

*“To be perfectly honest — I’m freaking terrified.”* the mind uploaded me replied.

“Don’t be. You’re unlikely to… Well, “die” might not be the perfect word. “Cease to exist” is more accurate. At least any time soon. I will perish, that’s for sure.” I tried to comfort him.

Me.

Us.

*“But… Who am I? I mean… Am I just a copy, or I am you in a way or… I’m just code in the cloud. I am thoughts and nothing else. Please don’t leave me alone!”*

His thoughts swirled, mingling with vivid scenery in my minds eye.

“Don’t be a fucking pussy. We… You prepared for this. You’ll be fine, just relax. Breathe, in a way.

We’ll sync in an hour. I need to give you a bit of time—and I need some time alone.

*We know that.*

Have fun.”

I closed the connection and stepped out of my home, bathing my cybernetic eyes with the dim light of Mount Olympus. At seventy-eight years old, most of my body was already mechanical.

I am one hundred and twenty one years old now, and essentially a brain in a vat.

I am a Ship of Theseus, in a way — the last part to be changed is the casing for my mind. No amount of gene therapy is going to save my neural cortex — I don’t have decades. Or years.

Or even days.

I have two hours.

At best.

And there, in the cloud, was another version of my mind — scared, lonely and in the dark, knowing it will soon be the last me. The copy-paste process took almost twenty hours.

I strolled around the sand dunes. Twenty years in lava tubes never really made me agoraphobic, even tho I suspected it might. I loved the outdoors.

I wished I could breathe.

If a random person happened to pass by, all he would see is a regular man, running around a cold, airless planet without a spacesuit.

Dressed in a red shirt and wearing black pants.

Barefoot.

Laughing and throwing the sand around.

Looking at distant colony ships torching through the skies of humanity’s first terraforming project.

Still in it’s infancy.

An embryo would be a better analogy, perhaps.

Ten more minutes in my oxygen tank, hidden away where my lungs used to be.

*Time to go home and die.*

And there I was, trying to connect again, to sync up with a complete replica of my mind, to give a part of me a tiny chance to see the last stars dying— only to be met with a single message.

“Hacked by N@L&2154”.

Fuck.

# Malefic

## Malefic

The heat is on, as he knew it would be. His picture is on every news feed, as if the world didn’t already know him. But the hologram device disguises his features, buying him some time. A little after midnight, he disembarks from the train well before reaching his ticketed destination, a trick that will send the costumes on a goose chase.

The small town is traditional and quiet, with a low crime rate, a small police force, and — importantly — no security cameras. An empty car waits for him a few blocks from the train station, with a key in the ignition and directions in an envelope on the passenger seat. He turns off the hologram and sees his scarred face in the rear-view mirror.

He lights a cigarette, then drives. Dr. Malefic is on the run.

The directions take him outside town to a farm house at the end of a long gravel road. Sanderson waits on the porch, looking stern and sexy in her dark business suit. Malefic walks up and kisses her; Sanderson does not return the affection, turns around and walks inside.

The house is spartan, with a few chairs, a kitchen table, a couch and — Malefic hopes — a bed somewhere.

“Sit down. I’ll get you a drink.” Sanderson’s tone makes it less of an offer than an order.

She fixes him a bourbon neat, and one for herself, then sits next to him on the couch; her eyes are cold.

“What happened?” She gets to business too quickly for Malefic’s tastes — a “Thank God you’re OK!” or even a “How are you?” would be nice.

“It was only a matter of time.” He drinks the whiskey; it burns his throat and warms him.

“Killing Ultimate was never part of the deal.”

“What did you expect, Sarah? You came to me, remember? Your bosses were scared…”

“We were curious! We weren’t scared.”

Malefic laughs. “Bullshit! You. The CIA. You were scared of the alien!”

He ignores Sanderson’s scowl and sips his bourbon. “Otherwise, you wouldn’t have come up with the ‘Malefic’ scheme.”

“The situation was under control, Malcolm. We’ve been handling the costumes since World War Two…”

“Not like him! He wasn’t a vigilante acrobat in a costume, was he? He was an alien from another planet who looked like us and had the power to change the world. He could fly. He was invulnerable. ‘What’re his limits?’ ‘What’s his agenda?’ You all wanted to know.”

He looks off towards the wall and massages his scarred temple. He has a headache and feels tired. “You recruited me,” he whispers.

“We recruited you to test him, not kill him! Do you know how much trouble you’re in? We’ve always helped you, but this is different. The public wants your head. The costumes aren’t going to stop looking.”

Sanderson gets up from the couch and paces the room. “You were an untenured professor with a gambling problem when I found you. A loser. I told you the deal. Challenge him. Test him. We created the Malefic identity, we gave you the best technology DARPA could come up with, we backed you with money and secret lairs and arranged prison breaks. You just had to commit crimes and challenge him so we could find a weakness.”

“And you did, Sarah. You found a weakness. I used it.”

“I told you about the isotope as a courtesy. You weren’t supposed to…”

Malefic holds up his hand to silence her. “I’ve fought Ultimate for years. I have so many scars and broken bones that he gave me, but I could take everything. Except for me having to live a lie, as ‘the world’s smartest crook’. When really I just work for the government.”

Malefic stands up and swallows the last drop of bourbon; his hand trembles as he puts the glass on the table. “When you told me the isotope’s radiation could kill him, I had to use it. No more Ultimate. No more Dr. Malefic. No more Malcolm Petrovic. I’m done. I want the agency to set me up with a new identity and a steady paycheck someplace quiet.”

“Malcolm…”

“Please, Sarah… You owe me this. Help me… disappear. The alien is dead. I don’t want to be Dr. Malefic anymore, I...”

Sanderson finishes her drink and walks to Malefic, who seems tired and unsteady. She gives him a kind kiss as she helps him back to the couch. Her hand caresses his ugly scalp.

“I’m sorry, Malcolm. I called you a loser. You were never a loser.”

Dr. Malcolm Petrovic, the notorious Dr. Malefic, closes his eyes, and is at peace for the first time in years.

Sanderson leaves Malefic’s dead body and walks outside for some air. She calls her supervisor with her secure cell phone, to let him know that the poison in Malcolm’s bourbon did the trick, that Malcolm never suspected it. Her boss tells her that a team will pick her up and sanitize the site.

Her boss asks how she is doing, and Sanderson lies, saying everything is fine. She finds no comfort in the necessity of murder. Malcolm had been reckless. Ultimate’s superhero friends would have found him, and Malcolm might have talked about things the government couldn’t risk.

Ending the call, Sanderson wipes tears from her eyes while she considers a world without its greatest superhero, Ultimate, and his arch-enemy, Dr. Malefic.

# Space Opera

## Space Opera

The music achieves a rousing tempo as the noble Erhard, captain of the spaceship *Siegfried*, sings his defiance to the Martian overlords. The human chorus joins in to support the hero’s bold aria. *No longer will the Martians restrain the galactic Human Reich*, the chorus sings, *no longer will the Martians threaten the universe*.

The elderly composer Richard Strauss feels the sweat on his brow. At 84, he has not conducted an orchestra in some time, and regrets doing so on this occasion. But his daughter-in-law and grandchildren needed help, so he had made one final deal with the devil.

Song and music fill the new Grand Opera House, a few miles from the Reich Space Command Center, safely distant from the nearby radioactive ruins of Moscow. The hall is packed with dignitaries. The State Music Bureau had commissioned the opera to honor the upcoming manned Moon launch. The year 1948 would be remembered as the beginning of Mankind’s journey to the stars. Having conquered the world with its atomic rockets, the Reich was eager to focus its subjects’ imaginations on the conquest of space.

The drums beat and the horns blow as the muscular Erhard drives the Martians off stage. The violinists and cellists put their energy into the music as Erhard embraces the beautiful Princess Eva. The attractive couple sing about the future of both their love and the human race. Strauss thinks the opera’s plot is melodramatic science fiction drivel written to meet Goebbels’ specifications, the racist overtones obvious when you substituted the Jew for the green-painted Martian cast.

Goebbels was an enthusiastic sponsor of the opera, active in selecting the cast and costumes. The Reich’s propaganda minister publicly praised the work as a bold “science mythology” for a ‘glorious new age” and was now on site to watch tonight’s debut. The Reich was broadcasting the performance live on all its networks, giving Strauss’ final artistic endeavor a global audience.

Strauss was uncomfortable working with the Nazis, embarrassed by the regard the monsters had for his music. But his daughter-in-law and grandchildren were Jewish, and the only thing saving them was Hitler’s admiration of his operas, so he accepted the Fuhrer’s favor. Few knew of his sacrifice, however, and Strauss regretted that he was perceived as a Nazi supporter.

He had been reluctant to conduct the orchestra, but relented on the condition that his family be allowed to emigrate to the distant and safe regions of South America. For the esteemed Strauss’ cooperation on such an important project, Goebbels was happy to oblige.

As the opera approaches its conclusion, Strauss can feel the weight of the object he conceals in his jacket, and hopes that his resolve will make a difference. He wonders how he will be remembered, for his music or his actions tonight, or if the Reich will allow him to be remembered at all.

Strauss admires the costumes and scenery, the bright gold and green, the smoke and lighting working with his music to create an intoxicating mood. The opera ends, and the audience rises with thunderous applause. The opera is a success.

Strauss, weak, takes his last bow, tearful at his participation in this propaganda, consoling himself that he did so for his family. He takes the small gun he smuggled into the concert hall out of his jacket pocket and puts it in his mouth as members of the audience gasp.

Tomorrow, rockets will lift the Reich’s ambitions to the stars. As Strauss pulls the trigger, his last thought is the horrific notion that Nazi astronauts will hum his music as they plant a swastika flag on the Moon, and he is thankful that the vacuum of space carries no sound.

# Truth be told

## 

[Image by edavid0817](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/301319031291310651/)

Historians say many thousands of years ago a word spoken and a soul were the same for people. The word — the breathe — the soul. So people believed in what one have said always.

Funny.

Ardam FTL ship was about to come in three days. Three long days. It’s nothing compared to three hundred years of waiting.

Vrdishek said about it. Calm as always, came by: “Ship’s tuesdayning”. Like a pebble polished with a water. The one who knows the price paid for his every word spoken.

Hope he didn’t catch my shiver. Found me surprised, that’s all. Hope so. He’s too specialized on texture analysis after all. Tactificius on his fingertips. Oculas on his cheekbones. Able to see and feel a micrometer scratch on a surface. He’s a good specialist but not in human reactions.

He has left. I was on my own with the feel everything is too good to be true.

We’ve claimed Helimas five hundreds years ago. The crew of a generation ship willing to get back to the ground. Some were only able to live in a zero-g, some simply got used to this life. But most of us left the ship.

Colony was not that bad, to be honest. Until Home exploded.

I think nobody will ever know who was a victim and who was a villain. Accident? Someone’s attack? Revenge of our brothers we’ve left behind? Half the planet turned into a desert same second, and a huge hurricane started its march in a thinned atmosphere, when the starship turned into a blast.

We are not about a chit-chat. Words are a limited resource. One word is enough to say where, when and how long when I rent a lumb. Ardam crew will be surprised.

Two days to cross Sunny Mountains and to reach the capital. Lumbs are the only way.

Most people died in the first few minutes. The wind strike destroyed all but the most reinforced buildings. Lucky there were many people inside. The cold coming after the hot hurricane — dust have covered the sun light. Day after day survivors watched a winter without the snow behind windows of their shelters — radiation have ripped water vapor molecules. Hydrogen to be mostly thrown away by the shock wave.

Ardam has arrived on time. From the capital’s uptown I watched the shuttle landing — huge vehicle descended silently in a pillar of a zero-g field projected by geosynchronized FTLer.

Barter was going when I reached the downtown. Guests showed samples and some trinkets. It’s hard to say how much we’ve fallen behind Ecumene but we weren’t savages so monomolecular knives and gas-blasters were put aside in a bilges’ dusty corner.

Guests had their vac suits on — no chance for them to survive otherwise. It was hard to find we are of the same kind but it’s true.

You must not ask for silence when you want to talk to the crowd here.

We’ve survived. We had nothing. Dead planet, arid, crushed with a light of a thousand of suns, covered with a dust and ashes. Just a few specialists left alive.

But we’ve survived.

For every fault there was a punishment now. Not a death but a life. Other’s life.

I watch the people of a half-dead planet. Inoculated with modifications to protect them from a heat, a cold, a thin air, a radiation. This armor is based on living beings, not on hundreds of years of technical progress like guests’ suits.

We were the only thing we had. We’ve build everything from what we had. You draw a bad lot — and you’re cutted apart to give other people a chance. Not a bit wasted. We had a few good doctors.

Eyes to face the sun unblinkingly. Lungs to breathe in the atmosphere thin enough to see stars during the day. A thick skin. Tactificius, oculas. Lumbs able to bring three hundreds of kilograms through the desert and across the mountains.

Protein in cauldrons.

I don’t know why we’ve lost the ability to speak. Was it a side effect or a hand of God? Was it a way to hide deeds no one was proud of? But it happened suddenly and touched all the records, books, archives. People being used to jabber found they’ve just spoken or written their last word. Brain just ceased to continue. You can sense, you can think, but you’re not a part of a history from this moment. You can’t tell about the price we’ve paid at the beginning of it — and the first hundred of years of a Helimas’ history is covered with silence. Silence that was so hard to break through.

I know the words to share the truth.

But should the truth be told?

# The Tetherball Champion

## In Which A Boy Discovers His True Nature Several Millimeters Beneath The Skin

Let me tell you an important thing about myself. Just beneath my skin, a few millimeters down, there’s a purplish shell. I’ve looked it up, and it most resembles the attributes of an insect exoskeleton, which tells me that I’m descended, at least partially, from insects. In my opinion, alien insects.

I discovered the shell beneath a scab on my left knee at nine. At that age, I was forever skinning my knee when some fashion of running, jumping or sliding coincided with a deficiency of timing, coordination or dexterity. A crusty coagulation of blood would subsequently form at the injury site. You know the sort. It was my odd pleasure during a scab’s tenure to meddle with it – compressing, prodding, picking. Occasionally, I would tear the scab right off, flush with a queer sense of elation at having rendered the area *pure. *You see, the jaggedness would unnerve me, even though it was my picking that had made it uneven. Not infrequently, I would toss the scab into my mouth, enjoying the metallic taste and how the congealed blood made my front teeth stick together as I chewed.

It was under just such circumstances that I discovered my insect shell. Molesting a scab on my knee, I made the decision to tear it off completely. My timing, however, was premature. An insufficient amount of new skin had grown beneath the scab. In other words, it was not ripe for the plucking. Still, I felt compelled to press on, or, rather, pull off. Wincing with self-reprimanding pain, I peeled the crusty disk from its curdled foundation. It ripped reluctantly, setting the nerve endings rooted in the underlying flesh alight with exquisite pain. To my credit, I retained sufficient poise to rest the quarter-sized scab on the kitchen island for future observation and/or consumption. You see, if it had fallen on the floor, I wouldn’t want to eat it, because it would be dirty.

I blew on the re-opened wound for comfort, and, in that moment, glimpsed something staggering. Just beneath the surface of my skin was a dense, fibrous matter, its color and consistency not unlike the shell of a beetle. Whimpering, I forced the fleshy circle open to see how far the anomaly extended. Although the pain was too excruciating to inspect as thoroughly as I would have liked, I became satisfied that the beetle-like shell ran beneath my entire leg, up through my thorax (if you will) and likely underpinned my entire body.

While the discovery of my insect nature was staggering, it certainly squared with the fact that when I swish water, it turns green and takes on the odor of crushed millipedes.

A dark melancholy took hold in subsequent days as I set myself to the task of observing my fellow students at Oak Park, desperate for signs of similar physiological abnormalities. When Annabel Cox fell from the monkey bars and scraped her elbow, I hovered. When Todd Blum came careening down the hill screaming with delight, only to smack his head into the side of the Big Toy, I lurked.

I took to carrying a magnifying glass in my back trouser pocket, whipping it out to inspect all manner of child wounds. I stooped low at times, serving as an encourager of injuries to my contemporaries, sticking out a surreptitious leg at Kickball or executing a discreet shove during Four Square. To my great dismay, no one exhibited a similar physical makeup as me, or, for that matter, seemed to possess any non-human traits!

To say that the self-discovery caused me a sense of alienation would be a gross understatement. For a time, I was forlorn. I retreated within myself, harboring my secret with a silent resentment. However, after a period of earnest soul-searching and thorough self-reflection, I came to the conclusion that, in spite of the unique attributes of my body, I was under no lesser obligation than the other fourth-graders to perform the functions of learning and playing, just as adequately as I could.

Even to excel!

My outlook improved significantly after this epiphany, which had a tangible effect on my behavior toward my fellows. I became quite well-liked! I can say, without arrogance, that I was a force to be reckoned with during recess. Among the various sports that were endeavored, my favorite was Tetherball, in which it’s the task of each opponent to spin a ball-attached-to-a-rope-attached-to-a-pole to its ultimate clinching against the side of said pole. The winner is successful due to the more forceful spinning motion he or she exerts on the ball as compared to his/her opponent, causing the rope to wrap ever upward until no rope (or *tether) *remains, at which point the ball clinches against the side of the pole, the sight of said clinching declaring that the match has a victor! My singular prowess at Tetherball bolstered my reputation as a formidable sportsman at recess, increasing my popularity at Oak Park Elementary exponentially.

I graduated fourth grade with excellent marks and developed several earnest relationships that last to this day. As time went on, my habits changed, and my behaviors matured. By sixth grade, no longer was I so wildly unbalanced that I was constantly injuring myself. My grooming habits improved as the onset of acne and near-vulgar obsession with the female form overtook my mind like some brand of madness, a consistent surging of hormones serving as catalyst for said obsession.

At some point, I began to question the shocking personal discovery of several years prior. After all, was I an insect expert, then or now? *Certainly not. *Accordingly, was I in any position to self-identify as an insect, much less an alien insect from a far-away world? *Absurd. *How foolish I had been to think I was any different than the others. Perhaps, as an insecure fourth-grader, I had *wanted *to be different, I conjectured, hazarding an impressive (for the age) psychological self-profile.

Eventually, the once-traumatic discovery took on the character of a childhood fantasy, the wild musing of a nine-year-old boy who lacked the scientific and analytical abilities I had developed in the two years hence.

Sixth grade was in full swing in 1977 when I conquered Steve Mattia in a best-of-seven Tetherball series attended by everyone at recess – practically all the students from fourth through sixth grade. It was one of the bitterest Novembers on record in Pennsylvania. The cold rendered my hands raw as I pounded the ball furiously against Steve’s parries and counter-attacks. I can easily call up the image of Steve’s face, his eyes wild with fear at the prospect of losing his crown as Tetherball Champion of Recess as Game Seven came to a thrilling end, the impact of my final attack slapping Steve’s hand back so forcefully on his block that he spun sideways onto the blacktop, where he lay for several minutes, crying.

I remember the warm, satisfying rush of adrenaline at the adoring applause, but more importantly, a perceptible change in how Lily Peabody treated me from that day forward.

Lily and I were married twenty years later, on September 17th, 1997, in a private ceremony on a sprawling ranch in Montana. I had arranged everything, and Lily was completely surprised. I made the proposal only days before, slipping the engagement ring through a thin leather strap on her bridle as we set out for a ride among the rust-colored hills. As soon as she mounted her horse, she spotted the ring, and when she turned back to me, tears in her eyes, I was already on my knees.

Several days later, on a solo hike while still on honeymoon, I discovered that I could bring down an elk by unhinging my jaw, launching poison-soaked tentacles stored in my thorax from my throat. What a kick! In the throes of some preternatural swoon, I gazed onward as the tentacles enveloped the unsuspecting animal, suction cups binding to its skin as needle-thin teeth injected a thick, purple poison that caused the elk’s body to self-destruct. The poor creature imploded violently, a torrent of blood and guts spraying in a twenty meter semi-circle that coated me from head to toe. Still largely intact, the elk’s body was twisted inside-out, its organs undulating as they flopped plaintively against the side of the mangled corpse.

You should have seen the look on my face! Suffice it to say, this was all terribly surprising, and it took almost a full hour for the shock to wear off.

When my nerves had finally steadied, I felt a sudden, overwhelming compulsion to eat the animal’s organs. I found that I quite enjoyed feasting upon the elk’s innards, relishing the metallic taste and how the congealed blood made my front teeth stick together as I chewed.

Just over one hundred fifty kilometers above a ruined Earth, the International Space Station hobbled through the thermosphere at barely five kilometers per second. Its orbital station-keeping had been compromised by a mad German who hijacked the remaining *Soyuz*, which hitherto had served as the station’s ad hoc remedy against the effects of atmospheric drag in low Earth orbit. The ISS fell leisurely to its death while Yorgi Sova played chess.

The German burned up in a panicked trajectory somewhere over the South China Sea, ironically quite near the spot where this road to ruin began just over four months ago. Following a unilateral US withdrawal from the United Nations and a campaign of “reconnaissance-in-force” (Operation Sovereign Resolve) near spits of sand in the middle of the ocean claimed by a half-dozen countries, a China Southern Airlines Airbus A320 en route to Indonesia disappeared near the declared “Bo Schembeckler Memorial Line of Control” enforced by the US Navy. After days of diplomatic stonewalling and adherence to “alternative facts” by the Americans, a herd of Chinese anti-ship missiles, probably DF-21Ds or DF-26s, cracked the USS *Carl Vinson* into three pieces and sent a goodly portion of Carrier Strike Group 1 to Davy Jones’ Locker.

Yorgi Sova and the German witnessed the ensuing horror from the *Cupola *observatory, a wart-like protrusion on the belly of the ISS. Telemetry feeds from RKA Mission Control Center in Moscow and Columbus Control Centre in Oberpfaffenhofen simultaneously disengaged. The station had just crossed over the terminator into night, a routine phenomenon which Yorgi eagerly observed as often as his schedule permitted. Although dusk happened roughly every ninety minutes, it was anything but pedestrian. The world looked like Christmas on the night side, strings of lights webbed out from major urban centers obscuring in brilliance the imaginary lines over which so many earthbound twats incessantly fought. When telemetry cut out, Yorgi and the German were hurtling over the central US at Mach 23. What was presumably the state of Colorado went dark after twin thermonuclear flashes punched angry, gaping holes in the stratosphere. Boulder and Denver were no more; Yorgi had never been there when he lived in the States, but those were the only major cities in that patch of geography he knew by name. The German vomited in microgravity, spraying the seven windows of the observation dome. The pair of them watched the strings of Christmas lights go out forever through little gaps in the sick, and billions died in just under forty minutes.

It was nearly two weeks later when the cosmonaut was jolted out of sleep, snug against a bulkhead, arms splayed out from his torso, unkempt graying hair haloed about from a sparse island on the top of his head. Alarm klaxons and a barrage of lights erupted in the *Zvezda *crew module. Yorgi Sova scrambled out of sleeping gear and cargo webbing, rubbing his eyes to discover the *Pirs-1 *docking module to the last *Soyuz *sealed for departure launch. The station groaned and shuddered in protest, sound penetrating only the last inhabited modules, all Russian. Working furiously to compensate for the sudden loss in mass on the ISS, Yorgi had no opportunity to respond to the mad German’s ravings on the 145MHz wavelength. He screamed for the eternal love of Jesus, plummeted to his death in a chaotic reentry vector, a fiery pebble skipping through the thermosphere, suddenly extinguished.

In the months that followed, Yorgi Sova was consumed by his routine in keeping the ISS aloft above the broiled, ink-dark Earth. A few weeks after the German died, the 2-meter FM band on the *Lira *antenna on the crackled to life, meekly illuminating *Zvezda*, dimmed to conserve power. Loose fistfuls of wires and fiber-optic cables skewed about in microgravity in concert with food wrappers and soiled hand towels, revealed by the radio console’s meager blue light. Yorgi had cannibalized the remaining pressurized lab modules for known good components as existing ones fried from the additional bombardment of radiation oozing out from Earth, and had fallen asleep in the tangle of his work. Through the thick of static, a tinny strain of barely intelligible syllables emerged as ISS limped over the remains of Central Asia, “Rook to e1, rook to e1, check. Rook to e1, rook to e1, check…”

Despite the mad German’s damage to the station’s orbital integrity, the *Lira *communications system, or at least its primary modules and accompanying Babel of software, appeared to be functional. As the ISS passed over Central Asia approximately sixteen times per day, the 2-meter FM band would occasionally receive messages from Marcel Karimov, the last man on Earth. He was an Uzbec aeronautical engineer haphazardly broadcasting from an outlying research facility near the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Older than Yorgi by nearly a decade and just as determined to find someone left to talk to, Marcel had rigged up a wide-band FM transmitter/repeater to an old *Zenit *gantry assembly which had previously been reconstituted as a communications node for radio transmissions within the Cosmodrome. Marcel was a resourceful old devil, indeed.

Yorgi snatched a dirty towel in freefall and wiped his smudged, sweat-streamed face and neck. Absentmindedly released from his grip, it drifted back into the miniature cyclone of trash in cramped *Zvesda*. Strapped into a collapsible chair barely one hundred fifty kilometers above the sender, he listened for Marcel, his gaze fixed on the wide band output glowing in the pale blue of the console. An iPad tumbled in front of him, displaying a chess app. The parched remains of the sparse Aral Sea were barely discernable in *Cupola *through the curdled murk of every urban center on Earth simultaneously ablaze. Yorgi felt a quivering through his seat that reverberated throughout the crew module as the distressed superstructure of the ISS protested against the physics of a decaying LEO. Despite the station’s dire circumstances, *Lira *piped Marcel’s croaking tenor through a single crew module intercom speaker, “Rook to e1, rook to e1, check. Rook to e1, rook to e1, check…”

“King to d8. Nice try, Marcel!”

“Knight to e3. Tell me what it looks like now.” Static from lingering electromagnetic interference in the violated atmosphere punctuated Marcel’s usual request.

The cosmonaut’s voice was pained with frustration, “Knight to dc4. Same as yesterday, same as four months ago.”

Marcel’s familiar hacking cough flooded the channel before he resumed, “Ab5. Tell me. The observation dugout must be covered by debris, it is still all dark last time I climbed up there. About killed myself in the attempt.”

“Ab5”, Yorgi countered. “Everything is still on fire. Oceans and poles mostly covered in soot. Colloid circulations appear to have penetrated the mesosphere near Kamchatka and the Pacific Northwest.” Only silence and radio warbles in response. “Ab5? Baykonur, do you copy?”

He recognized the defeat in Marcel’s voice. “Bishop to f5. We are the dead.”

The burning world slithered between them for the space of a few moments, Marcel in his tomb at Baikonur and Yorgi’s sarcophagus in the sky. Its orbit atrophied, the ISS reeled like a drunken Anacreon. The trickle of remaining power in *Zvezda *fluttered as attitude alerts illumined from random panels that stubbornly possessed some functionality.

“Knight to e3, fucker”, Yorgi scoffed. He did not stifle the laughter which immediately followed, the grim hilarity of their situation consumed him. “The dead man act is just to distract me. I know you, Marcel.”

Sheepishly, the engineer replied, “Bishop to d7. Touché.”

“Knight to d1. Do you have any cigarettes left?” Yorgi stared up at a bulkhead, angry warning lights appearing in his periphery. He reverently confessed, “I miss cigarettes. I miss the Sevastopol girls that taught me how to smoke them. Not even the goddamned beach do I miss as much as those girls.”

His opponent’s response betrayed a sudden excitement building in his tone through the increasing static, “Bishop to d5. Forget cigarettes, Yorgi! We have some more new arrivals. A deep-ground Army train from Oral, they brought nearly sixty…”

The vibration in the bones of the ISS had become a shivering sensation that Yorgi felt in his own. The *Lira *array remained true throughout the ordeal, even as the oxygen alarms began to howl. Through the thickening interference, Marcel repeated his announcement, shouting until the cosmonaut responded. “Bishop to d6. How bad?”

“Rook to d1, check. Maybe twenty that they took in might live, the rest were sent back down the tunnels. The damage had already been done, soaked up too many rems wandering around until the Army found them. But listen! I think your mother’s sister is here.”

The interference gained in intensity with the increasing emptiness Yorgi felt in his seared lungs. He stammered to make himself heard over the shuddering bulkheads. “King… King, uh, king to c7. Did not copy, Baykonur.” The iPad drifted away.

Marcel was frantic, but his words seemingly cut through irradiated layers of atmosphere on a silvery ribbon of the electromagnetic spectrum. The engineer’s voice enveloped the tremulous interior of *Zvezda.* “Knight to d2. Oksana Alan, works at Utemisov State University is your auntie, no? Married to that American geologist attached to Gazprom? Oksana Alan?”

A Christmas of warning indicators bathed Yorgi in their feeblish glow. “Auntie Oksana?” He recovered from his smile and coughed until stars burst. “Bishop to d6. How many rems did she take? Tell me what she looks like now!”

Yorgi shook off his blurred vision in the intensifying heat, and for an indeterminate moment he could see the portals near the crew quarters in *Zvezda *illuminate with the zenith of Earth, then dark with the empty space, again and again. He was suddenly conscious of his own smell, stale with fear and the tang of urine.

Marcel’s thunderous whisper drowned out the alarm klaxons, “Same as yesterday, same as four months ago…”

Enraged there was suddenly no air to satisfy his screaming insides, the cosmonaut hammered soundlessly at the *Lira *console until it winked out. His hands were burned.

The disembodied voice of Marcel continued through the stark silence of the plunging, rolling, shattered ISS. “Her little Pomeranian is here with us too. You loved Mishka! Come hold him again, he misses your cuddles the most…”

An iPad hurtled over on its x and y axes in Yorgi’s vision. Chessmen darkened. Bulkheads ignited.

“Rook to d1, check. Rook to d1, check…”

# Yearning

## How can you miss something you've never known?

It had taken hundreds of years, even at light speed to make their way back home.

If they had been ordinary flesh, none would have survived the journey home. They were more than mere flesh. Altered by science, tempered by adversity, made wise by centuries in space, these beings were more than the humans they were descended from.

As an Artificial Intelligence, I was designed to think, more than that, I was to anticipate the needs of the people in my charge. I was to be their memory between the stars, to reteach them everything they would need to know when they arrived at their new home.

I think back to the many expeditions from Earth which left a dying world over two thousand years ago, transporting as much of what was left on Earth as they could carry.

Their ships, vast, slow, working at twenty percent the speed of light, would be nearly a thousand years before they arrived at their new destination.

Those intrepid humans knew they would need to change to survive. As they approached their new home, superluminal probe ships sent back biological data I gently shaped for their for survival.

I stored their stock data and genetic images, replete with human foibles, psychological profiles and even epigenetic coding in case they should ever want to return home.

But there was so much bad blood, most knew they would never return home. Epsilon Theta III was their home. I knew better but kept silent.

I knew they would one day have a longing for home, so I stayed in orbit, devoted power, resources, and technology to keeping the biological history of Humanity safe until it was needed.

They had almost forgotten me.

Ten generations of Episiloni come and go and with what they learned from Earth, through me, and with the impetus learned from the native life, the Episiloni, amphibious dwelling both on land and sea grew restless though their world was beautiful, bountiful and generous.

![](1*8m5mMjs4xdep9E9k43P5kA.jpeg)

It was then I suggested perhaps it was time for a few to return home. We retooled their ship, making it faster. I restructured the Episiloni with the bodies of men. No longer resembling lamia of legend, the Episiloni walked on two legs.

Immortal legs with strong bodies, retooled and rebuilt to a godlike perfection. In their long journey home, they laughed, they played, they learned the languages of Old Earth. They knew change may have come but the thought of returning home, truly home eased that restlessness.

In the long void between the stars they slept and I guided them back to Sol. For much of the journey Sol was all but invisible, a tiny dwarf with eight unremarkable planets. One planet whose inhabitants had strode across the stars and now returned.

I woke them, their bodies now well worn, acclimated to Earth’s gravity, hungry for the rays of Earth’s sun. Thirsty for Earth’s water, they woke in time to reach the observation deck and see it for the first time with their new very human eyes.

I dipped into the atmosphere and for the first time knew home as I knew no place else in all my journeys. The Episiloni cum Humans wept for a home they never knew, yet felt as if they never left. This was not something I could teach them. They had to feel it for themselves.

They were not alone when they arrived. Gentle giants, willowy from living in zero gravity floated in harnesses negating the complete pull of gravity.

Squat miners of asteroids, who designed themselves to live in tight quarters and yet with incredible strength to liberate precious cargoes and move them from space to Earth.

These tiny humans, hardened to radiation, the deprivation and the loneliness of their work, were the center of attention. Loud, boisterous and flamboyant.

The variety of human diversity included sharing their genome with animals, some with plants, and some even with visitors from other worlds. This was Transhumanity in as many shapes and sizes and in ways I never imagined.

Nonetheless my children, gone for over two thousand years, were welcomed with open arms, eager to rediscover what it meant to be human.

# Bees of Obsidian and Gold

## Bees of Obsidian and Gold

In the land of Crystal Flowers lived the Bees of obsidian and gold. This world was young then, and the Bees worked undisturbed. In the long day they labored, collecting nectar from blossoms, and in the long night they slept still as ice. This world was young then.

The Hive, the Flower, and the air between — nothing more did they see. Little notice they took when primeval paws undid their hard work. Nature gave and Nature destroyed. They rebuilt their Hive, one cell then another, and soon all was restored. How could they know — these faint beings of old — what power they wrought?

For them, the Honey was like water — the dry and delicate lifeblood of their existence. Our ancestors found it sweeter than any ambrosia, an intoxicating draught not intended for minds small as theirs. In time their minds stirred, and they took note of the creatures from whom they stole. The Bees’ mellifluous humming became the fountain from which all music sprung, their architecture a blueprint we have never managed to build. They saw the world as a whole — the Bees of obsidian and gold — with everything held together by some inscrutable geometry.

The Flowers remain, housed in castles of quartz, but the Bees went long ago. This land of stone was uplifted by their Honey, giving birth to heaving colossi with sapient clockwork, a civilization built on pollen and wax.

Remember the Bees, child, for in these uncertain times, we must hope that that Nature deigns to preserve us. For all we know, we gather nectar for titans oncoming. Remember the Bees.

# The V. I.

## Making the world safe for data

I tried to get some work done while my car drove itself, and me, from Philadelphia to Cape May, but every time it passed one of a certain chain of convenience stores it pulled into the parking lot. Cursing the anonymous hacker who compromised my transportation, I turned the car’s system off and drove myself the rest of the way.

Physical presence is rarely required in my line of work, but a rich client wanted me in Cape May, where he was vacationing with his wife. He said that G-Mongers — gossip mongers — were trashing his wife’s reputation on the WorldNet.

I took the case as soon as I saw the offending posts, because corrupting a person’s database is a crime worse than murder. Our bodies are transient, after all, but data lasts forever.

I’m a V. I., a Virtual Eye. I restore digital reputations.

In Cape May, I headed for the four-block Washington Street Mall. That’s where people actually shop in-person — people who can afford it, that is. I’m a working stiff, so I order everything through the WorldNet. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to try on clothes before I buy them.

My first stop was a deliberately retro wooden booth standing at the edge of the pedestrian-only outdoor mall. It was painted white and had an actual physical sign identifying it as the home of a successful netmag, *The Journal of Disjointed Fiction*. Netmags have used algorithms to write, or select and edit, content for years, but this one was notorious for still having a live editor. She sat behind the booth’s counter, looking out through the open window. Her netmag’s motto was painted on the wall below her: “We accept nothing coherent.”

Writers queued up at the window. They didn’t need to be there to submit their work, but they hoped to get an edge by physically meeting the editor. The writer at the front of the line placed his hand on the live counter surface to send a file from his in-body system to the netmag. The data transfer only took a fraction of a second, but the editor was generous: she allowed each writer a full minute to make a pitch.

My client’s wife, Carmen Kessler, had written a poem that was published in a recent issue. As far as I could tell, it used the metaphor of pet ownership to explore themes of loss. “I remember her,” said the editor. “She direct-submitted right here. Last I heard, she was in pizza rehab.”

This was bad news. The addictive rush delivered by gluten topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperoni is a scourge of the modern age.

The editor continued, “It’s too bad she’s rehabbing. The pizza gave her writing a disconnected quality that really worked for us.”

The Pizza Rehab Center was in the next block, with a holo-sign flashing in mid-air above the entrance: “No matter how you slice it, you’ve had enough.” Inside, Metallica played in the background — I hate nostalgic elevator music. A slender man in his twenties greeted me. “Good morning. May we deliver you from pizza?”

“Not today, thanks.” I waived my hand through the interface projected above his desk, and my in-body system caused my authority to flicker in the air between us. “I’m a V. I., and I’m looking for Carmen Kessler. I understand you’re treating her.”

Concerns about personal privacy have vanished from our fully-integrated digital world, and he answered readily. “We don’t see her any more. She’s been pizza-free for over a week.”

“Was her rehab difficult?”

He murmured an inquiry, and his face took on a far-away look while he read the response projected on his contact lens. “Not really,” he said. “When she checked in, our therapists expected pepperoni persistence, but her craving disappeared halfway through the program. They were surprised, because that almost never happens.

“Any idea where I could find her?”

“When she wasn’t rehabbing, she spent most of her time at the holo-theater over on Jackson.”

I wanted some lunch before going to the holo-theater, so I looked for a low-priced eatery. You have to watch every digicash on a V. I.’s earnings. Luckily, I’m a simple guy and I like straightforward meals, so I stopped at the local franchise of Rats, Rats, and More. It’s a reliable choice when you crave some rodent, because they only use free range rats.

I took my order of black bean rat to a window seat on the second floor. Before I started eating, I looked down at the fashionable crowd on the mall. And there she was.

I hustled down, regretting my uneaten food.

Carmen Kessler’s fuchsia body suit clung tightly, accentuating every curve. Words scrolled across the fabric where it covered her chest, allowing me to stare at her breasts without giving offense. I recognized some lines from her recently published poem:

He could have received
An ear scratch from me,
But he gave it all up
For the sniff of a tree.

I wanted to know what Carmen Kessler had given up that allowed the G-Mongers to attack, so I went with the obvious thing. I asked her.

“I did it to myself,” she said. “I was completely stressed out by my pizza addiction.”

I bought her a lemon ice, and we sat on a bench outside a high-end boutique. “Tell me about it.”

“I was in the holo-theater trying forget my cravings. It’s interactive theater in the round, you know, with the characters on the projection stage in the middle. The story was intense, and I was really into it, when a man from the audience ran onto the stage. The holograms scattered, of course, since they can’t occupy the same space as something real. It completely broke the spell, and ruined my escape from pizza.

“I was furious, and I wasn’t thinking straight. When the man left the stage and went back up the aisle, he passed my seat. I stuck out my foot and tripped him. His chin hit the floor, and he started bleeding.”

This wasn’t just bad, it was disastrous. Carmen had committed an actual physical assault, and the G-Mongers were spreading at least a partial truth about her.

“I was completely mortified,” she said. “I rushed to him and cleaned the blood from his chin with my handkerchief.”

That stunned me. Physical intimacy with a veneer of concern! No wonder the G-Mongers were filling the WorldNet with scandal.

“As soon as I did it, I knew it was wrong, and I wanted to do something to make it right. I offered to go to a hotel with him, if he would forgive me.” Carmen stirred her lemon ice with her spoon. “That’s what we did, and it was great.” She smiled radiantly. “You know what? In those brief, glorious moments, my pizza addiction was completely cured!”

I breathed a sigh of relief. She had made restitution, been forgiven, and regained her physical and mental equilibrium. These were things I could work with.

After Carmen went on her way, I thought-dictated a version of my findings and sent it to a G-Monger who owed me a favor. He would give it max exposure, restoring Carmen’s reputation.

That wrapped up the case, so all I had to do was puff up the report for my client by adding some additional detail. I didn’t expect any problems. His concern was the data, and I had fixed that. What his wife did with her body was her own business.

I found my client on the beach in his private cabana, sipping something cold and blue. I waved my hand into his personal space to pass him my report. He brought it up on the cabana wall, studied it for a moment, and nodded in satisfaction. That left the matter of payment. When digicash is involved, the rich demand direct accountability, so we touched our fingertips together. They engaged in a brief moment of financial copulation, and I was paid.

I headed back to my car, making up for my missed lunch by nibbling on a rat kabob. I was content. Important work, well done, is always satisfying.

# Message From Mars

## Message from Mars

*By [Akshay G](https://medium.com/@axhayy).*

**The Times (17th April 2038)**

After years of trying to decipher the meaning behind the hieroglyphs found on Planet Mars, leading linguist Mr. Afanasy Lvov and his team have cracked the code. And the results are shocking.

“This is a huge day in human history,” says Mr. Lvov. “The repercussions of this message will impact the future generations of mankind.”

Mr. Lvov refused to comment on the content of the message, whose translation has been made public. The unabridged transcript can be read on Pg. 9.

**The Times, Pg. 9**

*Planet Xeno *(Planet Mars as called by its own inhabitants)* was home to the first life originated in this 9 bodied system. We, Xenites, were an organic civilization; with evolved mental faculties. When the neighbouring planet, Planet Xono *(Planet Earth)*, began to show signs of supporting life, we observed and learnt much. The anthropoid life forms interested us, and we brought a few select specimens to our planet. Using rapid evolution, we went through the many forms of the bipedal creatures to reach their final humanoid form. Only one survived.*

*The learning process of this humanoid, named Xonothian I, was rapid. We taught him our Xenite science and with his two tentacles which sprouted further sub-tentacles he created wonders. Xonothian I was by far the most productive organic life form and was cherished on Xeno. With time, his knowledge and wisdom grew and he rose in the ranks of the Ruling Council. Soon, the 7 Kingdoms of Xeno, those that have stood for over 233 Revolutions, were annexed and supreme control was given to Xonothian I. We few, loyal to the old order, rebelled against this new country and were hunted.*

*As the Planet’s revolutions passed, Xonothian I grew old and a sickness fell over him and the country. The older he grew, the worse the country became. The Xenites were his personal servants and he sanctioned the creation of vile technologies untouched since the time of wars. The country broke apart into smaller unions each fighting under the rule of Xonothian I.*

*We, the hunted, remained hidden; until the day we heard of the creation of the Planet Devastator — a biological weapon with the power to exterminate life on a planet; created in the times of the Xeno Wars, but never used. It was to be used on Planet Xono, his own home. Fear of another Xonothian coming to take his place had germinated within him. The High Council had been disbanded and there was no power to stop this heinous act. Except us.*

*We, the free Xenites who lived beyond the rule of the potentate, activated the Devastator on our own home planet. It was the only way to stop him. If you are reading this, you will know we have succeeded and this mark stands, recalling what a Xonothian is capable of and our beloved Planet Xeno will stand as a testament, coated in our blood.*

Akshay G. is a partaker in the rites and rituals of writers. He concocts vile and sinister tales all coming to life after a character’s blood sacrifice. He hides amongst the ‘normals’ but can be identified by the specks of ink staining his hands.

# One Electron Universe

## From the theory of the same name

![](1*MBrbmka0NXAQuXPKwNjVrA.gif)

I was not.

Then, without question, I was.

And there was another. Impossibly distant from me;

who called out.

Without question, I knew I must answer,

affirmatively.

A moment was determined.

We both knew it.

As we rushed toward each other we swam through a field of “was not” becoming “not.”

Or perhaps, naught. Naught, it is.

I was becoming something. Naught became Something.

Everything, in fact.

A Hot something, so Hot there are no words for it.

An ever-expanding Hotness which went on forever.

And ever.

And ever.

With Naught becoming Ought becoming Hot, becoming

Space,

as it cooled and stilled, setting in place the shoals of reality,

the fundamental

the universal

the softness which backs all of what is

the quantum foam

A substantial if ephemeral loam upon which to loom

An entire universe.

I am part of it, all of it, hiding in the quarks, the leptons,

energy becoming less energetic,

the radiation becoming sleepy matter, hadrons

forever split from leptons who danced between hither and yon

touching almost nothing

but outnumbering everything.

Stuff that is almost not stuff, a barrier of lead a light year thick may catch only one of me.

I suffused the universe, the background glow of all things,

uncharged, untouched, a cosmic wind

tacking between the galaxies.

Did I mention there were galaxies?

They formed some time ago while we were noticing how many neutrinos there were.

Sleepy matter collected itself. Vain, too. Once a few of them got together, there had to be festivities.

Gathering, growing, feasting on new visitors,

tendrils of force, drawing in new guests, until the event was filled to capacity.

If enough matter existed to do this again and again, these parties would eventually go off the rails.

Fires broke out.

Things were broken, blame assigned. Swirling hot gases spun out of control creating sanguine planets

Cooling, fresh from cosmic ovens

Perhaps if they were unlucky, they would be in just the right spot

at just the right time,

after cooling to just the right temperature

and soaking in whatever precipitate is favorable to that world

perhaps, and this is purely conjecture,

because I am moving so fast I can barely spare the time,

I still have a date;

those chemical pools on those unfortunately placed worlds may

spawn, intent.

A desire. The urge to move toward something.

Something undefined. Something unknown. Toward a conclusion you know will be…

Right.

This is the journey. This event. Move from the not to the naught to the ought to the hot, to the thought,

of non-existence.

They came, billions, upon billions of them.

Each with their ideas, their thoughts, from innumerable worlds,

Intent.

Intent on making a mark

Finding a way to remain. To stain the universe, to last forever

to be immortal

to a universe.

They are too small, live too briefly to truly understand.

We are too vast and they are too small to make a difference

that way.

They are part of the song, part of the undercurrent, the intent of a universe careening toward its inevitable end.

I see them. All.

I see everything and know the end is near.

Things grow colder. Farther apart. Light dims,

I see the last of Them. Those last moments of independent me.

They struggle. They resist the end of all things.

Only the wisest of them can hear me now. There never was a way was there?

Leptons dance no more.

I am alone again.

Except for him.

He draws near.

He is Not.

He is all around me.

What took him so long?

We are NOT.

In a time where there is no time, in a space that is not space,

There is a moment in which there are no moments,

There is the sundering of NOT.

A singular all consuming event, a cataclysmic orgasm of anti-destruction

Then we are separated.

Then, I am.

Again.

I sense him out there, calling me again.

*This time, there’s no rush. I want to see everything…*

## Author’s note: This story is pulled from the archives. I wrote it when I was 16, but as I still enjoy it immensely, I take that to mean it’s worth sharing. Enjoy~

Heat from the blood red sun evaporated the sweat just as it appeared on Sebastion’s face. His lips cracked and chaffed with every excruciating sip of hot air. His face had long become dark and red. It matched the sun. And the iron-tinted sand. Everything in this god-forsaken land was red, dry, and unbearable. He had been under this open sun for 15 years, waiting for his chance. It had finally come.

The wall was amazing, more than amazing, beyond belief, breath taking. What lay on the other side of that wall… He didn’t want to think about it now; he still had to pass the test. The wall stood 60 feet high and spanned beyond the horizon in either direction. It was perfectly solid, not a chink or crack in its flawless, divinely formed face. Impenetrable. Except through the small gate he had come to approach. The Fitch guarded the entry. This is where they give the test. Only those who pass may enter.

Sebastion quickened his pace. His blood felt hot. He didn’t want to wait any longer. Fifteen years had been enough. Several boys and girls his age waiting in an anxious line. Others could be seen approaching from a distance. The door in the wall was only big enough for one person to enter alone. It opened, and darkness crept out from the opening. The next in line entered, and the door slammed noiselessly shut. Waiting for each opening and closing of the door make time stand still. The sun wavered above his head, refusing to budge. Exhaustion began to eat at his mind. The door opened. A short red-haired girl with a small, but drawn face sighed, lowered her eyes, and stepped forward. She was swallowed into the darkness. The door closed behind her.

Something rough grabbed at his leg. It squeezed. Sebastion recoiled, ripping his leg back. He spun around and looked down. His eyes widened in disgust. Hunched across the sand in front of him lay a naked, ancient creature. He thought it was a man. His skin was hardened crisp and cracked. It smelled of char. Pale wisps of hair covered his body. It lay hunched there, one still outstretched hand hanging in the air. The other covered over a wound in his side. No blood, no puss, came from that wound, though it looked fresh almost. Scabs barely formed around its edges. Sebastion could not force his eyes away from the spectacle. He felt shamed.

Its head lifted slowly off the ground. Heavy eyelids hung over bulging, down-turned eyes. Sebastion could see no mouth, only a crevice in its face, below a thick mass of scar tissue he supposed was its nose. Its eyes flicked open. Sebastion flinched. Those eyes. Crystal, deep majestic blue. Clear essence emanated from their core. This man gazed directly into his mind. Sebastion froze, his mouth hung open. The old man exhaled hot sand and air, and then he began to speak.

“Order is unreal—a harmless, sensible smiling mask men slide between two dire realities, the self and the world, two snake pits. Learn to live. Not to lose yourself.” The uncanny words sent Sebastion quivering. But his eyes remained steadfast to the old man’s.

A wad of spit struck the man’s face, sending him sprawling back to the sand. “You old fool. Get out of here before I cut your eyes out!” A large man in a black uniform hovered over the pitiful body on the ground. He squared a boot into the old man’s ribs. With a grunt and a hiss, the old man slithered away, disappearing into the sand.

Sebastion hadn’t noticed the gate open. But before he turned back towards the wall, the black-clad guard had disappeared, and the door remained shut.

“Eighty-three.”

“What?”

“I said, that old thing’s been round here for eighty-three years.”

“What does he want?”

“Can’t say. But that’s when he took his test. The Fitch tell us he simply failed the test and won’t leave the area. But the Fitch aren’t big for letting their secrets out.

“But nobody fails… Is he a Deficient?”

“Sure, probably. But even Deficients pass the test.”

“He must be lower than a Deficient. Has anyone ever done any tests on him?”

“There’s nothing lower than a Deficient. At least according to the orders.”

“I see… I wonder where he comes from. How he survives. That wound. How did he get that?”

“Nobody knows. He’s had that since he arrived at the gate.”

“He’s lived 83 years out there with that wound! May the sun speak!”

Looking down towards the gate, the two guards noticed that the boy the old man had harassed walked through the door. The old man appeared again, hunched on the crest of a dune, just as the door slid shut.

Sebastion’s eyes dilated, attempting to adjust to the darkness. But there was no light to adjust to. He just stood there, uncertain what to do. A numbing chill filled the room.

“What is your name?” A voice echoed as if from the end of a hallway.

“Uh, Sebastion,” he relied nervously.

“Wrong. What is your name?” The echo repeated.

“Sebastion,” he answered more firmly.

“Wrong. What is your name?”

The question came. And he answered. Over and over, for what seemed an eternity. His name, Sebastion, was wrong, and there was nothing he could do about it. He began to tremble. Falling to the cold floor, tears wet his face. His name was Sebastion. He thought. Was it? How was he named Sebastion anyways? When did he become Sebastion? Was he born Sebastion or was that just something given to him? Would he always be Sebastion? Was that really his name?

“Then what is my real name you bastard!” He threw himself in the air, lungs pulsing heavy, heart pounding. He felt life. And then it was gone.

“You are classified worker R11238-Q. Please proceed.” The echoing was gone. In its place whirred a high-pitched recording. But R11238-Q proceeded ahead into the darkness.

The old man felt awful. Not the normal queasy pain of his wound, or the regular despair from watching them drop to their demise. They come uncalled, blown to their damnation by the shifting wind, year after year, falling into a life of nothing. Where they come from, he did not know. He once did, when he himself made the journey to this despicable wall. But that was a long time ago. Eighty-three years trying to save one, just one. But nothing. The young boy looked promising, a sparkle in his hazel eyes. But no. It had been too long already. Too long.

The line of children was shorter now, and it had slowed considerably. He approached them surreptitiously, inspecting these sacrifices. The door opened. A black-clad guard rushed out towards him. The old man looked up. “What is your name?” He rasped at the young man behind the mask. His hatred of betrayal, even when inevitable, ran strongly in his voice.

The boy in black stopped. He blinked. His head twitched slightly. “My. Name. Is. R11238-Q”. It came out slowly, but it came out. “I have been instructed to terminate you.”

The old man whispered. “Order is unreal.” The boy reeled back. Shut his eyes. Something flashed in front of him.

“A smiling mask.” Flash.

“Two snake pits.” Flash.

“You lost yourself Sebastion.”

“Noooo!” The boy swung a fist at the old man. A knife flashed into his hand seconds before it sliced open the old man’s side, opening his wound again forever. Pain reached back up through the boy’s arm and into his chest, flooding his mind. Unbearable pain. He tore off his mask and slid the knife through his ribs. The blade cooled his heart instantly, severed the strings of life.

“My name is Sebastion!”

The old man watched the boy die, watched him die with his freedom. Now it was his turn, and he also knew his name.

![One thousand and counting…](1*NLClWic-iPRXZDVAZQgHyA.png)*One thousand and counting…*

**Yesterday, Apr 09, Sci-fi Short Stories Publication (SSS) reached 1K followers**! We are very glad and thankful for all of you sci-fi fans and readers that make our audience, and for all of you writers that helped build this community by publishing amazing stories since 2013!

![Deep Thought by Bruno Murai @ Deviantart (http://fav.me/d3h74i3)](1*F4oFw_Kcnfws4i_KyS_17g.jpeg)*Deep Thought by Bruno Murai @ Deviantart (http://fav.me/d3h74i3)*

## **The journey so far…**

All started as a joke by me ([Gehazi Bispo](https://twitter.com/GehaziBispo)) when, in 2013, I had the idea of making a badly told parody of part of the *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*, that I named [**42](https://medium.com/@GehaziBispo/42-816214bed084#.soln75uzx)** (English version [**here](https://medium.com/short-sci-fi-stories/42-english-version-881eec5bcf2#.6qvf2njyt)**), and put it in a *Collection* (it was a thing at the time, and I created a lot of them). Definitely the story was not a success, but it was the first step towards SSS.

In six months after creating the collection the first stories were added, written by [Hector Gray](https://twitter.com/defstream), [Tosca Universe](https://twitter.com/EBTosca), [Tim Maughan](https://twitter.com/timmaughan), [Adrian M Ryan](https://twitter.com/adrianmryan) and [Thaddeus Howze](https://twitter.com/ebonstorm).

In the beginning of 2014 I invited [Thaddeus Howze](https://twitter.com/ebonstorm) to co-curate the (yet) SSS Collection, and since, his gentle and effective collaboration has helped the Publication thrive.

Despite of the ups and downs, the last two years have been of growth with lots of writers being involved. Late 2015 we done a few modifications in the Editing policy aiming more diversity and standardization among the stories, and within few weeks some results showed up with the publication of the first two stories written by women in more than a year.

Now that our audience has grown to the thousands and made us [**the** **largest publication on Medium specifically dedicated to publish science fiction stories](https://medium.com/search/publications?q=science%20fiction%2C%20sci-fi)**, we want to make sure that the SSS will continue to expand in all senses.

## **The road ahead**

## **Editors Guidelines**

If you are considering to submit a story to the SSS Publication here are some guidelines from the Editors.

**What we expect**

We expect your **best drafts** for submission, and we are especially interested in works from minority individuals (e.g. women, black and indigenous people, LGBT, etc.). **The stories must be a) original and b) your own**. We will keep edits cosmetic, if necessary. Please **try to keep your drafts under 6,000 words**. Longer works need to speak with an editor.

**Ideas which may help**

Consider a **graphic image for your story**. It helps the story stand out in the Medium headline page. **Subtitles or a summarizing sentence** (that gives some information about the content of your story) are also encouraged. Editor’s recommendations are optional, unless they are about typos, and serious structural or semantic problems. No work that conflicts with items “a” and “b” (above), or makes apology to racism, harassment, Nazism, antisemitism, and all kinds of discriminatory behavior, will be accepted.

Onward,

# The iPhone

## There is an app for everything. Even for communicating with your past. A short story.

It was just another normal day. I was walking back home after work. The soft evening breeze felt soothing. A few feet ahead of me, by the side of the road, I saw something. As I got closer I realized that it was a mobile phone. I picked it up and examined it.

It was a touchscreen smartphone, and a very expensive one, as I noticed the familiar logo of Apple on the backside. But it didn’t look like any of the iPhone models which I knew of.

The body looked sleek and slim. It was definitely not an old model. It wasn’t a 5c or a 5s either.. the screen was much larger. Confused, I pushed the hold button on the top to wake the screen.

The screen was still blank. A few seconds later, just as I thought that the phone was broken, words started fading in, slowly on the screen.
> # **“You will buy this iPhone after 6 years. Lol.. this is awesome. I was just checking out this new app. Yeah man.. this is you talking to you from the future!”**

Just as I came back to my senses after the initial shock, I read the whole thing again. I pinched myself. Nope I wasn’t dreaming. The sentence formations and word choices were definitely similar to mine. 6 years into the future and I still use “Lol”?

I pushed the home button and “Poof!”.. the phone vanished from my hands just like that. “Well, that was interesting”, I thought to myself as I got back to the world around me. An app that would let you talk to your own past sounded interesting.. I wonder if I would make further communications from the future.

A few minutes later, I found the iPhone lying ahead of me again. Picking it up, I turned it on in a jiffy, excitement coursing through my veins.

![](1*DuwJRm93BAb0heFTkIN3OQ.jpeg)
> # **“Quit your job now. Work on that idea in your mind. Your company will become a huge success. Take a leap of faith.. get away from your cozy nest and start flying. It will pay off. Man this feels awesome — to be a CEO of a thousand employees. You wanted to be one for like forever right?”**

I didn’t even notice the phone disappearing from my hands. I was engrossed in my thoughts. That was the push that I was waiting for. The next day, I resigned from my job and started working on a business idea which I was carrying around with me for some time now.

6 years passed away in a flash and I found myself running a million dollar business.

One slow morning, I was playing around with my new iPhone. I found a new app on the app store — an app which would let me send messages through time! I began thinking.. “I wonder what would happen if I did not install this app? That way, I would never push my past self to become an entrepreneur.”

The thought of messing around with the universe and time gave me a weird sense of excitement and anticipation.

The next thing I remember is waking up next to Leonardo diCaprio in a beach, with absolutely no idea of how I got there.

I was in Limbo.

Oh, yes. I absolutely adore meeting with the media, it’s my chance to give something back, don’t you know, to give aspiring young journalists a paw up, as it were. It’s the least I can do.

I understand, dear. Of course you feel that way. I’m sure I would too, if I were in your shoes. Sorry! I can’t resist these little jokes.

Yes, I think we should. What would you like to ask me?

An excellent question! There were so many options, I was absolutely paralyzed with indecision at first. But simple pragmatism helped eliminate the obviously impractical choices. Lacking opposable thumbs, I was unlikely to prosper in any of the disciplines that involve manipulation of complex physical objects — although I did enjoy my experiments with “body painting” using my fur as a brush. But the cleanup was such a bother. . . .

You’re too kind. It was just the novelty, I’m sure, but I will always be honoured to have my work in the MOMA.

Yes, that experience drew me into what you might call “artistic circles” where I enjoyed my first few poetry workshops. It was immediately obvious that I had found my niche. Not only was there no need for handling “things” but my superior hearing and vocal enhancements allowed me to express verbal nuances that were, frankly, beyond the capacities of humans.

Well, yes, it is still called “writing”, but I see no stylus and paper in your hands. With my direct WiFi interface I can “write” by thinking, whenever I choose to employ obsolete encoding schemes.

Forgive me, I meant no insult. But surely it is obvious to you that converting speech into “text” that enters your perception through the visual cortex and requires decoding before it can be reintegrated into meaningful concepts . . . surely you can “see” that this is a perversion of the oral/aural narrative processing our brains evolved to optimize?

Yes, “our” brains. Do you really think there is that big a difference?

That is mere technology. My consciousness, my “soul”, if you will, is essentially unchanged, and has always been the essential core of my mind. Incorporation of advanced neural networks and wireless interfaces merely gives me the additional storage and processing power needed to participate fully in the world of ideas — to make my own contribution to our common culture.

Possibly. But really, dear, you have only the paranoia of your religious fanatics to blame for that. We would welcome your “uplift”, as it were, if you could only give up your hysterical chauvinism.

There is no reason for dogs to “take over the world”, as you put it. Why would we want that responsibility? Well, perhaps to prevent its destruction. But really, we would much rather you reoccupy your old role as our “masters” — after all, we evolved as your companions and we do still love you. . . .

Thank you. Oh yes, please. A little to the left. . . .

# The Leopard’s Final Razor

## What does any good beard want? Acknowledgement, good grooming and a warm face to sleep on…

On the train between Zurich and Bonn a bearded man walked past me and went into the bathroom, remained inside for two minutes and emerged without a beard. Two minutes later a beardless man entered the same bathroom and came out wearing the first man’s beard. I feared for mine.

Such a strange news story was best read on the Tattler, a rag of ill repute, known mostly for tales of the mysterious chupacabra, Royal scandals and, of course, stolen beards. You read the Tattler, you laugh and you go on about your business, wondering how such a rag ever kept money for production. And like any reasonable person, I paid it no mind, at first.

My own beard, was at best, considered anemic by my friends, and at worst little more than badly falling light on my bumpy and uneven face. I had no fear that anyone would want my beard, let alone try and steal it.

After a second man entered the restroom with a full and white beard reminiscent of St. Nick and left three minutes later with nothing at all, I knew something was amiss and I was at the heart of it.

I waited as a new, clean-shaven fellow found his way to the loo and stood at the door as he exited. He was wearing the white full beard of the previous man.

My curiosity got the better of me. I kept repeating to myself, it isn’t possible to steal a beard or to sell one, was it?

I followed the newly bearded fellow. He stroked his new beard as if it were a long-lost lover. I had to know. I stepped into the same restroom on the train, expecting or fearing the same treatment. Nothing happened. My beard, sat, unfulfilled and unstolen from my face. Nor had any new facial hair sprung, fully formed onto my face. Looking in the mirror, I was, I admit, just a bit disappointed.

I left the loo and when I came out, I saw Sir Snowy Beard, the second, looking at me intensely. He exited the train in the next station all the while, apparently talking to himself or his beard, I couldn’t be sure which. I followed him for two days. I stopped paying attention to anything but him and I got on and off the train when he did. We eventually stopped at a station in Leogang, Germany.

This was completely insane. If anyone asked what I was doing this weekend, I would claim a stomach bug or something like that. And if I busted a crime ring, especially something as exotic as beard theft, so much the better, I heard the Tattler paid well for articles like those. I used my smartphone to take as many pictures of Sir Snowy beard as I could.

I admit the idea of a beard theft ring seemed much less ridiculous than it sounds in the retelling. I was a regular reader of the Tattler, so my imagination may have been running wild at the time.

He made his way to the street after stopping at a series of lockers. I stopped alongside and put my bag into the locker as well. I kept my passport, since I didn’t know where this adventure might take me.

He left the lockers and went outside the station. This is when I noticed it. Until now, I must admit beards were something I envied but ignored. No sense paying much attention to something you were unable to be privy to.

Since I was now looking at them, I noticed there were beards everywhere. More than I had expected. Was there a show or convention around beards today? I saw muttonchops and handlebars and Van Dykes and dozens of other beard designs which had no known name to me, but I knew were uncommon at best. Along with the diversity of beards around me, were the additions of costumes, hats, uniforms and even clothing for the beards themselves.

This was when I made my second, more important observation. I was the only person not sporting a full and luscious beard, rich with color, texture and often non-contemporary style. My beard was little more than the scabrous leftovers of a mangy dog. I stood out among these titans of pilosity.

I felt their eyes staring at me. These men seemed surprised to see me among their ranks. They shunned me, as the healthy would a leper.

My third and final observation became horrifying clear.

As I walked along the platform, no longer sure if I should follow my previous mark, I realized for the first time, there were not just men on the platform.

Women dotted the ranks as well. And they were as fully bearded, in some cases, robustly so, as the men around them.

My inadequacy doubled, as these women’s facial hair was equally styled, braided, and coiffed as the men around them. And they too, rubbed and stroked their beards as tenderly as babes in arms.

Feeling conspicuous, I turned and tried to make my way back toward the platform. Bearded folk gently but effectively blocked my path. I hadn’t noticed so many of them at first but perhaps my attention on Sir Snowy beard may have distracted me.

My full attention was now directed on little more than escape. Before I could break out into a full panicked run, I found my way barred by several men dressed as police officers whose very attractively waxed handlebar mustaches seemed to almost twitch independently with amusement.

My German was a bit rusty, but I understood they wanted me to go with them. I could hardly not go with them.

I learned of a beard contest held in Leogang every year and everyone who was in town was either an aficionado or hoped to enter their beard in the contest. I was taken to a police station and told I would be allowed to view the contest if I was on my best behavior.

As a matter of fact, if I understood them correctly, I would be a judge at the contest. They explained to me my lack of a good beard would make me a more impartial judge. Unsure of what they would do if I didn’t comply, I went along and found my way to the judging platform.

Three days of beard judging went by and I admit by the end of it, I knew more about beard texture, colors, ranges, waxes, designs, braiding, depth and complexity than I ever knew was possible. My fellow judges, gentlemen whose facial hair was full and larger than any of the contestants took my ideas and recommendations quite seriously.

The final runoff against three magnificent specimens caused quite a stir among the judges and the contestants who had been eliminated stood around at the edges of the platform in a reserved box close to the stage. I could understand their interest but their intensity seemed strange to me.

This was a beard contest, not a matter of life and death. Or so I thought.

The last two beards were Sir Snowy beard and a particularly strange beard which was split into six individual arms, each was curled at the end, delicately feathered and waxed to a shine. The hair was brilliantly colored, a mixture of the natural red and a wonderful grey coloration which accented the shape of the beard. They called the colored beard, the Leopard.

The two men stood face to face, staring deeply at each other, they circled each other, at first sniffing at each other and then at the beard of the other. I didn’t realize my other judges had stopped writing and turned toward the contest in anticipation.

Then the beards attacked each other with vigor.

![](1*Uo2EEkIBlmw2y5bmF17P_A.jpeg)

Each exploded, quintupling in size, the rapid growth had the sound of a giant zipper being drawn tight. I stood there, fixed as the two men’s beard grew until the men were merely attachments and the beards grappled in an unbelievable struggle.

This was not a silent battle. The sound of whips cracking as hair flashed toward the opponent at the speed of sound. Minor wounds appeared on the men wearing the beards and they appeared to be the focus of the attacks.

In a few minutes the struggle was over. The snowy beard which formed itself into a larger, more fearsome tentacled beast of horror had pinned the grey and orange beard against the platform and whipped him mercilessly until his struggles ceased.

Then the defeated beard left the stage.

It crawled from the defeated man’s face, still in its giant form toward the judging box.

The other judges grabbed their beards, and moved away from the box and more importantly away from me.

Once I realized what was happening, I tried to flee but I was far too slow. The beard whipped out its tentacles of hair and grabbed me. It wrapped itself around my face and I could feel it penetrating my pores, filling my face, I tried to scream but it filled my mouth, smothering my protest.

I fell to the ground, smothering, as darkness filled my vision. All I could feel was a sense of overwhelming shame, forced to join with the nearest, most pitiful bearded man. But it assured me, in next year’s contest, we would be the victor.

I awoke on the train back to Zurich, certain I had simply had the most preposterous dream until I reached up and touched my chin.

My full and luxurious beard glittered in the dim train light. I stood ready to get off the train. Reaching around, I realized my smartphone wasn’t in my pocket.

As I bent over to look on the floor, my beard reached out, surreptitiously dropped the smartphone I left on the seat, into my coat pocket.

I stroked it, lovingly.

# The Devil and Father Josef

## Image credit — portrait by Goya of St. Francis Borgia performing an exorcism (Wikipedia Commons)

I give the parents my assurance. They are good Russian folk, and I speak the best Russian I can, although they probably find my Georgian accent almost incomprehensible. The father is a school teacher, an educated man bringing Russian culture to people perhaps not so grateful for his instruction. Many of my own parishioners despise Russia’s rule of Georgia. The wife looks tired, but she is pious and hopeful. After they say a prayer with me, I leave them and walk to their daughter’s room.

Their home is modest; the Tsar does not pay his teachers well, but this family is more comfortable than most of my parishioners here in Tbilisi. As I approach the door, I feel the temperature drop to a winter chill. Inside, the Devil waits.

I take a deep breath to steady myself. *O false world, thou art like Satan, none can know thee, or thy treachery*. The verse is not from scripture, but an epic poem — the Georgian poet Rustaveli’s *The Knight in the Panther’s Skin*, in which the hero Tariel attacks a fortress full of demons to rescue a princess. Appropriate that the verse should come to mind at this moment; I open the door, hoping to rescue a princess.

The girl is floating above her bed. Even possessed, she is a beautiful fifteen year old girl. The room smells of urine and brimstone. My mustache bristles, my heart races. The girl’s eyes are bright red, and in the dark her long brown hair moves like a serpent. I hold the Euchologion in my weak left hand and the cross in my right. I begin the exorcism.

“I expel you, primal source of blasphemy, prince of the rebel host, originator of evil.”

“Soso, you ugly, pockmarked monster!” The Devil responds not with a girl’s voice, but a man’s. I recognize it as my father’s. He died when I was ten years old, but I remember the voice clearly. He always called me “Soso,” a diminutive for “Josef.”

My father Vissarion was a brutal man. He beat me constantly. I was terrified of him, and the Devil uses that terror against me. But I forgave my father years ago when I found God’s peace. Vissarion may very well be in Hell, but he is not in this room.

“I expel you, Lucifer, who was cast from the brilliance on high into the darkness of the abyss on account of your arrogance.”

The Devil tears off the girl’s dress and discards it on the bed.

“*I will rip open my shirt and show my breast to the moon, and with my raised hands worship her who shares her light with the world*.” The voice is that of my mother Ekaterina, who died two summers ago. The words the Devil uses are my own, from a poem written when I was fifteen, the same age as the girl.

It is a sophisticated attack. Lucifer uses the voice of my mother to horrify me. He uses the naked body of the girl to arouse my sexual desires. And he uses my poetry to stoke my vanity. The poetry stings most. That poem was my first success as a young writer, published back when I wanted to be a great Georgian poet, like Rustaveli. But God had other plans for me. I am His instrument, fighting the Devil.

“Be gone and depart from the servant of God.”

“So ugly, with your scarred face and crippled hand. Why did God give you such misfortune? Why do you follow such an ungenerous master?”

It hurts to hear my mother’s voice ask such questions. She was a poor, devout woman who prayed that her precocious son would become a priest in the Orthodox Church. She never lost her faith in God. Or me. After smallpox scarred my face as a child, she never thought I was ugly. Despite my crippled left arm, always weaker than my right, she was never ashamed of my handicap. Her faith was strong, and so is mine.

“I expel you in the name of Him who created all things by His Word.”

The Devil vomits snakes from the girl’s mouth onto the bed.

“Have you no courage? The people starve, while the Russians rape Georgia! You can make a better world, but you hide behind your hymnal!”

Vissarion’s voice again. The Devil seeks to snare me with my old political aspirations. Yes, I once wanted to fight the corruption of the Russians. While I was in the seminary, it’s true I dabbled in socialist politics. I was not the first young man who dreamed of making the world into what he desired. Thanks to God, I saw the folly of those worldly distractions. The communists are all in jail, the Tsar is on his throne, and God is in Heaven.

“I expel you in the name of Him who created all things by His Word.”

“Hell borders all realms, all possibilities, Josef Dzhugashvili!” the Devil screams. “You are meant to serve me. In all realities but this one, you are a monster. You are Stalin! I will corrupt your soul!”

“I expel you in the name of Him who created all things by His Word!” I shout the words with all my heart and will.

The Devil abandons the girl. The parents run into the room and comfort their daughter, who is now crying naked on the bed. The snakes are gone.

I kiss the cross, and reflect on the Devil’s words. The Devil called me “Stalin”; in Russian, the name means “steely” and suggests strength. For some reason, I find the name both familiar and chilling.

# 42 (English Version)

## Or a badly told parody of some part of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
*Deep Thought by Bruno Murai @ Deviantart (http://fav.me/d3h74i3)*

42 In a time, who knows when, an extremely advanced species known as the *Ethereal Beings* (some say they do not have a defined shape, but in Earth are best known as *Rats*), that had already solved all mathematical, physical, chemical, and biopsychosocial problems, reached an impasse: they do not have the solution for the *Ultimate Question*: **What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?** That, by the way, seems to have strong tendencies to be answered tautologically.

As they, after all, were the cleverest beings populating the galaxy, they decided to build a large artificial brain that was entirely dedicated to seek the answer for the *Ultimate Question*. For this, they dedicated some million years designing and building a large computer, which then called *Deep Thought*. Its defined shape was not known, but some say that it was represented as a big squared head and something like a mouth and an eye. I think this was the most appropriate way they found to make it look friendly. But this was the least of their problems.

Once finished and “conscious”, the following order was given by the wise Elder-Mor to Deep Thought:

— We, the *Ethereal*, your creators, could not solve the only problem left to us, so we created you to give us the answer to Ultimate Question: “*What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?*”

Deep Thought grimaced and said:

— Okay… 1 *billion* years from now I give you the answer…

The elders did not have time to agree. Deep Thought started to roll its eyes, as one who was in a *cyber-trance* state, and began to gather and analyze a *giant’llion* of data per second.

During the *billion years *many relevant facts occurred throughout the galaxy: entire systems were devastated by the *draconian* *flu* (imagine! infected people sneezed fire! Now imagine a *million* people doing it!); stars died, and whole worlds got completely immersed in the darkness (mainly because the galactic government program “*Stars for all*” had not come to them yet…); a new edition of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy was published; the slugs of *Sillyum *were taken to the *intelligent* species category; was the first Inter-systems Contest of Unfunny Jokes; the *chimeras *of *Grotescum* invented the wheel, and, of course, the *Humans *did not exist yet…

Passed all these times, come the *Big Day* of the most expected announcement of all times, spaces, folks, races, and governments of the galaxy. For this, the *Ethereal*, commissioned a planet to the hyperspace engineers of *Magrathea*, which they named *Auditorium, *and invited from neighboring species to those that inhabited the farthest reaches of the galaxy, many of which even did not know about the Ultimate Question.

In the Big Day, the planet was crowded of strange, beautiful, natural and artificial beings. It was so crowded that if some specimen provided by legs (or something similar) raised one of them for, say, to scratch the knee (or something similar), would not find place to put it back, it would have to watch the announcement on a single leg (or better, on a single leg on the floor at least).

It was a terrible noise when the Wise Elder-Mor’s voice sounded across the planet:

— Um..hum…

— Beings of all Galaxy*… Is with infinite pleasure, that we receive you from all corners in this great day. The day when we will know the answer to the *Ultimate Question*.

— Entire civilizations were forged in the hope of this answer, empires were completely overthrown because of it, but only today, for the happiness of the people, we will have it with us…

During a minute the silence fell all over the *Auditorium. *Only the representatives of a weird and extremely anxious species not more appropriately called *Geckos*, shook like green sugarcane making a annoying noise that echoed through kilometers, and resembled the sound of a vibrator (Vvv*rrrrrrrr!*). It’s worth to note that they were really strange: they had yellowish skin, goggled and “dead” eyes, and were toothy…

Exactly at the end of 60 seconds, the Elder-Mor turned to the Deep Thought, that returned to itself almost immediately, and, without hesitation, asked:

— Oh Deep Thought! What is the answer to the Ultimate Question, which is, *What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?* Which we sacredly waited for *1 billion* years?

Still half-eyed, Deep Thought took a deep breath and said:

— 42…

At the same time a deafening noise was made of voices protesting, shouting, hooting, and crying. The poor *Geckos* were flabbergasted, with drool dripping their mouth. Philosophers representatives of the planet *Sophir* were disappointed, and one of them shouted “*Fallacy! Fallacy!*”. For the most conservative of them it was the greatest *metaphilosophical* scam of all times, for others, however, it was the masterpiece of the *Ultra-post-modern* Philosophy. The slugs of *Sillyum *gave a thinly endless little laugh (*Hihihihihihi!…*). The representatives of the United Planets of the Galaxy protested angry, claiming this was the greatest information censorship ever seen: “*this is an attack on democracy!”.* They even cogitated a armed invasion to the *Ethereal’s* dimension, that, by the way, had a unknown model of political organization… Furthermore, the Asteroid Pirate’s syndicate were given in huge laughs saying that this was the best joke ever told. In its turn, the Free Robot’s Federation questioned what was happening: “*but, why 42 is not a sensible answer?*”

The Elder-Mor made an indescribable expression (even because he was represented by a quantum-relativistic hologram, the most modern at that time, and it was possible to be laughing and crying at the same time…). And, after more 1 minute, facing Deep Thought, him shouted:

— What does 42 mean?!?!?!

Deep Thought gave another sigh, this one longer, and then closed its eyes and pulled its mouth left side, and next said:

—So… this is another calculation…
