# I Can’t Live Without&#58; Calm

## Why the blue meditation app works so well

![](<|image|>)

Like any true Texan, I got hooked by Matthew McConaughey.

“How often do we really feel what’s happening within and around us?” he asks in that all too familiar drawl, his words spaced a little too far apart. The story he tells is called “Wonder,” and it’s one you aren’t supposed to finish. This is a story meant to put you to sleep, a bedtime story for adults. It’s featured on the homepage of the [first billion-dollar wellness app](&lt;|url|&gt;): Calm.

My therapist recommended the app to me in early December during a particularly stressful work experience. For weeks, I ignored her. I had tried other meditation apps she suggested over the years, only for them to feel like they were another obligation I couldn’t get right, like exercise or taking my antidepressants. But Calm followed me around the internet after her recommendation. I saw ads for it on Instagram and while streaming television. In early February, my therapist mentioned that Matthew McConaughey read a bedtime story on the app — and I caved.

Calm is the top-grossing health and fitness app on iOS and 20th highest grossing overall. It was [declared a unicorn company](&lt;|url|&gt;), valued at just over $1 billion shortly after I downloaded it. The company says it has more than [40 million downloads and 1 million paid subscribers](&lt;|url|&gt;), of which I am one.

Using the app is, yes, calming. Between clicking on the app and reaching the homepage, there is an intentional moment spent on a gradient blue screen that reads “take a deep breath.” At first I thought this was my phone being slow, but the more I engaged with the app, the more I realized this screen functions as a kind of transitory space to give your mind a moment to recognize that you are seeking calmness, that tranquility requires time.

So much of what makes the Calm app work is small like this. It is intentional because it is asking you to be intentional. The app’s basic functions are free. For $12.99 per month or $59.88 for a year, paid users unlock seven- and 21-day programs that target specific issues — stress, anxiety, self-esteem, happiness — as well as the sleep stories, often narrated by celebrities. I paid for the app almost immediately to listen to Matthew McConaughey, but many of the pieces I use most frequently are available for free. The paid tier, in my opinion, is worth it for the background focus music alone.

At its most basic, the Calm app is all about daily meditation. A peaceful river plays in your headphones, and a soothing voice guides you to sit up straight, become aware of your body, and breathe, slowly. This basic guided meditation is 10 minutes long—uncomfortably long for my first 10 tries or so. But it eventually became a manageable amount of time I could easily squeeze in between phone calls or after my morning coffee. The narrative interjections are not jarring and are frequent enough to recenter me from distraction.

In one morning meditation this week, the narrator introduced a Welsh word, *hiraeth*, meaning a nostalgia for a place one cannot return to. This two-minute speech was part yoga class introduction, part trendy evangelical pastor, and part kitsch. But it came across as earnest—a gentle, helpful reminder to be gracious.

Once you have completed one guided meditation, the app shows you a calendar featuring your “longest streak,” or the number of days meditating in a row and total time spent in meditation. This is the only mild gamification of meditation. There are no points to accrue, no levels to unlock, no contact integration to race your friends.
> # This small corner of the app is meditation at its most simple: the flow of breath in and held and out again.

I have never enjoyed gamified apps and actively (whether out of rebellion or stubbornness) rebel against them. Whenever my streak gets too high on Duolingo, for instance, I will intentionally break it and choose another form of language learning instead. I do not want to be told to meditate or learn a language or drink water by my app; I want to learn to want to do it on my own, to reach for what the app can bring me without needing competition to do it. Where Calm shines is in its reassurance that this effort to breathe is enough on its own. Meditation alone, you alone, it seems to say, is reward enough.

Many of the guided meditations allow you to pick your time to focus: anywhere from five to 30 minutes. I found the ones focused on walking to be particularly helpful. Instead of listening to a podcast or music, I will sometimes find myself following a guided meditation to walk, noticing the small buds on a tree, the uneven bricks on the sidewalk, the shadows of leaves trembling.

Yes, there are many apps to guide you through meditation, Headspace being the most well-known. I found Headspace more intimidating to begin, and it’s more focused on longer meditation. Calm attempts to offer more than that. In its “Music” tab, Calm offers long ambient sounds to play in the background. I listened to the exclusive ambient album commissioned from Moby while responding to emails last week and found it soothing and more sonically interesting than many of the ambient albums offered on Spotify. The sleep stories are a nostalgic comfort. It is so rare to be read aloud to as an adult and so enjoyable to drift off to sleep in the midst of a good but not too good story.

My favorite part of the app, though, is one that isn’t prominently displayed on the homepage. Click “More” in the bottom right corner, and you’ll see the option to “Breathe.” Sometimes you don’t need the nature background and the celebrity names and the narrator guiding you. Sometimes the need to feel peace is more urgent, and here in this space is the answer.

This small corner of the app is meditation at its most simple: the flow of breath in and held and out again. A blue circle and gentle tone guide you through mindful breathing.

Calm is an easy app to use, no matter how difficult meditation may be. Matthew McConaughey may have sold me on it, but he’s not what keeps me opening the app when I’m stressed. I keep opening it for that simplest reminder of all: just to breathe.<|endoftext|>

# Privacy Is the New Digital Divide

## Keeping your data secure is becoming a luxury good — and the poor risk becoming second-class online citizens

![Illustration: [Scott Gelber](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Scott Gelber](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

The modern understanding of personal privacy was first defined in the landmark 1890 essay “[The Right to Privacy](&lt;|url|&gt;).” Its authors, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis (the latter of whom eventually joined the Supreme Court), were wealthy American lawyers concerned about how the paparazzi of the time were deploying a powerful new technology called a camera. “Recent inventions and business methods call attention to the next step which must be taken for the protection of the person,” they wrote. “Instantaneous photographs” and “numerous mechanical devices” threatened to gather and disseminate individuals’ personal information. In response, they argued that everyone had a “right to be let alone.”

The Warren-Brandeis essay is notable for broadening the legal concept of privacy to include the more nebulous sense of what our personal privacy really feels like. Their argument has only become more relevant over the nearly 130 years since. The power and ubiquity of the internet has birthed privacy infringement on a scale that would have been unimaginable to the Victorians. The [2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal](&lt;|url|&gt;) revealed that the personal data of 87 million Facebook users was used to design psychologically targeted news and propaganda campaigns to sway voters in key elections in the United States, the U.K., and Mexico.

But that scandal can be seen as just one brick in a wall of mistrust that has built up between citizens and the technology they use, especially when the service, like Facebook, makes money by selling advertising targeted to its users.

In response, a new wave of companies is monetizing the new opportunity of offering paid-for services with heightened privacy. The “right to be let alone” is now a right that can be paid for. [Gartner](&lt;|url|&gt;) forecasts that worldwide spending on consumer security software will reach upwards of $6.6 billion in 2019. These services include Safe Shepherd, a privacy protection service that scrubs user information from marketing databases; TrustedID, which helps to detect risk of identity theft and control the use of personal information; and myriad startups offering encrypted email, messaging, and browsers. In 2014, one [*New York Times](&lt;|url|&gt;)* columnist spent more than $2,200 in a single year trying to protect her privacy through a fleet of such services.

But there’s a problem. These services reflect the increasing value of privacy, not as a right, but as a luxury good. Privacy is an extra, something to be opted into and paid for. And those who keep using “free” advertising-supported platforms — because they don’t understand the risks of giving away personal data or can’t afford to pay extra for privacy — are finding themselves on the wrong side of the new digital divide.

This kind of effective discrimination against low-income communities is nothing new, and neither is invasion of their privacy. Welfare claimants in the United States can be subjected to unannounced searches and interrogations, including invasive surveillance, urine-sample drug tests, and DNA testing of their children. The implication is that the poor are expected to give up their privacy to receive basic services. And the internet — despite promises of neutrality and equality — proves to be no refuge from this rule.

“No laws prohibit poverty discrimination” says Michele Gilman, a law professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law and one of the authors of the [2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) “Privacy, Poverty, and Big Data: A Matrix of Vulnerabilities for Poor Americans.” “The potential harms of this privacy bargain are more perilous for low-income people,” she says. “People who live in poverty are subject to targeting due to their economic status, such as for predatory financial products or predatory educational programs. And due to their digital dossiers, they can lose opportunities for housing, employment, and education when landlords, employers, and schools are conducting screenings and associating poverty with undesirable traits.”
> # The vulnerabilities low-income communities face online are changing.

The study concludes that “anti-poverty advocates are rightfully concerned that the digital world will replicate, if not reinforce, both covert and overt patterns of surveillance.” “A right to be let alone is important in the sense that we all need some autonomy in determining how much of ourselves to share with the public,” Gilman says. Her work is reinforced by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web who, last November, proposed a “[contract for the web](&lt;|url|&gt;)” that would establish clear norms, laws, and standards to underpin the internet. That would include a fundamental right to privacy.

Gilman thinks social media companies could soon offer options for users to [pay for increased privacy](&lt;|url|&gt;), while still providing free services for those who surrender their information. This option, she says, “will further the divide between the privacy haves and have-nots and exacerbate economic inequality.”

It isn’t just poor Americans; entire populations have been preyed on. In 2015, Facebook launched Free Basics (formerly Internet.org), a mobile app that offered free internet access to users in developing countries. Facebook promised to help people get online by offering stripped-down version of Facebook, Wikipedia, ESPN, and others.

But a 2017 Global Voices [report](&lt;|url|&gt;) found different motives for Free Basics. The app actively urged users to sign up and log into Facebook, and it divided third-party services into two tiers, giving greater visibility to one set of information over another. User activities were channeled through Facebook servers, generating yet more banks of consumer data in the process. Facebook wasn’t introducing people to an open internet — it was plundering the next data frontier in emerging markets outside the United States.

Facebook responded by claiming the Global Voices study did not reflect the experiences of millions of people who had benefited from the service, but by that point, Free Basics had already been labeled as “[digital colonialism](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

The vulnerabilities low-income communities face online are changing. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg posted a [3,000-word manifesto](&lt;|url|&gt;) outlining his plan to make Facebook more “privacy-focused.” Between the usual personal homilies and meditations, he described the company’s plan to push users toward encrypted private messaging and away from the news feed.

“As I think about the future of the internet,” Zuckerberg wrote, “I believe a privacy-focused communications platform will become even more important than today’s open platforms. Privacy gives people the freedom to be themselves and connect more naturally, which is why we build social networks.”

[Critics](&lt;|url|&gt;) say the move amounts to little more than rear-guard corporate defense. Facebook faces high costs and regulatory hurdles in its attempts to remedy its recent debacles. [Some](&lt;|url|&gt;) think that by merging data between its different messaging apps, as planned, Facebook is effectively shielding itself from looming antitrust authorities, and that pulling users into a closed network with end-to-end encryption would exempt it from moderating the fake news, propaganda, hate speech, and vaccine misinformation its platform disseminates.

“I would be very pleased if it was real and true, but there’s a lot of skepticism associated with [this move toward privacy],” says Ann Cavoukian, who leads the Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence at Ryerson University in Toronto. The growing digital privacy divide is disturbing, but as Cavoukian points out, what’s most alarming isn’t that privacy is becoming a luxury commodity, but that it’s considered a commodity in the first place. “The norm shouldn’t be that you have to protect it just like you have to put a wall around your house,” she says. “The house belongs to you. The information belongs to you, and they shouldn’t just take it at a whim.”

Back in 2007, Cavoukian was invited to Facebook’s headquarters to speak to Mark Zuckerberg and Chris Kelly, the company’s first chief privacy officer. She says the company then appeared genuinely committed to privacy. Cavoukian believes the business model changed when Sheryl Sandberg [joined Facebook from Google](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2008 as chief operating officer.

“They went in the direction of ‘we’re going to make a lot of money,’” she says. “And then privacy tanked.”<|endoftext|>

# The Legacies of Apollo 11

## A personal perspective on Apollo 11, and restoring the American Dream

![Aldrin Gazes at Tranquility Base. Source: NASA](<|image|>)*Aldrin Gazes at Tranquility Base. Source: NASA*

My grandfather Abe Gussowski was born in a *shtetl* near what is now the Poland-Lithuania border, a couple of years after the Wright brothers flew their first powered aircraft. He survived more than a decade after the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. Struggling from immigrant child, to the Merchant Marines, and then to mechanic at the aeronautics division of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation — a direct descendent of Orville and Wilbur’s original company — Abe might have had some gear-and-grease sense of what it took to get men to the moon and back again. It left him awestruck, if not actually disbelieving.

Abe’s version of the moon landing is a story of the American Dream fulfilled. Like the Manhattan Project, one of the ushers of the American Century, it was a dream of the technological sublime hitched to an arch political cause. The American Dream had more or less worked for Abe. He and my grandmother Sylvia rose out of poverty in the New World while my grandmother’s relatives were turned to ashes in the Old World. Neither were educated beyond the 8th grade. Abe and Sylvia raised a son — my father Herb — who became part of an educational elite at Union College and then Yale Law School, a meteoric rise from Paterson, New Jersey.

I was born just a few years before the moon landing, and it is one of my earliest memories. I watched the two, fuzzy, black-and-white bobbing moon men on the cathode-ray TV screen. Witnessing this event — happening at some unimaginable distance, and occurring only through the use of some unimaginable technologies, and with the purpose of some unimaginable genius and commitment — was important to us. I would only later learn the names of the intrepid Armstrong and Aldrin, and the forsaken Collins (and still later the story of the “hidden figures”), but I diligently followed the rise of the Space Shuttle program, even building a model of the Enterprise atop its Boeing 747 for a school science fair. Together with the environmental movement, the energy crisis, and biotechnology, the tumultuous advance of the space program in the mid-1970s set me on my intellectual pathway to studying science and technology policy.

There are shadows of this story, however. My father, Herb, remembers going to the movies with his parents in 1948, to see the film *All My Sons*. Abe groused about going because he knew that playwright Arthur Miller drew his story of greed, disregard, and dereliction from Curtiss-Wright. Abe had been proud to help keep the machines turning, machines that supplied the Allies in World War II with huge numbers of storied aircraft, including the P-40 fighter of Flying Tigers fame, and the C-46 cargo plane that flew “over the hump” of the Himalayas. But the Curtiss Aeronautics Plant also delivered defective engines to the U.S. military. The episode led to investigations, convictions, and court martial, as well as to Miller’s first commercially successful play and its film version.

Damaging to public perception, and to the morale of workers like Abe, Curtiss-Wright’s malfeasance was not the reason for its steep, post-war decline, which happened for a more prosaic reason: Curtiss-Wright did not keep up technologically. It failed to invest in R&D sufficiently to win the federal contracts that moved their competition into the Jet Age, and then into the Space Age. The company whose engines powered the DC-3 and the B-17 Flying Fortress closed plants and laid off workers. Abe was lucky enough to make it beyond 10 years of service to a voluntary retirement. The Curtiss-Wright Corporation survives — firms are near-immortal persons after all — but it never recovered its wartime scale or prowess.

Meanwhile, my father’s trajectory had leveled off a bit. He found that the white-shoe law firms who would typically hire Yale alumni were not willing to hire Jews. Some of the interested firms thought that with blue eyes and an Anglicized name like Guston, he could pass. (It had been the same in pledging fraternities in college. When he was tapped into a traditional fraternity, he asked if he could bring other Jewish and Black friends with him. He was denied.) Early in his career, he had an opportunity to follow a Yale professor into the Kennedy administration. He turned down this chance to homestead the New Frontier — the broad label for Kennedy’s ambitious policy agenda — for family reasons. He went on to a family law practice and the relative stability and comfort of the professional class, with a tinge of bitterness and regret at doors that were closed to him or those that he chose not to open.

The Apollo program didn’t push beyond its success either. I can’t say that I watched any of the other five moon landings. My only memory of the drama of Apollo 13 is via Ron Howard. I do, however, have explicit memories of Watergate headlines, coloring a depressingly monochromatic map of the 1972 election, and questions about why anyone would vote for that crook. I have memories of other black and white images from the nightly news. For me, the images might have been from as far away as the moon, but for others they were mortally close. I seem to remember there were names of people scrolling down the TV screen — boosted now with a clothes hanger rather than its rabbit ear antenna — names that were not the credits but the casualties.

While going to the moon (and safely returning) had been an inspiring challenge, when it finally happened many took it as a distraction, not just from Vietnam, but also from the riots ravaging American cities. The recent film [*First Man* (2018)](&lt;|url|&gt;), about Neil Armstrong’s experience and emotions preparing to rocket to the moon, portrayed some of the protests at the periphery of his vision. The questions encroached: How could we spend billions on Apollo while our cities burned? How could we marshal the commitment and the expertise for the moon when we were failing in the ghetto?

50 years after Apollo 11, the United States has decided to revisit the moon with a program eloquently named Artemis. The moon is only her first target, however, and Mars is the true quarry. (This may have been what President Trump meant when he [tweeted](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the moon is part of Mars.) Beyond the moon, NASA has a spectacular agenda of exploration: the Mars 2020 rover; the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission; the mission to Psyche, the metal asteroid; and the recently announced Dragonfly mission to Saturn’s moon, Titan.
> # While going to the Moon (and safely returning) had been an inspiring challenge, when it finally happened many took it as a distraction, not just from Vietnam, but also from the riots ravaging American cities.

Unlike 50 years ago, the United States will not be alone out there. While the Soviets led the United States in most of the important technical achievements in space through the 1960s — human flight, for example, and space walks — they abdicated the moon. At the moment, however, the United States remains captive to the Soviet [Soyuz](&lt;|url|&gt;) system to put astronauts into space. Even the 50th anniversary launch on July 20 will be aboard a Soyuz MS-13, from Kazakhstan to the International Space Station.

This situation, extant since the end of the shuttle program in 2011, should change soon, courtesy of private space ventures in collaboration with NASA. But whenever we return to the moon, we will find a Chinese lander on the far side, along with debris from a privately funded Israeli mission and other lunar explorations by countries including India, Germany, Russia and others.

The problems from which Artemis and these other missions might distract us are numerous and grave. We rarely talk about “the ghetto” as a place any more, even as racism and its human and economic legacy persist. We are now confronted with camps detaining refugees and immigrants under horrendous conditions on U.S. soil. The global environmental movement that was born along with the Space Age has receded from its own apogee in the Paris accords. Indeed, the surpassing of “[planetary boundaries](&lt;|url|&gt;)” of sustainability and the intractability of collective action has only fueled the rhetoric to “get off this rock.”

My son Sam was born in 2006. It wasn’t a particularly auspicious year in space, save for the launch of NASA’s New Horizons mission. It was the fastest spacecraft ever launched from Earth and rendezvoused with Pluto in 2015. Sam had, by then, passed through his Mars rover stage and, although he thrilled to the images of Pluto, he is more taken by earthbound concerns like climate change. He expressed his sense of the retrograde election news the next year, after presidential electoral counting was completed on November 9, with “worst birthday ever!”

If NASA and the rest of the world’s space agencies are to capture the imaginations and talents of my son’s generation, they will have to succeed in ways that they have not yet. In this sense, the challenge is preventing Artemis from becoming the unfortunate twin of Apollo.

NASA puts significant effort into education and engagement, but more needs to be done. We should wonder about how to make Artemis more tangible and experiential to a vast number of people across our country and around the globe. This is not to say that space exploration must always return concrete benefits, although that would be a good thing. But it is to say that the program has the potential to alienate people for whom the technological endeavor has not panned out. We must work hard to make Artemis not just awe-inspiring, but knowable, relevant, inclusive, and legitimate. I believe this is crucial to any hope we might have of it contributing to the endurance of my grandfather Abe’s American dream.

We should remember that Kennedy’s charge to go to the moon was one among several priorities: “We choose to go to the moon… and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Returning to the moon will be hard. Returning to the promise of technology and the American dream will be harder.

# The Global Attention Span Is Getting Shorter

## This is the consequence of information overflow

![Illustration by [Benedikt Luft](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration by [Benedikt Luft](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

It’s not your imagination: keeping up with the sheer amount of content that’s available today — whether it’s Twitter, the news, or the latest show on Netflix — is getting harder. As a result, the length of time that content remains popular — a rough measurement of the global attention span — is decreasing, according to a recent large-scale analysis [published in *Nature Communications](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

The authors evaluated a total of 43 billion tweets and analyzed the top 50 trending hashtags in the world every hour on the hour, from 2013 to 2016. They then calculated the time the hashtags remained popular and found that in 2013, a hashtag remained in the top 50 list for an average of 17.5 hours, but the figure had dropped to 11.9 hours by 2016.

This attention contraction isn’t just a product of the internet. For instance, the researchers analyzed how long certain words and phrases remained fashionable in 100 years of literature made available by Google Books. They found that catchy terms were used in books for an average of six months in the 19th century, but only stuck around for a month by the 21st century.
> # “I think a lot of people are feeling a kind of exhaustion with all the things that you have to keep up with.”

“The public interest is getting saturated quicker with one topic because there’s more content produced in the early stages of a trend,” says study co-author Philipp Lorenz-Spreen, who studies modern information systems at Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany. For example, in the 1980s, a blockbuster film — defined as a steep increase in ticket sales from one week to another — was released on average every four months, but that time has shrunk to between one and two weeks in 2018, according to the study.

This means that we are becoming interested in trends more quickly, but are also losing interest in the same content more swiftly, says Sune Lehmann, another study co-author, who is a physicist and mathematician at the Technical University of Denmark. The only media sources whose content isn’t becoming unpopular more quickly, according to the study, are scientific research papers and Wikipedia.

“I think a lot of people are feeling a kind of exhaustion with all the things that you have to keep up with,” Lehmann says.

But he speculates it will be difficult for companies to adapt to the increasing pace of social systems if they also aim to make a profit in an attention-driven economy. “The problem, as I see it, is that there are aspects of experiencing rapidly incoming news that are exciting and exhilarating,” he says. “Any site that sells ‘slow news’ needs to deal with the fact that it is challenging, difficult, and sometimes boring to deeply understand a complex problem.”

One implication of a short public attention span may be that it’s harder to hold people accountable, says Lorenz-Spreen. For instance, he explains that it may be increasingly difficult for journalists to conduct in-depth research for news stories due to pressures to break news stories first, and the knowledge that news stories have a short shelf life. And any issued corrections or clarifications might be less likely to reach readers because they’ve likely moved on to other content by the time mistakes are noticed and fixed.

Lorenz-Spreen thinks communication needs reshaping to help people deal with information overload. One intervention, he says, might be to shift journalistic norms away from novelty and towards quality — stories with more background research, or other journalistic news values.

Sebastián Valenzuela, a journalism and mass communication scholar at the University of Wisconsin Madison who was not involved with the study, says institutions, such as governments, are not ready for such fast turnaround. In the scientific world, he says, it may be risky if researchers actively choose to study trendy topics that hit the headlines, but aren’t as important as other pressing issues that demand more time and effort.

For Valenzuela, the silver lining of a shorter collective attention span is that it means individuals, who previously found it harder to contribute to public discourse, can now attract attention more easily. “The traditional gatekeepers of culture, news, and information are losing power.”

But he doesn’t think the issues of faster turnaround and shorter collective attention spans can necessarily be fixed. What’s needed, Valenzuela says, is for institutions to be more flexible and adaptive. “Organizations need to invest more heavily in technology and human capital to filter and process information,” he adds. “If technology is the culprit of information overload and attention volatility, technology is also part of the solution.”<|endoftext|>

# The Next Blockbuster Drug Might Be Made in Space

## The Next Blockbuster Drug Might Be Made in Space

### Microgravity could be an ideal environment for cancer drug research

![Credit: NASA/Roscosmos](<|image|>)*Credit: NASA/Roscosmos*

Nearly a decade before the first space shuttle left Earth, NASA wanted to make drugs in space. In a 1970 internal document, the agency suggested that the microgravity environment of space could be conducive to manufacturing and testing the efficacy of different kinds of pharmaceuticals.

Gravity poses logistical challenges for scientists working in the lab. On Earth, heavier materials sink to the bottom of test tubes and often clump together. In microgravity, however, the proteins that are needed to create medicine overcome these challenges and can grow freely. When working with proteins and cells in space, the purity of experiments can increase.

When the United States’ shuttle program was first proposed, the plan was to launch as many as 50 flights a year. The cost of this ambitious idea needed to be justified. It was suggested by NASA that perhaps astronauts working on the shuttle could work on a cure for cancer. Or discover a treatment for Parkinson’s. The possibilities were endless.

In 1982, NASA partnered with McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing). McDonnell Douglas designed a machine to test a process called electrophoresis, which is a way to separate macromolecules when studying DNA and RNA. Early results suggested that the space environment would make the experiment purification processes more efficient.

Rather than having NASA astronauts test the company’s machine, McDonnell Douglas proposed to NASA that the company send one of their own employees to work on the shuttle. Surprisingly, NASA said yes. Charlie Walker, the chief test engineer who helped build the machine, was selected, and became the first civilian to go to space. He recalls the company’s confidence in their research: “We took [the results] to NASA and they said if the company is willing to invest in [sending me to space] then we are willing to partner,” he tells Medium.

With two flights to space, Walker made history, but shortly after, in 1986, the Challenger shuttle exploded, killing the crew onboard. As a result of the devastating loss, private companies, that initially wanted to send their employees into space for research purposes, pulled back.

But today, the International Space Station (ISS) is fully operational, and typically has six members aboard who spend their days doing scientific research, like the testing of medical equipment, 3D printing, and even growing plants. Drug discovery is also now back in action.

In 2018, a company called Angiex Inc. was one of the lucky private drug companies to send an experiment up to the station. The principal investigator of the Angiex experiment, Shou-Ching Jaminet, is a molecular biologist and former researcher at Harvard Medical School. She’s studying the effects that microgravity has on endothelial cells, the types of cells that line our blood vessels.
> # “Part of the motivation… is driven by the need to understand whether a mission crew could make their own drugs in space, if needed.”

In space, blood vessel cells don’t grow as well as they do on Earth, which might explain why astronauts have higher rates of cardiovascular problems. Angiex is working on a cancer therapy drug that destroys blood vessels in tumors. “We wanted to see if endothelial cells in microgravity are spared by our drug,” says Jaminet. Their research has implications for cancer treatment on Earth, and to help maintain the health of astronauts in space.

“Most other cell types are not that sensitive to microgravity… but blood vessel cells are different and that might explain some of the observations of astronauts health,” says Jaminet. “[Like why] they have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, even though they are generally healthier than the rest of us.”

She and her team got to watch their drug testing experiment live when astronaut Dr. Serena M. Auñón-Chancellor conducted it on board. Angiex only recently received their experiment results and the team is still in the middle of analyzing the data, but so far, Jaminet says they are pleased with the process.

Not everyone is confident that there’s money to be made in manufacturing drugs in space. “I don’t believe in any of it,” says John Logsdon, a space historian and former member of NASA’s advisory council. “I’m a skeptic that there is a pot of gold related to microgravity research. There are other commercial things to do with space but this particular idea has been tested enough to suggest that it is not really true.”

Others disagree. “I definitely think it’s cool and necessary,” says Walker. “I believe there will be numerous successes in our pursuits in terms of medical research and even corporate research.”

Ken Savin, director of the Center For Advancement and Science In Space (CASIS), which manages the ISS U.S. National Laboratory, agrees. “These companies are doing experiments and looking at research that they just couldn’t do on earth,” he says. Sure, research facilities on Earth try to mimic lesser gravity’s effect on cells, but ultimately if you really want to know what your experiment will be like in microgravity, you have to go to space.

Even if space-based drug discovery doesn’t turn out to be profitable, there remain benefits. Drugs stored on the space station have a much shorter shelf life than those stored on Earth, and only so much stock can be placed on a spacecraft. Part of the motivation for allowing pharmaceutical research to continue on the ISS is driven by the need to understand whether a mission crew could make their own drugs in space, if needed. Long-duration space missions are decades away, but should crews visit Mars as anticipated, they will likely stay for several months, not to mention that the round-trip to Mars takes over a year. Understanding how treatments behave in microgravity gives NASA insight into the best ways to keep future astronauts safe.<|endoftext|>

# How Mindless Phone Use Ruins Your Relationships

## How Mindless Phone Use Ruins Your Relationships

### *Whether you’re at work, on a date, or with the family, put that thing away every now and then*

Think back to the last time you met up with a friend for dinner. How many times did you look at your phone during the meal? Chances are, you checked it [at least once](&lt;|url|&gt;), if not more often, without even really thinking about it. How could you resist when you’re [bombarded with notifications](&lt;|url|&gt;) by a piece of technology precisely engineered to seize and hold your attention?

Checking a text or posting on Instagram when you’re in a real-life social situation may seem harmless, but studies have shown that it isn’t — not for you and not for the person you’re with. From office one-on-ones to dinner dates, interacting with your phone in the presence of another person can leave a lasting negative impression that affects how much you enjoy your time together or even how that person perceives your relationship overall.

According to Gallup’s [most recent poll](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the subject, Americans typically check their smartphones at least once an hour. Meanwhile, 81% report having their phones near them “almost all the time during waking hours,” and 41% actively check their phones several times per hour.

Still, most Americans also think they use their phone less than others around them — 61%, in fact, which, as the Gallup poll points out, is a mathematical impossibility. (I will freely admit to belonging to the 11% of polled users who believe they use their phone more than others.)

Kosta Kushlev, an assistant professor of psychology at Georgetown University, says he became interested in the distracting nature of phone use in social situations because of his own bad habits. Motivated by this observation, Kushlev decided to study the phenomenon. A [resulting 2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) showed that if a subject in a social setting has their phone on the table in front of them — even if they’re not actively using it — they leave that social situation having enjoyed it less than subjects who didn’t have their phones near them. The effects are subtle, Kushlev says, which makes them harder for the subject to perceive.

And it isn’t that the presence of the phone is making people unhappy. Rather, phones are “leading you to miss out on opportunities that you might have otherwise had,” Kushlev says. “You can’t really pick up exactly from where you left off. It’s interrupted.”

Kushlev performed [a similar study](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2017 that looked at 174 millennial subjects over the course of a week, rather than a single meal, and found that people reported feeling less connected and generally worse after interactions that included the presence of “computer-mediated communication” than after purely face-to-face, no-phone interactions.
> # Strangers smiled at each other less, and smiled less intensely, when they had their smartphones with them.

[Another study](&lt;|url|&gt;), from 2018, looked at the impact of smartphones’ presence on interactions between strangers. It found that strangers smiled at each other less, and smiled less intensely, when they had their smartphones with them than when they didn’t.

“People just don’t feel that the person is paying attention to them, and then they report having a [worse] conversation,” says John Hunter, a PhD candidate in psychological science at the University of California, Irvine, who conducted the smiling study with Kushlev and others. Even if your phone is not in use but still in front of you, “that makes the conversation worse, because the other person kind of feels that, well, that phone in front of you is maybe more important to you than the conversation we’re having.”

These effects aren’t felt only between friends or strangers. In workplaces and romantic relationships, the impact of “phubbing” (that is, phone snubbing) can have distinct ripple effects. A [2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) looked at how “boss phubbing” affects employee engagement and found that when bosses phub their subordinates, employees have lower trust, less belief that their work is meaningful, and lower levels of confidence in their professional abilities. All of this leads to less employee engagement overall.

The impact on romantic relationships is similar. The same team who ran the workplace phubbing study also conducted research on phubbing among couples and found similar results: When one member of a couple uses their phone in the presence of the other, the result is conflict that lowers relationship satisfaction, which can then lead to lower overall life satisfaction and, in some cases, depression.

“It makes your partner feel like you don’t care about them,” says study co-author Meredith David, an assistant professor of marketing at Baylor University. “[It] makes your partner start questioning, ‘What is this person doing? They don’t care to talk to me. They don’t value our relationship. They’re not really here with me.’”
> # “When parents use their phones, they might be missing out on opportunities to connect with their children.”

Phubbing can have damaging effects on parent-child relationships, too. Kushlev performed [a study](&lt;|url|&gt;) that looked at how parents experience a day at the museum when they are allowed to just barely use their phones versus when they’re encouraged to use their phones as much as possible. The study found that parents who used their phones more reported being in a worse mood, feeling less social connection, and feeling less “meaning” — which Kushlev says is particularly remarkable.

“When parents use their phones, they might be missing out on opportunities to connect with their children and feel a major benefit of being with their children, which is a sense of greater meaning in life,” he says.

David notes that merely having the phone on the table and not in use makes people feel less valued. She recommends that in meetings or on dates, participants turn off their phones and put them away to avoid any additional conflict that may arise from phubbing. She also predicts that workplaces will start implementing “phone breaks,” similar to smoking breaks, in which all employees are allowed to use their phones only during designated times and/or in designated places.

While most of the research shows that having your phone out in social situations won’t do you any good, there may be one notable exception: when you’re feeling anxious. Hunter led [a study](&lt;|url|&gt;) that looked at the stress response of those with phones out and in use, those with phones but not in use, and those without phones, all in socially awkward situations. He found that the least anxious group was the one in which participants had their phones but weren’t using them.

It’s all about the value that the phone can bring in a particular situation. “Use your phone for enhancement, not for escape,” Hunter says. “If you’re using your phone in ways to make the conversation better, you’re sharing a funny joke with someone… that’s good. But when you do it to escape, it tends to be pretty negative.”

In some ways, a phone can feel like another person in the room, taking up cognitive space with communications from text messages, social media notifications, and news alerts. But a phone is also easy to put away. It’s easy to put into airplane mode, silence the notifications — or even turn it off completely.

Smartphones aren’t going anywhere — and unlike human beings, they don’t have feelings. If we want to keep our relationships with our romantic partners, friends, and co-workers healthy, we need to prioritize their physical presence over digital communications when we’re together. That text message is still going to be there when you’re done.<|endoftext|>

# The ‘Escape to Mars’ Plan Has a Fatal Flaw

## The ‘Escape to Mars’ Plan Has a Fatal Flaw

### Elon Musk and other futurists are missing something big

Mars, our neighboring red dot, has been the focus of human exploration for hundreds of years. Science fiction writers, scientists, and explorers alike have spent decades imagining what life would be like if humankind could pick up and move there. Never mind the radiation, lack of oxygen, and inhospitable atmosphere. According to some billionaires and scientists, Mars is our future.

The private space industry has exploded, with companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic all designing spacecrafts to bring people to the cosmos and orbit the earth as tourists, or, in SpaceX’s case, to set up a massive settlement of humans on Mars.

But the field of space exploration is at an ethical impasse.

Let’s set aside for a moment the fact that space travel is difficult and risky, and that people could die on the journey. Critics of privatized space travel also take issue with the implications these companies are built on. What does it mean when a company makes it their goal to colonize an entire planet?

The desire to become interplanetary harkens back to the 19th century, when colonizers believed it was their God-given right to expand out to the west and take over land and communities. The adoption of Mars as a second home is the Manifest Destiny of the 21st century. Even the language is problematic. “Colonize Mars” is one of the phrases private companies use most often to describe their grand plans. SpaceX sells a T-shirt that reads “Occupy Mars.”

“These issues intersect with so many lessons that we have here on Earth, be it the rights of indigenous people or the way we even think about a wild environment,” says Lucianne Walkowicz, the Baruch S. Blumberg NASA Chair of Astrobiology at the Kluge Center, and astronomer at the Adler Planetarium who studies the ethics of Mars exploration.

Throughout history, colonization has resulted in mass deaths, the spread of disease, and the decimation or suppression of native cultures. Yet these issues are rarely discussed among Mars colonization planners. Some think Mars is a dead planet, covered in a fine layer of rusty dirt, rocks, and some frozen water. But despite our constant and steady exploration of Mars over the past 50 years, it’s unknown whether life exists there, or ever did. “We don’t know whether there is a history that we could study there or learn about,” Walkowicz says. “We don’t know whether there is life under the surface. There could be microbial communities. There could be more complicated stuff. We just don’t know.”

Space moguls like Elon Musk brush off the issue. During a panel interview at the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in 2015, Musk was asked about planetary protection measures. “I think the reality is that there isn’t any life on the surface of Mars,” he responded. “There may be microbial life deep underground, where it’s shielded from radiation and the cold. That’s a possibility, but in that case, anything we do on the surface is not going to have a big impact on the subterranean life.”

Experts don’t necessarily agree with Musk’s view and argue that more research is needed before declaring that there’s nothing worth preserving on the planet.
> # “Just because there are some multibillionaires who have ideas about how we should go to space doesn’t mean that there aren’t a lot of us with other ideas.”

Mars remains an untouched environment. Landing hundreds of people on the surface would be the equivalent of walking into a controlled laboratory and dousing everything with grime and dirt. For space scientists, the experiment would be ruined. Not to mention the fact that humans don’t have a great track record when it comes to environmental preservation. The health of our own planet — one that has clean water, breathable air, and an atmosphere that keeps us alive — is in crisis. We’ve done a terrible job taking care of the Earth. Why would Mars be any different?

The fact is that scientific exploration is not the goal for wannabe Mars dwellers, and issues related to space preservation largely fall to NASA. While companies like SpaceX work closely with the agency, their goals are not necessarily aligned. It is the job of NASA’s Office of Planetary Protection to promote responsible exploration of the solar system and protect any indigenous life form, even if it’s ancient and no longer alive. Walkowicz says she worries that the current administration may be too lenient, policy-wise, toward business interests.

Musk and others stand by their intentions to transport humans to Mars as a way to save the species in case of a disaster, like an asteroid or the repercussions from a massive world war. If we are wiped out, at least we have some extra human stock on Mars. But this logic is flawed, Walkowicz says, because it is “spreading the idea that global annihilation due to an asteroid could happen at any moment.”

“It** **injects an urgency into human beings going to Mars that doesn’t actually exist,” she adds. “They’re always talking about the asteroid strike or in a billion years the sun is going to expand and make the earth too hot. Nobody ever brings up climate change.”

If there is going to be a backup plan for humanity, who* *gets to be backed up? Mars settlement plans are likely to be offered to a select group of people, like those who can afford a $200,000 ticket on a SpaceX rocket. Although Musk paints a picture of a comfortable space life, anyone who takes that journey should know the risks. They might not get to come back. Mars could become home to a lot of unhappy wealthy people.

If we have a chance to do this all again, experts argue, we should be careful and put a lot more thought and consideration into both the ethics and logistics of sending people to Mars. As part of her Kluge fellowship, Walkowicz recently held a conference called Decolonizing Mars that brought together scientists, philosophers, writers, artists, ethicists, and engineers to begin discussions on alternative plans. Walkowicz says she isn’t totally against sending humans to Mars, but she thinks the prospect needs to be approached more inclusively. “There are certainly aspects of learning about Mars — both its present and its history — that are way more efficient if you have humans there locally,” she says. “So I think there are compelling scientific reasons for humans to go.”

Mars is by no means a realistic backup plan for our survival. It is, however, a hot spot for scientific exploration. Those who dream of setting up large communities in the cosmos need to work in tandem with those who have different goals and perspectives.

“Just because there are some multibillionaires who have ideas about how we should go to space,” Walkowicz says, “doesn’t mean that there aren’t a lot of us with other ideas.”<|endoftext|>

# Dangerous DIY Sunscreen Recipes Are Spreading on Pinterest

## Dangerous DIY Sunscreen Recipes Are Spreading on Pinterest

### *Misplaced concerns about chemicals in over-the-counter sunscreens are fueling a new problem on social media*

![Illustration: [Joseph Melhuish](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Joseph Melhuish](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Everyone’s trying to make a buck on alternative and all-natural remedies these days.

Sephora [launched](&lt;|url|&gt;) a “Clean at Sephora” category in 2018, aiming to help the increasing number of customers who are afraid of chemicals like parabens and phthalates to find products without them. Consumers are buying vitamins and supplements in [record numbers](&lt;|url|&gt;), despite evidence that they’re [ineffective](&lt;|url|&gt;) for most people. And, of course, vaccine hesitancy is becoming a massive public health concern, with the [World Health Organization](&lt;|url|&gt;) naming it one of its top 10 biggest risks to global health.

[New research](&lt;|url|&gt;), published May 20 in the journal *Health Communication*, shows how this trend is extending to people’s sunscreen habits — and maybe even putting people at increased risk for skin cancer. The study looked at how people share information about homemade or do-it-yourself sunscreen on Pinterest, and found that nearly 95% of pins about homemade sunscreen portrayed it positively, and a full 68% of the pins recommended recipes for DIY sunscreen that didn’t even work.

Lara McKenzie, a principal investigator at the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital and one of the study’s authors, says she and her co-authors were interested in studying Pinterest specifically because of how many parents use the platform. She says that, as a parent herself, “I understand the movement and wanting to provide the best for your kids and to not give them things that are harmful or dangerous or hazardous,” but that, in fact, relying on homemade sunscreen puts a child more at risk than whatever potential dangers people think lurk in sunscreen chemicals.

“It’s really scary because what’s at risk here at best is a really bad sunburn, but at worst is the possibility of skin cancer in the future, especially if it’s children,” she says. “The number of saves (formerly called “repins,” in which a user “saves” someone else’s pin to their own Pinterest page) for the average Pinterest post are something like 800, and one of the pins in the study was saved more than 21,000 times. This is in the mainstream and it’s popular.”

![*Screenshots of homemade sunscreen recipes on Pinterest from study*](<|image|>)**Screenshots of homemade sunscreen recipes on Pinterest from study**

While Pinterest may be a prominent space for sunscreen misinformation to spread, it’s hardly the only place you can find it. *Into The Gloss*, the beauty blog that launched the massive indie beauty brand Glossier, [has a recipe](&lt;|url|&gt;) for homemade sunscreen consisting of shea butter, zinc oxide powder, coconut oil, and other oils. (The author is now the executive fashion news editor at *British Vogue*). The health website [Dr. Axe](&lt;|url|&gt;) warns that “conventional sunscreen can be full of harmful chemicals and toxins” and that their recipe for homemade sunscreen not only protects the skin from getting “burnt,” but also “nourishes and hydrates your skin with essential vitamins and nutrients.” And the popular wellness blog [*Wellness Mama](&lt;|url|&gt;)* claims that “lack of sun exposure is a much bigger problem than too much sun exposure” and advises readers to make their own sunscreen from, again, zinc oxide, coconut oil, olive oil, beeswax, and other ingredients. (One of the Pinterest pins included in the study is a *Wellness Mama* creation.)

As fun as it is to whip up your own face mask or devise your own bar soap recipe out of oatmeal and essential oils, sunscreen is an entirely different beast. That’s because protecting your skin from both UVA and UVB rays is a precise science that requires more nuance than dumping zinc oxide powder in a cup of coconut oil and calling it a day. Zinc oxide, or titanium dioxide, both of which are physical sunscreen agents commonly used in commercial sunscreens, have to be combined with the other ingredients in exact amounts as well as evenly incorporated throughout the lotion to ensure adequate protection. The likelihood that an unpracticed arts and crafts enthusiast will be able to achieve that, even with a decent recipe, is slim.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved sunscreens, says McKenzie, “are tested for efficacy and effectiveness in a really rigorous way. These homemade versions and the proportions and the ingredients are not.” Sunscreen, after all, is not merely a skincare product meant to shrink pores or delay aging (though it can do that too). It’s an FDA-regulated drug, because sunscreen’s main purpose is protecting us from two health-related concerns: sunburns and, eventually, skin cancer. (FDA regulatory hurdles are [their own massive issue](&lt;|url|&gt;), unfortunately, as they make it difficult to introduce newer, better sunscreen ingredients that Europe and Asia already has to the American market.)

This isn’t to say there aren’t some questions about possible side effects of conventional sunscreen. One such question was partly affirmed in early May. In a [small, preliminary FDA study](&lt;|url|&gt;) published in *JAMA*, 24 participants applied 2 milligrams of sunscreen per centimeter over 75% of the body four times daily for four days. The study found that four main sunscreen ingredients — avobenzone, octocrylene, ecamsule, and oxybenzone — were present in participants’ blood at rates higher than what the FDA allows before toxicology testing must take place.
> # As fun as it is to whip up your own face mask or devise your own bar soap recipe out of oatmeal and essential oils, sunscreen is an entirely different beast.

Following the release of the study, of course, was an avalanche of sensationalist media headlines. “High levels of sunscreen ingredients end up in the bloodstream: study,” wrote [*Reuters](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. “The chemicals in sunscreen seep into your bloodstream after just one day, FDA says,” proclaimed [*USA Today](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. “FDA Warns Chemicals From Sunscreen Enter Your Bloodstream After One Day,” said [*Moms.com](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. While the first two headlines are technically correct (and the third is simply wrong — the FDA isn’t “warning” anyone about anything), they may strike unnecessary fear in readers, when there’s nothing, yet, to actually be afraid of.

Kimberly Miller, a clinical assistant professor of preventive medicine and dermatology at the University of Southern California, points out that the study doesn’t assess if these active sunscreen ingredients cause harm, but rather whether or not they’re present in the blood at all.

“We’ve been using these ingredients in sunscreen for some 30-plus years without evidence of systemic adverse health effects,” she says. “Many things are systemically absorbed into our bloodstream that we actually know are harmful to our health.” Miller notes that most of us breathe in fine particulate matter through air pollution, which isn’t good for us — but few of us go around wearing masks outdoors.

The study itself insists that people shouldn’t stop using sunscreen. The next step for scientists and sunscreen manufacturers is to do more research on the impact these active ingredients may be having on our internal health. But one thing is for sure: broad-spectrum, conventional sunscreen protects the skin from damage wrought by the sun’s rays, and those rays can lead to cancer.

It’s also possible that the news could push people further into the arms of pseudoscience, where loud voices declare the overstated or outright false benefits of “all-natural” edible sunscreen, homemade sunscreen, and sun-protecting antioxidants, while fearmongering about “chemicals” that [disrupt human hormones](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [bleach coral](&lt;|url|&gt;).

McKenzie says she thinks the sunscreen absorption study could play a part in pushing people to make their own sunscreens, which could be dangerous. “There’s really skepticism out there about the medical community,” she says. “We’ve done some focus groups, on a different topic, but there was a lot of skepticism about natural versus man-made anything.”

Miller, whose research focuses on skin cancer, says that sunscreen skepticism is a cause of concern for dermatologists and public health officials looking to curb rising rates of skin cancer in the United States. “I’m worried that this skepticism about sunscreen, fueled by things like the [EWG guide to sunscreens](&lt;|url|&gt;) (which overstates the risks of chemical sunscreens and is not science-based) and now media sensationalism regarding the *JAMA* study, dovetails with other anti-science trends (for example, [vaccination refusal](&lt;|url|&gt;)) and will do nothing to curb the skin cancer epidemic in the U.S.,” she says.

Pinterest is no stranger to controversy — but unlike other social networks, it’s taken swift and decisive action when necessary. When a [2016 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that 75% of vaccine-related posts on Pinterest were negative, the company took notice, and a year later, it banned “promotion of false cures for terminal or chronic illnesses and anti-vaccination advice” and started [blocking](&lt;|url|&gt;) vaccine-related searches. With enough public outcry, perhaps the platform will turn its attention to other pseudoscientific activity, such as promoting the use of dangerous homemade sunscreens on children, as well.

And yes, there are still questions about how our bodies interact with sunscreens. But what no one should do is hop on Pinterest — or any social network, for that matter — track down a cool-looking homemade sunscreen recipe, and go to town in their kitchen. There are a lot of fun things you can do on Pinterest instead, like learn all about [edible insects](&lt;|url|&gt;), lust after the American Dream ([home ownership](&lt;|url|&gt;)), and find recipes for [making your own soap](&lt;|url|&gt;). Leave the skin damage prevention to the pros.<|endoftext|>

# Femtech Could Be the Solution to Medicine’s Male Bias

## Female engineers are building a new health care industry, but its future depends on mostly male investors

![Illustration: [Jenn Liv](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Jenn Liv](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Consider the speculum. It’s hard to find a better symbol for how medicine regards female patients: with a[ cold, metal instrument](&lt;|url|&gt;) that dates back to the 1840s. And while doctors use it to inspect vaginas in 60 million pelvic exams every year across the U.S. alone, only a few companies have tried — unsuccessfully, so far — to redesign the instrument.

“This is a good example of the lack of innovation [in women’s health care] because there’s such good technology out there and yet the speculum hasn’t been redesigned for 200 years,” says Trish Costello, a Silicon Valley-based investor. “Any woman who’s ever had their annual exam knows how uncomfortable it is and knows that it could very easily be improved. There just hasn’t been the interest or the funding to do it and successfully go to market.”

The speculum is a visible symbol of a deep institutional problem with medical science — that it has been dominated by, and developed for, men. If you’re a woman in the U.S., studies suggest that you’re less likely to receive[ life-saving treatment](&lt;|url|&gt;) if you have a blood clot and that it could take you[ longer to be referred](&lt;|url|&gt;) for an EKG after heart failure, because doctors are less likely to recognize symptoms of heart disease for women, which differ slightly from men’s. Scientists have traditionally regarded men as the default patient. Before the early 1990s, it was [normal for medical trials to use only male participants](&lt;|url|&gt;), with scientists largely assuming that all genders experienced the same symptoms and would respond in the same way to treatments. Not until 1993 were clinical trials [required by law](&lt;|url|&gt;) to include women in the U.S. Even the mice used in drug tests are [usually male](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # The speculum is a visible symbol of a deep institutional problem with medical science — that it has been dominated by, and developed for, men.

“This created a huge gap in knowledge about women’s health and the ways in which women’s biology and health needs differ from men’s,” says Amy Miller, president and CEO of the Washington-based nonprofit [Society for Women’s Health Research](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Although we are now trying to backfill this missing knowledge, women and their doctors are still forced to make health care decisions with information that is often based solely on male biology.”

The results of that bias are stark — and extend beyond the U.S. Gender bias in medical research helps explain why British women are 50% more likely than men to be [misdiagnosed following a heart attack](&lt;|url|&gt;). Even in progressive [Denmark](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the 14th most gender-equal country in the world, [according](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the World Economic Forum — a study of 7 million people found that a diabetes diagnosis takes 4.5 years longer for women than for men.

But [Shruthi Parakkal](&lt;|url|&gt;), a consultant at the business consultancy Frost & Sullivan, believes that femtech — a fast-growing strand of digital health care — could help even out medical gender bias. “Femtech will be able to provide innovative solutions to contribute to gender parity in care delivery,” she says, speaking from her base in Chennai, India. “The market is just waking up to the need for differentiated care based on gender.”

Frost & Sullivan defines femtech as “software, diagnostics, products and services that use technology to improve women’s health.” And the sector is booming — the company predicts femtech will be worth [$50 billion by 2025](&lt;|url|&gt;).

So far, this new strand of health care has been dominated by reproductive health apps such as Clue, Glow, and Natural Cycles. Each has achieved rapid growth — Clue reported [5 million users](&lt;|url|&gt;) after its third year — by providing women with their own monthly cycle data so they can either try for pregnancy during fertile days or use the app as a “digital contraceptive.”

But the next generation of femtech companies is looking beyond reproductive health to create a parallel health care industry tailored to women. These companies — many inspired by their founders’ personal experiences of how health care can fail women — are looking to exploit opportunities in mainstream medicine’s gender gap.

For entrepreneur Alicia Chong Rodriguez, heart disease is personal. She lost her grandmother to it, so she knows that both she and her mother are at heightened risk. But that hardly makes her family outliers. “One in three women die from heart disease [compared to] one in 31 from breast cancer,” she says.

In 2015, when she was studying engineering at MIT, Rodriguez discovered that heart disease treatment was largely based on research trials that had been conducted on male patients. That motivated the MIT engineering graduate to launch the company[ Bloomer Tech](&lt;|url|&gt;) the same year. Alongside co-founders Aceil Halaby and Monica Abarca, Rodriguez has developed a bra fitted with sensors that continuously track the user’s heart health, displaying results on a mobile app.

The bra is not yet on the market, but the team hopes to make it easier for women to monitor and understand their own heart, and in doing so, build up valuable data that could be used to plug the gender gap in medical research. The company’s product could enable an unconventional research trial into women’s hearts, which Rodriguez hopes will help fill in a gender data gap on health care, at the very moment when machine learning is taking a greater and greater role in medicine. “A future with A.I. in health care will only be as good as the data we give our models,” she says.

Some critics have argued that the femtech label is [unhelpful](&lt;|url|&gt;), focused too heavily on fertility, menstruation, and the needs of cisgender women. Amy Domangue spent time embedded in a Los Angeles hospital as part of the Techstars startup accelerator, which mentors entrepreneurs. “I witnessed how the femtech industry had wrongfully targeted what they think is the only thing important to women, which is fertility,” she says.

That experience inspired her to co-found [Jessie Health](&lt;|url|&gt;), an aggregator platform where women can type in their symptoms, allowing the site to direct them to one of their 15 virtual care vendors treating problems ranging from UTIs to anxiety. “We felt there were all these great companies coming out like [HeyDoctor](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [BetterHelp](&lt;|url|&gt;), but the problem is that not every platform is licensed for every state, and also there’s not much navigational support if you prefer to message a physician versus having [a] live video visit,” Domangue says.
> # The next generation of femtech companies are looking beyond reproductive health to create a parallel health care industry tailored to women.

The Jessie Health team is still raising seed money ahead of the platform’s launch in June, but Domangue has already noticed that most potential tech investors are men;** **women have historically struggled to get funding for products, like those in femtech, that men wouldn’t use and can’t relate to. To combat that, she’s emphasizing the traction the company already has with insurance companies and employers, looking to save money.

Lack of funding could be the biggest threat to the developing femtech industry, says Costello, CEO of investing platform Portfolia, which launched the country’s [first femtech fund](&lt;|url|&gt;) last summer and aims to create 100,000 female investors by 2022. “Today, nine out of 10 VCs are male,” she says. “People invest in what they know. If men can’t personally relate to a health issue, they’re less inclined to take interest, much less back an important solution. It’s why we have so many companies devoted to erectile dysfunction while women’s health startups still struggle for funding.”

The challenge to redesign the speculum, meanwhile, has been undertaken by [Yona](&lt;|url|&gt;), a team of four designers and engineers at Frog Design in San Francisco** **— the innovation and strategic design firm most famous for its work with Apple.** **Begun as an early-stage design concept, the team of four women has used a process called “radical empathy” to envision a less intimidating and more sensitive way of conducting pelvic exams, centered around patients’ emotional as well as physical needs.

Their prototype speculum 2.0 allows the physician a clear view without the need to open the speculum to maximum width. It is coated in silicon, which feels warmer than cold metal, and has an accompanying app that guides the patient through the exam procedure and allows them to tell their doctor about their preferences. It’s an ambitious concept and, because Frog is primarily a concepting agency, one that may never come to market.** **Yet few women wouldn’t sign up for some sort of product** **that improves the ritual, archaic humiliation of a pelvic exam. Maybe there’s an investor out there who agrees.

“The medical community has historically failed to meet women’s health issues,” says Costello. “By backing companies that are focused on women’s health, we can begin to shift bias and the power balance and have a more direct say on what gets put into the marketplace, and how.”<|endoftext|>

# Don’t Use A VPN At Home

## Despite what VPN commercials tell you, there’s really no reason to use a VPN at home

![Photo: Grassetto/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Grassetto/Getty*

Public Wi-Fi, especially hotspots without passwords (like at cafés and malls), are where you should always be using a VPN. When your device communicates with a Wi-Fi hotspot, there isn’t a beam of radio waves connecting you to the router. Instead, the router and your device blast signals in every direction with the hope that the signal will eventually reach the router’s antenna.

Of course, this works most of the time, because you’re reading this post right now. Even in the event that a few packets don’t find their way, TCP has you covered. TCP is an internet protocol that ensures each end of the connection receives all the packets sent to it. Should a packet not arrive, it is sent again until delivery is complete.

How does this relate to VPNs? Well, because the signals are being sent in every direction, a hacker with the proper equipment, which actually isn’t too expensive, can collect those packets without you or the router noticing. Generally, password-protected Wi-Fi utilizes encryption that ensures what the hackers pick up is a jumbled and useless mess that can’t be reassembled. However, public Wi-Fi is often not password protected, meaning you don’t benefit from encryption. A VPN makes up for that by providing its own form of encryption that protects against snooping.

Not only does a VPN provide its own encryption, which prevents hackers from knowing what you’re doing online, they often contain another layer of defense. Many modern VPNs will ensure that the data being sent is not only received, but also received without being tampered with. Even in the event that someone attempts to inject unwanted data into a packet, the VPN should detect it and protect you from that kind of attack.
> # If a hacker is sitting right outside your house collecting every single packet your device sends, there’s nothing they can do with it.

I’m willing to bet that your home Wi-Fi is protected by a password. Even if you’re unaware of the security benefits, having a password simply prevents people from using up your bandwidth. Modern routers make setting up and updating the password a relatively easy process, with the hardest part being updating the passwords on all your devices.

Since you most likely have a password set up for your Wi-Fi network, you’re getting the protection the encryption offers. If a hacker is sitting right outside your house collecting every single packet your device sends, there’s nothing they can do with it. This only works if the hacker can’t guess your password, however, so be sure to use a secure one.

One argument for using a VPN at home is if you don’t trust your ISP. That may be because you think the company is spying on you and selling your data, or it’s taking advantage of the lack of net neutrality and blocking websites unless you pay extra. Either way, a VPN is the perfect solution, right?

Well, not really. Remember, all a VPN does is securely tunnel your traffic to a server, after which there is no extra layer of encryption protecting you. Basically, using a VPN pushes the risk down the line from your home ISP to the VPN provider’s ISP.

Whether that puts you in a better situation largely depends on the VPN provider. Reputable — generally meaning paid — VPN services are most likely fine, because they’re making money from you paying them. Free VPN providers, however, often rely on selling user data to cover the costs of their services and make a profit.

Even if you trust your VPN provider, there are still other aspects to consider.

Because VPNs add another layer of encryption to your internet traffic, your latency will go up and speeds will go down. This is an acceptable trade-off when you’re on public or otherwise untrusted Wi-Fi, because a bit of slowdown is worth being secure. But when using a VPN at home, the trade-off doesn’t make nearly as much sense. The more physically distant the VPN server, the higher the latency and the slower speeds will become. If you’re lucky enough to have a VPN server close to your house, then the impact will be less noticeable — but it’s still there.

This advice is aimed at the general internet user who’s using a VPN to keep their internet traffic safe from hackers. At home, if you’re using a strong Wi-Fi password and HTTPS when it’s available, using a VPN won’t add much security to your internet browsing. Wi-Fi encryption will prevent nearby hackers from seeing what you’re doing, while HTTPS will protect you up to the web server itself.

Of course, the situation changes a bit when you’re using a VPN for both security and privacy. Assuming you take all the rights steps to hide your online identity, then using a VPN at home may make sense for your use case. Since you’re probably using a faraway VPN server to prevent online services from getting your approximate location, you’ll experience rather high latency and sluggish speeds. But if you care about your privacy enough to use a VPN 24/7, the trade-off is probably worth it for you.

I use a VPN at home, but it’s not because I want to hide from Google or as a protest against my ISP. (Okay, maybe it’s partially because I hate my ISP.) The main reason is so I can access my Raspberry Pi from anywhere in the world. Since I happen to use that Raspberry Pi as my main Wi-Fi router, everything gets routed through my VPN anyway.

But whenever I stream something or do anything else that’s bandwidth intensive, I switch to one of my other Wi-Fi networks without a VPN. In fact, my laptops usually aren’t connected to my VPN-enabled Wi-Fi connection, because I prefer speed and low latency over a bit of added privacy from my ISP.<|endoftext|>

# Twitter’s Redesign Isn’t About You

## It’s about making a notoriously slow-footed company faster on its feet — which could eventually pay off for its users

![](<|image|>)

Something unusual happened this week: Twitter got a major redesign, and people hardly freaked out at all. That might be because most of the updates appeared cosmetic, even trivial. But the project’s true aim — according to its lead designer Ashlie Ford — was to make Twitter easier for Twitter to use. And that, in turn, could mean a better Twitter for everyone, eventually.

The long-awaited revamp [of Twitter.com](&lt;|url|&gt;) rebuilt the desktop website from the bottom up as a progressive web app and merged it with the former [mobile website](&lt;|url|&gt;). The makeover was met with a collective shrug, and scattered snorts of derision. (Did they get rid of the Nazis yet? Still no?) But the updates start to make more sense when you realize that they aren’t really about changing how people use Twitter — at least, not immediately. They’re about changing the company’s internal culture, and in doing so, paving the way for Twitter to fix all kinds of problems, large and small, in the future.

Twitter, as a company, seems to spend most of its time in various stages of existential crisis. Lately it has been rethinking everything as it tries to figure out how to address rampant harassment and hate speech and how to make its platform more conducive to civil, human conversation as opposed to dunking, trolling, and general cacophony. So one would expect that the first overhaul of its website in seven years might try to tackle these problems in substantive ways. After all, a platform’s design draws the boundaries for its use.

Instead, we got a series of seemingly surface-level tweaks that passed with surprisingly little notice, given the long history of Twitter’s loyal users reacting with nearly comical outrage to almost any significant change to the platform. (Remember the fury over [threaded replies](&lt;|url|&gt;)? The [algorithmic timeline](&lt;|url|&gt;)? The move to [280 characters](&lt;|url|&gt;)?) Among the updates: The main navigation bar moved from the top of the page to the side, there are a handful of new buttons and features ported from the mobile app, and the site as a whole became cleaner and more responsive.


The changes are modest, including minor features that could prove useful, like making it easier to find lists and bookmarks, navigate direct messages, or toggle between your algorithmic and chronological timelines. But the redesign is more consequential than it appears. It might even mark a quiet turning point for a social network that has long lagged behind rivals in improving and building on its core product.

The company rebuilt the technology underpinning the website because the old one had become kludgy and outdated on the back end, making every change an exercise in bureaucracy and frustration for the company’s own software engineers.

“The legacy site was built on an old tech stack,” Ford told me in a phone interview. “It was really hard to update, and because of that, it didn’t get updated very often.” The new site, she said, “was built entirely from the ground up, and so it is much faster to prototype, experiment, and roll out new features.” It is now what’s called a progressive web app, loading faster and adapting readily to different devices and screen sizes.

In the process, it has become much more similar to Twitter’s native mobile apps, which makes it easier for designers and product managers to sketch out how an idea would work on each. Previously, the company’s changes tended to come first to its mobile apps, migrating to the web only much later. A post on Twitter’s engineering blog underscored that the redesign’s number one priority was to “make it [easier and faster to develop new features](&lt;|url|&gt;) for people worldwide.”

Ford said the company hopes the rebuild will not only make life easier on existing employees, but help to attract new ones. That can be critical for Silicon Valley tech firms, which compete intensely for the most capable software developers.

If they work as promised, the changes could help Twitter shed its reputation for [moving like molasses](&lt;|url|&gt;) while its competitors seem to be in hyperdrive. The social media reporter Casey Newton observed in 2017 that Twitter couldn’t figure out how to build an edit button, while Facebook was working on ways to let you type with your mind and [hear with your skin](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Of course, the inability to rapidly test and ship changes hasn’t been Twitter’s only problem. The company has also been notoriously [slow to make hard decisions](&lt;|url|&gt;), which [can be a virtue](&lt;|url|&gt;), but starts to look [more like negligence](&lt;|url|&gt;) when users have been suffering the consequences of its inaction on the same problems for years. Empowering the company’s workers to test out ideas will only help if Twitter’s top management is willing to give some of them the green light.

Twitter has already been toying with some interesting ideas in its mobile apps. While the desktop app makes lists more accessible, a current test version of the iOS app goes even further to make them an integral part of the platform: Swiping right from the home timeline toggles between a series of “pinned” lists, making Twitter feel more like its power-user-oriented subsidiary, TweetDeck.

Twitter wouldn’t say if or when it might make that change for all users, though Ford told me the company is interested in boosting list usage, and has already seen an uptick from the desktop redesign. That shift could help to make Twitter less of a single-room shouting match and more of an interest-based network — or it could backfire by encouraging people to circulate lists intended to doxx, intimidate, or harass. Either way, the back-end changes will make it easier for Twitter to quickly test out and implement these sorts of ideas for a wider range of users, without requiring people to download beta versions of the app.

In a similar vein, the new desktop site has incorporated a change pioneered in the mobile app that allows a user to switch between multiple accounts from their home timeline. Twitter told *Wired* that was motivated partly by users in Japan, where it has become common to create [different accounts for different interests](&lt;|url|&gt;) and purposes.

Some other changes previously tested in mobile apps, such as [removing reply and like counters](&lt;|url|&gt;) from certain views, have not been brought into the desktop redesign thus far. But there is one change in that general direction: The website no longer displays your follower count on your home timeline, forcing you to navigate to your profile page if you want to see how you’re faring in the great popularity contest.

Critics who point out that Twitter’s big redesign has done nothing to fix its fundamental problems are correct. But it should at least make the company a little lighter on its feet from now on — so it can move on to making the sorts of substantive changes that could really make a difference. Or at least really piss people off.<|endoftext|>

# Apple News+ Is Damn Near Too Much of a Good Thing

## Apple News+ Is Damn Near Too Much of a Good Thing

### *It’s easy to get lost inside News+*

![One of my favorite Premiere magazines next to News+ on the largest iOS screen I could find. All photos courtesy of the author.](<|image|>)*One of my favorite Premiere magazines next to News+ on the largest iOS screen I could find. All photos courtesy of the author.*

Back in the late ’80s, my favorite magazine was *Premiere*. This was a glossy movie magazine for those who obsessed over the craft and business of film. Celebrities appeared on the cover and actors were profiled, as was the case with *People *and the *Hollywood Reporter*, but no other magazine put you on the set, in the writers’ room, or at the negotiating table with execs like *Premiere *did.

I loved it for the insight, as well as the large photos and layouts, and I vividly recall when they shrunk the magazine down from *Life *size to something roughly equivalent to the *New Yorker*. *Premiere *never really recovered, and the publication limped along until the declining economics of print killed it in 2007.

I was reminded of that classic glossy publication as I perused dozens and dozens of magazines in Apple News+ on my iPhone 7, an iPhone XS Max, an iPad Mini, and the iPad Pro 12.9.

The iPad Pro came closest to recreating that classic *Premiere *format. Even so, it was smaller — not quite the same experience, even on the biggest tablet Apple has to offer.

News+, Apple’s new home for paid editorial content, is both a reminder of the pleasure of reading print magazines and an admission that, no matter how many cool animations and interactive features you slide into *Vanity Fair*, it will never be the same as reading a physical magazine. But if you can accept that the News+ experience is its own distinct product, it can be quite easy to lose yourself among its endless digital pages.

Like many of the services Apple [recently launched in Cupertino](&lt;|url|&gt;), News+ is not, in fact, a standalone app experience, but an augmentation of an existing one. I’ve been using Apple News, Apple’s largely human-run news aggregator and push service, for a few years now, and I’ve even come to rely on its Apple Watch notifications. Slipping News+ inside the already well-distributed and popular News app makes sense.

After agreeing to pay $9.99 a month — though the first month is free — I soon had access to News+ on all of my devices that were signed into the same iCloud account. I even set up family sharing so my wife and kids could get lost in all the titles.

If you used Texture, the precursor app to News+ that Apple acquired last year, the magazine stand in News+ will feel quite familiar. It’s like a more orderly Hudson News online, without the random Dunkin’ Donuts in the back.

![There are literally hundreds of titles inside News+. The easiest way to see them all is in the alphabetized catalog.](<|image|>)*There are literally hundreds of titles inside News+. The easiest way to see them all is in the alphabetized catalog.*

The homepage is preloaded with magazines you’ve checked out previously or downloaded for offline reading. Above that is a side-scrolling list of categories that includes all the topics you’d imagine, from style and beauty to cars. I noticed that while Apple News+ includes the slightly racy *Maxim*, other R-rated titles like *Playboy* are nowhere to be found. Still, if you’re sharing News+ with family, especially young children, you might want to turn on parental controls in your iOS settings. This is one situation where I wish I could adjust those settings within the app and do it on title-by-title basis, rather than limiting access to the entire thing.

![The News+ homepage.](<|image|>)*The News+ homepage.*

There’s also a Featured section, which is notable for the amount of effort the publishers put into each magazine. Apple provides a special [Apple News Format](&lt;|url|&gt;) tool that offers publishers significant flexibility in how they present their designs and articles. Publishers that push the boundaries with animated covers, moving backgrounds, and animations end up in the coveted Featured section.

However, the majority of the 300-plus titles in Apple News+ have opted for a more straightforward port, plugging their content management systems into the News+ platform and essentially letting it suck in their article content.

Even with the most highly designed titles, there is tremendous consistency to the look and feel of these publications within Apple News+. There’s the large, beautiful cover, which, depending on the screen you use and the amount of work the publisher put into it, may or may not have some 3D movement to it when you move the screen around. Right below the cover is the table of contents. From there, you can dive into any story and start swiping left or right to view the next article or ad. This style of digital magazine navigation hasn’t changed much since the days of Zinio, and it’s still effective.

The imagery can be arresting or mouthwatering. In *Vanity Fair*, for instance, I found my appetite triggered as I stared at a full-screen bowl of kelp noodle chap chae. And I couldn’t take my eyes off *Esquire’s* Samuel L. Jackson cover and the photos of him inside.

![Covers and photographs look good in News+.](<|image|>)*Covers and photographs look good in News+.*

The responsive design of News+ means magazines look equally good on large and small screens. That said, it is more fun to peruse these titles on larger screens, where the imagery and ads really pop.

It’s important to understand that these are truly digital magazines and not websites gussied up to look like print. In fact, many of the same print and digital magazine rules apply here as they do in the analog world. With the exception of tiny space-filler ads, house ads, and classifieds, the ads you’ll see in News+ are the same ones the publishers will run in their physical magazines.

In fact, that’s the way it has to be. According to the Alliance for Audited Media (AAM), an independent cross-media verification organization that, among other things, checks circulation numbers for publications, the magazines inside News+ qualify as “digital replica editions.” An AAM spokesperson says the organization was working with Texture long before Apple bought the company and even worked out a way to account for service subscriptions and the opening of individual issues to count toward each magazine’s overall [circulation rate base](&lt;|url|&gt;). Of course, simply opening one issue of *People* in News+ does not make you a full-year subscriber.

“If the consumer opens the April issue, then the April issue counts… in total paid circulation for the April issue. If they do not open the May issue, then May is not a circulation unit,” explains the AAM spokesperson.

The degree to which these micro-transactions and incremental subscriptions will improve the fortunes of an industry that’s reeling from [consolidation](&lt;|url|&gt;), [cuts](&lt;|url|&gt;) ,and [falling revenue](&lt;|url|&gt;) remains to be seen. But if the quality of experience and value are any measure, then News+ has the potential to be a wild success — at least for Apple, which is said to have signed up [200,000](&lt;|url|&gt;) News+ subscribers in its first 48 hours on the market. (Though remember — that first month is free.)

## **So much content**

Imagine being trapped in that Hudson News with nothing but time (and doughnuts). You would read everything in sight. News+ makes it easy to jump from publication to publication and, especially on larger screens, makes it painless to flip or slide through endless pages of texts and pictures. There’s even access to a limited number of back issues. In *Wired’s* feed, I was able to go back to March 2018.

![Oh, those big pictures of yummy food.](<|image|>)*Oh, those big pictures of yummy food.*

Search is somewhat hidden under the “Following” button, but it’s worth exploring since it lets you identify channels and topics you want to follow by using the heart icon. While I think it would make sense to make search more prominent, it may be hidden by design. Remember that each issue you open counts as a kind of micro-subscription. Siri also lives inside News+ under the Follow section, and it will helpfully suggest topics and publications based on how you use your device.

![Inside the News+ *Vanity Fair* channel.](<|image|>)*Inside the News+ *Vanity Fair* channel.*

One thing I wish News+ would offer is the ability to mark up or annotate content with the Apple Pencil and share those notes with other News+ members — perhaps to recall the classic newspaper clippings your mom used to send you.

Because, of course, there are a handful of premium subscription newsletters and newspapers beyond the magazine content on News+. Most notable is a [limited version](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the *Wall Street Journal* — rivals like the *Washington Post *and *New York Times *aren’t available, perhaps because of a [rumored 50/50 revenue split](&lt;|url|&gt;) with Apple. *WSJ *content stays on Apple News+ for three days and then disappears.

![](<|image|>)

This much content for $9.99 a month is almost too good to be true, especially because subscribing to any one of these magazines is generally about the same cost as a monthly News+ subscription — though you’ll often get that magazine for an entire year. Still, especially because I can share Apple News+ with my entire family of four, it feels too good to last.

## **Lasting value?**

Every subscriber these magazines collect through News+ is temporary at best. In the old days of print circulation, you could hold on to a subscriber for years (mostly by making it nearly impossible to unsubscribe). Here, every subscription battle fought and won with one issue is potentially lost by the next one.

My concern is that magazines won’t see the bumps in circ numbers that they need for higher per-page ad rates, which means this could be a losing proposition for them, even as they struggle mightily on the real print side. If that happens, publishers will drag Apple back to the negotiating table, and suddenly we’ll be paying $14.99 a month or more.

Some might still consider that a good deal, but will they feel the same when it’s $24.99 a month? I could be wrong. Perhaps Apple has finally broken the mold, figuring out publishing economics where no one else could. But based on my 30-plus years in the business, I highly doubt that.<|endoftext|>

# To Revive the Mac, Apple Wants to Kill Electron

## To Revive the Mac, Apple Wants to Kill Electron

### *The dramatic-sounding Project Catalyst promises a new way forward, but the road is uncertain*

![Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images*

For millions of businesses around the world, desktop apps are a key way to reach customers. Building them is also an expensive, slow job that requires a team of developers and designers — particularly if they’re building for multiple platforms, like Windows, macOS, and Linux, at the same time.

Or it was, anyway, until a framework called Electron came along and completely changed the business model, disrupting the way modern apps are developed. Electron allows developers to use web-based programming languages and tools to write a single set of code that runs on every operating system, while still allowing for device-specific functionality, like the use of media buttons on your keyboard.

Many of the tools you use every day are based on Electron or similar frameworks, including Slack, Visual Studio Code, Spotify, WhatsApp, Discord, and more. Electron has eaten desktop apps whole, and native apps — like, say, Pages for Mac — have struggled as a result. More macOS apps than ever are based on web technologies, and Apple wants to change that.

## Enter Project Catalyst

Electron represents something of an existential crisis for Apple. If developers can build with web-based frameworks, they’re less likely to use Apple’s tools, services, and ultimately, its App Store. That’s especially worrying at a time when sales of Apple’s iPhones seem to be plateauing.

[Project Catalyst](&lt;|url|&gt;), announced at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, is a Hail Mary move designed to bring developers back to the company’s ecosystem. Its goal is to make building a native app as easy as building with Electron. Catalyst makes it easy for developers with iPad apps to port them to the Mac, allowing them to run on the desktop with few changes to the codebase.

Essentially, it’s a very similar approach to Electron, with a major caveat: It only targets one platform, effectively only solving the Apple side of the equation.

In theory, Catalyst has potential to revive developer interest in building Mac apps, and reverse the trend before it’s too late. Unfortunately, Apple failed to make a good case for it.
> # If you don’t know what Jira is, be thankful: It’s one of the most loathed tools developers are forced to use every day

To demo such an exciting framework, you’d expect big names like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, which could theoretically bring off-line video playback to the Mac for the first time — as these apps are already offered on Windows. They weren’t there, nor were any other big names of consequence.

Instead, Apple demonstrated its forward-looking technology in the least interesting way imaginable: by showing project tracking software Jira, a racing game nobody’s heard of, and a handful of other forgettable products. If you don’t know what Jira is, be thankful: It’s one of the most loathed project management tools developers are forced to use every day, and it’s an odd choice as a demonstration of compelling apps on the desktop. If anything, Jira should stay in a web browser.

Twitter is the biggest of the apps announced so far, but we already know that its iPad app is a disappointment, especially compared to its defunct macOS app. On other platforms, Twitter pushes its progressive web app, which is much better — and updated on a regular basis.

If Apple couldn’t find a single big name to bring something unique to the Mac with Catalyst, why would any developer use it over the web technologies they already have access to elsewhere? Sure, it might save some time for developers who happen to be building an iPad app already, but developers like Netflix, which need to build for other platforms anyway, will keep using Electron for other apps. To make use of Catalyst, they’d need to add a bunch more work for a half-baked iPad app that runs on desktop.

This Hail Mary arrived too late, and it won’t even satisfy every developer working on Apple platforms. Instagram, for example, has an iPhone app but not an iPad version — so, no Catalyst here.

A better example of this idea can be found in Chromebooks, where Google allows almost any Android app to be used without modification*.* Want to run Instagram or stream with Spotify’s mobile app? It works as you’d expect, with all of the benefits from the mobile app in tow.

Catalyst shows some promise, but it’s up against harsh business realities. If you’re a company like Slack, it’s cheaper and easier for you to target every desktop platform with Electron, which allows you to get updates out to all of your users faster with one set of code.

It’s great for developers to have more options, but I’d argue that Electron has already eaten native apps whole. As more businesses use it to reach as many customers as possible, it’s more cost-effective, easier to maintain, and it does everything Catalyst does — while building on the existing web codebase.

Catalyst might bring a handful of apps to the Mac, but it’s not the winning play Apple needs. If anything, it’s evidence that Apple will continue to fight against the web becoming the platform of choice — even if it seems the battle is already lost.<|endoftext|>

# Google and Amazon Fought a Smart-Home Battle at CES 2019

## Google and Amazon Fought a Smart-Home Battle at CES 2019

### *Who won? It depends on how you look at it.*

![You could not escape “Hey Google” at CES 2019.](<|image|>)*You could not escape “Hey Google” at CES 2019.*

How much did consumers spend on smart-home technology in 2018? $31.4 billion. That’s how much, [according to Statista](&lt;|url|&gt;). By 2022, it’ll be almost double that.

The obvious leader in all this — the company that owns a significant share of that smart-home industry — is Amazon, which has reportedly sold [100 million Alexa devices](&lt;|url|&gt;). Google, which sells a whole collection of Google Assistant-supporting home devices, controls another chunk. The two companies are locked in a battle for the heart and soul of your smart-home experience, with Apple’s HomeKit standing off to the side. Many smart-home devices were on display at CES 2019, but the tech conference did little to clarify which company is on the path to total market dominance.

Each took a different approach to capture our attention. Google was all shock and awe, blanketing the convention with billboards and constructing a ride in the style of Disney’s It’s a Small World. The thing was so massive, they poured a fresh concrete foundation to support it. Amazon surely spent a fraction of what Google did — I can’t remember a single Alexa billboard — but it still owned huge mindshare across a wide array of vendors at the show. Apple’s HomeKit and Siri remain third wheels, supported by manufacturers along with Alexa and Google Assistant but never front and center. And let’s not forget the Rodney Dangerfield of voice assistants: Samsung’s Bixby, which enjoyed a big play at Samsung’s monolithic CES booth but was mostly absent everywhere else.

Based on the coverage, Amazon Alexa surely emerged triumphant. It was part of so many products, from cars to toilets, that many found it impossible to ignore.

![Google tried harder, but Alexa was everywhere. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*Google tried harder, but Alexa was everywhere. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

But to understand who’s really on top in the voice assistant and smart-home war, you need to look beyond the show floor and consider the state of play in the months and weeks leading up to the world’s largest consumer electronics show.

CES 2019 kicked off just days after we learned about Amazon Alexa’s commanding sales number, but the reality is that [Google’s been making up ground](&lt;|url|&gt;) with a growing number of homemade Google Home gadgets and more and more third-party products supporting Google Assistant. And just a few weeks ago, Apple invited me to a New York office, where it extolled the momentum of its HomeKit platform and previewed a half-dozen or so new smart-home gadgets like [Belkin’s WeMo Smart Light Switch](&lt;|url|&gt;) and the first [HomeKit-compatible video doorbell](&lt;|url|&gt;) from Netatmo.

![Netatmo’s new video doorbell is the first to support Apple HomeKit.](<|image|>)*Netatmo’s new video doorbell is the first to support Apple HomeKit.*

Google, obviously aware of the momentum it had entering CES, simply tried harder. Apple failed to buy booth space and collect all of the gadgets that finally support HomeKit. Can it really afford to sit back and wait for everyone to come knocking?

In the meantime, Amazon’s iconic Alexa blue permeated the show floor. Seriously: The blue light was in clocks, TVs, speakers, locks, and, yes, that [Kohler Numi Alexa toilet](&lt;|url|&gt;). Though Google Assistant’s branding includes blue, red, orange, and green, its most recognizable color at the conference was white: White sweatsuit- and wool-cap-wearing Google spokespeople were as ubiquitous as massage chairs. If I saw one of those white outfits, I knew a Google Assistant gadget was close by.

That juxtaposition — Alexa’s placement in dozens of products that you simply discovered by walking the show floor versus Google using people to demand your attention — was telling.

Without a buzzworthy Google Assistant product, Google resorted to stunts: the people and an honest-to-goodness ride. Clearly modeled on many a classic Disney people-mover experiences, the [Google Ride](&lt;|url|&gt;) took convention-goers on a journey through one typical person’s day, showing them in vivid, animatronic detail how they could manage their lives via voice and smart-home connectivity. It also ended with people getting a free Google Home Hub.


It was a memorable experience, but why does Google feel like it has to hit people over the heads to drive home how wonderful their lives will be through automation? Amazon grew to 100 million Alexa installs without major product launch events or truly memorable CES booths. This year, it built an elegant and [relatively subdued space](&lt;|url|&gt;) with an Alexa-enabled BMW at the center.

On the surface, Amazon appears to be winning without really trying. Most people I talked to about Google’s ride were giddy but worried it was overkill. They were also equally aware of Amazon’s looming presence and Alexa’s inescapable reach.

However, to say Amazon is winning simply because of ubiquity would be wrong. It started with a product and technology that worked without forcing consumers to fundamentally alter how they live. In the smart-home space, that matters. In some ways, Amazon followed a consumer technology road first paved by Nest, which is now owned by Google.

During the show, I met designer [Fred Bould](&lt;|url|&gt;), who helped design GoPro’s Hero 3 and the original Nest smart thermostat. He’s now involved with a new thermostat called [Daikin One Smart Thermostat](&lt;|url|&gt;) (which supports both Alexa and Google Assistant). Bould and I talked about why the original Nest was such a breakthrough product in the smart-home space. When Nest first launched in 2011, smart-home technology was far from a new idea. Yet Nest was undeniably the breakthrough product. Bould told me about how carefully they managed the design. The interface was thought out when he came on board, but the look and feel of the product and how users would interact with it was not. He described the incredible attention to detail they applied to the industrial design.

I wasn’t surprised. When I installed a first-generation Nest in my home, I was struck by the marriage of simplicity, ease of use, and obvious intelligence. It made sense, and it worked.

Amazon’s Echo was that kind of product. No, it wasn’t as elegant a design as the Nest, but as soon as I unpacked it, connected Echo to my network, and spoke to Alexa, I understood how to use it, and it understood me. It was the perfect way to introduce Alexa and smart-home automation to my home and millions of others.

Another key Amazon ingredient: openness. Amazon’s early, canny decision to open Alexa’s APIs is why the technology can be found in everything from a BMW to a tiny startup’s clock radio. Google Assistant is also open, but because of a later start, it’s still playing catch-up. HomeKit is closed in typical Apple fashion, and the company says that’s for a good reason. A closed system with vetted products means easier on-boarding, single sign-on, no personal data in the cloud, and tighter security. That all may be true, but that closed approach — and the lack of a cheap smart speaker — has left Apple’s HomeKit trailing far behind.

Sure, Amazon probably won the mini smart-home battle of CES 2019, but this war for the smart-home hearts and minds is far from over. Google is gaining traction, and as I’ve always said, [don’t bet against Apple](&lt;|url|&gt;).<|endoftext|>

# Google Can’t Figure Out What YouTube Is

## And its users are suffering for it

![Animation by [Nicole Ginelli](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Animation by [Nicole Ginelli](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Is YouTube [a music service](&lt;|url|&gt;) or a [movie rental store](&lt;|url|&gt;)? A space for news outlets or [beauty vloggers](&lt;|url|&gt;)? Is it for [video essays](&lt;|url|&gt;) or [game streamers](&lt;|url|&gt;)? For years, Google has wanted the answer to be a simple, “Yes, all of the above.” Today’s [shutdown of the YouTube Gaming hub](&lt;|url|&gt;) shows the actual answer is a lot fuzzier than that.

YouTube occupies a unique position somewhere between a TV-like service — where it gets its name — and a social network. Its core function of hosting and sharing videos is useful to a wide variety of communities with wildly different needs. Some of these needs are even contradictory, such as shopping channels that need to monetize products, versus news channels that attempt to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest. Google has attempted to reconcile this clashing platform identity in recent years by spinning off pieces into independent hubs, but it’s unclear if that strategy is working or if it helps those who get left behind.

YouTube Gaming was meant to be one of those hubs. When [it first launched in 2015](&lt;|url|&gt;), YouTube Gaming was a separate mobile and web app designed to leverage the massive gaming community already on YouTube and turn it into a competitor to Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. At the time, YouTube proper lacked features that would make the site better for creators making gaming content, like the ability to browse livestreams or explore all videos related to a single game. A separate app would let Google more carefully serve the needs of this one community without changing the entire site for everyone else.

There was just one problem: People didn’t use it. In September of 2018, Google told *The Verge*, “There was confusion with the gaming app,” which led users to skip it. They just used the main YouTube app instead. While [200 million users watch gaming content on the main YouTube app every month](&lt;|url|&gt;), so few used the separate app that Google has decided to get rid of it entirely. Now the features the app spawned are being moved to [a tucked away section of YouTube](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # Someone who uses YouTube for music doesn’t need to browse people live-streaming games, while someone who watches for games doesn’t really need to upload their own music

Google faces a similar problem with music on its platform. [A 2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) estimated that 46% of all the time spent streaming music across 13 major world markets came from YouTube. That’s more than all other music streaming services, like Spotify or Apple Music, combined. This has led to a reported $6 billion in ad revenue paid out to the music industry [as of September 2018](&lt;|url|&gt;), though some reports suggest that [YouTube pays out less](&lt;|url|&gt;) than other streaming services. In 2018, after accidentally conquering the music market, Google tried to do it intentionally by [launching YouTube Music](&lt;|url|&gt;). Eventually, the company says, this will replace the existing Google Play Music service.

At least, that’s the plan anyway. Google said YouTube Music would get [all the best features ](&lt;|url|&gt;)of its older music service, but in the year since, progress has been slow. One of Google Play Music’s defining features (aside from a cumbersome name) is the ability to upload your own music library and play it across your devices. So far, this feature hasn’t come to YouTube Music. In a statement to *OneZero*, Google confirmed it still plans to build this feature, but didn’t provide a timeline for the transition. Meanwhile, the app can [play music files stored locally on your phone](&lt;|url|&gt;), but it’s a far cry from what Google’s own standalone music service can already do.

Someday, the company may decide to change course on YouTube Music, just as it did with YouTube Gaming. The company [doesn’t break down](&lt;|url|&gt;) how or where it makes money through YouTube, so it’s hard for an outside observer to tell what niches within the platform — with its [two billion monthly users](&lt;|url|&gt;) — are worthwhile to Google.

But this conflict points to a larger issue Google faces with serving its users. The features and infrastructure required by one community may differ drastically from another. Someone who uses YouTube for music doesn’t need to browse livestreamed games, while someone who watches for games doesn’t really need to upload their own music. Neither might want to rent movies on the platform.

YouTube also plays host to niches that get far less attention. Dr. Sophie Bishop, Teaching Fellow in Digital Economy and Society at King’s College London, has studied the beauty vlogging community. For beauty vloggers, she explains, features like being able to sell or link to specific products would benefit creators, but so far Google hasn’t provided them.

“What Instagram has provided that YouTube hasn’t is this shoppable experience… in a way that’s reasonably attractive and complies with different kinds of regulation,” says Bishop. “Because of the way the beauty communities make their money, there needs to be an ability to purchase or label products.”

Instagram allows its creators to [sell products directly on its platform](&lt;|url|&gt;), complete with browsable photos and a full checkout system. Google has announced that [YouTube will eventually get similar functionality](&lt;|url|&gt;) as part of a broader update to its Google Shopping platform. While this might help product reviewers, YouTube’s algorithm can work against them. In recent years, the site has prioritized longer watch times, making [lengthier videos more successful than shorter ones](&lt;|url|&gt;). Longer videos means better placement in the algorithm, more opportunities for mid-roll ads, and more money for creators. This benefits educators, video essayists, and other creators who relish more time to discuss topics at length. Yet it works against people who make tutorials or succinct product reviews.

“It takes as long as it takes to put makeup on your face,” explains Bishop. To meet the length requirements, beauty vloggers have increased the number of products they review or the time it takes to get ready, which doesn’t always go over as well. “Beauty bloggers are [coming under quite a lot of scrutiny](&lt;|url|&gt;) because of the environmental implications of literally ordering 30 dresses [just to try] them on.”

Then there’s yet another underserved YouTube segment: news outlets. Journalistic organizations don’t need to sell products with flashy checkout features. Instead, they’re better served by features that help users find context and more information about the story they’re presented. Google has demonstrated it wants to take news more seriously by [adding some new features](&lt;|url|&gt;) to YouTube to help users get more information on a news story. However, the problem is that these features only show up when a user actively searches for political topics. If users aren’t searching for news, these features are invisible.

Dr. Grant Blank of the [Oxford Internet Institute](&lt;|url|&gt;) suggests that better search tools could help keep viewers out of political echo chambers, but not if users don’t know about them. According to Blank’s [research on the topic](&lt;|url|&gt;), users who seek out information on a topic tend to find a broader view on a subject and, in doing so, avoid falling into echo chambers. This falls apart when users don’t know how to find that information in the first place. “Many people are reluctant to use tools like search, because they feel like they don’t know how to use them,” Blank explains. “So simple, basic search training on how to find things would be helpful for lots of people.”

Another Google product, [Google News](&lt;|url|&gt;), has a better version of what YouTube has attempted to do. A feature called Full Coverage collects related stories from a variety of news sources so readers can get a clearer picture of the topic. The button to activate this feature is attached to most stories, right in the app. “The [Full Coverage] button appears to pay more attention to the political slant of the particular new organization, if there is one,” explains Blank. “It seems to me that would tend to reduce the possibility that people would find themselves in echo chambers.”

YouTube has no such feature. You can find related videos on the sidebar just like on any other video, but they might not be germane to the topic or represent a wide range of perspectives like the Full Coverage feature. Depending on your viewing history, you might not even get videos on the topic at all. If a viewer lands on a Fox News video about the president, there may be no way for that viewer to find any coverage from another outlet unless they’re specifically seeking it out.

This reveals the fundamental conflict within YouTube. By trying to be a music service, a gaming platform, a product review site, a news broadcast, and so many other products at once, it can’t excel at being any of them. Even Google’s other products are often better at serving the niches that exist within the video platform. The YouTube Gaming app may be gone, but it will live in the sidebar as a stark reminder that, below the surface, YouTube’s communities have needs that a generic, massive platform just can’t meet.<|endoftext|>

# Inside The Race to Build the Netflix of Food

## Kraft-Heinz’s Evolv is using the algorithmic analysis pioneered by tech companies to help us plan our meals

![Photo: Joel Sharpe/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Joel Sharpe/Getty Images*
> “Food is the single most important habit that we have as human beings. What we’re doing is bigger than tech, it’s bigger than food, it’s bigger than I think any of the things that I’ve worked in my career. We’re fundamentally changing how people think about the single most important habit of their lives.”
> *– Mani Gopalakrishnan, VP of Digital Innovation for Kraft-Heinz*

Food and technology are having a moment.

The love affair began in the 2000s, when companies like Seamless burst onto the scene. Then came Blue Apron, which knew that the value of food wasn’t merely in the food itself, but rather in the social experience of making it. So-called [“track and trace” companies](&lt;|url|&gt;) have since taken center stage by offering interested parties unprecedented insight into every aspect of their food: where it’s from, how long it traveled from farm to table, what it’s been exposed to, if it was produced on a farm with GMOs, and more.

We’re still very much in the top half of the first inning in terms of maximizing what food can be to people, for two main reasons: 1) a lack of data-driven solutions to deliver convenience and personalization to consumers at scale thanks to the messy nature of consumer packaged goods (CPG) data, and 2) the food value chain is organized around retailers, not consumers.

Some companies are attempting to solve these problems, and the race is officially on to create the Netflix of food.

It’s crucial to understand that massive companies are borne out of shifts in the technology landscape. Uber was only able to launch once the mobile phone reached a certain saturation point. Likewise, the Netflix moment for food is only possible in a world where technology can index nutritional data from millions, if not billions of people, and turn those insights into useful solutions for consumers.

That moment is now, and one company on the precipice of realizing it is [Evolv](&lt;|url|&gt;), Kraft-Heinz’s answer to the future of food.

“How many gallons of milk can consumers carry in two hands? How many fit on a grocery store shelf? These are the questions CPG brands have traditionally asked,” says Nina Barton, Chief Executive Officer at Evolv. “In today’s demand-driven world, the brands that win will be the ones that are focused not on the constraints of the retailer, but on the individual needs of the consumer.”

To many, this might not be front-page news. The internet has shifted power from those who control supply to those who control demand. However, in the food world, this shift has yet to play out at scale for CPG brands. Food companies must now serve the needs of their consumer — as opposed to the constraints of the retailer — if they want to win.

As [David Perell](&lt;|url|&gt;) points out in “[The Pivot to Owned Commerce](&lt;|url|&gt;),” algorithmic analysis was instrumental in creating *House of Cards*. Netflix used its access to vast amounts of data on consumption habits from its audience members to learn that people loved the West Wing, David Fincher, and Kevin Spacey. The result? A $100 million investment in a show that [changed Netflix’s trajectory forever](&lt;|url|&gt;).

What stops Evolv taking the same approach to food? Nothing. In fact, they’re already working on their own *House of Cards*.

The core of Evolv is its food intelligence platform, which it inherited via acquisition last year from a San-Francisco-based food startup. The A.I.-driven platform brings together diverse domains of unstructured data around groceries, meals, nutrition, and the health impacts of certain foods.

This food intelligence platform powers [Meal Hero](&lt;|url|&gt;), Evolv’s first consumer-facing product. Internally, the company describes it as the world’s best meal planning tool, seamlessly connected to grocery e-commerce. In short, Meal Hero aims to recreate the experience of having a personal chef and nutritionist in your home.
> # “People have big dreams in this domain. Yet, they’re often hard to achieve because of the complex optimization problem around food. I truly believe that people would love to be nudged towards their dreams, especially if their dream path is the easier road. Our job is to make the right path the easy path, and I believe the most effective and scalable way to do that is through technology.”
> # — Erik Andrejko, Chief Technology Officer, Evolv

Evolv has trained its food intelligence platform on 9 million-plus recipes by world-class chefs, nutritionists, and culinary experts. As such, Evolv not only has access to insights its competitors would kill for, but also the unique ability to build consumer-facing applications that better serve consumers (e.g. Meal Hero).

Internally, Evolv’s leadership is bullish on Meal Hero’s ability to improve how consumers experience food. As Tjarko Leifer, Head of Product, puts it:
> Figuring out what’s for dinner tonight is a really tough multidimensional challenge for families to solve. It’s the sort of thing that is really hard for people to keep in their heads but something that software can be really good at.

![](<|image|>)

Leifer’s right.

Deciding what to cook for dinner is a complex optimization problem, and undoubtedly one of the most important facing us as a society. In a world where [over 60% of American adults are overweight or obese](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [over 30% of Americans are either prediabetic or have type 2 diabetes](&lt;|url|&gt;), nudging the world towards better nutritional choices every night has transformative potential.

Evolv’s leadership believes its consumer-first data-driven approach can fundamentally transform the food value chain. Again, as Andrejko says:
> If you look at the food system today, every player in that food system is just doing what you would probably do as a rational person if you were in their shoes. A farmer grows these crops because it’s suitable for their land and there are people who will pay good money for that crop. So every single person in that chain is responding to their customers.

Andrejko’s point is simple yet profound: Today’s food system is entirely determined by consumer behavior and decision-making. If you can change those behaviors through technology and nudge customers towards new goals, you can revolutionize the entire food chain. Not to mention the fact that technology enables the nudges to become so personalized that you’re able to meet any customer where they are regarding food intolerances, allergies, likes, dislikes, and lifestyle.

In their book, *Nudge*, behavioral economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein describe the power of the nudge as “[Gently pushing people towards] choosing actions that are intended to make [them] better off *as defined by themselves*.”

This gets at the crux of why Evolv has the capacity to become so transformative. People want to eat well; no one is sitting around thinking of ways to do the opposite. Yet corporations that prioritize money over health realized the power of the nudge decades ago, and have been “nudging” consumers towards suboptimal decisions — fast food, empty calories, refined sugars — ever since.
> # “Would you like to eat better? Of course you would. I’ve never had someone tell me, ‘No I’d love to eat worse.’”
> # — Erik Andrejko, Chief Technology Officer, Evolv

Kraft-Heinz and Evolv now have the capability to “nudge” people toward behaviors that fundamentally improve their lives without consumers even realizing they’re making better decisions. This is radical personalization and convenience — and a transformative ability to improve lives at scale.

We’ve seen this model play out already with brands like Peloton. The genius of Peloton is not that it sells fitness equipment, but rather the glory that comes with a fit lifestyle. Similarly, Evolv isn’t selling food. It’s selling something far more powerful: a better and healthier version of you.

Now, this won’t be easy. Companies that deal in our data — Facebook and Google, namely — have achieved massive success precisely because consumers didn’t understand how their business models worked. But the beauty of Evolv’s model is transparency around how it works, which the company hopes will drive adoption.

The reason for this is simple: Our world is plagued with issues surrounding health, people know it, and they’re demanding a solution.

In the past few centuries diabetes and heart disease — conditions borne of the food we eat and the lives we live — have replaced war, famine, infectious diseases, and death in childbirth as primary health concerns. If Evolv one day operates at scale, it could very well spell the end of these issues. Once consumers understand that an algorithm can help them become healthier and improved versions of themselves — as opposed to simply giving them another show to watch or another pointless object to buy — adoption will skyrocket.
> # “Food is the single most important habit that we have as human beings. What we’re doing is bigger than tech, it’s bigger than food, it’s bigger than I think any of the things that I’ve worked in my career. We’re fundamentally changing how people think about the single most important habit of their lives.”
> # – Mani Gopalakrishnan, VP of Digital Innovation for Kraft-Heinz

This will transform how food producers operate, too. Consider that for Netflix, owning the relationship with consumers offers content creators a profoundly improved understanding of what audiences want. In the entertainment industry, this is one thing — producers can use data to inform the production of shows like *House of Card*s, knowing the show will be a hit almost before it’s released. But, at the end of the day, its impact is limited: audiences are deprived of half a day of their lives every year or so, and they have something to discuss with people they don’t share anything in common with.

This isn’t meant to knock Netflix — entertainment is important, but our health matters more. While Netflix’s model has the potential to impact human lives in an incredibly meaningful way, in all likelihood, that impact will not come from within Netflix itself. Rather, it will come from a company like Evolv, and a food-based ecosystem that allows them to take ownership of the customer relationship, return data back to suppliers so they can create the next great wave of consumer-facing products, and present those products to consumers to help them reach health goals they’ve set for themselves.

This is Netflix’s model, repurposed to serve what is arguably humanity’s single greatest need at scale. It’s an algorithm whose success could spell the end of modernity’s diseases — obesity, diabetes, and the like — and help people realize better versions of themselves through what they eat and how they live.

Evolv is focused on positively impacting lives at scale, and helping both individuals and families who want to better manage their own health do so as seamlessly as possible.

This is not about making people’s lives easier. Rather, it is about improving people’s circumstances. It’s about giving people options beyond what’s easy, and recognizing that they’re ready to accept what’s meaningful. It’s about making sure their experience in an essential part of their lives is optimized for whatever the best possible version of that life is.<|endoftext|>

# How Big Printer Is Trying to Crush the Counterfeit Ink Trade

## How Big Printer Is Trying to Crush the Counterfeit Ink Trade

### *That great deal you found on Amazon may have a dark side*

![Credit: vladacanon/iStock/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: vladacanon/iStock/Getty Images Plus*

The team moves through a dark, narrow hallway, emerging into a room crammed with an odd sort of contraband: toner and ink cartridges stacked almost to the ceiling. Authorities question a woman who deflects at first before finally admitting that all of them are counterfeits.

The video, shot in India and shared with me by Hewlett-Packard (HP Inc), illustrates the raids local authorities have conducted hundreds of times around the world to try and stem the flow of counterfeit ink and toner cartridges. It’s reminiscent of a drug bust, and the economic stakes are nearly as high.

According to the [Imaging Supplies Coalition](&lt;|url|&gt;) (ISC), an organization representing the business interests of companies like HP, Epson, and Canon, counterfeit printer consumables cost the industry $3 billion a year. Given how much an official ink replacement costs, you probably think the industry can afford the loss.

But as [*Consumer Reports* pointed out](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year, there are a couple reasons these companies charge as much as they do for your ink. The first is the most obvious: You’re paying off your printer when you buy ink. The cost of printers is low because, in the long run, printer manufacturers make more on ink. But in the short term, these companies have to pay for the cost of components, as well as developing and building the printer to begin with. In addition, the ink and toner cartridges are more than just containers—they’re complex (read: expensive) pieces of technology.

![Seized counterfeit toner cartridges. Photo courtesy Hewlett-Packard](<|image|>)*Seized counterfeit toner cartridges. Photo courtesy Hewlett-Packard*

HP and the ISC wouldn’t comment on consumer frustration with the high cost of ink, but they both acknowledge that people naturally look online for the best ink prices they can find. These knockoff deals supposedly lead to HP fielding customer complaints, even though HP didn’t sell them the bogus printer supplies.

“When you have a brand that carries this amount of customer recognition and trust, there’s always somebody trying to capitalize on that brand trust,” says Eduardo Macias, director of brand protection at Hewlett-Packard.

HP, though, is not alone in its efforts to stamp out counterfeit supplies. Epson also works with local authorities around the world to [support anti-counterfeiting raids](&lt;|url|&gt;).

## **The Buyers**

Counterfeit printing supplies predate modern inkjet and laser printer technology. In 1994, the printer industry founded the ISC. Back in those days, ISC president Allen D. Westerfield tells me, the industry was dealing with counterfeit ribbons, dot matrix printer supplies, and typewriter wheels. Ribbons were literally being reinked and repackaged by counterfeiters. As the print industry shifted to inkjet and laser printers, the counterfeit consumables market shifted to toner and ink cartridges.

Then came the internet and e-commerce, which catalyzed an explosion of counterfeit goods. The trade is large and profitable, there’s a ready supply of spent cartridges to refill and resell, and there’s the obvious value proposition to consumers looking for the best prices. “The internet and e-commerce made it easier,” Westerfield says.

Search results for ink or toner cartridges in Amazon, Google, and eBay are a mix of legitimate and counterfeit supplies, though there’s virtually no way for you to tell the difference until you get the cartridge in your hands or put it in your printer.
> # Hewlett-Packard executives told me that for small businesses buying in bulk, counterfeit products are sorted into 90% of deliveries.

HP has for some time used hard-to-duplicate holographic labels on its cartridges, and its printers can detect counterfeit cartridges and advise users to remove them before they start printing.

Still, it might be hard to overcome that satisfaction of simply paying less for your consumables, especially if you’re a business that buys toner and ink cartridges in bulk. In those instances, counterfeit might even be mixed in with legitimate supplies. HP executives told me that for small businesses buying in bulk, counterfeit products are sorted into 90% of deliveries.

For consumers, the best way to avoid counterfeit consumables might be going analog and buying supplies at your local brick-and-mortar store. Experts told me it’s highly unlikely they’ll encounter counterfeit ink at, say, their local Staples.

## **Unprintable Crimes**

Inside counterfeit ink and toner supplies is, surprisingly, real ink and toner. However, the ink is sometimes mixed with water, and the quality of the toner is unlikely match what you’ll find from legit suppliers. HP told me that these supplies generally don’t last as long as genuine products, and they can’t be guaranteed for things like water resistance and colorfastness in normal daylight conditions. In addition, using unauthorized consumables can void your printer warranty.

There are also environmental concerns. “One of the challenges for end users… is that you have no idea what chemical components, what plastic, what electronics have been used in the making of these cartridges,” says Hewlett-Packard’s Macias, who adds that the company has seized some counterfeit supplies that use materials banned in Europe.

Even if you dismiss the environmental concerns and print quality (how much do offices that print thousands of pages per month care about colorfastness?), the counterfeit ink trade is not, according to HP, a victimless crime.

There is “the misinformation on consumer side: ‘I’m buying a knockoff product, saving a little money, what harm am I doing?’” Macias says. But the reality is that those dealing in counterfeit goods, even those as mundane as printer consumables, are often involved in other illegal activities.
> # Last year, Hewlett-Packard was involved in 500 separate raids, in which they confiscated 170 million counterfeit toner products and components.

The organizations behind counterfeit ink and toner cartridges are, Macias claims, “big organized crime organizations.” Unlike, say, the drug trade, counterfeit consumables can, from the outside, look just like a legitimate business. Macias tells me that some of the storefronts selling these supplies in the tech malls of India have no idea they’re selling illegal goods. But that low-profile, high-traffic business can fund other, more dire crimes.

“No rational consumer would choose to support organizations that endorse human trafficking, arms trafficking,” Macias s.

Authorities don’t typically raid these storefronts. Instead, HP, Epson, and other printer manufacturers work with local authorities to identify the original source. That involves a lot of time, patience, and surveillance. Local law enforcement will usually conduct the raid, while some of, say, HP’s regional investigation managers will tag along to identify the counterfeits and, later, testify about what they discovered. Last year, HP was involved in 500 separate raids, in which they confiscated 170 million counterfeit toner products and components.

![Counterfeit ink packaging. Image courtesy Hewlett-Packard](<|image|>)*Counterfeit ink packaging. Image courtesy Hewlett-Packard*

Identifying counterfeits isn’t always easy, especially if counterfeiters are using original manufacturer’s cartridges. Sometimes, however, the counterfeiters make it easier by trying to do more. During a recent raid in Egypt, investigators found counterfeiters manufacturing their own knockoff packaging, which is easy for investigators to identify.

## **Beating the Knockoffs**

Stemming the flow of fake products is a multipronged effort. In addition to on-the-ground enforcement, Westerfield says the industry needs more control over products on the internet. HP works closely with Amazon to try and head off counterfeit results. But Westerfield told me the industry has to do “a better job of educating the consumer and user about what problems are caused by counterfeit products.”

The industry may get some help from the U.S. government. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing government agencies to investigate [how counterfeit and pirated goods end up in the United States](&lt;|url|&gt;). “If you’ve seen the latest Trump executive directive, he has asked several agencies to look into problem that inappropriate marketing has caused to us economically… [H]e’s basically talking about counterfeiting,” Westerfield says.

The executive order tangentially addresses another growing threat to the ink and toner industry: third-party inks that abuse original patents to build what are essentially duplicates. Unlike counterfeits, these cartridges are marketed under the companies’ own brand names.

For now, the plan is to continue working with agencies around the world to stem the flow of counterfeit consumables, improve their own technology to make it harder to create and sell fake consumables, and educate consumers and businesses on the downsides of using counterfeit ink and toner cartridges.

“When you take that multipronged approach, I do feel like we’re winning,” Macias says.

Perhaps, but back in India, ink and toner counterfeiters are posting bail and, two months later, returning to their fake ink businesses.<|endoftext|>

# It’s Time to Reboot the Startup Economy

## The new laws and antitrust actions that would resurrect American innovation

![Photo: [NurPhoto](&lt;|url|&gt;)/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: [NurPhoto](&lt;|url|&gt;)/Getty Images*

For more than a century now, the key economic advantage of the United States has been its startup economy and capacity for launching new industries. This is innovation, yes, but of a particularly important kind. It is not just the improvement of mousetraps, but rather the pioneering of entire industries that, in time, come to employ millions and generate trillions. Being the place companies get their start has given the United States an extraordinary advantage over the last century, and helped make it the world’s preeminent economic power.

But this advantage, which we sometimes take for granted, is now threatened by excessive consolidation in the U.S. economy. The most obvious symptom is the decline of the American startup. As [a recent Brooking study](&lt;|url|&gt;) shows, startup rates have declined dramatically across the economy. In an extraordinary development, the number of companies shutting down has grown to match the number that are starting up. The Department of Labor [shows](&lt;|url|&gt;) a declining number of people working for startups, while the Center for American Entrepreneurship [documents](&lt;|url|&gt;) a relative decline in American VC funding relative to the rest of the world. We may, in short, be entering a “startup winter.” This is a problem that affects many industries, but is particularly obvious in the Internet economy.

There will, of course, be those who resist the implication that anything is amiss. Some argue that all is well, that the big guys are friendly giants, and really all we need to do is stop worrying and [learn to love our national champions](&lt;|url|&gt;). When it comes to the platform economy we need not fear, because the giants will either invent everything, or buy whoever is. And venture capitalists can invest in startups confident that everyone will earn their payout.

I do not agree with this perspective. [Economic structure matters](&lt;|url|&gt;), and I fear that the United States is losing a vital capacity: of being the best place for new industries to get their start. We are becoming a country of giant concerns, admirable in their way, but where incremental improvement is the norm, where bureaucracy rules, and stagnation may be inevitable. We will become a country where inventors and entrepreneurs dream of being bought, not of building something of their own. While it once seemed impossible, the Internet is becoming the case study of that development.

The solution, I believe, should be a broad effort to reboot the startup economy. That can be done not through one policy or passing any single law. It requires a thoughtful yet forceful reassertion of the bundle of pro-innovative laws and policies which have made up the best of American innovation policy over the last century. I see three essential elements in that policy:

* Pro-competitive laws and regulations (also known as [“competition catalysts”](&lt;|url|&gt;));

* The reassertion of antitrust, including retroactive merger review; and

* The funding of visionary research projects, in the spirit of the ARPANET, both basic and applied.

These policies have several things in common. They open the economy by reducing barriers to entry — in economic jargon, [“lower rivals’ costs.”](&lt;|url|&gt;) They reduce the power of older companies to control the new, allowing new industries to arise on their own. And they give newer or smaller competitors the opportunity to compete with larger concerns. Collectively, this mixture of policies and rules have had an extraordinary track record in putting the United States in a position of technological leadership in the world. It is to this, the best practices of the last century, to which we should return.

Let me turn now to the Web, the specific topic of this hearing. Eleven years ago I was in San Francisco doing research for a book, [*The Master Switch*,](&lt;|url|&gt;) and thinking about the historic cycles of technological innovation. In that research I noticed a pattern. Big inventions break open industries, leading to the birth of new and innovative industries, and a characteristic pattern of hundreds if not thousands of startups.

But that doesn’t last. The new industry is prone, after some time, to consolidation, monopolization, and in time, stagnation that can last for decades. And, importantly, once consolidation occurs, existing industries often try to co-opt or prevent the emergence of new industries — the so-called “Kronos effect.” That was the pattern for the telephone, radio, television, cable, automobile and many other “high tech” industries.

The question, back in the 2000s, is whether the same might happen to the web. At the time, the idea that the web might undergo consolidation seemed crazy. Many, in fact, believed it impossible. The web was intrinsically different, went the prevailing wisdom: it was open by design, and new entrants would always be “one click away.” No firm could expect to hold lasting power: the 5- year-old firm was already middle-aged; the 8-year was on life support. For this was an ecosystem, not an industry, and ecosystems just don’t tolerate monopoly.

Ten years later, at the risk of stating the obvious, things look a little different. History has, in fact, repeated itself and traditional economics — matters like economies of scale — have reasserted themselves. The ecosystem has been replaced, and the idea that the web is dominated by a handful of large firms is a mystery to no one.

A symbolically key moment, in retrospect, was in 2012, [when Facebook bought Instagram.](&lt;|url|&gt;) At the time, Facebook was about 8 years old, ancient in web terms, and seemed destined to be replaced by something like Instagram; something newer, better, and more in tune with a younger generation. But Facebook broke the narrative by buying Instagram — paying double the previous offer — and managing to get the merger past the Federal Trade Commission despite documentary evidence that the merger was intended to eliminate a nascent competitor.

That moment demonstrated the power of buyouts to eliminate competitive threats, and the willingness of government to let a threatened firm get away with it. Today, the 2019, the old slogan that competition is one click away seems like a bad joke. Unlike in 2008, the big firms seem in no danger of fading under the onslaught of smaller rivals. Instead (often in violation of the antitrust laws) most of those would-be rivals have been bought or effectively tamed. I’m not alone in this assessment. Most Silicon Valley observers, from Mary Meeker through Tim O’Reilly believe that the American tech is in a lull, innovation-wise. We can tell by the conversations: instead of talking about a crazy new firm that is trying something new, the talk is all “what will Google do? What will Amazon launch?” Or, alternatively, we talk about China is up to. That, to my mind, is a sign of where things stand.

I don’t think “rely on the giants” is a good innovation policy for this country. We’ve tried it before: in telecommunications for almost 70 years, in the car industry for many decades, and in many other industries as well. It is not as if giant firms don’t innovate, but they do so incrementally, carefully, and in a way designed to protect their existing revenue streams. Over the last century, competitive, open sectors — ecosystems — have proved themselves superior to those monopolized or dominated by a “big three” or “big four.”

Fortunately, it is not too late to act. The United States has faced excessive consolidation before, and found ways to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in cycles where dominance is the pattern. Looking back at the 20th century, three major tools were employed.

The first was regulatory: so called [“competition catalysts,”](&lt;|url|&gt;) laws and regulations that limit the power of monopolists or other dominant firms exercise power beyond its market, and to treat fairly those who depend on it. The telecom laws and net neutrality are the key examples of this approach, but there are others as well, like the rules that force optometrists to issue written prescriptions so that you can buy glasses anywhere. In telecom, the government fostered the growth of industries “on top” of AT&T’s network (and “at the ends”), limiting AT&T to providing transmission. That policy led to the birth of the first dial-up network providers, AOL and Compuserve, and ultimately, in the 1990s what we now call the mass Internet.

The second is the use of antitrust, the topic of this hearing. The United States brought a trilogy of tech cases — AT&T, IBM, and Microsoft — that I see as foundational in terms of shaking up industry and creating room for new firms and new industries to grow. At the time, for each of those cases, the naysayers suggested that the law was obsolete, that monopoly was inherently fragile, or that to interfere with America’s national champions would simply hand the future to Japan — a country that knew how to support its tech companies, not attack them.

Yet in retrospect, the breakup of AT&T, and the challenges to IBM and Microsoft helped create the tech economy we now take for granted, along with American leadership in the sector. This is not to say that the engineers, entrepreneurs and capital markets are undeserving of the credit they are given. But it is to say that technologies like the personal computer, the emergence of a software industry, the ISP industry, the web, and even the very companies we discuss today benefited from the economic structure created by both regulatory action and antitrust.

“I do not believe in trust-busting for trust-busting’s sake,” as Robert Jackson once said. But I do believe, after a century of experience, that industries do consolidate, that today’s vibrant and dynamic industries can get too large and begin to stagnate. The American car industry, for example, was considering a highly innovative industry in the 1950s, but by the 1970s was showing severe signs of consolidation and lack of entry.

One key tool we need to make more use of is retroactive review of mergers that have led to anticompetitive consequences. Today, almost all merger review is prospective; but predictions are hard, especially about the future. The antitrust agencies are, I believe, beginning to develop ways to look at mergers retrospectively under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, or consider a merger as part of a program of monopoly maintenance under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, but this a key for fixing a big blind spot in antitrust enforcement.

The third is government’s own investment in innovative research projects. The Internet, we often forget, began as a bold and visionary project funded by the federal government. Importantly, it didn’t have a business model, nor need to make money — instead, it served as a platform for others to launch from, including all of the platforms who are here today. If the Apollo moon project remains the most visible example of government-backed engineering achievement, the spin-offs and spillovers from the Internet project have clearly yielded more, overall for the American people than any other.

One of the best ways to see the advantage of this bundle of policies is by comparison. It is almost natural to worship great and powerful companies, and they have a way of becoming favorites of government. But the nations who fully embraced and supported their tech powers in the 1970s and 80s — Europe and Japan — have fallen behind. The United States forced its companies to face the heat of competition created opportunities for the new and the unknown, and has benefited greatly from that approach.

In fact, what makes the United States so distinctive is that, just about every decade, it produces new winners. We aren’t waiting around seeing what IBM and Hewlett-Packard, the powers of the 1970s will do next, and we should not have an innovation policy that consists of depending on what Google, Facebook and Amazon will do or who they will buy.

In closing, we must never forget that the story of America’s preeminence in the tech industry is not a story of just one actor or set of actors. It has been a joint project that involves engineers, entrepreneurs, managers, investors, venture capitalists, and also wise action and thoughtful setting of the ground rules by government. It is a grave mistake to confuse wisdom with doing nothing; for doing nothing is its own form of industrial policy, one that has not served us in the long run.

# You Shouldn’t Fear Amazon’s Alexa

## You Shouldn’t Fear Amazon’s Alexa

### *Why paranoia about digital voice assistants is overblown*

![Credit: David Becker/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: David Becker/Getty Images*

*Star Trek* vs. George Orwell’s *1984*. No two cultural touchstones better illustrate our diametrically opposed feelings about voice systems.

*Star Trek*’s always listening, ever-helpful Computer represents the highest ideal of a digital assistant, while Orwell’s Telescreen, with its “Big Brother is watching” messages, was emblematic of our darkest fears. With each passing year and digital assistant breakthrough, we vacillate wildly between these two perspectives.

*Bloomberg* recently reported that Amazon was employing [thousands of humans](&lt;|url|&gt;) to comb through utterances and transcribe what we say to Amazon’s Echo-based voice assistant. The revelation broke an unspoken agreement between Amazon and the millions of Echo and Alexa-enabled device owners who assumed that only algorithms, not humans in a back office somewhere, would be analyzing our words for meaning.

Amazon isn’t Big Brother, but its 613,000 employees and [$232.89 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) in annual sales revenue puts it at nation-state scale, raising concerns about a company with that much power listening in on our private conversations

Upon learning of this, many of us, myself included, paused to remember those moments when Alexa responded even when we didn’t utter the “Alexa” watchword. What did we say to prompt it, and what was Amazon doing with the information?

In reality, not much. Amazon didn’t deny its use of flesh and blood people to dip into the Alexa conversation stream, plucking words and sentences for its own purpose. However, those purposes were, as Amazon tried to make clear in its official response, more benign than anything Orwell might have imagined: “We only annotate an extremely small sample of Alexa voice recordings in order [to] improve the customer experience. For example, this information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, so Alexa can better understand your requests, and ensure the service works well for everyone.”

It went on to say that those transcribed conversations are not connected to any personally identifiable information.
> # Amazon has probably heard and transcribed some pretty bizarre and very personal conversations. So what? Amazon isn’t going to do anything about what it hears.

Amazon’s interest in what you’re saying is in direct proportion to how what you say relates to activities in the company’s ecosystem. Alexa connects to some 80,000 skills, but the core set — the ones you use most often — are connected to Amazon’s shopping, music, and the company’s growing collection of smart devices. Does it have to “listen” all the time to connect those services to your needs? Yes. But so do Siri, Google Assistant, and Samsung Bixby. They all listen for their watchwords (just as *Star Trek*’s voice system always listened for “Computer”). Nothing that the system “hears” before that is collected, but what’s said after you utter “Alexa” is.

Obviously, Amazon could have done a better job of communicating the possibility that some of your conversations could end up in human hands. On the other hand, at this stage, no voice system can improve without a combination of algorithmic machine learning and human analysis.

Amazon is far from alone in its desire to perfect these systems. Apple, Amazon, and Google have spent years improving both the voice quality and conversational- and context-aware capabilities of their voice systems. Last year, [Google’s Duplex](&lt;|url|&gt;) carried on a conversation with a hair salon, even booking an appointment, all without the person on the other side being aware they were talking to a computer — which predictably enough [freaked some people out](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Meanwhile, more typical digital assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant still fall far short of the voice assistant ideal envisioned by *Star Trek* in 1966.

No other sci-fi show has had such a lasting impact on today’s tech leaders, and if you want to blame something for the proliferation of voice assistants and the way they work, there is no better target than *Star Trek*. All these middle-aged programmers grew up watching one iteration or another of the sci-fi franchise. The concept of an always-listening computer spread like a contagion. One of the chief architects of Google’s Knowledge Graph, former Google Senior Vice President Amat Singhal told me in 2012 that it was his dream to build the *Star Trek* Computer. And in a recent letter to shareholders, Amazon founder and CEO [Jeff Bezos wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;), “The vision for Echo and Alexa was inspired by the *Star Trek* computer.”

### **Was *Star Trek*’s Computer so special?**

While it’s not clear exactly what inspired Gene Roddenberry to introduce Star Trek’s Computer, we do know that he deemed it important enough to give the voice assistant his wife Majel Barrett’s voice. Her voice continued to be used for the Computer [even after her death](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Barret didn’t voice all the Computer versions, though. In one original series episode, Captain Kirk, played by William Shatner, [engages in a lengthy back-and-forth](&lt;|url|&gt;) with the Library computer. It’s just the kind of conversation, one that never pauses to reset context, that we all dream of with our current voice assistants.


All those times Shatner and his castmates spoke to Computer, did they think about the implications for the future? Were they, perhaps, wishing they had such an assistant of their own?

“Isn’t that what sci-fi is, taking something that exists today and projecting a possible future? Did I know? No. It’s the writers that projected the future. I just read the lines given by them,” Shatner told me via Twitter DM.

Roddenberry’s future was an optimistic one, one tech companies wholeheartedly embraced. But consumers today are torn. As Bezos pointed out in that same letter to shareholders, no one at the time was asking for Echo: “If you had gone to a customer in 2013 and said, ‘Would you like a black, always-on cylinder in your kitchen about the size of a Pringles can that you can talk to and ask questions, that also turns on your lights and plays music?’ I guarantee you they’d have looked at you strangely and said, ‘No, thank you.’”

For consumers, an always-watching and listening system will always smack too much of Big Brother, even if it’s driven by a dispassionate algorithm. It’s the job of Amazon, Apple, and Google to reconcile the promise of the *Star Trek *Computer with the threat of Big Brother. In this area, Amazon clearly still has some work to do.
> # Stop complaining and enjoy the fact that you can talk to a computer.

But let’s say Amazon and other voice assistant developers get it right. Where would such an advanced voice assistant lead us?

Remember the 2013 movie *Her* starring Joaquin Phoenix? Its depiction of a lonely man falling in love with his digital assistant (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) was unsettling, not only because of the cross-silicon-human relationship but because of its inevitability. (Spoiler alert: The voice assistant eventually “leaves” her human to live with other A.I. in the cloud.)

If humans eventually develop meaningful relationships with digital beings, it will happen because of all those years of transcribing and training worked. So should we be concerned that Alexa and Amazon are listening to everything we say? No. Sure, Alexa pipes up even when we don’t explicitly say “Alexa” because it thought it heard its name, and yes, that means Amazon has probably heard and transcribed some pretty bizarre and very personal conversations. So what? Amazon isn’t going to do anything about what it hears.

This is the price of innovation. If you don’t want Amazon hearing what you say at the dinner table, turn off the mic or throw away your Echo. Otherwise, stop complaining and enjoy the fact that you can talk to a computer and that it can answer almost any question you throw at it.

By the way: Which of the current voice assistants plays the role of Computer for the original *Star Trek*’s Captain Kirk? None, he told me. “I have a first gen Alexa in a drawer.”<|endoftext|>

# A New Study Suggests Employers Track Your Every Move to ‘Improve Productivity’

## A New Study Suggests Employers Track Your Every Move to ‘Improve Productivity’

### The researchers claim their data analysis can decrease workplace bias and increase performance, but the truth is much more complicated

![Photo by [FitNish Media](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [FitNish Media](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

How would you feel if your boss told you that, if you wanted that raise, you’d need to wear a tracking device 24/7?

It’s not an implausible future. [Workplace wellness programs](&lt;|url|&gt;), which sometimes use fitness trackers and other devices to assess employee health — data that in many cases impact insurance rates — blossomed under the Obama administration, and now cover upwards of 50 million American workers. A new [study](&lt;|url|&gt;), funded in part by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence with lead researchers from Dartmouth College, suggests a potential next step into this brave new world: day and night data surveillance that connects seemingly irrelevant data points — like how often you check your phone or leave your home on the weekend — to your work performance.

The study aims to “classify high and low performers” through the use of location-tracking beacons, wearables, and phone apps. It’s similar in design and purpose to two other research programs, called [mPerf](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [MOSAIC](&lt;|url|&gt;), which both investigate how artificial intelligence can aid workers (and, of course, their employers). But experts warn there are many concerns around this kind of tracking.

“The features that are being used in this study are things like how much sleep people are getting, their heart rate, how much physical activity they’re getting,” says Natasha Duarte, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a privacy and security nonprofit. “For a relatively young, privileged, healthy employee, those might be a salient factor… What about people who have disabilities? Basing their workplace performance on how physically active they are could be really discriminatory.”

A total of 554 subjects — 320 men and 234 women — were tracked in the study. They worked in various industries, but mostly in tech and consulting. The subjects regularly filled out classic workplace assessment surveys, in which they replied yes or no to statements such as “today I displayed loyalty to my organization” or rated themselves on whether they “adequately completed [their] assigned duties” or “ensured [their] tasks were completed properly.” These responses were then used to classify the workers as higher or lower performers.

Meanwhile, these same subjects were equipped with a number of different tracking devices. Each participant wore a waterproof Garmin bracelet, installed a tracking app called PhoneAgent on their smartphones, and had to use four beacons that tracked their location: one was placed in their wallet, one on their keychain, one at home, and one in the office. These devices recorded subjects’ sleeping habits, how often they got up from their desks, how often they left their homes at night and on weekends, how frequently they unlocked their phones, how much exercise they got, how well they slept, and other metrics.

The study authors then compared the data collected from the tracking devices to the survey results. Results were differentiated by the industry a participant worked in, as well as if they were a supervisor or nonsupervisor. For example, according to the study, nonsupervising high performers spent more time at work on the weekends (big surprise there) and visited fewer places on weekday evenings; higher performers working in consulting were less physically active on the weekends, while higher performers in tech were less physically active during the week.

Pino Audia, a professor of management at Dartmouth College and one of the study’s authors, says he infers from some of this data that high performers who visit fewer places during the course of the day have stable routines. This allows high performers to be proactive and resourceful, even in difficult work situations. “If you’re constantly interrupted, perhaps that impairs your performance,” he says.

The study’s authors hope such employee data could be used to make employee reviews less discriminatory and unfair. The existing approaches to worker evaluations are “fairly antiquated and potentially biased,” says Andrew Campbell, a professor of computer science at Dartmouth and another study author. He says that the team wanted to investigate how mobile sensing data could be employed to predict patterns that were reflective of higher performance. They eventually hope that in a decade or so, employees will use such data to reflect on and improve their own work.

Standard, written workplace evaluations are indeed imperfect ways to judge how well an employee is doing at their job. [Open-ended survey questions](&lt;|url|&gt;), such as “how does the employee meet expectations?” or “what are the employee’s greatest skills?” compel managers to rely on stereotypes and biases, rather than data, in their responses, according to researchers at the Stanford VMware Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab. Men are more likely to receive specific feedback that focuses on their technical skills while women receive more general feedback, like “You’re a great communicator!” Specific feedback provides a blueprint for an employee to improve as well as capitalize on their strongest attributes, meaning that people who don’t receive such feedback can get left behind.

Audia says that the study points to “a near future in which we can be less reliant on surveys. We can rely more on objective indicators of behaviors. How can corporations ensure greater equality in the treatment and compensation and promotion rates of people by gender and by race and by nationality? […] You can think of some of the technology used in this study as moving in that direction.”
> # “If you build [an algorithm] off of men in their midtwenties, and apply it to women, or anybody over 30, or somebody with a disability… then yeah, it doesn’t hold water”

Naturally, there are some concerns with this work. There’s the issue of bias that Duarte mentioned; most of the individuals studied were men. And if data from this white-collar, primarily male cohort was used to predict or evaluate the performance of someone who didn’t fit into that population, they could be discriminated against for factors that have nothing to do with their performance.

“If you build [an algorithm] off of men in their midtwenties, and apply it to women, or anybody over 30, or somebody with a disability, or any kind of variance in physical activity… then yeah, it doesn’t hold water,” says Jen King, the director of consumer privacy at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society. “The training data is inherently biased.”

Someone with a mental illness, for example, might have anxiety that raises their heart rate or worsens their sleep quality; a mother of a teen might leave the house frequently in the evening to take them to extracurriculars, which could be used as a mark against them since, according to the study, high performers tend not to leave the home as often after work.

And, of course, there is the troubling privacy violation of having trackers on employees that follow their movements and record their biometrics, including when they’re not at work. There are few privacy protections for employees in the United States, so “requesting” that employees subject themselves to constant surveillance may be legally viable; that’s already happening in the case of [employee wellness programs](&lt;|url|&gt;), in which employees have to lose weight, stop smoking, and track other biometrics to prevent skyrocketing health insurance rates. Such programs aren’t only legal — they’re actively encouraged by the Affordable Care Act.

“It shouldn’t be happening, but the legal landscape around it is very unclear, unfortunately,” says Duarte. Such tracking programs are unethical even when employees provide consent, she says, noting that people can feel [coerced](&lt;|url|&gt;) and pressured to participate to seem like “good workers.” “CDT’s position is that it shouldn’t be something that people are allowed to opt into. Like, location tracking that is not necessary to provide someone with a service that they’ve requested should be illegal,” she says.

King brings up the prospect that bosses could even use the location-tracking data to stalk employees. Imagine “the creepy supervisor that develops a crush on the female co-worker and follows her everywhere she goes or always knows where she is,” King says.

The study authors point out that the research is still in its early stages, and that it would be several years before such tracking is likely to be implemented in any workplace. Campbell says he understands how datasets like this can introduce bias in general.

“I take your point as a general criticism of any machine learning, or building algorithms from data, that if, for example, a demographic isn’t represented in that data, then the algorithm completely ignores them,” he says. “I don’t have a really good idea about how to solve that problem.”

But this is also not the only large study looking at this very topic. The [mPerf study](&lt;|url|&gt;) is funded by the same governmental organization, and like this research, it looks at the correlations between workplace performance and mobile sensing data.

“It is not inconceivable that not too many years in the future there will come a day when high school students applying to colleges won’t have to take the SAT or the ACT,” Deniz Ones, the study’s lead investigator, [said in a press release](&lt;|url|&gt;). “They’ll be asked to download some apps on their mobile devices and link their wearable sensors and let colleges collect data for a couple of months.”

There’s also the Multimodal Objective Sensing to Assess Individuals with Context, or [MOSAIC](&lt;|url|&gt;), which tracks members of the intelligence community to assess employee performance, although some might point out that employees in the intelligence community can reasonably accept some amount of surveillance as part of their jobs.

Are there ways to improve performance evaluations without invasive tracking? [According to researchers](&lt;|url|&gt;) from VMware, the Stanford group focused on women’s leadership, managers should agree to specific performance requirements months in advance. An employee’s performance can then be checked against those requirements, which helps eliminate bias in a review. Managers should refrain from general, ambiguous praise like “she’s a fantastic communicator” and instead rely on the agreed-upon performance rubric to fairly evaluate how well the worker communicates.

Further research on how employers can effectively guide their employees without success is absolutely necessary. But even beyond the invasive nature of the tracking suggested in research like the Dartmouth and mPerf studies, the problem of new and often invisible biases being introduced by technology persists. Humans may argue with each other’s judgments, but too often people believe these systems are objective. We should know better.<|endoftext|>

# Is It Worse to Burn Oil or Turn It Into Plastic?

## And more questions on the future of plastic and the environment

![Credit: Barcroft Media/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Barcroft Media/Getty Images*

### **How much plastic is there in the world?**

An estimated 9 billion tons of plastic has been produced so far. Of this, 5.4 billion tons has been chucked into landfill or scattered onto land and sea. To get a sense of what this looks like, if all of this plastic were made into cling film it would be more than enough to wrap the whole planet.

The world is now producing over 400 million tons of the stuff every year. That is more than ever before, despite the sudden rise in awareness of the environmental problems associated with it, like the move to [ban plastic straws](&lt;|url|&gt;). Of all the plastic ever made, less than a third is still in use, less than a tenth has been burned, and only about 7% has been recycled. This leaves the remaining 60% hanging around as rubbish.

When trash gets landfilled, at least you can argue that the carbon is going back into the ground where it came from and where it belonged all along. From a climate change perspective, this could be the best end point.

An estimated 4 to 12 million tons per year ends up in the sea, where it turns up on the world’s remotest beaches, on the deep ocean floor and in the stomachs of animals. It sometimes even finds its way back into our food chain where it can be found, for example, in a third of the U.K.’s caught fish. One of the most depressing aspects of humankind’s blind destruction of the natural world has to be the realization that these tiny bits of plastic will be there forever, more or less. Thousands of years from now, a microscope on a pristine beach will still find the little grains of man-made multi-colored sand that we have unthinkingly laid down over just the last few decades. No amount of cleaning will sort that out. And the amount in the ocean looks set to triple over the coming decade from around 50 million tons to around 150 million.
> # If just one year’s worth of today’s oil production were turned into plastic, it would almost double the total amount that there is in the world.

### **What do we use it for?**

Over a third of all our plastic is used for disposable packaging. To look on the plus side, recycling rates have gone from an all-time average of just 9% to nearly 20% today. But to look on the negative side, this is still pitiful and the growth in recycling rates has been dwarfed by the overall growth in plastic production, so that the amount getting chucked out every year is still going up not down.

### **Is fossil fuel better burned or turned into plastic?**

[Hobson’s choice!](&lt;|url|&gt;) Ideally it would have stayed in the ground. Landfill, for all its other problems, at least puts it back there.

If just one year’s worth of today’s oil production were turned into plastic, it would almost double the total amount that there is in the world. This sounds like a crazy notion, but already there are signs of oil companies looking to sell more of their wares to plastics factories, as the world slowly gets to grips with the need to not burn fossil fuels. However serious climate change might be, shifting from CO2 to plastic waste is even worse. So if you know someone who is proposing this business strategy, please call it out for what it is: poison.

### **So what are the alternatives?**

In the U.K., shops are starting to offer zero packaging food, with shoppers bringing their own containers. Waitrose supermarkets are even experimenting with the concept. Where food packaging is required, paper may sometimes have a higher carbon footprint but it also has the huge benefit of biodegrading. Where transparent films are required, degradable cellulose products are now available.

For protective transport packaging, there is little excuse these days for expanded polystyrene (ie. Styrofoam) rather than molded blocks of recycled paper and card, and for postage, shredded paper is as good as bubble wrap.

Seven percent of plastic is for transportation — mainly the manufacture of vehicles. This may actually be worth it since the environmental benefit of lightweight durable materials is very significant and the good news is that it should be entirely possible to salvage all vehicle plastics for re-use, recycling, and careful incineration.

The alternatives for clothing and other textiles are natural fibres such as cotton, linen and hemp. Here there are trade-offs, because the environmental burden of cotton production, including the water footprint that has all but dried up the [Aral Sea](&lt;|url|&gt;), is enormous. And synthetic fibers can have benefits in durability, ease of washing and drying, and performance. The best option is often going to be to steer towards high-quality durable products, look after them, repair them when they need it, pass them on when you’ve finished with them, and ensure they are recycled at the end of their lives.

In the construction industry, glass and natural fibers such as sheep’s wool can be used for insulation. Low-grade recycled plastic can be used as construction materials, and this is fine as long as care is taken at the end of the building’s life to recycle it or otherwise prevent it from dispersing into the environment.

Where plastic isn’t recycled, clean incineration solves, at least, the problem of waste lying in landfill or being scattered across the land and sea. This means that in the end the fossil fuel from which it originated has been burned as it would have been if were gasoline or diesel, with the same contribution to climate change — but is at least gone from the land and sea.

Bleep. Bloop. Buzz. It feels like notifications are inescapable, constant, and growing in number every day, no matter what we do about them. We’re all spending hours of our day staring into our phones, because they’re designed to pull us in: a dopamine hit released when your phone buzzes is all it takes.

Despite the research suggesting that notifications, and the resulting overuse of smartphones, are [causing serious mental health issues globally](&lt;|url|&gt;), little is being done about it. There’s been no meaningful change to notifications in 10 years, and technology companies aren’t being held liable.

![“I’d like to interrupt you” sounds far less appealing than “getting notifications.”](<|image|>)*“I’d like to interrupt you” sounds far less appealing than “getting notifications.”*

Sure, Apple and Google [both introduced “digital well-being” tools](&lt;|url|&gt;) to help us measure and manage our smartphone overload, but the options largely just offer more information, combined with the bare minimum tooling to manage it. The problem is still chiefly one that falls on overburdened users.

If the technology companies creating smartphones were serious about helping, they’d address one of the key problems head-on and call notifications what they really are: interruptions.

## A name with more weight

A notification sounds useful, but an interruption seems unwanted, or at least less welcome. A simple name change would help to make us pause and at least consider the ceaseless flow of information our phones are directing at us.

![An example of what an “interruption request” could look like.](<|image|>)*An example of what an “interruption request” could look like.*

It seems trivial, but switching the mental model would make it easier for consumers to understand how a notification erodes their attention span. Each ping saps it away in tiny pieces, with a blast radius that’s far more substantial than the five seconds it takes to look at your screen.

We should present notifications for what they are, and technology companies should be liable for taking control of what that means for their ecosystems, rather than simply allowing apps to ask for blanket approval.

## Giving notifications a price

Once an app gets approval for notifications — which it usually demands before you can even sign into whatever service it is — the company can essentially do what it likes forever, with no repercussions unless it’s blocked entirely by the user or caught abusing notifications as a habit.

How many times have you downloaded a simple game or mapping app, only to be harassed every few hours about deals, offers, or even just a reminder to open the app again? Can you imagine what it would feel like if a TV or microwave you bought repeatedly asked you to turn it on several times a day? These tiny pieces of distraction should come with a cost to the app developer that makes them think: Is it *really* worth sending this?

There are a few ways this could be implemented. Apple and Google could attach a virtual cost to sending a notification. Each app could receive an allocation of notifications — interruption tokens — to allocate per user, per week, and force them to categorize notifications as they’re being sent. If the app drain its notification budget, it would be required to ask for more interruption time and explain why it’s important that another notification is sent.

Or perhaps notifications could receive an anonymous, optional rating from users, like rating an Uber driver once you’ve jumped out of the car. Get a low enough score from your users? You can’t send notifications for a while. Continue to get a really low score? Well, you’ve lost your privileges, sorry.

Assigning a cost to abusive notification users would help the companies building apps evaluate whether it’s worth actually sending notifications in the first place. There would be less begging from Facebook to fire up Instagram and fewer companies harassing us to open our wallets until we turn them off.

Today, it’s on the user to be in control of this. It’s all or nothing, and it’s your own problem. Technology companies should be held responsible for the notifications being sent in their ecosystem and not permit developers to decide for themselves.

## Better tools for users

Digital well-being features are a good idea, but they come with few teeth. You can see that your attention is being fragmented into millions of pieces, but that doesn’t proactively help you manage the problem. More aggressive tooling around distracting notifications would allow consumers to drive change at the developer level.

A good start would be a simple system to flag notifications as harassment or spam. As it stands today, there’s no way to notify Google or Apple that notifications are annoying or useless. The only way out of an app’s annoying notifications is to turn them off, but that doesn’t stop them from spamming other users.

![Android already recommends blocking notifications after swiping them away three times — but what if you could provide feedback?](<|image|>)*Android already recommends blocking notifications after swiping them away three times — but what if you could provide feedback?*

Our email inboxes offer spam boxes, so why aren’t mobile operating systems doing the same? A long press on a notification should allow the user to report it as spam and block the category forever, which feeds up the chain and forces the company running the store to do something about it.

Twitter has tools to report users for harassment, but why can’t we report apps for harassment? Instagram is a great example of an app that abuses notification permission to grow engagement: Look at this post of a puppy! Your friends are waiting for you! Come back and see what’s new!

Each of these apps should have a way for users to express their frustration (or happiness, if users actually like them) so developers can affect change in the wider ecosystem, rather than simply get away with endlessly stealing attention.

Evolving existing tools would also help. I’d love to see tools like “do not disturb” pushed forward with new ideas, like allowing users to set their devices into “focus mode” for a set period of time.

Block all alerts, and bundle them into an overview of what was missed so they aren’t overwhelming once you’re ready to come out of focus time. That way, there’s a period of Zen but not a blanket notification block, which would help when you need that extra burst of disruption-free time.

## Regulation

Of course, there’s no motivation for these giants to do any of these things — more notifications mean more engaged users and more money for the company providing the app store! When attention is the product, it’s in their interest to keep us coming back.

Perhaps, then, the creators of the phone operating systems themselves should be externally motivated to do better.

I’m not entirely sure how this would work, but I’m starting to believe that notifications might require oversight from a government body or third party, which could take complaints from users of apps or operating systems and perform random checks.


If an operating system vendor is caught to be lazily managing its notification ecosystem, it should be held liable and forced to more proactively take care of the people on the other end.

It wouldn’t be easy, but as it stands today, there are zero reasons for Google or Apple to want to fix notifications. Without the mysterious black box that they are today, I think we’d see how much notifications are hurting society.

## Notifications are broken

We’ve had smartphones for 10 years, but since they launched, we’ve seen little in the way of meaningful improvements for managing them. Even in newer products, like the Apple Watch, notifications are enabled by default, assuming permission is granted, and then start buzzing on our bodies as well, with little consideration for what that means.

I want better ways for consumers to have their say directly to these big corporations and better tools for holding the developers that build abusive notifications accountable. We don’t want to be endlessly sucked into our phones, and we need a better way to take control of that.

Some people reading this will probably think, “Sure, just disable them,” but that’s not good enough. Notifications are creeping into every crevice of society’s attention, and we have to claw it back — or the information overload we’re already struggling to survive will drown us.<|endoftext|>

# Face It — You Want To Be Seen

## We may fear digital surveillance, but tech platforms count on our desire to be noticed online

![Photo: Paul Taylor/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Paul Taylor/Getty Images*

Two weeks ago, the *Economist*’s Asian technology correspondent, Hal Hodson, started a Twitter [thread](&lt;|url|&gt;). He was worried. “Something really massive is happening, and I feel like society is barely grasping the tendrils of the implications,” he wrote. “Technology is eroding one of the great levees of human society — the ability to move around the physical world anonymously.”

Hodson, like the rest of us, has reason to be concerned. Technology companies are deep into an ongoing shift from collecting endless data about what we do online to collecting endless data about what we’re doing offline too. The so-called “internet of things” is expanding, and the scope of what’s knowable about users — what we do, where we go, who we know, or what we look like — is widening quickly. That expansion is creating some unnerving scenarios.

There are products that [scan](&lt;|url|&gt;) students’ electronic communications, and[ ](&lt;|url|&gt;)others that track their movements, doorbell cameras that watch the streets, facial recognition replacing tickets at airports, programs to track [employees](&lt;|url|&gt;), cameras that capture you [at the mall](&lt;|url|&gt;) and others at [concerts](&lt;|url|&gt;), and apps that are surreptitiously [recording](&lt;|url|&gt;) your every location. The list goes on.

We can easily imagine the grander implications of it all, an end-state scenario. It’s so easily imaginable that living within an all-seeing, all-knowing infrastructure is the subject of some of our most celebrated fiction. And, if we still can’t quite wrap our heads around it, China offers a current, real-world example. In other words, we can see clearly into the future, and yet despite some efforts to retain our invisibility, by and large, we continue barreling onward.

Why?

It’s important to remember that the tech giants who own and control the platforms and tools that we depend on to mediate our lives didn’t just monetize human behavior — they helped shape it. They did so in myriad ways: by adding a layer of unpredictability into our everyday lives via systems of communication designed to confuse us; by introducing a new perspective on commodification–of our homes, cars, and other possessions; and even changing the way we think about finding love.

But the overarching shift has been about values, about what inherently matters most to people. In adopting the new tech platforms, accepting and incorporating their underlying algorithms into our everyday lives, we have simultaneously been acclimatized to not just their operations, but the overlying expectations these tools carry. Primary among those expectations is not only that we should be seen, but that we should want to be seen.

As Taina Bucher explores in her [book](&lt;|url|&gt;), *If… Then: Algorithmic Power and Politics*, we are generally in the dark when it comes to explaining the specific mechanics of the algorithms at the heart of our favorite apps, but what we do regularly guess at is how to make them notice us. As Bucher discovered in conversation with social media users, people tweak the content of their posts on Facebook, or even the time of day they post, in an attempt to catch the algorithm’s eye and ride the wave of its amplification. This is familiar to anyone who’s used social media, and it’s why news organizations repost old content when a topic is trending on Twitter, or why you see a million hashtags at the end of Instagram posts. Everyone is just trying to get noticed.
> # In a society mediated by online platforms, visibility is the only thing that matters.

Because being noticed is vital. Platforms reward and validate participation in purposefully confusing ways to keep us guessing, and, like a slot machine, returning for more. But the tech companies design them in a way that the experience can actually improve the more we use them. So, we strive to be noticed. If we’re noticed, we might get more reaction on our Facebook posts, we might get more requests on Airbnb, more swipes on Tinder, or simply more money on Depop. With more attention comes, potentially, a better life. And the opposite is also true: If you’re not seen, maybe you speak to fewer people, maybe you make less money, and maybe you never find your soulmate. With no attention, life can really suck–and that’s especially true now.

In a society mediated by online platforms, visibility is the only thing that matters. In fact, while we commonly think of the attention economy as hinging on the limited time we have to give on any one platform, it’s likely that the attention those platforms can give us is as valuable a commodity.

The thirst for visibility might not fully explain our complacency to the worrisome growth of surveillance technology — we might just be lazy — but it’s not surprising that a lot of people are normalized to an even closer examination of our lives now that the tech giants have been training us for more than a decade

For most people, deeper surveillance sounds less like a threat and instead like the route to a more personalized user experience. Which it is! But it’s also going to mean something else, too: a change in how we operate within our society. Where we go and who we meet, and what we say and do when we get there–or, in some cases, whether we get there at all–might all one day soon be monitored. In other words, what will actually change is our human experience. We can already see what that might mean. For one, society’s marginalized will face (and [already do](&lt;|url|&gt;)) even greater targeting and profiling. And for everyone, but most specifically for those who already can’t afford it, the privilege of privacy will come at a steeper and steeper price — a kind of final bill we’ll all finally be asked to pay for years of free services that gave us seemingly unlimited VIP treatment on the house.

Still, while we may have found ourselves in a bad place, Hodson’s lament also points to an opposing trend: the growing resistance to surveillance tech. For instance, a recent test of movement tracking tech in New York schools [ended](&lt;|url|&gt;) after public outcry. Similarly, San Francisco [banned](&lt;|url|&gt;) police use of facial recognition technology, and there is a lively [debate](&lt;|url|&gt;) over whether Detroit should do the same. At a more personal level, as *Wired [*reports](&lt;|url|&gt;), teenagers are, ironically, using TikTok, the newest popular social media app with its own [security](&lt;|url|&gt;) [concerns](&lt;|url|&gt;), to vent their frustrations about Life360, a surveillance tool marketed to parents who want to keep tabs on their children’s whereabouts.

A full-scale rejection of surveillance tech seems unlikely — too much of it is already out there. And we should remain concerned about its increasing prevalence in our lives, lest we realize the worst of what we’ve previously imagined as possible. But just as social values shifted toward emphasizing our personal visibility, they can, and probably will, shift back. Just as we accepted that social equity was measured in visibility, we can make [obscurity](&lt;|url|&gt;) valuable again. In other words, anonymity isn’t lost forever, it’s just invisible for now.<|endoftext|>

# The Largest Unnamed Object in the Solar System Is Getting a Formal Title

## The Largest Unnamed Object in the Solar System Is Getting a Formal Title

### How astronomers are tapping the public to name 2007 OR10

There are many distant objects that orbit beyond Neptune — the most famous of which, of course, is Pluto. But far beyond Neptune are numerous dwarf planets that range from Pluto-sized — 4,500 miles across — to even smaller and stranger. Some are shaped like footballs and others like perfect circles with orbits that take them further out than any astronomer ever expected to find a planetary object.

In 2007, three astronomers discovered one of the largest dwarf planets ever, coming in behind Pluto in mass and size. Its formal designation became 2007 OR10, marked for the year it was found. It remains the largest unnamed body in the solar system and for over a decade now, the planetary science community has been waiting for this dwarf planet to earn a real name. And now the time has come.

A few weeks ago the lead discoverer — planetary scientist and astronomer Meg Schwamb — announced that she was officially putting the vote in the hands of the public. She and her co-discoverers, astronomer Mike Brown and astronomer David Rabinowitz, selected three mythological names for the public to choose from and posted a [website ](&lt;|url|&gt;)where the votes could take place.

Here are the options from the [website](&lt;|url|&gt;):

**Gonggong**: “A Chinese water god with red hair and a serpent-like tail. He is known for creating chaos, causing flooding, and tilting the Earth.”

**Holle**: “A European winter goddess of fertility, rebirth, and women. Holle makes snow by shaking out her bed. She is a patroness of household crafts, especially spinning. She is linked to the Yuletide season, also associated with mistletoe and holly.”

**Vili:** “A Nordic deity. Vili, together with his brothers Odin and Ve, defeated frost giant Ymir and used Ymir’s body to create the universe.”

Gonggong was David Rabinowitz’s suggestion, Vili was long on the list, while Halle came later. “I’m happy with any of them,” says Schwamb. “I think they’re all great. Plus, I had to pick a name that would likely pass the International Astronomical Union’s (IAU) parameters because you don’t want [Boaty McBoatface](&lt;|url|&gt;),” he added, referring to the British government research vessel that was named by internet poll.

Selecting serious names to choose from wasn’t easy. “All these dwarf planets and objects like Pluto have names that sort of fit the surface properties and so it’s hard when you don’t know anything about it,” says Schwamb. “We wanted to give it a fitting name. It’s like naming the baby after seeing the baby… Now, we can tell a story.”
> # “Naming is a process that makes places out of worlds.”

Astronomers are not likely to discover new dwarf planets as large as 2007 OR10 because the sky surveys all would have likely found them by now, so this naming campaign could be one of the last. And it’s not every day that astronomers get the chance to name a planetary body. “It has always taken the world’s greatest telescopes or spacecraft to find new worlds, so naming them has always been the privilege of people who have access to those things,” says Emily Lakdawalla, planetary scientist and senior editor at The Planetary Society, a major space exploration nonprofit. “That’s why I’m so happy that Meg invited the public to participate in naming 2007 OR10.”

Not only is 2007 OR10 on the larger side, but it’s also one of the slowest rotating bodies in the Kuiper Belt, a collection of small planetary bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. It even has its own moon, which will likely get a name eventually, one that will relate to whatever is chosen for 2007 OR10.

The voting officially closed this week, but not before more than 280,000 ballots were tallied. Once they figure out the winner, Schwamb and her colleagues will formally submit a letter to the IAU, which will either begin the process of approval or move on to the runner-up. Assuming all goes well, 2007 OR10 could have its name in as soon as a few weeks.

It’s not every day a dwarf planet is discovered, and it’s not every day a formal name is selected either. “Naming is a process that makes places out of worlds,” says Lakdawalla. “I’m thrilled to be living in a time when humans are first discovering and exploring 2007 OR10 and all the others around Kuiper Belt — not just Pluto but also Eris, Makemake, Haumea, Sedna, Orcus, Quaoar, and many more.” Humans are putting their stamp on the cosmos, one name at a time.<|endoftext|>

# What’s on Your Home Screen, Taylor Lorenz?

## Talking bespoke apps and ‘moon playlists’ with the tech journalist and meme whisperer

![Taylor Lorenz](<|image|>)*Taylor Lorenz*

*This is “What’s on Your Home Screen?” a Q&A column from OneZero. We want to understand more about how people use their smartphones — those life-consuming devices we dump hours into every day — to pave a way toward a better future. Or at least a more reflective one. We’ll add new entries regularly, and each will feature a new interview with a notable person about the apps they use, how they’re organized, and whether those red bubbles drive them nuts.*

Taylor Lorenz gets the internet. Her work as a staff writer at the *Atlantic *routinely pulls the curtain back on strange pockets of online culture, and she’s been known to publish articles that seem engineered to spark their own mini-news cycles on Twitter. (See this week’s [viral piece](&lt;|url|&gt;) on internet nemeses, for example.)

And so, I had to see how she uses her iPhone.

I was surprised to find a number of what she called “artisanal” apps, which serve very specific purposes, in contrast to the mega-functions of a product like Facebook or Spotify. Less surprising was a now familiar refrain about the worthlessness of [notification badges](&lt;|url|&gt;).

*What follows is our chat, edited for length and clarity.*

![](<|image|>)

### **OneZero: So, first off, I noticed you have the beta Twitter app, twttr*. *What’s going on with that?**

**Taylor Lorenz:** I applied to be in the [beta](&lt;|url|&gt;) thing as soon as I saw that it was announced. I was like, I wanna try it, because I always try everything that’s new. I’m obviously a heavy Twitter user. I wanted to see what it was going to look like.

Honestly, it’s not any better than the current Twitter. The replies are weird. And a little bit more confusing. It’s not a better experience. I still have people telling me to kill myself every day.
> # “Being online in general has made me happier, even though Twitter is hell and stuff.”

### **Did you just delete the old Twitter app when you got this? Are you all-in on it?**

I put the old one in a folder on like the fourth page or whatever.

### **I noticed you don’t have a lot of pages.**

My phone is constantly running out of space. I really have to delete apps a lot. I don’t know how many storage units it has, it’s 64 or something. The cheapest option for the iPhone 8 Plus.

### **You’ve got Hype Machine, which kind of struck me as a throwback.**

I’m the most loyal Hype Machine user ever. It’s the best app. I find music on there that Spotify wouldn’t even know about. They have really good remixes of songs that would never make it on Spotify or anything like that. It’s just a really good app for music discovery. I’ve had my favorites on Hype Machine since 2010. It’s where all my favorite songs are.

### **Do you have a favorite artist on Hype Machine?**

I just like the remixes. There’s just not a lot of remixes on Spotify, maybe because of licensing issues.

### **Is the app all updated and nice or is it, uh, kinda janky at this point?**

It’s nice-looking! You can click what’s new, there’s popular songs, favorites by moon…

### **Favorites by moon?**

You click in, and it’s a moon playlist.

### **A moon playlist.**

It sorted all my favorites by the moon cycle that they’re in. Spotify would never do anything like this! That’s what I’m saying.

It also has the blog directory. You can see different blogs that post about music. I can click into my favorite music blogs, and you can see the feed and see all they’ve posted. Everyone should be giving Hype Machine $6 a month or whatever. They’re really small.

### **That’s really cool. The blog feed feels like a throwback to the old internet, where we don’t have one centralized feed that we pull everything from.**

Yeah, totally. It’s like artisanal apps and services.

### **Are there other “artisanal” apps you use?**

EZ Meme! It’s the one my boyfriend just made. *[Laughs] *It has no users — it’s still in beta.

It’s hard to keep artisanal apps alive. Ello, Peach — it’s so hard to get traction against the big ones. That’s what I worry about with Hype Machine.

### **But don’t you think if Spotify was going to crush it, that would’ve happened already?**

Yeah, probably.

### **So, tell me about EZ Meme.**

My boyfriend made this because I was really frustrated I couldn’t do certain things on Instagram Stories. There’s just not a good meme-making app out there. It lets you make memes and funny things, and put a bunch of funny photos on one iPhone screen for Instagram Stories.

### **Is it monetized?**

It’s still in Testflight. I don’t know if he wanted me to plug it. But it’s on my home screen, so the jig is up.

### **And I see you have Shudder, the horror-streaming app. Do you watch movies on your phone a lot?**

I have a projector in my apartment, but a lot of times I start to fall asleep, so I want to finish a movie on my phone. I fall asleep to a horror movie almost every night.

### **That’s kind of messed up.**

I’ve seen almost every horror movie ever. I don’t know why, I just love horror. I probably watch three movies a week. Shudder is great. They have a lot of movies that aren’t on other streaming platforms, and they have a lot of foreign movies, too.

### **So, that’s another bespoke app like Hype Machine or EZ Meme.**

That’s a good point. People are always like, why don’t you watch on Netflix? And I do, but I’ve seen every horror movie ever. Netflix doesn’t have a lot of old ones, a lot of foreign ones. There’s a lot of smaller indie horror movies that will never go on Netflix. It’s really cool that Shudder exists.

### **Switching gears, you have 118 notifications on your Phone app in your dock.**

I guess those are all voicemails. I’ve never checked my voicemails since I got my phone. It’s weird though, because I call my friends on the phone all the time.

### **That’s interesting. **I can’t really stand phone calls**. I have the Messages app in my dock and the Phone app in my top row. Are you not a big texter?**

I text all the time. I have my iMessage, Messenger, Instagram, and Slack all in a row.
> # “Soon our phones will be integrated into our brains, so people should just get used to it now. I don’t ever feel bad about it.”

### **It’s like your home row.**

My group chats are almost all on Messenger. Instagram, I’m on all day for work. Slack, I’m on all day for work. I’m a completionist for reading my iMessages. But I’m a phone call person. If I’m good friends with someone, I call them constantly. I have a lot of friends who don’t live in New York.

### **So, you’re kind of known as the internet whisperer — do you ever put your phone away?**

I take it in the bathroom when I shower. I’ve taken it in the shower, to listen to podcasts. I was really lonely and depressed before I had access to the internet and social media. Being online, in general, has made me happier, even though Twitter is hell and stuff. Being connected to friends is great. I consume so much content everyday, and I like that. I enjoy reading about things and listening to podcasts. I enjoy scrolling through Instagram and finding things.

I don’t feel bad about being on my phone 24/7. I don’t think about it or worry about it. Soon our phones will be integrated into our brains, so people should just get used to it now. I don’t ever feel bad about it.

### **We’re all on our phones all the time anyway, why browbeat ourselves?**

Yeah! All these people are obsessed with putting it away, or saying, “I only use 40 minutes of social media,” whatever. I accept it and balance it. Sometimes, I do other things that are bad in the moment, but it works out. Overall, I’d say I have a healthy relationship with my phone, but I don’t want to knock anyone for doing what works for them.
> # “I basically don’t have notifications on, period, for anything.”

### **I noticed you have [Clue](&lt;|url|&gt;), do you check that all the time?**

*[Laughs] *I should have switched that out.

I actually check it out every day. I froze my eggs, and I got obsessed with fertility cycles. Going through the process of egg freezing made me realize I know nothing about my own body. I don’t have a smartwatch or any of those health-type things. I use Clue, and I use it to track how I’m feeling, or if I’m going to get my period soon, or whatever. It makes me feel like I have a handle on my health. It’s a pretty good app.

### **And I noticed you don’t really have any notification badges. Do you limit those, or do you just check everything right away?**

I hate those things. I basically don’t have notifications on, period, for anything. Everything is on mute in my iMessages. The only people not on mute are my parents, my best friend, my boyfriend. Everyone else is on mute. Every other app is on mute.

If a notification comes up, I just click into my app to make it go away. The apps are probably like, they’re working! But no, we’re clicking because we’re annoyed.

# Do Astronauts Make Good Politicians?

## Do Astronauts Make Good Politicians?

### Former astronaut Mark Kelly is running for Senate. He may join a small club of astronaut politicians.

![Credit: NASA/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: NASA/Getty Images*

Former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly recently announced his candidacy for Senate in Arizona, in a 2020 special election for the seat of the late John McCain. Kelly, who is running as a Democrat, [released a long list](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Monday of Arizona politicians who support his campaign. And if he’s successful — Kelly [raised](&lt;|url|&gt;) $1.1 million in the first two days of his campaign — he will join a short list of American astronauts turned politicos.

Many people dream of becoming astronauts, and it’s easy to see why: They get to travel to space, leave our planet behind, and experience zero gravity. But only a handful have wanted to lead back on Earth as well.

The list begins with John Glenn, who in 1962 became the first American to orbit Earth, clocking nearly five hours in space. He was also the first astronaut to be elected to public office.

Glenn had the résumé of an all-American hero. Besides his service at NASA, he had an extensive military career, serving in World War II and the Korean War. Glenn successfully ran for a Senate seat in Ohio in 1974. He held the position for 25 years and ran, unsuccessfully, for president as a Democrat in 1984. Glenn even returned to spaced while still a senator, becoming the oldest person to go to space when he flew on the space shuttle *Discovery *in 1998. “If there is one thing I’ve learned in my years on this planet,” Glenn famously said in 1997, “it’s that the happiest and most fulfilled people I’ve known are those who devoted themselves to something bigger and more profound than merely their own self-interest.”

Apollo 13 astronaut Jack Swigert — who may be most famous for uttering the famous phrase “Houston, we have a problem” — was elected to the House of Representatives in 1982 but sadly died of cancer before being able to take office. Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt also became a senator in New Mexico after returning from space.
> # “One thing that all astronauts do share is perspective — in the literal sense.”

There are also two senators who became astronauts during their political careers. In 1985, Utah Senator Jake Garn flew aboard the space shuttle as a payload specialist. He was given the rare opportunity because he headed the appropriations subcommittee that involved NASA and had experience as a pilot. Just one year later, in 1986, Florida Senator Bill Nelson got his own trip on the shuttle. As the senator from what’s known as the Space Coast — a region in Florida around Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station — Nelson was heavily focused on NASA. He flew on the STS-61 mission aboard the space shuttle *Endeavour*, along with Charlie Bolden, who would later become NASA administrator during the Obama administration.

“One thing that all astronauts do share is perspective — in the literal sense,” says Casey Dreier, chief advocate and senior space policy adviser at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization that promotes the exploration of space. “Seeing Earth from above, absent political boundaries, contrasted against the despairing emptiness of space, engenders the famous ‘overview effect’” — a cognitive shift that many astronauts report experiencing while viewing Earth from space. Not surprisingly, astronauts who become politicians tend to have a larger interest in NASA.

“To see our planet as this majestic blue ball floating in the blackness of space is breathtaking,” [Kelly wrote in 2017](&lt;|url|&gt;). “It is truly the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.”

Even so, astronauts may be no more suited for public office than any other celebrity politician, says David Canon, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the author of *Actors, Athletes, and Astronauts: Political Amateurs in the United States Congress*. He doesn’t think astronauts “have anything distinct other than the fact that they moved over the Earth and were able to look down,” he says. “It is not something that is an observable impact on how they conduct themselves in political office.”

Mark Kelly is now in line to become only the fourth astronaut politician. “It gets pretty obvious pretty early on, when you get into space, that we are all kind of in this together,” he says in his campaign video. Kelly is especially focused on the effects of climate change on Arizona, a topic he’s been vocal about for years. In 2017, he [penned an op-ed for CNN](&lt;|url|&gt;) about his concerns for the planet, writing, “The impact of climate change — the scars that it’s leaving on our planet — is visible from above, too.”

Kelly is married to former Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who survived after being shot in the head in Tucson in 2011. The couple [founded an organization](&lt;|url|&gt;) to fight gun violence. [Kelly told the *Arizona Republic](&lt;|url|&gt;)* that he will be talking about gun control. “I care deeply about that issue, and it will be a part of this campaign,” Kelly said, adding that laws can protect gun owners’ rights while keeping people safe from gun violence.

“What’s different about astronaut politicians,” Canon says, “is that by virtue of them having this unusual experience, it does kind of capture the attention and imagination of the voting public, and it makes it easier to get sort of instant credibility that all challengers need when they are running for public office.”

Astronauts running for public office also serve as public reminders of the wonder of going to space. But it also means they can lose much of their bipartisan support. “The political life of astronauts reminds us of the essential humanity of those we tend to see as heroes or, at the very least, as superhuman in their mental and physical abilities,” Dreier says. “Politics demands that they broadcast their personal and idiosyncratic beliefs in order to appeal to voters and to address their broad concerns. It forces them to take positions or pursue actions which, though based on their values, you may find disagreeable. These actions fundamentally humanize them in the sense that they become more than their profession. They become complex. They contain multitudes.”

There are things we love and hate about the politicians who represent us, but maybe a person who has developed a vision for Earth while hanging alone in the darkness could bring something special to Washington, D.C. — especially in a moment of deep, almost violent partisanship.

“Astronauts carry with them the experience to look beyond this, if they so choose,” Dreier says. “Nearly every astronaut has spoken of that feeling. I cannot think of a more important perspective to carry into politics.”<|endoftext|>

# How to Parent in the Age of Cyberbullying, Trolls, and Momo

## Even with the best intentions in the world, we can’t monitor everything

![Credit: vinnstock/iStock/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: vinnstock/iStock/Getty*

Being a parent in the digital age brings on more responsibilities than our ancestors prepared us for. Content is available on demand, messages are instant, and lives can be harmed in the blink of an eye. Our lives are busy, and I’m sure we’ve all been guilty of temporarily handing our children over to the digital babysitter. I’ve done it — whether it was because of work, chores, cooking dinner, or just wanting to watch a movie, I’ve been guilty of giving my 5-year-old child a tablet or phone to watch. For the most part, I think I know what he is consuming — *Baby Sharks*, *Ryan ToysReviews*, *Mario*, *Minecraft*, *Kirby *gaming videos, or songs about locating mommy and daddy fingers — but I can’t say I know every single thing he watches.

I recall an occasion last year where my 4-year-old was playing with his bigger cousin, whom he adores, and then out of the blue he called her a bitch. Between the shock, horror, and embarrassment, I tried to recall where he would have heard such terminology. Don’t get me wrong, I’m no saint, but it’s not something I tend to use. Shit or fuck’s sake maybe, as I’m easily frustrated, not to mention clumsy. Only a few weeks later, my nephew told me he had a similar issue with his little brother, and it turns out he had heard it from some channels on YouTube. They had since switched to YouTube Kids and the problem seemed to have gone away. I quickly had a chat with my son and told him he was no longer allowed to watch YouTube unsupervised, and showed him the alternative YouTube Kids app. Job done, right?

A few weeks ago, my husband came across a video on Facebook titled “Cute Rabbit” and saw it as an opportunity to watch a clip with our son about an adorable fluffy animal on the run. Little did they both know, this poor, innocent animal was about to be the victim of some sick minds who decided to shoot a crossbow through it. I think it’s fair to say daddy was not expecting to explain human stupidity and cruelty when he was just expecting some nice digital bonding time.

Earlier this year, we saw a lot of commotion about the “[Momo Challenge](&lt;|url|&gt;)” — the creepy Japanese bird-like creature supposedly appearing on WhatsApp and YouTube that suggests children try things without their parent’s knowledge. It allegedly starts with simple commands to play “hide and seek” and escalates to acts of violence. It’s been branded a hoax by certain media outlets, like the [*Guardian](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, but I think they have missed a trick.

Parents and media outlets are being blamed for creating hysteria and scaremongering. As a parent and someone who works in the digital space, I can see both sides of the coin. I won’t lie — I hold my hands up on spreading word about the potential danger. Social media is sometimes a blessing and a curse, yet it still warrants a place in the 21st century as a key form of content consumption and communication.
> Here’s the stats bit. According to [Statista](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2017:
> Globally, 2.46 billion people on are social media, with an expectation of 3.02 billion by 2021. That’s a lot of people and the top platforms by users/views are Facebook and YouTube. More than 71 percent of internet users are social media users.

There is a saying: “Act in haste, repent at leisure.” This is one of those occasions where I do not regret alerting other parents to what I saw as a potential danger. Do I feel like a fool? Yes, to some extent, but I have no regrets.
> # Social media outlets, such as YouTube and Facebook, have limited and grossly inadequate tools.

I think where Momo was different, and where I felt most alarmed, was the potential threat of someone, or something, telling our child not to say anything to adults, or else there would be consequences. It sounded like what we’ve heard about pedophiles and how they target children.

Ultimately, I think it begs the question: What does it mean to be a parent in the digital age?

Content censorship is something I mainly think about in terms of the certification around movies, games, or even the [9 p.m. watershed](&lt;|url|&gt;). Whether we listen to the guidelines or not, at least we have someone watching over us who has vetted this content. But social media outlets, such as YouTube and Facebook, have limited and [grossly inadequate tools](&lt;|url|&gt;). One click and it’s uploaded. We have the capability to report and flag content after the event, but by that time it may be too little, too late. It’s like allowing your child to see the Kamasutra and then telling them to ignore what they’ve seen or heard.

In the [*Guardian](&lt;|url|&gt;)* article, Kat Tremlett, Harmful Content Manager at U.K. Safer Internet Centre, said, “We almost need to stop talking about the issue for it not to be an issue any more.” Of course, this is in relation to the fear that vulnerable people are at risk by content like this encouraging them to think of self-harm. That’s another subject, but on the matter of the Momo Challenge, [Blue Whale](&lt;|url|&gt;), or the [disturbing footage of Peppa Pig on YouTube](&lt;|url|&gt;) in what seems to be a feature of the *Walking Dead*, I disagree — there is a lesson to be learned here that many are overlooking.
> # In the digital age, we have the extra burden of things our parents knew nothing about.

As a parent, we teach our children about most dangers, such as looking both ways before crossing a road, not taking sweets from strangers, not running with scissors, or touching a hot stove. In the digital age, we have the extra burden of things our parents knew nothing about like online grooming, cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and so forth.

We are only seeing the start of these problems since devices are more readily available and a lot of content is free. Advancing technologies also have a role to play in the problem, suggesting more content based on what has been consumed already.

As parents, we’ve tried to take precautionary steps such as locking down our Wi-Fi, content and IP filtering, locked down devices and apps, and time allocation.

I’ve seen some articles and posts from parents about removing YouTube or YouTube Kids completely, allowing them only to watch Cbeebies or Netflix. While that is great for the babies and toddlers, if you’re doing this for children who can talk, just make sure you’re not creating an artificial bubble.

Absolutely take the necessary steps to minimize inappropriate content, as you see fit. But even with the best intentions in the world, we still can’t monitor everything and, at some point, our children will grow up and want to consume more and more, they might even be a content creator themselves, who knows. Let’s just make sure we prepare them for this, just as we would about cars, stranger danger, and bullies.

Ultimately, online content is massive and growing exponentially every day. We can try and bury our heads in the sand but it’s not going away. Our children will inevitably be exposed to it and we can only do our best to prevent harm and educate them on being digitally aware.

1. Prevent as much harm as possible, lock down devices, and turn on content filtering.

1. Talk openly with your child about the potential dangers online (inappropriate content, information sharing). Let them know what to do if they see or hear things they shouldn’t.

1. Make sure you continue to have an open dialogue so they can alert you straight away to any suspicious activity. You can then take the necessary steps and if needed report it to the social platform(s), police, and/or schools.

The Momo Challenge may very well be a hoax, but I think it’s time to turn this horror show into some lemonade. Times are changing and the way we consume content is evolving, so we all need to be digitally aware.<|endoftext|>

# Three Questions About the Future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe

## Three Questions About the Future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe

### **The next phase of Marvel’s movies is much weirder than you realize**

![President of Marvel Studios Kevin Feige, Director Taika Waititi and Natalie Portman of ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ at the San Diego Comic-Con 2019. Photo: Alberto E.

Rodriguez/Getty Images*

Now that Marvel Studios has wrapped up 11 years of superhero storytelling with *Avengers: Endgame*, which has made more money than [any other movie](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the history of cinema, the company finally felt comfortable telling people what’s next. At last week’s San Diego Comic-Con, the studio [announced and/or confirmed](&lt;|url|&gt;) its next nine movies, including new heroes, expected sequels, and a few surprises. But the biggest surprise is that the new, Avenger-less Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn’t make much sense.

To be fair, Marvel Studios is in a bit of a trap, even if it’s one of its own making. Two of its three founding characters are gone, thanks to the exits of Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans — which also means the *Avengers* movies are done, at least for the time being. These are shoes that require several billion dollars to fill, so it makes sense that the studio would need to try some creative ways to do so. But that said, the choices Marvel has made for its upcoming slate are… unexpected. Here are the three biggest questions raised by the next phase of the biggest superhero movies in the world.

### **1) Is the Marvel Cinematic Universe really becoming a multiverse?**

Apparently so, since the Doctor Strange sequel is titled *Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness*. A multiverse seemed kind of inevitable when the Avengers smashed the normal MCU timeline with hammers in *Endgame*, despite the movie (very strangely) going out of its way to point out it was [an enormous problem](&lt;|url|&gt;). Still, when the existence of the multiverse was seemingly confirmed in *Spider-Man: Far From Hom*e, I sighed with relief when Mysterio’s parallel Earth origins were revealed as a lie. Obviously, I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up.

Here’s the problem with a multiverse: It means some of the stories we’re going to see don’t count. If Doctor Strange visits a new universe and helps save the day there, it’s not nearly as compelling as him saving the universe audiences have already been invested in for over a decade. This is an enormous problem for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the greatest strength of which has always been its continuity, how every movie connects in order to build to a stunning, epic climax like *Endgame*. Worse, giving non-nerds multiple Earths and timelines and versions of characters to keep track of could very easily make the simplicity of the current Marvel Cinematic Universe a convoluted mess that could turn off part of the audience.

As best as I can figure it, the only benefit Marvel gets by introducing the multiverse is that it affords the possibility — eventually — of bringing in a new Iron Man and Captain America, with “being from a different universe” being offered as an explanation for why different actors will be taking the roles made iconic by Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. Otherwise, the potential problems raised by this choice seem to far outweigh any benefits it might bring.

### **2) Why the hell is Marvel making an *Eternals* movie?**

It’s a bit surprising that Marvel is making [Shang-Chi](&lt;|url|&gt;) its next superhero, because 1) he’s not a superhero, he’s just good at martial arts, and 2) he’s only been an occasional supporting character in the comics since his own series ended in 1983 (after a 10-year run). However, as the movie is giving the Marvel Cinematic Universe its first franchise headlined by a character of Asian descent, that’s more than enough reason to be happy that *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the 10 Rings* is on its way.

It’s the planned [*Eternals](&lt;|url|&gt;)* movie that really makes zero sense. It may have been a long, long time since Shang-Chi’s heyday, but at least he had a heyday. Marvel has literally made less than 60 *Eternals* comics since their debut in 1976, and the longest series lasted only 19 issues. Comic book fans have consistently shown they neither want nor care for the Eternals characters, and yet now, somehow, they’re headlining what is presumably going to be the grandest, most epic film in the MCU’s upcoming slate.

Explaining who the Eternals are is immensely difficult, which is a large part of the reason why making a movie about them is so bizarre. Here’s a shot:, they’re gods on Earth made by much bigger, more powerful gods called the Celestials in order to protect Earth from the Deviants, whom the Celestials also made for some reason. Now, the Eternals aren’t like Thor and the characters of Marvel’s Norse mythology, who are really just long-lived, hardier-than-normal superheroes with reasonably defined magic powers. The Eternals are much closer to being genuine gods on Earth, because they live millions of years, are close to omnipotent, and can somehow merge together to form a collective consciousness called the Uni-Mind. They are out there.

More importantly, their only contribution to the Marvel comics universe — their only stories — have been as a conduit to the Marvel’s theological cosmology, which includes the Celestials, but also personified entities like Eternity, Death, and a whole host of gods and divine forces and beings and horrors created at the dawn of the universe that are [an unbelievable mess](&lt;|url|&gt;). Even a streamlined version seems like it would be so off-putting to mass audiences that it makes a multiverse seem like a fantastic idea in comparison.

Getting metaphysically spiritual is an area the Marvel Cinematic Universe has not explored, and I sincerely doubt it should. The only reason I can think of that Marvel Studios would make an *Eternals* movie is because it desperately wants to make an *Inhumans* movie but can’t, after the truly garbage TV miniseries made them the company’s most toxic live-action property. Basically, the Eternals are weirder, less comprehensible knockoffs of the Inhumans, who were already weirder, less comprehensible knockoffs of the X-Men. (Fun fact: The Eternals are such essential characters in the comics that they all recently committed suicide off-panel of the current *Avengers* series.)

Of course, the *Eternals* film was in the works long before the Fox acquisition, so even though Marvel has the X-Men movie rights back now, they’re stuck with it. I know everything Marvel Studios touches has turned to gold, and sheer momentum will likely get audiences in seats… but it also has a very good chance of being the MCU’s first major misfire (not involving Ed Norton’s Hulk).

### **3) What’s Marvel’s big plan?**

As mentioned above,* Avengers: Endgame* was the culmination of 11 years of cinematic storytelling, with almost every movie used to build an overarching storyline with an all-encompassing final act so epic it needed two movies to tell. Also as mentioned above, this is the power and the allure of the MCU: All the movies matter. This is what gets audiences to come to not just a few movies, but every single one of them, because they know they need to see them to truly comprehend the full story. It’s such an effective tactic that other studios have been trying to replicate it for years. Marvel Studios isn’t going to suddenly start free-styling their films now.

That said, I cannot fathom how these movies could possibly tie together to make a single story.
> # The final film on the docket is *Thor: Love and Thunder*, which will feature Natalie Portman as the titular thunder god alongside Chris Hemsworth, for which I couldn’t be more excited.

It’s not anything like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, who just needed to be put in a room together and given a common enemy to fight. The upcoming films are wildly different. First up is a Black Widow spy movie set in the past (a necessity because of the character’s death in *Endgame*), followed by the ever-baffling quasi-divine nonsense of *Eternals*. Then *Shang-Chi* will be a martial arts flick, potentially with magic, thanks to its antagonist the Mandarin. That magic connection could tie into the second Doctor Strange film, except *Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness* really makes it sound like he’s going to be hanging out with heroes from a different Earth entirely. The final film on the docket is *Thor: Love and Thunder*, which will feature Natalie Portman as the titular thunder god alongside Chris Hemsworth, for which I couldn’t be more excited.

Those are all of Marvel’s scheduled movies scheduled through 2020 and 2021, but Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige confirmed two other films that we all knew were coming: *Black Panther 2*, which, if it matches the first movie, will be heavily focused on the Earth-bound nation of Wakanda and its future-tech, and the *Captain Marvel* sequel, which will no doubt primarily be an interstellar science fiction film. Then there are the two films people didn’t know were coming: The return of *Blade* — now starring Mahershala Ali as the vampire hunter — along with Marvel’s attempt to finally make a *Fantastic Four* movie that works.

I can envision a second, *Endgame*-level movie in another 11 years in which the threat is a godlike cosmic entity on the level of the planet-eating Galactus. This raises the stakes on Thanos, but more importantly the Fantastic Four deal with these things — Galactus in particular — on the regular. The cosmic aspect ropes in Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Thor, and Black Panther (thanks to being king of the world’s most technologically advanced nation), but I have a very hard time envisioning what Shang-Chi and Blade bring to this party. (Black Widow will still be dead, presumably.) I guess the Eternals could help set this up, but it’s still impossible for me to see them mesh in any sensible way with any other characters, if only because they’re so powerful they make all the other heroes basically redundant. And how in the hell could introducing the multiverse improve an overarching story instead of muddying it?

Obviously, just because I can’t imagine all this working doesn’t mean that Marvel doesn’t have a plan, and based on their track record, odds are it’s a pretty good one. Even if there isn’t, there’s a lot to like about the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s future, primarily its increased diversity. And that’s not counting those five direct-from-the movies Disney+ shows on the way, starring Loki, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and others.

Still, for the very first time ever, I can’t even imagine what Marvel Studios is thinking. In a way, that’s extremely exciting. But there’s still a small, tiny voice in my head that’s worried we may be about to witness an 11-year-long sophomore superhero slump.<|endoftext|>

# How the Internet Transformed the World of Custom Poetry

## Sites like Etsy and Instagram are remaking a classic artistic hustle

![Illustrations: [Shira Inbar](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustrations: [Shira Inbar](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

“Don’t believe those people who say being a poet isn’t lucrative.”

That’s Eric Vance Walton, a writer who composes custom poetry for clients. His business stretches back to the 1990s, before bespoke everything — [shampoo](&lt;|url|&gt;), [perfume](&lt;|url|&gt;), [Game Boys](&lt;|url|&gt;) — became an online phenomenon fed by vendors on Etsy and Instagram. But Walton’s something of an OG: Search for “personalized poetry” on Google and his store is, for now, the first link below a flotilla of ads.

“Most people found me by word of mouth or internet searches,” he says. “I hadn’t heard of anyone else doing it at the time, but I’m sure there were others out there.”

Walton’s been around for a while, and he charges $125 a pop for his custom poems. (He’s also worked a day job at an insurance agency.)

But those without the benefit of SEO need to set the bar a bit lower. People who offer bespoke, personalized poetry on Etsy — [and there are a number of them](&lt;|url|&gt;) — often start at around $50, sometimes less.

Ryan Wilson is a college student who sells [custom poetry for $30 on Etsy](&lt;|url|&gt;). He says he helps provide a service for special occasions.

“I think words are a tricky thing, and the goal people struggle with is to find the perfect set of words to convey a certain emotion,” Wilson explains. “I am, by no measure, an expert, but two minds contributing to the set of words is often better than one. I don’t think I see any one gender more than the other, but most of the poems revolve around some form of love, familial or romantic.”

Both Wilson and Walton note that many of the personalized poems they create are given as gifts for a happy occasion, such as a birthday, wedding, anniversary, or retirement.
> # “I think words are a tricky thing, and the goal people struggle with is to find the perfect set of words to convey a certain emotion.”

Who’s buying? Walton says clients range in gender, age, location, and race, but they’re all “people who know the emotions they want to convey, but they usually just don’t how to communicate those feelings in an eloquent way.”

Many poets have found followings on Instagram, like [Beau Taplin](&lt;|url|&gt;) (who currently has 612,000 followers), [Christopher Poindexter](&lt;|url|&gt;) (362,000), [Kat Savage](&lt;|url|&gt;) (51,000), and[ J.R. Rogue](&lt;|url|&gt;) (also at 51,000). Taplin and Poindexter do custom commissions, generated for their sizable social followings rather than search engine delvers.

Of course, the bespoke poetry hustle hasn’t always required a computer. Jeremy M. Brownlowe, more commonly known as [Typewriter Troubadour](&lt;|url|&gt;), lives a nomadic lifestyle out of his van that he’s built into a “tiny house on wheels.” He sells personalized poetry by sitting in public areas with his typewriter, creating verse on the spot for paying customers. You’ve probably seen others do the same in parks or subways. But Brownlowe also now has an Etsy shop where he sells poems for $40.

“I know that I am acting more as a healing artist, rather than a poet,” Brownlowe says. He adds that he’s “helping people find the right words to express to those they love,” echoing the sentiments of Walton and Wilson.

![](<|image|>)

Unlike Walton and Wilson, however, Brownlowe says that personalized poetry completely pays his bills. In 2015, he financed a road trip through the country — stopping in Tucson, Austin, New Orleans, New York, and Denver — by creating personalized poetry along the way. After the success of this trip, Brownlowe quit his job at a grocery store and now relies solely on the money he makes writing poetry, estimating that he’s written over 10,000 poems since he began.

It’s a rocky life for some. Wilson says “business is inconsistent — I will have a month netting over $400 and then two months where I only receive maybe three orders.” And Walton, who found personalized poetry to be quite lucrative in the 1990s, didn’t quit his job in insurance until 2017, at which point he began writing full-time, but not by way of personalized poetry. His income is based on his publishing novels, as well as his popularity on Steemit, a blockchain-based social platform that rewards popular users with cryptocurrency, where he has over 100,000 followers. Walton says he still takes the occasional commission for personalized poetry when time allows.

Based on user reviews for custom poetry, customers tend to be satisfied. When Debra Scholen was searching for a thoughtful gift for her daughter and son-in-law after the birth of their son, a friend told her about Brownlowe. She commissioned a personalized poem on Etsy.

“It felt old-fashioned and authentic and a perfect way to celebrate the birth of the long-awaited Greyson,” Scholen says.

Customer satisfaction may be so high because many of the poets take a collaborative approach. Walton’s process includes a questionnaire and a 15-minute phone call and/or FaceTime consultation, after which he completes a first draft that he shows to the client for feedback. When describing his own process, Wilson notes that he generally goes back and forth in revisions with the client.

“Sometimes we get it done the same day as the order, other times it takes maybe a week,” Wilson says.

When Brownlowe meets people in person, the entire process takes about 10 minutes. “If I think about it too much, I lose focus, and thus the poem loses its power because it is coming more from my head, rather than my heart,” he explains. “The person then gets the first draft of the poem, in its rawest form.”

### **Remaking the classics**

While all of this might remind you of the millennial branding around products like [custom vitamin packs](&lt;|url|&gt;), it’s really an innovation of an old tradition.

“In the history of Western art, much of what we have that survives was commissioned by the elite, either by wealthy individuals or by national governments or the church,” says Sarah Beetham, an assistant professor of art history at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. “Making a painting or sculpture is an expensive, time-consuming process, and owning works in these media has traditionally been available chiefly to patrons of means.”

Personalized poetry from the internet follows in this tradition, but there’s one key difference: it’s not only the elite who can commission the production. Anyone with as little as $30 can commission a poem based on their own experience.

Thanks to the internet and social media, traditional gatekeepers are no longer the sole decision-makers in terms of what art audiences see, read, experience, and yes, commission. But then, even this — innovation democratizing art — also has historical precedence. “The elite control of art production began to break down with the introduction of reproducible media, including prints, photography, and domestically-scaled sculpture in inexpensive materials,” says Beetham.

Such breakdown continues, leading us to an era in which anyone can commission a custom poem for $30 through an Etsy shop. The process of democratizing art, poetry included, will likely only continue with the next disruptive innovation, whatever that may be — and however it might rhyme.<|endoftext|>

# What Will Happen When Robots Store All Our Memories

## In the future, we could record, optimize, and replay our memories — even after death

![Credit: Ociacia/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Ociacia/Getty Images*

*In an excerpt from his new book *Talking to Robots*, David Ewing Duncan imagines looking back from a future where memories can be permanently stored with the help of a technology called Memory Bot based on an actual conversation he had with Ken Goldberg, Tiffany Shlain, and Odessa Shlain Goldberg.*

Yes, there really was a time when people were expected to preserve memories on their own. A time when you would share with your four-year-old daughter a stunning sunset and it wouldn’t be automatically recorded as a neural-meme. You felt so very close to your little one and she to you, only to have that moment vanish forever. Maybe you took a selfie, but that never really captured the whole experience.

Then came Memory Bot, with its revolutionary Quantum Meme Vector® technology. Created in the future by a husband and wife and their daughter — UC Berkeley roboticist Ken Goldberg, the filmmaker-raconteur Tiffany Shlain, and the future entrepreneur and philosopher Odessa Shlain Goldberg, respectively — Memory Bot was for years the most popular gift ever during the holiday shopping season, even more popular than Teddy Bots. Memory Bot remembered everything that you wanted it to: sunsets with your daughter, your grandson’s bar mitzvah, the birth of your puppy, your promotion at work (before you were replaced by a robot), and on and on.

It all began in a free-ranging conversation in the Shlain Goldberg living room in Marin County, California, way back in 2018. That’s when Ken, Tiffany, and Odessa, who was then14 years old, were sitting quietly late one afternoon chatting about robots, technology, and memory. Ken Goldberg was the first in the family to mention the idea of a memory bot for older people to remember their lives, though the concept soon expanded to a mem bot for everyone. “In some sense, it will be something that is completely focused on gathering your most important memories, those you want to remember, and to have access to, with all the experiences and connections you had throughout life.”

“I think a version of this is actually doable now,” he added, speaking as a Berkeley robotics professor who knew a lot about this stuff. “You could mine the vast amount of information that’s online about each of us. You could have your emails traced through your entire life, and your messages, and your images, et cetera. Then the A.I. can do associative memory, so it’s constantly making associations: linking to the news you read, online searches, and anything that you have connected to. ‘Hey, remember when this thing happened? Remember when that happened?’”

Well, yeah, except that this data could be used less benevolently by advertisers, trolls, pols, and would-be world dictators trying to sell you something or to unduly influence you. But let’s keep going.
> # “Maybe this is one of the optional settings that you have with Memory Bot. It sounds horrible, but maybe you set it on real versus idealized.”

“I think … a problem, especially at the end of life,” he continued, “[is] when you’d like to remember things, but you forget, and maybe so does your partner, if you’re lucky and have one.”

“Wait a second,” said Tiffany. “You often hear about older people getting in a depressive loop because they’re not remembering the right things. I think what Ken is talking about is that you have some sort of Memory Bot that reminds you of all the most beautiful things and moments of your life.”

“Because of my East Coast background, I guess, I like the idea of some bad news, because you need to know that, too,” said Ken. “It’s almost that you would be faking out yourself, that your life had been better than it was. I guess there can be an idealized version, maybe this is one of the optional settings that you have with Memory Bot. It sounds horrible, but maybe you set it on real versus idealized.”

“One kind of offshoot of this idea,” Tiffany said, “which I do think would be really interesting is — there’s so much I’d love to know about my grandparents. I have scraps of photos and recollections from relatives. If there was a bot that could truly reconstruct your email, your photos, really give you a 360-degree view, so a great-grandchild could say, ‘Well, what was Great-Grandpa Zeide-Ken really excited about or worried about?’ They could reconstruct who their parents or their grandparents were, to try to understand them better.”

“They could use their text patterns to have actual conversations generated by the robot that knows so much about the person,” said Odessa.

“I wish I could do that with my father,” said Tiffany, referring to the physician and author Leonard Shlain, who died in 2009. “Sometimes I go into my inbox and I surf something out, and I see one of his emails. He’s like, ‘Hey, Babe,’ and he says these little things. I’ve often thought if you could make this composite of the voicemails he used to leave me, or the emails, and some home video, and lectures, you really could — thinking of the future generation using email, Facebook, and Twitter and whatever future platforms that will inevitably appear — you could create this portrayal of who they were that you could tap into.”

“Maybe the fear of death would change in our society,” said Odessa. “There’s not that mourning period, because you’d never really die.”

“There was a guy I know, and Facebook kept showing memories of his daughter who had died,” said Tiffany. “He finally just canceled, he couldn’t bear it, because she kept appearing even though he tried to expunge her from his account. But Facebook wouldn’t let her die. Who gets access to that? We know that in the digital world almost anything that appeared somewhere doesn’t ever go away.”

For a moment, the family went silent as they absorbed this. Then Odessa raised another important point: “You’ll have people who didn’t have a very good life,” said Odessa. “Maybe they became refugees.”

“Or they were abused,” said Tiffany, “or were drug addicts.”

“I’m not saying they have to take in all of these memories,” said Ken. “I think a lot of empathy has to be evolved into this kind of a situation. Memory Bot has to understand what’s going to work for you, and certainly not to bring up something that’s going to traumatize you.”

To this, Odessa sighed and said, “Maybe there will be times when we just want to turn off the Memory Bot, to let our minds rest and remember things without [a machine],” which made this 14-year-old’s mother and father smile. That’s because the Shlain Goldbergs already practiced something back in the 2010s that they called a “Tech Shabbat,” a weekly break from using technology that they had adapted from the Jewish Sabbath. Not because they were religious, but to take some time off from their machines to reconnect with their family and friends and with themselves.

When the first Memory Bot — the MemBot z2000 — was launched, it was a huge sensation. Older people loved how it bathed them in mostly glowing — but also in some difficult but important — memories of their life. Kids loved it too, as they chatted with great-grandparents and ancestors long dead, almost like they were still alive. Soon after, the MemBot z2000 Plus upgrade included the option to reconstruct from a person’s digital trail a loved one who had died without leaving a mem bot record of their own — a son or daughter, or parent, or best friend.

The first mem bot companies, including one founded by Odessa Shlain Goldberg after she grew up and became a philosopher and entrepreneur, included holo-dashboards that allowed mem bot customers to designate what they wanted to remember or forget. Or to half forget, or one-quarter forget a memory inputted into a mem bot’s Quantum Meme Vector® system. People could also turn up or turn down the machine’s softening and nostalgia vectors or adjust the balance of positive and negative memories whenever they wanted to.

Of course, there were those who believed that memories should never be erased or edited, even people who had suffered horrors and atrocities. “We need to remember when evil occurs,” these purists insisted, “so that they will not be repeated.”

And let’s not even get into law enforcement, which demanded access to unexpurgated memories of anyone who witnessed a crime committed or allegedly committed a crime themselves. Eventually abuses by the police spurred the World Congress to pass the Private Memory Protection Act.

Another unexpected consequence was the scourge of mem addiction. This happened when people became so obsessed and distracted by all the memories, and with conversing with all the dead people, that they neglected to create new memories. Some even lost their jobs and ended up aimlessly roaming the streets, muttering questions to a long-dead great-grandmother or distant ancestor.

Just when things in the future seemed to be getting out of hand, Odessa Shlain Goldberg (as an adult) proposed a solution: the whole world should try taking a Shabbat-like day each week where they put away their machines, including Memory Bot. Slowly, though, through adopting Tech Shabbats and a general dialing-down of the use of gadgets and bots, humanity learned to keep things in balance between memories and reality. Sadly, some people continued to suffer from memory addiction, and there never seemed to be enough beds in memory detox clinics to accommodate them.

Mostly, though, Memory Bots became routine and part of the social fabric of the future as controversies faded, laws and regulations were refined to curb abuses and maximize safe usage, and people became intrigued and distracted by the latest new gadget that was going to wow them, then scare them, and then become routine.

In the old Shlain Goldberg house in Marin County, you could still find Ken, or the essence and memories of Ken, captured inside an eight-inch-tall black cylindrical tube on the kitchen counter that looked remarkably like an ancient Alexa. (Sadly, Ken, as well as Tiffany, had just missed the advent of longevity tech that allowed their daughter to live thousands of years and counting.) Except that Ken-Alexa had a swivel head that was constantly recording everything, with the positive-negative filter still set right where Ken had left it, in the middle of the dial. Even when Odessa was centuries old but still looked the same as she did when she was 25, she could talk to her dad, and ask him questions, and hear him laugh.

# Dear Marvel Studios&#58; Your Cosmos Isn’t Nearly as Interesting as You Think It Is

## Dear Marvel Studios: Your Cosmos Isn’t Nearly as Interesting as You Think It Is

### *Captain Marvel*’s biggest problem isn’t the superhero, it’s the galaxy she lives in

![Image: Marvel Studios/Disney](<|image|>)*Image: Marvel Studios/Disney*

*Captain Marvel* is by no means the greatest superhero film ever made. Even so, many people found Marvel Studio’s first and long overdue movie led by a female character to be unexpectedly lackluster. The titular hero may not have [the cultural cache of *Wonder Woman](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, but the Air Force pilot-turned-alien super-soldier Carol Danvers isn’t the problem (nor is Brie Larson’s [well-reviewed performance](&lt;|url|&gt;)). The real problem is that Marvel has vastly overestimated how much people care about what’s happening in its movie universe’s… well, universe.

Let me stop you before you tell me how much you love *Guardians of the Galaxy* and its sequel, or the goofy, retro delight of *Thor: Ragnarok*. Yes, all three of these ostensibly comic book films are undoubtedly science fiction that primarily take place in space or on other planets. And it’s undeniable that the first *Avengers* movie and *Avengers: Infinity War* featured alien invasions and became two of the highest-grossing films in history. Based off box office receipts, at least, audiences seem to love the wider Marvel cosmos.

They don’t. People loved *Guardians *for the four oddball characters who make up the titular team, not because it introduced the imperialistic Kree empire or the intergalactic space-cops known as the Nova Corps to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The second *GotG* movie wasn’t compelling because it gave us a lengthy history lesson on the primordial, godlike beings called the Celestials, but because the heart of the movie was the relationship between Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord and his father Ego (who also happened to be a Celestial *and* a planet). And I defy anyone who’s read fewer than 100 Marvel comics to tell me the names of both generically evil alien species that serve as cannon fodder in the first *Avengers* movie and in *Infinity War.*

It doesn’t matter what their names are, because they still exist solely to give the heroes things to punch (or hammer or repulsor blast or… arrow). People certainly didn’t need to know anything about the Celestials to enjoy *GotG2*. And the Nova Corps ended up being such an important force in the Marvel galaxy that Thanos essentially killed them offscreen, just before the events of *Infinity War* even began. (RIP, John C. Reilly’s Corpsman Dey.)
> # Marvel Studios can tell us the Kree and the Nova Corps and the Celestials and everything else are incredibly important, but they haven’t been able to actually show us that they’re important.

Even the goofily exhilarating *Thor: Ragnarok* didn’t win over people because of the *Star Wars*-esque look of its alien world, but because of the loving/antagonistic relations between Thor, his brother Loki, and his “friend from work” the Hulk.

The Marvel movies have presented the cosmic elements as important parts of their storytelling universe, and it makes sense because they have indeed been major components of the comic books themselves. Over the past 60 years, they’ve helped form the backdrop for — or directly inspired — some of the publisher’s best-known, best-loved stories. But in the movies, they’re just glorified, galactic set dressing.

Marvel Studios can tell us the Kree and the Nova Corps and the Celestials and everything else are incredibly important, but they haven’t been able to actually show us that they’re important. That’s a Creative Writing 101 failure.

This forms the crux of the problem with *Captain Marvel*, as the movie hinges on an eons-long intergalactic battle between two alien races, one of which we’ve briefly met and the other that is entirely new to movie audiences. (Spoilers follow.)

The movie draws a lot of inspiration from [“The Kree-Skrull War,”](&lt;|url|&gt;) a comic storyline from 1971–72 that was one of comics’ first major and most popular crossover events — a yearlong saga that roped in heroes from all over the Marvel universe. Although, when I say “draws inspiration from,” I really mean “there is a war between aliens called the Kree and aliens called Skrulls” — and that’s about it.

This war is the conflict upon which the bulk of the movie hinges, but no one explains why the war is being fought, let alone why we should be rooting for the Kree other than that’s the side Carol Danvers is on when the film begins. The Skrulls are the bad guys primarily because they look like lizard people, and also because their name sounds like “skull.” This haziness eventually turns out to be part of the plot, but that doesn’t make it any more compelling for the film’s first half. And since the movie eschews the traditional linear superhero origin story, *Captain Marvel* feels largely unmoored at the beginning.

Still, the generic war might be forgivable if the Kree had any sort of personality whatsoever. They live on Generic Sci-Fi Planet #4 — lots of tall buildings with a singular funky design aesthetic, and also flying cars, the trademark visual cue that you’re not on present-day Earth. The Kree boss is essentially the Matrix, with Annette Bening as Morpheus. Even after the movie ends, about the most distinguishing thing you can say about the Kree is that many of them are blue. (But not all of them.) Jude Law’s Yon-Rogg, who is supposed to be one of Carol’s most important, defining relationships, rarely rises beyond “somewhat paternalistic mentor.” Her other Kree “teammates” barely have lines. And even if you thought Lee Pace’s Ronan the Accuser was a nuanced villain in *GotG1* (he was not), his appearance in *Captain Marvel* is nothing more than a glorified cameo.

Again, it’s not like the Nova Corps/Celestials/etc. are any more intrinsically compelling than the Kree. But what gave the *Guardians of the Galaxy* movies so much personality is that they also included the best, most memorable aspect of Marvel’s comics universe — its weirdness.

Think about *GotG*’s gun-toting Rocket Raccoon, or the lovable sentient tree-man Groot. Or the fact that Star-Lord’s dad is, in fact, a Living Planet. Or Jeff Goldblum’s incredibly Goldblum-ian performance as the Grandmaster in *Thor: Ragnarok*. (Although to be fair, just about everything in director Taika Waititi’s *Thor* movie is weird, which is largely why it’s so delightful.) All *Captain Marvel *has going for it is the cat Goose, who is a gag more than an actual character, plus Ben Mendelsohn’s memorable performance as the Skrull leader Talos and his delightful if consistently jarring decision to use his natural, *incredibly* Australian accent to voice an alien lizard shape-shifter.

This is a bummer, because it’s not like the Kree — or the Skrulls — lack for fascinating elements. In the comics, [the Kree](&lt;|url|&gt;) are made up of warmongers, pacifists, revolutionaries, more revolutionaries, and something called the “Lunatic Legion.” The Supreme Intelligence, instead of being a VR module, was a [giant, surly head-blob](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a large jar. There was one Kree who was buried under Stonehenge 3,000 years ago and named Demon Druid! As for the Skrulls, they had a Super-Skrull that could even duplicate superpowers. Better still, the Fantastic Four once hypnotized a few Skrulls into becoming and [believing they were cows](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Please imagine how much better *Captain Marvel* would be if she had been kicked by an alien in disguise as a cow.

Of course, it’s completely natural that the movie would need to mercilessly streamline decades of comics history to make a coherent movie, but it’s a bummer *Captain Marvel* sanded off so many of the edges that make the Marvel Universe’s, er, universe so interesting. This is not to say the movie isn’t worth watching; again, the superhero and the movie are a lot of fun when they move away from the dull, mythos that anchors the film (for both good and ill). Plus, *Avengers: Endgame* will certainly be richer for having seen *Captain Marvel*, given that the character — long confirmed as the most powerful superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — will play a major role in the Avengers’ rematch against Thanos.

Or you can go to merely resend the message that yes, believe it or not, people will watch superhero movies starring female characters (although given that the movie [earned $455 million worldwide](&lt;|url|&gt;) in its opening weekend, Marvel Studios has probably already heard this message loud and clear). Now, if only they would get the message that Marvel’s cosmic mythos isn’t that interesting. It’s the characters — the talking raccoons and tree-people and Jeff Goldblums and yes, the Captain Marvels — who are.<|endoftext|>

# Let’s Not Put the Government in Charge of Moderating Facebook

## Social platforms are not good at policing speech, but Washington would be even worse

![Photo: Alex Wroblewski/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Alex Wroblewski/Getty*

Facebook co-founder [Chris Hughes’ *New York Times* op-ed](&lt;|url|&gt;) last week calling for his former company to be broken up sparked responses from ex-Facebook employees (some [in favor of the idea](&lt;|url|&gt;), some [against it](&lt;|url|&gt;)), Democratic presidential candidates (some [in favor](&lt;|url|&gt;), some [against](&lt;|url|&gt;)), and Facebook itself ([definitely against](&lt;|url|&gt;)). *Politico* called the question of a Facebook breakup “[a new litmus test](&lt;|url|&gt;)” for White House aspirants.

Polarizing as it may be, however, dismantling a major American company isn’t the most radical element of Hughes’ proposal — nor the most troubling. Largely overlooked in all the debate has been his call for a U.S. government agency to regulate online speech, not only on Facebook but on all social media. It’s an idea that may hold intuitive appeal for those concerned about the power of social networks to decide what we can and can’t say — until you start to think about how it might actually work, and how to solve the problems created by social media without creating even bigger ones.
> # Hughes fails to make the case for why online speech should be subject to extra government scrutiny, let alone be made the province of a special government agency.

Breaking up Facebook might marginally reduce the power that Mark Zuckerberg himself holds, but antitrust action alone won’t solve the problem of companies making the rules for online speech. It merely spreads the problem around. Recognizing that, Hughes suggests an additional remedy: the same government agency in charge of regulating privacy would also “create guidelines for acceptable speech on social media.” While acknowledging that the idea of government censorship “may seem un-American,” he notes that courts have already carved out exceptions to the First Amendment, and suggests that more may be needed to respond to problems such as online harassment and live-streaming violence.

He’s right about one thing: the idea of the government deciding what online speech is acceptable does seem un-American. Yes, [there are limits](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the types of speech that are protected by the First Amendment (although Hughes’ example of [shouting “fire” in a crowded theater](&lt;|url|&gt;) isn’t one of them). But as t[he *Verge*’s Adi Robertson points out](&lt;|url|&gt;), those same limits already apply equally to online and offline speech. Hughes fails to make the case for why online speech should be subject to extra government scrutiny, let alone be made the province of a special government agency. If the plan is to establish new legal restrictions on speech, the courts seem unlikely to uphold them. If it’s just to set up optional “guidelines,” it’s hard to imagine how those would differ substantially from platforms’ existing policies.

Setting aside the question of whether federal regulation of online speech is constitutional, it’s worth thinking about whether it would even be desirable. There are assuredly flaws in how the major social networks, including Facebook, moderate speech. But the idea that a government agency would necessarily do better is naive.

It’s easy to forget when proposing noble-sounding government interventions that the government is run by people whose view of the problem might run counter to one’s own. While Democrats are urging social media platforms to [ban white nationalists](&lt;|url|&gt;), Republicans are pressuring them to [stop “censoring” conservative views](&lt;|url|&gt;). It may be obvious to those on the left that hate speech rules on social media should be used to ban the likes of Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos, and they’re frustrated that Facebook and Twitter haven’t acted more decisively. (“Ban the Nazis!” has become a rallying cry for critics of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.) But President Trump is more interested in the alleged [“hate speech” of Ilhan Omar](&lt;|url|&gt;), the Democratic Congresswoman from Minnesota whose statements on Israel have been criticized by some as playing into anti-Semitic tropes.

Anyone who wants a U.S. government agency making new rules for online speech needs to take a moment to think about exactly who would appoint that agency’s leader, and to what political ends they might seek to put it. If the answer is Trump, then leaving content moderation in the hands of private companies might start to look like the lesser of two evils.

It is maddening, of course, to see companies whose chief interests are growth and profit dither and flail when it comes to content moderation. Hughes suggests that, in Facebook’s case, it’s due to a lack of accountability, stemming from the absence of government regulation and Facebook’s dominant market position. (Facebook-owned Instagram, Whatsapp, Messenger, and Facebook itself are all among the world’s most popular social networks, with Facebook the largest of all.)

Realistically, however, decisions about what sorts of speech to tolerate are not as obvious as they seem, and there’s often a tension between consistency and common sense. Rules that seem logical in one context inevitable break down in another, as when Facebook banned the Pulitzer Prize-winning [“napalm girl” photo](&lt;|url|&gt;), or developed a patchwork of hate speech rules that ended up protecting [white men but not black children](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # They didn’t want* *to be in the business of deciding what people can and can’t say. It has been pressure from the public and the media that has pushed platforms to take these problems more seriously.

Before we throw up our hands and tear up the First Amendment, it’s worth considering that the major Internet companies, including Facebook, have actually proven at least somewhat more accountable than Hughes gives them credit for when it comes to regulating online speech. This time last year, Infowars founder and far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was operating unfettered on every major social platform. Now he’s banned by most and under siege on the rest. Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer have been cast out from both Twitter and Facebook. Those two platforms, along with YouTube, waged a whac-a-mole campaign against videos of the New Zealand massacre in April.The results were far from perfect — but [it wasn’t for lack of trying](&lt;|url|&gt;). Harassment and hate speech are still huge problems with serious consequences, but Facebook and Twitter both have large and ever-growing teams devoted to addressing them, and both have genuinely made it a priority in recent years.

None of this is to defend those platforms from scrutiny, let alone to praise them for their public-spiritedness or foresight. On the contrary, the scrutiny is arguably the only reason they’ve acted. They didn’t want* *to be in the business of deciding what people can and can’t say, beyond relatively easily identifiable stuff like nudity and spam that visibly pollutes the average user’s experience. It has been pressure from the public and the media, and in some cases their own employees, that has pushed platforms to take these problems more seriously, and to act to defuse the outcry. The outcome is almost always imperfect, and sometimes the platforms [break their own rules](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the process. But it’s worth noting that this pressure has generally been far more progressive in both intent and effect than the pressure coming from Congress — which, at least until the House changed hands this year, focused on conspiracy theories such as the notion that [Twitter is shadowbanning conservatives](&lt;|url|&gt;), or that Facebook has a vendetta against Trump supporters such as [Diamond and Silk](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Antitrust and privacy regulation are plausibly bipartisan issues, on which we should be able to trust regulators more than we trust Silicon Valley behemoths. But deciding who can say what online is one realm in which government oversight might be worse than the alternative.<|endoftext|>

# Preservationists Are Saving Video Game History, One Upload at a Time

## Games are key to understanding modern culture, but archiving them can be surprisingly challenging

![Credit: The Strong](<|image|>)*Credit: The Strong*

How much is history worth? In May, the video game world got an answer of sorts: $14,000.

That was the winning bid for a prototype of a cancelled game developed for the original Famicom — the Japanese name for the Nintendo Entertainment System from the 1980s, with its pixelated graphics. *Indy: The Magical Kid *was based on a series of Japanese choose-your-own-adventure books. The game [had some early previews](&lt;|url|&gt;) in magazines but was ultimately scrapped, making its reemergence on the auction block — a notable event for a community of preservationists working to save video game history.

But there was a problem. That community, led in part by Nintendo preservation group [Forest of Illusion](&lt;|url|&gt;), hoped to win the game with $7,000 they had raised together — yet that winning bid came unexpectedly from a private collector who has no intention of preserving *Indy* for posterity.

Forest of Illusion co-founder togemet2, who asked not to use his real name because the process of preserving games is sometimes a legal gray area due to copyrights and other issues, tells *OneZero* that the loss came suddenly. (Archivists and historians are not necessarily looking to sell or even distribute versions of games they’ve saved online, but creating an unauthorized reproduction often technically* *violates copyright law.)
> # “This is culture. If we lose the pieces that brought us here, then we’re doomed to repeat our mistakes.”

“Unfortunately, we were outbid in the last few minutes of the auction,” togemet2 says. According to togemet2, the buyer said in an anonymous message sent to a Japanese fan site that “he had bought it to stop reproductions getting out, and that he would protect it as a Japanese treasure.” Togemet2 added that if this is, indeed, the case, the likelihood of the game being lost forever is high.


The preservationist movement is about documenting the past and keeping the video game art form alive for future generations. Gaming historians constantly need to find new ways to preserve the history of games, adapting the medium as they go. In a way, it’s far more difficult than preserving books or artwork. Older games might require a painstaking digitization process to convert the information stored on a cartridge to files readable by a modern computer; newer games on platforms like Steam may not have physical versions at all.

“We’ve finally figured it out that video games aren’t just passive entertainment projects,” says Frank Cifaldi, founder of the Video Game History Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to cataloging and digitizing games. “This is culture. If we lose the pieces that brought us here, then we’re doomed to repeat our mistakes. If we lack an understanding of how we got here and why, then we’re missing out.”


Jon-Paul Dyson, director of The Strong Nation Museum of Play’s [International Center for the History of Electronic Games](&lt;|url|&gt;) in Rochester, New York, explains that this archival work is a way to track the fundamental act of play. He believes that studying and preserving the way humans play is an important path to understanding the development of a culture.

“Play is something that’s universal and continues throughout our life cycle,” Dyson says. “The result is that play pervades almost every aspect of our lives. Video games are, in some sense, the most recent form of play.”

Of course, unlike with a painting, say, video games archives demand the preservation of a full and interactive experience — generally, pressing buttons to initiate certain actions on a screen, which the game then reacts to. It’s not always a matter of locking away an old cartridge with a Super Nintendo and a TV, either. We may think of electronic data as permanent, but certain forms of physical media “literally rot,” Cifaldi explains, as the materials and chemicals used to write the data deteriorate, which will wipe out chunks of information stored on the discs. Archiving these sorts of files, by copying data into easily readable and playable formats, is essential in keeping these titles around.

The process is different depending on what they’re hoping to save. There are devices and systems that can digitally back up games for you. “Typically, we’re taking data from one format to another,” Cifaldi says. “A typical easy process would not surprise you. This is a DVD that has data on it. I’m going to put it in a DVD drive on a computer, and I’m going to make an image of that disc so it’s on a hard drive instead of that disc.”

Byuu, a Tokyo-based software developer and preservationist of retro games who asked to go by his online alias due to privacy concerns, uses specially built programs to dissect and “reverse engineer” retro gaming machines so that old games can be played on new computers. (Again: Legal gray area.) Byuu is working on documenting circuit boards for Super Nintendo game cartridges; he tells *OneZero* he’s documented 1,200 so far, with a backlog of 1,500 more to go.

He uses a special hardware device that allows him to “analyze the entire circuit board memory layouts of SNES games” to save as much detail as possible. By doing this, Byuu is able to discover interesting bits of history that have otherwise been unexplored, like a critical detail embedded into the *Rockman X* cartridge. (You might recognize this by its American title, 1993’s *Mega Man X*.)

“It was discovered to contain bodge wiring” — a material used to quickly revise circuit boards — “to fix a last-minute production error caused by their copy protection,” Byuu says. In other words, developer Capcom fixed a problem by soldering in a wire. “Details like these were not well-known, and certainly not documented anywhere publicly in the SNES emulation space. Details like that affect our emulation of the game, and are critical to understand and re-create. They’re also interesting tidbits of history in their own right.”

That seems obsessive — and really, it is obsessive — but details count. You may have played modern updates of *Mega Man X *([on your iPhone](&lt;|url|&gt;), even), but they’re not necessarily fully representative of the original work. You might think of it like a high-quality print of Claude Monet’s *Water Lilies* — perhaps good enough to the average viewer, but missing the texture a discerning audience would notice.

Once a game is digitally preserved, archivists will scan in any additional game materials, like boxes, manuals, or even press materials. All of this is relevant to understand the cultural moment these games sprang from. For example, Carly Kocurek, a video game historian and associate professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology, is researching the “games for girls moment,” a 1990s effort led by developers like Purple Moon and HeR Interactive to create games specifically for girls. Kocurek needs to dig into old gaming magazines to learn about how these titles were marketed.

“I go through page by page and scan headlines, and then I take pictures of any pages I want to keep a copy of,” Kocurek says. “I upload these to Dropbox, and then I spend time sorting them in a way that makes sense for me.”

Cifaldi, too, has been working with *Game Informer*, a video game magazine that’s been published since 1991, to archive the documents they’ve kept over the years. That means press releases, photos, and image slides.

“The archive part — keeping these in a physical location — is easy,” Cifaldi says. “But the digitizing part… We had to build a network area storage here at *Game Informer*. We have a network-attached storage box here with 20 TB of space that we’re actually in danger of filling.”

### **The digital revolution**

Painful as it can be, archiving physical material can be easier than some modern challenges. Many new video games are digital-only, which means there are no cartridges or discs to work with. They’re online only as long as a publisher says they should be, and they may have digital rights protections that check with a server before allowing a person to play. If a server goes down, a game could be permanently lost. Additionally, copyright law makes preserving these games a challenge.

“For more recent games where there are no physical copies, that’s a real mess,” Kocurek says. “There’s so many interdependencies and the companies have a lot more control. It’s going to be hard to work around.”

Dyson agrees. He didn’t expect the range of complicated issues that have arisen with online games. “A game on your phone has no physical form,” Dyson says. “It gets even more complicated if parts of the game rely on some sort of external server that the company is operating. What happens if the company chooses to shut down that server?”
> # “A lot of what we think of now as the digital archives came from the piracy scene.”

Sometimes, preservation is simply impossible. Because of the intellectual property issues involved in preserving games, there are plenty that aren’t available legally. Occasionally the International Center for the History of Electronic Games is able to work out a deal with a company to record and preserve gameplay, instead of the actual files of a game.

That’s where piracy comes in.

“A lot of what we think of now as the digital archives came from the piracy scene,” Cifaldi says. Before Blizzard [announced its intention in November 2017](&lt;|url|&gt;) to develop *World of Warcraft Classic*, for example, some enterprising groups re-created the old, pre-expansion experience on private servers. “It’s people pirating the stuff and putting it online. As far as I know, we don’t have a very good piracy scene for smartphone games.”

Smartphones are particularly tricky. In 2017, Apple stopped supporting 32-bit applications on its App Store. Developers that didn’t upgrade their software to 64-bit would be left behind — and thousands were. This includes plenty of games that will no longer be accessible as cultural artifacts, creating what will be “a cultural black hole,” game designer Adam Ghahramani [wrote in VentureBeat](&lt;|url|&gt;) in June 2017.

New initiatives are trying to combat this, bringing the work of video game historians and archivists to the people, without dealing with copyright laws. Kocurek is creating a zine, [*Save Point](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, that covers the history of games and games research.

“While lots of people (including me!) research the history of video games, a lot of that work ends up in journal articles or books geared toward an academic audience,” [Kocurek wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) on her Kickstarter, which is now fully funded. Her goal is to create something that’s easily accessible to anyone interested, offering an important look into the history of play.

“I don’t think history necessarily impacts the future, but it absolutely shapes the present,” she says. “The history of games can tell us a lot about daily life, about technological and economic history, and about shifting ideas of childhood and productivity.”

And rest assured: the words “game over” aren’t in the vocabulary.<|endoftext|>

# Long Live Recap Podcasts

## Long Live Recap Podcasts

### *“Game of Thrones” has ended — but recap podcasts will endure*

![Photo: HBO](<|image|>)*Photo: HBO*

Daenerys and her dragons didn’t just come for King’s Landing. They came for my content.

Though the last season of *Game of Thrones* was [widely regarded as a creative failure](&lt;|url|&gt;), people watched — more than 19 million for the series finale last month. And more importantly, they tweeted, blogged, and podcasted. (As *The Outline [*reported in April](&lt;|url|&gt;), some outlets produced hundreds, if not thousands, of individual pieces of GoT coverage.)

I love *Game of Thrones*, but I’m not the world’s biggest fan. I haven’t read all the books, I don’t follow the stars on social media, and I’m not going to [name my future daughter Arya](&lt;|url|&gt;). I am an avid podcast listener, though. And what I love — or loved — about *Thrones*, probably more than the show itself, was the discussion that surrounded it: the swarm of conversation, debate, and theorizing that emerges from a true pop culture phenomenon.

Recap podcasts, particularly those dedicated to *Game of Thrones*, provide me access to a nearly endless stream of thoughts, analysis, and opinion that enrich the source material, deepen my understanding of plot and character, and transport me from the relatively dreary events of our current reality and into the magic and, yes, tragedy of another world.

Of course, *Game of Thrones* isn’t the only show with an army of fan-and-media-created podcasts, and it isn’t where I first stepped into the world of recap podcasts. This was a slow, and relatively recent descent, beginning with the Westworld podcast [*Out West](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and *Vanity Fair*’s [*Still Watching](&lt;|url|&gt;) *series.* *They gradually began to take the place of the political and true crime podcasts I’d been listening to regularly, but not loyally, before.

Shows like *Westworld* and *Game of Thrones* are, in a way, mystery shows. Much of what makes for the most delightful post-episode conversation is laying out the pieces and deciphering their message. But many podcasts move beyond mere plot recapping and theory speculating to delve deep into character motivations, production choices, and the differences between the books that serve as source material and the shows they spawned.
> # “New viewers of *Game of Thrones* will still have a sense of watching with others, even years from now”

This conversation can sometimes be considerably more interesting than the shows themselves. A listener review of one of my favorite recap podcasts, [*Storm of Spoilers](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, mentions how she didn’t even get into the television show until after she’d been listening to the podcast for several weeks. *Storm of Spoilers* is more of a traditional recap and discussion model; another of my favorites, *The Ringer*’s [*Binge Mode](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, feels like a literature class discussion in the best way possible.

Karen Petruska, an assistant professor in communication studies at Gonzaga University who has [researched](&lt;|url|&gt;) recap culture, says that part of the appeal of recap podcasts is that they serve as modern-day stand-ins for the “watercooler of yore.”

“Recap podcasts are one way to extend the pleasure of viewing,” she says. “A recap podcast can provide a sense of community in viewing — you can listen even after the series has long been completed, which means new viewers of *Game of Thrones* will still have a sense of watching with others, even years from now.”

*Game of Thrones* post-episode Twitter discussions were also a delight: Witnessing people’s glee and rage by turns was part of what made the show so special. “This is a show that both debuted and ran in an era where live-tweeting, post-episode breakdowns, and podcasts are the norm,” Myles McNutt, a media studies expert and assistant professor at Old Dominion University, told [*Esquire](&lt;|url|&gt;)* earlier this year. The show’s Twitter conversation has swollen from [47,000 Twitter interactions](&lt;|url|&gt;) following episodes from Season 2 to the series finale’s [vast numbers](&lt;|url|&gt;) of 7.2 million Twitter interactions — considerably more than the next runner-up for the week, *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, which hit 1.4 million Twitter interactions.

But there’s also a limit to how much I could spam my own Twitter feed with *Game of Thrones* content before being muted or unfollowed by my treasured followers. Twitter conversations are also limited by the inherent brevity of the form, and thus are often quicker, more reactionary, and more surface-level. So when I don’t have a big group of friends who also watch the show, and find the Twitter conversation stopping short of what I want it to be, podcasts are my best option.

*Game of Thrones* is done, though, and with it, most of the corresponding podcasts. The content monolith that was *Game of Thrones*, the power it wielded over cultural discourse, the way it got everyone talking and arguing and analyzing a show like they were in school again — that’s over.

But there are others. [*Westworld](&lt;|url|&gt;)* will come back next year, and [*Big Little Lies](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, one of the most beautiful shows I’ve ever seen, returns with Season 2 this Sunday. I’ll listen to the accompanying podcasts with joy, and participate in the Twitter conversations with equal parts fervor and consternation. But the way *Game of Thrones* and its accompanying cultural discourse has devoured me? That’s unlikely to return, but then again, you never know. [Ask me again in 10 years](&lt;|url|&gt;).<|endoftext|>

# Why Being Mean Online Is Never the Way to Go

## Why Being Mean Online Is Never the Way to Go

### *Keep it in the DMs, if you must*

![Credit: d3sign/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: d3sign/Getty Images*

*In Microprocessing, columnist Angela Lashbrook aims to improve your relationship with technology every week. She’ll go deep on the little things that define your online life today.*

In early January, the internet erupted over a blog published on* Bon Appetit*. “[Why I’m Never Buying Dollar Pizza Again](&lt;|url|&gt;)” by Alex Delany critiqued the very notion of cheap slices because of their “mediocre” ingredients and something about the environment. He reasoned we should splurge on $4 slices.

Twitter [didn’t](&lt;|url|&gt;) [take](&lt;|url|&gt;) [this](&lt;|url|&gt;) [well](&lt;|url|&gt;). People reasoned that the article was classist, in that the writer didn’t take into account why someone would only be able to pay a dollar for a pizza slice. Someone dug up one of Delany’s old [stories](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the proper way to hold and consume a slice, to which someone [snarked](&lt;|url|&gt;): “Someone needs to come get this mans.” (Delany declined to comment for this article.)

Was some of the social media criticism warranted? Sure. But was it really worth all of this? No — and the pile-on reveals a harmful tendency on social media that has more side effects than you might realize.

A few months ago, I made it a goal on Twitter to, as I call it, “keep it in the DMs.” Instead of snarky retweets or posts in which I rage about something people already know about, I’ll direct message or text it to a friend. We’ll bitch privately about how wrong the author of the piece was, expressing our frustration without infecting anyone else — including the original writer. The stupid article will fade into obscurity faster because fewer people are propelling it into the public eye.

It’s been a mildly successful experiment — I still post emotional tweets, only to realize my mistake and delete them a couple minutes later — but I feel a lot better, like I’m saving my public anger for issues that really matter.

Of course, having a rude or combative online personality doesn’t necessarily mean you’re like that IRL. But the internet does make it easy to unthinkingly engage in mean, unhealthy, or generally negative behaviors that we might avoid in our offline lives.

“When we’re communicating with other people online, we’re communicating with disembodied representations of them,” Nicholas Brody, an assistant professor of communication studies at the University of Puget Sound, tells *OneZero*. “So when you’re not communicating with somebody’s actual physical presence, you tend to disassociate what you’re saying from how it affects them.”

That’s one reason it’s so much easier to express anger or frustration online, or even to mock someone, than it is in real life: The perpetrator doesn’t have to see the expression on their target’s face when they attack them in a tweet. In a [2004 paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the journal *CyberPsychology* *and Behavior*, psychologist John Suler defines this as the “disinhibition effect.” “Invisibility” is one factor that contributes to disinhibition — both “benign disinhibition,” in which people might feel more open and comfortable, and “toxic disinhibition,” in which cruelty and negativity become easier to express. And in a [2011 study](&lt;|url|&gt;), researchers found that the lack of eye contact that comes with communicating via screens, even more than anonymity or invisibility, contributed most significantly to negative online disinhibition.
> # A 2012 sentiment analysis of interactions between popular Twitter users and their followers found that audiences tended to replicate the moods of the larger accounts they followed.

That’s why a person like myself, who is relatively shy offline, feels more socially comfortable online. But it’s also why I’m more likely to get into an argument on the internet than I would IRL.

It’s not just how being online can unleash problematic aspects of my own personality. Because the things I say or boost on social media reach a larger audience than the opinions I voice in a physical context, the potential impact of those words can be much larger. A [2012 sentiment analysis](&lt;|url|&gt;) of interactions between popular Twitter users and their followers found that audiences tended to replicate the moods of the larger accounts they followed. In other words, if a popular Twitter user goes on a rant about a slightly annoying article, it will cause their followers to post similarly angry and irritated tweets.

And if there’s a human target for someone’s rant, it can be even more harmful. Brody, whose research has focused on how the bystander effect is expressed in online communications, tells *OneZero* that cyberbullying can be particularly destructive because of the size of the online audience.

“Whereas a traditional bullying incident might be witnessed by two or three other people, when we’re connected to, on average, hundreds of people, depending on which online context we’re talking about, it’s likely that many people will see this incident,” he says. “So when audiences are larger, that can exacerbate the negative effects.”

And it isn’t only the biggest and meanest accounts that shoulder this responsibility. In a [2018 article on *Motherboard](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University, and Ryan Milner, an associate professor of communication at the College of Charleston, discuss how biomass pyramids, typically used in biological and ecological contexts, provide a useful method for analyzing how negative views and perceptions spread on social media.

![Image: [The Earth Project](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Image: [The Earth Project](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

A biomass pyramid can be loosely understood as a food chain. At the top is the apex predator, the animal with the most individual power of the ecosystem. Spreading below this creature are the varying levels of the food chain, down to the very bottom — plants, insects, and other seemingly less significant and powerful organisms that make up an ecological habitat. The food chain grows wider as it reaches the bottom because the amount of energy a lower-level organism provides is significantly less; for example, a bear would need to eat a lot more berries to be satiated than if it were eating a fox, which occupies a higher level of the pyramid.

This model applies to internet communication because, as Phillips and Milner write in their article, “biomass pyramids speak to the fact that there are far more everyday, relatively low-level cases of harmful behavior than there are apex predator cases.”

In other words, it isn’t only large accounts, coordinated harassment campaigns, and other major online events that spread negativity and cause harm on social media. It’s all of us, from those with huge Twitter or Instagram followings to the “egg” just getting started with their account. We all participate in making the internet a more stressful place with every negative comment, from snarky quote retweets to ironic inside jokes that create clear lines between who’s “in” and who’s “out.”

The problem can quickly snowball. One [2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) out of Stanford and Cornell found that a combination of being in a bad mood and seeing negative social media posts doubles the likelihood of negative or trolling online behavior.

“You might think that there is a minority of sociopaths online, which we call trolls, who are doing all this harm,” Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, an assistant professor of information science at Cornell and one of the study’s authors, told the [science publication* Mosaic](&lt;|url|&gt;) *in 2018. “What we actually find in our work is that ordinary people, just like you and me, can engage in such antisocial behavior.”

Yes, the onus is on social media platforms to combat harassment, stalking, and the spread of misinformation, all of which contribute to unpleasant and dangerous online experiences. And the incredibly positive changes that can come from social media — from holding racists and sexists accountable to encouraging us to tell personal stories we might otherwise keep hidden — absolutely shouldn’t be ignored.

But for many of us, our tweets and comments are often nothing more than unfiltered babble. They’re meaningless bitching, pointless takes, and rants that don’t accomplish anything but spreading negativity.

Leah Finnegan, an editor at the *Outline* and former *Gawker* staffer, addresses this subject in her recent column, “[‘Be Yourself’ Is Terrible Advice](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

“In tweeting mean shit about *Slate* articles, I was speaking my truth. In writing sarcastic blogs, I was being real,” she writes. “Had I authenticated myself into a corner, one devoid of social acceptance and, perhaps more importantly and embarrassingly, love?”

The essay deals with a lot more than just being rude online, but it does, very beautifully, confront the ways we compose our online personalities to feel “real,” though we are often merely acting on our worst impulses. Sometimes, being our “most authentic self” online really just translates to being a jerk and running our mouths. While it feels good in the moment, in all likelihood, it won’t amount to anything positive — for you or for anyone else.

So if you see a really awful, terrible tweet, or when someone from your hometown posts a frustrating opinion on Facebook, just screenshot it — and then text it to your friends. Save your hot takes for the stuff that’s actually worth a public expression of anger or indignation. If we sit on our hands instead of firing off a snarky post, we might just help build an ever so slightly less miserable internet.<|endoftext|>

# The Blockchain Is a Reminder of the Internet’s Failure

## The same utopian promises that bloomed during the Internet’s early days are back. Be afraid.

![Credit: Lya_Cattel/E+/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Lya_Cattel/E+/Getty*

I remember the day I fell in love with the Internet as well as I remember the birth of my children. The summer of 1993; I was a reporter at the alt-weekly *San Francisco Bay Guardian *and* *my editor assigned me a story about an anime convention in Oakland, California. I asked the organizer of the conference where I could find some *otaku* (fanboys) to interview. “They all hang out on the Internet,” he said.

I didn’t have Internet access, but I had a modem and a CompuServe account that I used to exchange emails with my uncle. An hour spent lurking in a CompuServe anime forum sparked a life-changing epiphany. The online world, I realized instantly, was a fantastic reporting tool. I learned more about anime in that hour than I could have in a week spent tracking down interview subjects via landlines. I knew right away that I had to break out of the CompuServe walled garden and start homesteading the wild Internet.

From that day forward, my Rolodex might as well have been carved on cuneiform tablets. Within a week, I had figured out how to use my wife’s University of California, Berkeley student account to telnet and gopher and FTP my way around the pre-web “Net.” Within the year, I had quit the *Guardian* (although not before dropping a cover story — “How to Connect to the Internet”) and started writing for a brand new magazine called *Wired*.
> # I loved the Internet. But 25 years later, I see the words “the blockchain is the new Internet” scrolling down Twitter and* *I want to shake my news feed by the scruff of the neck and growl: *Have you people learned nothing?!*

As is so often the case with new converts, I was an instant over-the-top evangelist. And why not? Dreams formerly relegated to pulp science fiction novels had become reality: the library of all knowledge was just a few 14.4 baud beeps and gurgles away. I was far from a libertarian but I do confess to resonating to John “cypherpunk” Gilmore’s declaration that “[the Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.](&lt;|url|&gt;)” Totalitarians, corporate overlords, and media monopolies: beware! Your gatekeeping days were over! The Internet had set us free.

Gosh, I loved the Internet. But 25 years later, I see the words “[the blockchain is the new Internet](&lt;|url|&gt;)” scrolling down Twitter and it’s all I can do to keep from screaming: O*h man, I fucking hate the blockchain. *I want to shake my news feed by the scruff of the neck and growl: *Have you people learned nothing?!* Call me apostate, or maybe just an aging grouch, but if the blockchain really is the new Internet, we’re all screwed.

Let’s get a few things out of the way. I do not hate the blockchain because I fundamentally question the technical merits of cryptographically-secured, distributed-database technology. Nor do I hate the blockchain because of how quickly Initial Coin Offerings turned from “innovative way to raise startup capital without selling your soul to venture capitalists” to “how fast can [we scam a whole generation of crypto-suckers](&lt;|url|&gt;) out of their cash before security regulators slam the door on our collective ass?” I don’t even hate the blockchain because bitcoin seems, at this point, primarily a way to transmute massive amounts of electricity into a speculative, [climate-change accelerating](&lt;|url|&gt;) investment commodity. There are a great many smart people working on blockchain implementations and [a ton of money](&lt;|url|&gt;) pouring into the space. I am prepared to concede that some useful applications will emerge that make my life more convenient and don’t break the planet. A few years had to pass between Mosaic 1.0 and the debut of Spotify and streaming Netflix and the iPhone. There’s still plenty of time before we call this round of innovation a wrap.

No, my problem has little to do with the actual technology. My gripe is with human faith in technology. [The same kind of utopian promises](&lt;|url|&gt;) that bloomed during the Internet’s early heyday — “[freedom, fairness, and equality for the society of tomorrow](&lt;|url|&gt;)” — are on the tip of every bitcoin miner’s tongue. The passion of the true zealot is everywhere: “[The blockchain will set us free](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

But if there is one thing that we should have learned from the history of the last 25 years, it is that digital networks and computers and code are no solution to human brokenness. With each passing day, the opposite seems more likely to be true. Pressure exerted by the Internet cracked some long-existing social fissures wide open.

Instead of gaining access to the library of all human knowledge, we ended up card-carrying members of Jorge Luis Borges’ “[Library of Babel](&lt;|url|&gt;)” — that infinite biblio-nightmare that stockpiled every possible iteration of gibberish along with the *real *books written in *real *languages.

Instead of leading us to truth, the Internet gave everyone the unparalleled opportunity to build their own personal knowledge universe, catalyzing a comprehensive unmooring of society from actual fact that has surely been a factor in the rise of Trump and a global turn towards propaganda-fed authoritarianism.
> # I respect the idealism of blockchain developers… But I am confounded by their inability to see that they are falling victim to exactly the same fallacies their hacker forebears embraced.

Instead of freeing ourselves from the manipulation of corporations and governments, we have bequeathed them the most powerful tools of panopticonic surveillance and control ever invented.

[The smartest blockchain developers that I have talked to](&lt;|url|&gt;) do not deny these truths of what the Internet has wrought. On the contrary, what gets them most excited about the future is their confidence that blockchain technology is the antidote for all the toxic ills unleashed by Internet anarchy. Once their dream of perfectly decentralized, unhackable, smart-contract-executing “trustless” tech is perfected, they believe, central banks and government tyranny will be rendered impotent, [nation-state borders transcended, voting fraud and fake news made impossible](&lt;|url|&gt;). The blockchain, in their view, is a teleological apotheosis, the perfection of progressive human civilization through technology.

At the heart of this vision is the idea that human messiness can be abstracted away by clever code. In a “trustless” system, public key cryptography and the “consensus” generated by distributing a database across multiple nodes eliminates the potential for fraud or corruption or exploitation committed by any intermediary. Smart contracts will automatically execute the terms of any deal, without getting bogged down by human fickleness or well-capitalized litigation. Tyrants will be powerless against cryptocurrency-funded freedom fighters organized in decentralized networks.

That’s the theory, anyway. But it misses the most important point about human messiness. The indisputable fact — obvious to anyone who has studied the history of technology or simply been alive for the last 25 years — is that living, breathing humans will deploy any conceivable technology for both good and evil, for the realization of both freedom and tyranny, for greed and power, and just plain mayhem. The Internet gave white supremacists a voice denied to them for decades; nothing is going to stop them from figuring out how to use blockchain technology for bigotry. Smart contracts will be tested in human courts. Regulators will regulate.

Decentralization is the first commandment of the blockchain faith. But what did [William Butler Yeats tell us](&lt;|url|&gt;) happens when “the center cannot hold”? *Things fall apart*!

I respect the idealism of blockchain developers who, I believe, are sincere in their faith that they are building a better world. But I am confounded by their inability to see that they are falling victim to exactly the same fallacies their hacker forebears embraced: this notion that we can code ourselves out of the deep holes we’ve dug; that we are building utopias in our virtualities that will finesse away the imperfections of human character.

It seems to me increasingly clear that we need to spend less time abstracting away our humanity and more time pressing the flesh. Instead of seeking out the anomie of decentralization, we need to figure out how to come together. To successfully deal with the failings of humanity, we have to spend more time with humans and less time thumbing our smartphones.

It’s not hard to understand the urge to declare that “the blockchain is the new Internet.” The mid-90s were a giddy time; the astonishingly fast transformation that swept through the culture was unlike anything in recent memory, and if you were riding the shockwave of that blast, it was exhilarating. Linked together in a global network, the computers that Steve Jobs called “bicycles of the mind” promised to take us anywhere we wanted to go. And, of course, a whole lot of people ended up making quite a bit of money off the new digital infrastructure. So who wouldn’t want to return to optimism of those days? Peace, love, and the Internet, man. It was *so *groovy.

That’s why I loved the Internet so much. Because of that sense of possibility and hope and progress. But that’s also exactly why I hate the blockchain. Because it reminds me of just how illusory those promises turned out to be.<|endoftext|>

# San Diego Comic-Con Is Overcrowded. Let’s Make It Bigger

## San Diego Comic-Con Is Overcrowded. Let’s Make It Bigger

### The world’s biggest pop culture convention has become its least enjoyable, but it doesn’t have to be

![Photo: Daniel Knighton/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Daniel Knighton/Getty Images*

San Diego Comic-Con is a one-of-a-kind experience that everyone who’s excited about pop culture — which is just about everyone — should attend once. And that should be the last time. One visit is all you’ll need to realize that despite the stars, the festival, the crowds, and (to a much lesser extent) the comics, the event has gotten so big that it’s not just bloated — it’s broken.

But it doesn’t have to be. And it turns out that the way to fix a big and bloated pop culture mega-event is to make it even *bigger*.

To anyone who’s waited hours in line in hopes of attending a hot panel at Comic-Con, or tried to find a place to have dinner in San Diego’s Gaslamp Quarter after the show, this may sound crazy. After all, the world’s biggest pop culture expo’s main problem is that there are simply too many people here. The issue goes beyond long lines, of which there are plenty. The con draws a reported 135,000 attendees to the San Diego Convention Center, which has [a capacity of 125,000](&lt;|url|&gt;) — and this attendee number doesn’t count the thousands of guests, exhibitors, staff, and media personnel who also have to squeeze into the convention center and its environs.
> # At its busiest, on Friday and Saturday, you can quite literally get swept away by the nerd herds roaming the aisles.

San Diego Comic-Con takes a ridiculous amount of time and effort to actually attend. The [67 “official” hotels](&lt;|url|&gt;) — positioned within an eight or so mile radius — can only be reserved through a lottery, held in April, in which all rooms are booked within a minute. (No exaggeration.) If you’re not one of the lucky few to end up within walking distance of the San Diego Convention Center, you have to drive through bumper-to-bumper traffic to get to the marina, and then battle for parking. (ACE, owner of many downtown garages, has its [own, unofficial lotto](&lt;|url|&gt;) to use its spaces.) And once you’ve finally managed to arrive, the fighting really begins.

Half of the Comic-Con experience is entering its giant exhibit hall, where studios and networks hawk their newest projects, and companies like Hasbro and Lego sell their goods. At its busiest, on Friday and Saturday, you can quite literally get swept away by the nerd herds roaming the aisles — except for the elaborate booths for companies such as Lucasfilm, in which people won’t be moving at all. If you’re hoping to see or buy anything popular, you’ll have to fight the con’s tremendous crowds to get there. Going to panels is primarily a series of waiting in lines: Want to hear Marvel talk about its Phase 4 plans? Buy the show’s countless toy exclusives? Get signatures from the guests? Eat food? Go to the bathroom? Expect to wait.

In fact, if you’re looking to get into Hall H — the convention center’s largest seating area, containing room for [6,500 attendees](&lt;|url|&gt;), which amounts to less than 5% of the con’s total attendees — expect to wait a lot. Hall H is where the con’s biggest studios show off their upcoming projects, including Marvel. Last year, the line formed on Tuesday, [two days before the show even started](&lt;|url|&gt;) — and the most anticipated panels are usually held Saturday evening. Worst still, you can wait in line for all those days and *still* be told there’s no more room in the hall when you finally get to the front of the line.
> # The solution isn’t making the con smaller — it’s making it bigger.

In all cases, the problem is that there are too many damn people in too damn small an area, and it’s been a problem for years — despite the San Diego Comic-Con capping its attendance [since 2007](&lt;|url|&gt;), out of necessity more than largess. Lowering the cap would make the con’s offerings more accessible, as well as allow for some badly needed breathing room, but it’s unrealistic. Fewer people attending means fewer reasons for studios and companies to bring exclusives for attendees, and that means fewer reasons for people to want to deal with all the hassles that come with attending the show in the first place, and so on. It’s a spiral that doesn’t end well for anyone.

So the solution isn’t making the con smaller — it’s making it bigger. We can start by having San Diego Comic-Con run Monday through Sunday. A longer show means more attendees, which means more sales and more people to be marketed to — and these are all good things.

The real solution is to divide the seven-day con into two reasonably distinct halves. Thursday through Sunday would be Comic-Con business as usual. Before it would be a second, separate opportunity to attend Comic-Con, but from Monday to Thursday. Fans could have the option to buy a full, weeklong pass if it was absolutely necessary, but there would be no real benefit to it. There’s only so much disposable income fans bring to the show, and they can spend it in three days just as easily as seven. (Actually, they can spend their nest egg in 30 minutes with a little effort, and many of them do.) As someone who has attended many times, I can heartily assure you no one needs to be at Comic-Con for more than four days unless they’re working there.

Even if it’s perceived as “Comic-Con Lite,” I’m confident there will be a real appeal in a less intense Comic-Con experience, perhaps for those who need more scheduling flexibility, or aren’t interested in fighting the crowds of the weekend, or might be more budget-minded. These qualities would surely appeal to some of the normal Comic-Con crowd, which would alleviate the density issues of “Part 2” somewhat, meaning attendees could move around more easily and potentially get a seat at a San Diego restaurant without walking two miles from the convention center.

The obvious problem is that making the con longer means the costs for the con — and the exhibitors — rise. The San Diego Convention Center charges rent, after all, and the marketing teams who have to monitor their booths and shopkeepers selling goods all have to be housed and fed throughout the event. Making the show’s attendees more comfortable is nice, but it doesn’t make a profit, nor does it raise brand awareness.

But the dramatic increase of people attending an extended con would be enough to entice those studios and booths and sellers to tack on a few extra days to their trip, especially if Comic-Con cuts them a deal to do so. A few well-placed discounts could also be enough for some of the exhibitors to move some of their panels and events to earlier in the week, at least while “Part 1” is getting off the ground.

Some panels could even be run twice, and potentially attract twice as many viewers. There’s no way Marvel Studios would wrangle all 5,000 stars of *Avengers: Endgame* to two separate panels on two separate days, even if they could. But it doesn’t seem to be out of the realm of possibility for HBO to have a *Westworld* panel on Tuesday night with a couple of the show’s supporting actors, then bring stars Evan Rachel Wood and Jeffrey Wright out for a second, bigger panel on Friday night.

Here’s the other reason I’m certain this could work: It already has, kind of. Although San Diego Comic-Con traditionally (and officially) runs for four days, it began offering a Wednesday “preview night” to press and guests in the early 2000s. In 2012, it began charging fans for the opportunity to get this early access to the exhibit hall, and they’ve been buying it ever since. Comic-Con is essentially five days long already. What’s another two days, especially when there’s a chance to grab so many new attendees?

I don’t see who loses here — except the poor souls who have to work there, either for the convention or for the exhibitors. (I know a few of them, and if they’re reading this I am dead certain they’ve either crossed me off their Christmas card list or are scouring the dark web for assassins to take me out.) Unfortunately for them, I highly suspect San Diego Comic-Con will continue expanding no matter what, sooner or later. It won’t be too long before “preview night” stops being an unofficial con day and becomes official. Eventually, someone will have the bright idea to have a Tuesday preview night, for the exact same reasons the Wednesday preview night was created the first place — and then they’ll rediscover fans will pay for early access. So on and so on.

It’s as inevitable a truth as the San Diego Convention Center’s 125,000-person maximum occupancy, so why wait? With the proper planning, tens of thousands of new people could finally enjoy the one-of-a-kind experience of attending San Diego Comic-Con. And if they actually have the ability to do what they want there, they’ll probably have fun, too.<|endoftext|>

# Is Your Phone Killing You? The Answer’s Unclear

## Experts respond with skepticism to a recent New York Times story

![Photo by [Warren Wong](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Warren Wong](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Last week, the *New York Times* published a provocative Well piece about smartphones and death that laid out some fascinating points, but it probably belonged in the Opinion section. The article, packaged with the headline “[Putting Down Your Phone May Help You Live Longer](&lt;|url|&gt;),” draws on recent research to suggest that smartphone use causes a spike in the stress hormone cortisol, perhaps leading to a chronic problem that ultimately shortens one’s life span.

Sure, this could be true. Chronic stress is associated with serious health problems, “including depression, obesity, metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, fertility issues, high blood pressure, heart attack, dementia and stroke,” as the article notes. But right now, we simply don’t have the research to justify freaking people out about their smartphones. We’re missing crucial information that makes a connection between phone use and chronic stress clear.
> # “The author makes a very strong claim, a rather headline-grabbing claim, that as a scientist I immediately rolled my eyes at.”

I talked to several scientists for this story, most of whom study how people are affected by internet use. All of them, to varying degrees, expressed questions and in some cases concerns about the *Times *piece.

“I don’t think anyone can prove that phone use causes stress,” says Tamara Afifi, a professor of interpersonal health communication at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and an author of one of the studies quoted in the *Times* piece. “There is indeed a positive correlation. But I think we need more research to prove causation, at least for chronic stress.”

“The author makes a very strong claim, a rather headline-grabbing claim, that as a scientist I immediately rolled my eyes at,” says Tracy Dennis-Tiwary, a psychology professor and a co-director of the Stress, Anxiety, and Resilience Research Center at Hunter College who has [written](&lt;|url|&gt;) about this topic before. “A lot of this work can be taken out of context, because a lot of it uses very extreme examples of either chronic stress exposure or extreme phone addiction.”

[One such study](&lt;|url|&gt;), upon which the *New York Times* piece relies, looked at the impact of smartphone use and withdrawals. It found that compared with healthy controls, subjects with “excessive smartphone use” have less ability to regulate their impulses and control their emotions and experienced higher secretions of the stress hormone cortisol when “withdrawing” from internet use, including from their smartphones. And the study focuses on teens who are already described as using their smartphones in an unhealthy and excessive manner. Smartphone addiction varies worldwide but [is estimated](&lt;|url|&gt;) to top out at 38%, depending on the definition used; while that’s not an insignificant number, it’s not a majority, either, meaning that the study’s results don’t necessarily apply to everyone.

Dennis-Tiwary says she found the study important but that the results are correlative, not causal. “It could be that these are kids who are going around not being able to regulate their drives and their impulses as well, and they’re the types who get sucked into cellphone use and social media use,” she says. She also notes that the withdrawal symptoms make sense, because anyone who’s experiencing withdrawals is experiencing stress as well.

“It seems fairly sensationalistic,” says Jon Elhai, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Toledo who has studied [internet addiction](&lt;|url|&gt;). Like Dennis-Tiwary, he pointed out that it’s difficult to make a causal inference from the research we have so far. “Most of the research suggests that it’s the people who start off with mental health problems, those who are the ones who, as a consequence of having mental health problems, the effect is that they end up using their phones more.”

Elhai adds that while it is certainly possible that phone use could cause stress—and there’s some evidence to suggest that it does—“it’s a cycle, and people who are more stressed out to begin with, they, as a result of their stress, tend to alleviate their stress by using their phones, and then that causes more stress.”

This tracks, at least anecdotally. I find myself reaching for my phone and staring at Instagram, eyes glazed, when I’m stressed out over a story or otherwise attempting to escape my anxiety. Sometimes I’ll do this at night as I’m lying in bed, which the *Times* story says could be bad for our health. One recent study, however, suggests that may not be the case — at least not for teens.
> # “I don’t think anyone can prove that phone use causes stress.”

[The study](&lt;|url|&gt;), which analyzed the phone use and corresponding well-being of 17,247 teenagers from the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, found little obvious evidence that phone use, including before bed, results in lower well-being. The study, like many others, is correlational and cross-sectional, which means that it analyzes data [at a particular moment](&lt;|url|&gt;), rather than looking at how the data changes over a long period of time. What the study does offer is a large dataset indicating that the prevailing wisdom — that our phones are having a huge negative impact on our health — might not be as decided as some critics would have us believe.

Still, for us to have a clearer understanding of how detrimental our phones are to our health, let alone whether or not they’re leading us to our deaths, we need studies that look at how our phones are influencing our health over the course of years. And for the most part, those don’t exist yet.

“With cross-sectional studies, what we do is look for associations, so correlations between variables,” says Daria Kuss, a senior psychology lecturer at Nottingham Trent University whose research focuses on [internet and gaming addiction](&lt;|url|&gt;). “With longitudinal research — research that is conducted over a longer period of time — we can find out whether the smartphone use is the actual causal factor.”

Kuss went on to note that the data we have now is compelling but not definitive. “I think it is fair to say that [smartphone use] might lead to increased mortality rates, but we do need more research, particularly this longitudinal that gives us an indication of cause and effect. Because the smartphones, the use of our smartphones, may be just one of the factors that contribute to mortality rates.”

This isn’t to say the *Times* article is a wash. It cites [one study](&lt;|url|&gt;) that, while small, offers compelling biological evidence that certain aspects of smartphone use are associated with heightened cortisol levels in teens. Dennis-Tiwary notes that the study is suggestive but nevertheless correlational. “It does suggest that some people with elevated stress markers and inflammatory markers, which have to do with stress, might be more sensitive to the negative impact of technology use,” she says.

“This is a really fascinating and important work, especially today, when families are wired most of their waking hours,” says Afifi, one of the study authors, but she agrees with Dennis-Tiwary that “at this point in the research, I would say that it is correlational.”

More research, like the [huge ABCD study](&lt;|url|&gt;) on brain development, is on the way that will give us a better idea of the relationship between stress, phone use, and maybe even mortality. In the meantime, it’s somewhat premature to say that stress caused by our phones is leading to a dip in our life expectancy. Could that be the case? It certainly could. But until the data is clearer, perhaps it’s wise to hold off on the alarmist headlines. We have enough to be terrified of as it is.<|endoftext|>

# Unintended Consequences in Silicon Valley

## The tech industry has more to learn about its unforeseen effects on our daily lives

![Interstate 280 in Sunnyvale, CA. Credit: Jonathan Clark/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Interstate 280 in Sunnyvale, CA. Credit: Jonathan Clark/Getty Images*

Spring break is a stretch that affords some of us in Silicon Valley a moment to pause and reflect. Driving around during my downtime, I was caught off guard as an older, gray Chevy sped by with a digital billboard attached to its roof. The word “byte” in bright red jumped out at me, but it quickly flipped to another ad — after eight seconds, it turns out — this one with smaller, harder-to-read type.

I sped up to see what the sign said. I already was going fast, but the Chevy was faster. I caught up briefly but still couldn’t catch the words. Then suddenly, I swerved. Righting my car, I slowed down and watched the Chevy fly into the distance. I paused to reflect.

Arguably, I have one of the most beautiful commutes in the U.S. Two highways, the 101 and 280, connect San Francisco to Silicon Valley. Highway 101 is a mess — your typical bumper-to-bumper logjam. But 280, especially if you time it right, is a driver’s dream.

If you glance to the west toward the Santa Cruz Mountains, a wall of green drops down to Crystal Springs Reservoir, the Bay Area’s drinking water. The scene can include statuesque egrets, deer, and grazing cows. Sunsets are spectacular. Topping it off, of course, is the majestic fog that rolls in over the coastal range. I love that fog. When my kids were tweens, I’d wax poetic, telling them and their pals that one day when they were older, they’d drive this route, point out the romance of the fog, and get someone to fall in love. “Ew!” they’d say back then, but eventually, it happened.

Unlike many in Silicon Valley, I don’t need a meditation app. I can “change channels” between home and work. My drive to Stanford University fills me with anticipation in the morning and lets me chill on the way home.

But the billboard on the Chevy briefly changed that. It felt invasive, disruptive, annoying, jarring. It made me curious — and briefly furious in the same way those electronic billboards on ad-bearing barges in the Hudson and East rivers outrage some New Yorkers. What’s more, given the small type and speed of the cars, it seemed dangerous.

A couple of years ago, however, I thought the “billboard on a vehicle” idea was brilliant; in some locations, it still might be. You see, the other reason the billboard caught my eye was because a co-founder of the company that created it, Kaan Gunay, was one of our Stanford business students.

When Gunay explained his idea in a workshop a while back, I was gung ho. Digital smart screens connected to relevant, geo-located ads? Super! In my mind’s eye, I envisioned a digital topper on a yellow taxi in New York, a place already laden with digital marketing. I encouraged him to apply for an innovation grant funded by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation, which I work for. He didn’t get the grant, but never mind; the company, Firefly, has since raised over $20 million in venture funding.

With all this on my mind, I rang him up. Indeed, the Chevy was one of his fleet. “Yes, we are running an ad campaign for that company,” Gunay said.

Firefly, which recently emerged from stealth mode, is at full throttle with 75 employees. The team is testing ad campaigns in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Its digital screens don’t just flack any advertisement but are connected to sensors that can track and geo-tag potholes and measure pollution. Uber and Lyft drivers enjoy a share of revenue created by the ads and operate the fleet. Ads can be “geo-fenced” so temptations for booze don’t appear as the vehicles drive by high schools. And a percentage of the ad inventory is dedicated to messages from nonprofits and public service organizations.

Still, I wondered about the unintended consequences of this new technology. Many in Silicon Valley are asking that question these days and pondering the unforeseen impact of the tech creations here. Stanford is developing new classes that explore this uncharted terrain. Just last month, the university launched an interdisciplinary Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence initiative (HAI) with a goal of anticipating both the positive and negative effects of A.I., the next tech wave expected to upend our lives.

As I described my reaction to the billboard, Gunay laughed. “I am assuming yours’ was abnormal behavior,” he said. “You were curious because you knew me.” Fair enough. On a more serious note, he added, “The last thing we want to do is distract drivers. Safety is our foremost concern.” Unlike wraparound advertising that’s otherwise making its way onto vehicles, no content appears on the front or back of cars bearing the Firefly ads. The ads face sideways and are aimed mainly at pedestrians and drivers stuck in traffic.

“What’s more,” Gunay said, “the company features useful content to neighborhoods” — because of the geo-targeting nature of its Fireflys — including “a diversity of smart city data along with great brands” that will drive the overall growth of the business. Once driverless cars become a reality, Firefly expects ad revenue will buoy the sector to make cities more livable and equitable.

Still, when it comes to unintended consequences, he said, “I’m sure there’s a good way to mitigate it… Maybe we don’t show moving content when the car goes over [a] certain speed?”

Classes have resumed at Stanford. I invited Gunay, who graduated with an MBA in 2018, to come back to campus to participate in an upcoming class designed to ponder the unintended consequences of technology. Give the students a challenge they can explore, I suggested. For example: How might we continue to experience life in the fast lane while ensuring Firefly’s digital screens serve as an asset to smarter city life and — like real fireflies — add to our sense of serenity?

Gunay’s response? He’s in.<|endoftext|>

# In Defense of Selfies

## Snapchat’s resident sociologist talks selfies, screen time, and our obsession with authenticity

![Photo: Steve Gale/Unsplash](<|image|>)*Photo: Steve Gale/Unsplash*

Dissecting the exploits of social media photographers has become a new national pastime. Just this week, *Vox *reported on influencers [chartering a tour to a beautiful Arizona canyon](&lt;|url|&gt;) on an Instagrammable rite of passage, and the *New York Times* chronicled models [flocking to a Siberian chemical waste dump](&lt;|url|&gt;) for the perfect lakefront shot.

This comes just a few weeks after Twitter lit up with a [misleading](&lt;|url|&gt;), now-deleted tweet shaming people who snapped selfies at the Chernobyl disaster site. That post triggered a viral pile-on from celebrities and journalists and rabid fans of then-one-month-old HBO miniseries *Chernobyl*. And years before that, the public dogpiled on a group of girls who posed for selfies [at a baseball game](&lt;|url|&gt;). Somewhat predictably, outlets regularly publish takedowns every time a new made-for-selfie locale pops up. (Of this [I am also guilty](&lt;|url|&gt;).) All the hissing and fussing signals a common dynamic: If you’ve got a selfie stick, beware — the internet’s a got a pitchfork.
> # *Look at these morons,* I remember thinking*.*

The hostility with which readers treat these selfie-takers is vicious, but also relatable. During a recent hike, I came across a glossy selfie shoot, plum in the middle of a remote wilderness. *Look at these morons,* I remember thinking*.*

My self-righteousness is echoed in op-eds warning us about our social media use and an increasingly inward gaze. Selfie culture represents a generation abandoning real life, [pundits say](&lt;|url|&gt;), and selfies are [commonly associated](&lt;|url|&gt;) with inauthenticity and narcissism. [Pop](&lt;|url|&gt;) [sociology](&lt;|url|&gt;) books shoot up Amazon’s rankings by promising to point us back home, offline, “in the moment.” It is there, the story goes — away from the shared photos and performative updates — where we finally return to our true selves.

“What a ridiculous state of affairs this is,” writes Nathan Jurgenson in his recent book [*The Social Photo: On Photography and Social Media](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. “The idea that the selfie has corrupted our authenticity,” Jurgenson argues, “is part of a larger misunderstanding that takes anything digital to be distinct from real life.”

As a sociologist at Snapchat and Editor in Chief of [*Real Life](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a magazine about living with technology, Jurgenson aims to disabuse us of the notion that “real life” and “online” are discrete realms, of which the former is inherently more authentic. He spoke with me about that false distinction and the general hysteria around selfies and smartphones. Our conversation, conducted over email, has been condensed for length and clarity.

### **OneZero: Recently we saw people on social media get dragged for taking selfies at Chernobyl. What is behind the impulse to shame people who take a lot of selfies, or who take selfies at places where we think it inappropriate?**

Nathan Jurgenson: One of the things that dominate popular discussions about photography today is the impulse to shame. To start with the obvious: Camera phones are fairly recent and incredibly ubiquitous additions to our social landscape. They rearrange our environments and behaviors, and our norms and etiquette are trying to catch up. People can be annoying or rude or harmful with anything, so, yes, rude people are rude with their phones. But we should also ask, what behaviors are the social platforms incentivizing? So much social media is designed to operate like a game to maximize scores.

The Chernobyl-selfie thing seems overhyped, but we can think of other examples of behavior people get upset about: treating yourself as a “brand,” treating other people and the world as mere fodder for growing that brand, forcing the rest of us to see such obvious marketing within spaces that could otherwise be used differently (talking to friends and family, for example). Metricized platforms encourage seeing your self, your experiences, and your world not in and of themselves but to be put to work, to be made productive. But I would hesitate to lump taking selfies in with these antisocial behaviors.
> # “I think the breathless cries of ‘narcissism’ around selfies says more about those commentators than the selfie-takers.”

Perhaps we like to think that identity just happens, that our selves are “authentic,” and so seeing someone pose and perform for the screen makes us a bit insecure about our own social performances. In any case, I think the breathless cries of “narcissism” around selfies says more about those commentators than the selfie-takers.

### **Do social photos take us “out of the moment” and reduce places to commodities?**

It depends on the context, the device, the platform, the specific use, and intention. If I am using a platform that is centered on metrics and numbers and I travel just to get photos that help me “win,” then the camera and platform are being used against the goal of experience for its own sake. But I do not think that documentation is inherently at odds with experience. If I am exploring a new city and see something that reminds me of a friend, and I snap it to them and we talk about it, that might be a removal from my moment in a geographic sense, but a deeper engagement of that moment in a social sense.

One of the ways social photos are different from traditional photos is the degree to which they are not just about documenting and recording an experience, but about sharing an experience. This can bring more people into a moment, which isn’t a degradation.

### **Did the technology and ubiquity of social media create the impulse to constantly share? Or did our impulse to share precede it, precipitating the technology to come about?**

The simplest answer is that the impulse to share is deeply related to the audience you’re given. Social media greatly changed the potential audience for just about anything. I think that’s the biggest variable for why people take so many photos today.

I also think that the rise of ephemerality and small-group sharing has changed why and how much we share. As I argue in my book, photography has moved from documentation to something that more closely resembles talking.

For example, there’s a cup of coffee next to me right now. It would make for a boring photo by traditional photographic standards. But it would make for a perfectly acceptable social photo, and there are many ways I would snap it: to indicate that I’m at a specific cafe right now in case others want to join, to let someone know that I am still working and writing, or to simply be a canvas on which to play with various filters or augmented reality objects.

The cup of coffee isn’t just something I am documenting and sharing, but something I can speak with. This understanding of the world as something to speak with greatly changes what, when, and why people might “share.”

### **What do you make of the trending idea that says disconnecting or dieting from screens and social media is beneficial to our health?**

I’m skeptical of treating all screens the same, the content on them the same, or simply using “the screen” as the analytical object to create diets or morality around. These questions should revolve around what is happening on the screen, where the quality matters as much or more than the mere quantity.

But I get it. If I need to write or edit something longer than these answers here, I usually get away from any Wi-Fi. I love camping, and hiking, and isolated cabins, and road trips away from screens as much as anyone, but I also love having a million tabs and chats open, bouncing between lots of screens and information at the same time. I’m not always looking to be “mindful” and self-obsessive about how much to look and not look at a phone, because that, ironically, can make the phone even more present in its regimented absence.

I’m not along for this “digital health” trend, not because their worries about tech are wrong (they are very well-placed), but because I don’t think we should look at what we do with screens like how a doctor observes a body.

But what do we do with [screens]? They are how we present our identities, talk with family and friends, are part of romantic relationships, or how we learn and talk about the news. I don’t think there is an objectively healthy or correct way to do any of this. And I don’t trust anyone, no matter how much “big data” they have, to be the neutral doctor-like arbiters to diagnose ways of talking and knowing and being as “sick,” and to prescribe some sort of change to make us “normal” again. I think this movement is often well-intentioned but has begun in an unhelpful, perhaps even dystopian and scary, way.

### **From [op-eds](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [surveys](&lt;|url|&gt;), it has been said that if you’re looking at a screen, you’re missing out on “real life.” But you propose that this way of thinking is misguided. Why?**

I coined the phrase “digital dualism” to describe the idea that there’s a “real life” separate from a “virtual world,” one being material while the other is digital. When I first started studying the internet, this is the assumption I saw everyone making.

But everything that happens on the screen is composed of real people, with real bodies, politics, insecurities, and vulnerabilities. People also sell the fiction that if you just turn off the phone, “authentic” reality is waiting for you, but that life is still mediated by non-digital forms of information and technology. Even if you log off, the ways the internet has shaped you, others, and the world still lingers. There is nothing that is purely natural and untouched. I think that “real life” is what happens both on and off the screen.<|endoftext|>

# How Health Apps Let Women Down

## Women have many reasons for tracking their health, but the apps that they turn to are often disappointing

![Credit: mihailomilovanovic/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: mihailomilovanovic/Getty Images*

Banana icons with condoms. A heavy focus on moods. Fetuses the size of grapes. Women have long had to deal with sexist features in health apps. A running [joke](&lt;|url|&gt;) for a while was that it’s not hard to spot a fertility-tracking app designed by a man. While these apps serve a simple function in theory—to track things—the story of how they came to be biased toward men’s interests is yet another that makes the underrepresentation of women in tech so apparent.

With pink floral backdrops and weight-tracking features in apps that congratulate people for losing weight, developers have made it clear what they think about women. A full year after Apple Health was launched, the company realized it had left out a [key feature](&lt;|url|&gt;): a period tracker. Sexist health apps like Glow and Eve have not only failed to accommodate women in the various stages of our lives, but they have also caricatured women’s bodies and reinforced negative concepts about menstruation and pregnancy.

Women were tracking their cycles long before we could ever monitor and record our health with personal devices. As the researcher Whitney Boesel has [told](&lt;|url|&gt;) the writer Rose Eveleth in 2014, “So many regular facets of being a woman in a Western culture are highly likely to make one track.” Whether it’s calories or menstruation, they’ve kept track using paper, spreadsheets, online calendars, and now apps. And they keep track for a variety of reasons: to monitor any irregularities in their cycle, to know when to pack sanitary supplies, to plan important events, to help them conceive, and more.

But when menstrual- and fertility-tracking apps first hit the app stores, they were all lumped together with a narrow focus on pregnancy. The app Glow, launched in 2013, framed all of its users’ goals in terms of pregnancy, making users decide between whether they wanted to avoid pregnancy, attempt to conceive, or use fertility treatments.

When half of users reported they were using the app to [avoid getting pregnant](&lt;|url|&gt;), the male founders, including PayPal entrepreneur Max Levchin, had to consider the idea that some people want to track their cycles simply to know how “normal” their period is. With this information, they put their $17 million in new funding toward reforming Glow to be an ovulation calculator and [launched a separate app](&lt;|url|&gt;), Eve by Glow, for period tracking and sexual health.


While these separate apps make it easier to track on their own terms, Eve is still problematic for many users. In-app redeemable gems offer tips to [inform](&lt;|url|&gt;) users about their bodies, telling them to “get to know your body for real” and answering where “the seemingly mythical” G-spot is. Eve makes assumptions about its users, calling them all “girls” regardless of their age and uses slang like “hookups.” If users want to keep track of their sexual activity, they are given the options to choose the icons of a banana with a condom, a banana without a condom, or no banana. This feature frames sex only in terms of a penis and excludes anyone whose partner doesn’t have one. And taking a look at the period flow tracker, the heaviest option appears with the label “crime scene,” making an attempt at a humorous description, but it reinforces a negative association of violence with menstruation.
> # Pregnancy apps have gamified getting pregnant.

Fertility apps like Glow help people work through fertility issues. Once your status changes to “pregnant” though, there’s a finality to this. Some Glow users in the community forum have [reported](&lt;|url|&gt;) all their previous data being deleted by default as soon as they change their status to “pregnant,” making it inconvenient when they still found that previous information useful. Many pregnancy apps have also not been gracious to users who might experience problems bringing their pregnancy to term. Apps [sell personal data](&lt;|url|&gt;) to baby brands—regardless of how successful pregnancies are—that can then [target ads](&lt;|url|&gt;) toward people who have just experienced tremendous loss. One woman, Kim McAuliffe, had a miscarriage and received emails for weeks advertising formula for, as she put it [in a *Medium* post](&lt;|url|&gt;), “a baby you’ll never have.”

Pregnancy apps have gamified getting pregnant. Once you’re pregnant, the goal is achieved with little nuance. These apps operate on the assumption that all users want to get pregnant, can become pregnant, and have a partner. On the other hand, fitness-tracking apps whose primary focus is not on pregnancy, completely leave out the possibility that their users can be pregnant. Just as there was no period-tracking feature in Apple Health, there is no “pregnancy mode” to take into account changes in activity, weight, and other factors. People have been asking Fitbit for a [pregnancy mode](&lt;|url|&gt;) for years with no luck.

Many women have had to abandon using an app that fails to take into account all aspects of their health. But if they try to push past the apps’ limitations so they can still track other factors, apps can start to encourage unhealthy behavior. Swapna Krishna remembers her Apple Watch badgering her during her third trimester to “close her rings,” and she couldn’t adjust the settings. “I couldn’t tell the app, ‘Hey, this is actually what is healthy for me right now,’” she [wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) in *Engadget*, adding:
> …it’d become a constant source of anxiety, reminding me that I wanted to be more active than I was physically able to be. Rather than using it to track my activity during my third trimester, I turned off notifications altogether and removed the Activity Rings from my Apple Watch face.

Developers don’t head into the office planning to translate a sexist assumption into a health app. They also don’t base their design parameters on the premises of excluding people with conditions like pregnancy, much less injury or illness. Even health apps for the general public have [gendered design](&lt;|url|&gt;). These design blunders happen when designers and technologists don’t take time to understand people’s needs.

It’s no easy job designing for personal context, but “businesses ignore it at their peril,” [argue](&lt;|url|&gt;) Gina Neff, a sociology professor at Oxford University, and Dawn Nafus, a research scientist at Intel in their book *Self-Tracking*. Some businesses “treat other factors within the individual context of use as ‘noise,’ too hard to account for in the design, or defend as a good way to spend resources. That ‘noise’ of personal context, though, makes or breaks technology adoption,” Neff and Nafus argue.

Designers are still struggling to understand how women’s lives affect their interactions with health apps. We have seen how sexist features or, in some cases, the blunt omission of features to accommodate everyone have been harmful to women users, even encouraging unhealthy behavior by failing to account for conditions like pregnancy. While they have gotten better over the years with newer options like [Clue](&lt;|url|&gt;)’s science-based approach, there are still many areas for health apps to be improved in order to help women in the various stages of our lives.<|endoftext|>

# The Death of Boredom

## The war for your attention has given us an era of unparalleled content choices

![Photo by [NASA](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [NASA](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

When was the last time you heard somebody say they were bored?

The last recollection I have of someone telling me they were bored was via an MSN message. (MSN was like iMessage of the 2000s, for those born in the 2000s.) That might sound peculiar in the context of 2019, particularly because it’s difficult to imagine a time when you could have access to the internet while simultaneously being bored. Remember the days of dial-up internet? Oh, how things have changed.

Television still essentially works the same as it did 20 years ago, except there has been an explosion in the quantity and quality of content. The TV [season](&lt;|url|&gt;) is no longer September to May, with the doldrums of summer reruns in between. There is just one 12-month season, with higher peaks and fewer valleys. Hollywood celebrities famous for being in films, such as Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman, are flocking to the small screen in “[prestige](&lt;|url|&gt;)” shows. There’s a reason this era we’re in is often referred to as the era of “peak TV.”
> # The Information Age stretches forward with no visible end in sight.

There’s also the content behemoth that is Netflix. There is quite literally something new being released on Netflix every Friday, whether it be an original series, an original movie, an original documentary, or an old show the company has licensed. When it comes to content distribution, Netflix has very little chill.

If you like spending your time soaking in news about the world, you might have noticed an explosion of options in that category as well. Traditional glossy magazines may not be doing as well, and the publishing industry as a whole is still not a money-printing business, but there has never been more to read. Part of this most recent boom can be attributed to an increased necessity for journalism (see: Donald Trump, #MeToo), but much of it is due to technological development. The information age stretches forward with no visible end in sight.

This brief list doesn’t even include films, burgeoning markets like the [$43 billion video game industry](&lt;|url|&gt;), or the nascent [podcasting](&lt;|url|&gt;) industry. In practically every industry where the main product is content, there has been an explosion not necessarily in quality, but absolutely in quantity. For consumers, this raises what is perhaps the defining question of our time: “How do I identify, distinguish, and choose between the ever-expanding sea of options?”

This was not a problem even 10 years ago. Now it has become truly difficult to be bored. And even if you somehow get to a point where you can’t find a show to binge or a movie on Netflix to play in the background, there’s still a smartphone in your pocket that gives you access to Instagram, YouTube, Spotify, *Fortnite*, and more — including this [website](&lt;|url|&gt;).

That abundance of options also gives us insight into another reality of our current time. While TV networks used to compete with other TV networks, and movie studios competed with other movie studios, one could argue that there is now only one single, large-scale competition for eyeballs. Netflix, Facebook, NBC, and the *New York Times* are not similar companies, but in an age where we’re not lacking in things to do, these companies are all after the same thing: your attention.
> # In practically every industry where the main product is content, there has been an explosion not necessarily in quality, but absolutely in quantity.

This war for your attention also explains the deluge of content. Those aforementioned companies don’t just want your attention—they also want to retain it for an extended and consistent amount of time. HBO doesn’t just want you to stop by for *Game of Thrones* and then leave. It wants a long-term relationship with you. It wants to keep you enthralled, which is why it releases more content than you could possibly keep up with. This is why HBO is [moving](&lt;|url|&gt;) into Monday nights. It’s why the *New York Times* has an ever-growing [Cooking](&lt;|url|&gt;) section. Heck, it’s why Netflix has [podcasts](&lt;|url|&gt;) about Netflix and views *Fortnite* as a [bigger competitor than HBO](&lt;|url|&gt;).

The war for your attention is a zero-sum game. If Netflix retains four hours of your day, that’s four hours HBO can’t get. The way for companies to remain competitive is to ensure a never-ending stream of content, which is how we reached the era of content overload. This is how boredom, as a state of existence, died. Gone are the days when you had to resort to twiddling your thumbs, wiggling your toes, or, worse yet, talking to somebody in person. For the kids that may be reading — oh, who am I kidding? There are no kids reading this. They have better things to do.<|endoftext|>

# Apple’s New Strategy Erodes ‘Screen Time’

## With a new focus on services, Apple abandons the pretense that you should look away

![](<|image|>)

Last September, Apple proudly rolled out a [Screen Time](&lt;|url|&gt;) feature that was designed to help people manage how much they use their devices, and even get away from them altogether with a related Downtime setting.

This was a canny marketing move from the maker of the most attractive and addictive screen ever invented. And it came against the backdrop of Apple’s unusually [public campaign](&lt;|url|&gt;) against Facebook in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Screen Time’s [promotional materials](&lt;|url|&gt;) prominently featured both Facebook and Instagram, as if suggesting these two apps in particular might be a waste of your time. Never mind that Facebook’s very real privacy liabilities aren’t connected to how often you use the product. Apple had an opportunity to position itself on the higher ground of the branding battlefield, and it took it.

![Apple zeros-in on Facebook-owned Instagram when introducing Screen Time’s “App Limits” feature.](<|image|>)*Apple zeros-in on Facebook-owned Instagram when introducing Screen Time’s “App Limits” feature.*

Whatever its intentions, Screen Time served as a way for Apple to separate its business from Facebook’s on the eve of a new platform war. The two companies are increasingly seen as rivals jockeying to construct multimedia services around key messaging platforms. (Tech writer Will Oremus astutely made such an argument [earlier this month](&lt;|url|&gt;).) At its core, Apple’s own iMessage is an incredibly valuable social network, one that keeps people [locked](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the blue bubble of iOS, where they’re liable to be lured in by subscription services like Apple Music. Cupertino has every reason to position Facebook’s rival messaging services as examples of low-quality screen time.
> # Time spent staring at screens may not be good for a user’s digital wellness, but it will increasingly make Apple money.

But if there was any pretense that Apple really wanted to help you move your eyeballs away from the iPhone with Screen Time or any other digital wellness feature, it was washed away on Monday, when the company unveiled a [suite of offerings](&lt;|url|&gt;) designed to lock you into its services: Apple News+, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and even the banking app attached to the titanium Apple Card all demand your attention… on screens made by Apple. Faced with [slowing](&lt;|url|&gt;) iPhone sales, Apple is emphasizing its services business. For these subscription-based services to be worth anything, people have to use them; to use them, people need to look at their screens. Time spent staring at screens may not be good for a user’s digital wellness, but it will increasingly make Apple money.

You’ll still be able to use the Screen Time feature, of course, but this pivot nonetheless reveals some softness in Apple’s PR strategy, at least. A company that solely made devices could credibly urge some responsibility with the use of those devices — and could presumably do so without harming its bottom line, as a phone manufacturer makes the same amount off that phone no matter how it is used. But the company cedes some moral high ground when its profit motive increasingly relies on hooking people on television and video games consumed and paid for through their devices. Sure, Apple has offered versions of these services for some time, but never as emphatically as it does now — and never with the kind of red-carpet rollout of Monday’s event.

That’s all fine, but it’s a reminder to look beyond the sheen of very expensive marketing if you hope to understand one of the most significant and powerful technology companies on the planet today. See also: Apple’s [Environment page](&lt;|url|&gt;), measured against its [spending on lobbying](&lt;|url|&gt;) against “right to repair” or its still-open supply chain that contributes to an epidemic of [toxic waste](&lt;|url|&gt;), as any major electronics company does.

There’s no need to moralize — this is how business works. But if you should find yourself wondering about the rhetoric surrounding Screen Time, or whatever digital wellness initiative that comes next, just follow the money. You’ll find your answer there.<|endoftext|>

# Why Apple’s Notification Bubbles Are so Stressful

## Why Apple’s Notification Bubbles Are so Stressful

### *Plus, the simple changes that could make a big difference*

![Credit: NurPhoto/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: NurPhoto/Getty Images Plus*

*In Microprocessing, columnist Angela Lashbrook aims to improve your relationship with technology every week. She’ll go deep on the little things that define your online life today.*

I hate the color red.

Not in all contexts, of course. A richly dyed red wool sweater is beautiful and even festive. It’s hard to find anything more glamorous than a garment made of red silk. A red dahlia is perhaps one of the most perfect flowers, the way the petals turn dark at the center.

Then there are things colored red for more practical reasons. A stop sign is red to ensure you see it and avoid accidents, while a red stripe on the floor indicates that you’re not to cross it. I don’t enjoy those particular red things — their crimson shades are often without depth or character, a flat hue that indicates “danger” and little else — but I’m glad they’re designed to catch my attention. A stop sign is too crucial an item to craft for beauty alone.

And then there’s the red on my phone.

I have 130 unread messages, which my phone relentlessly reminds me about in the aggressive red badge on my iMessage app. I have 15 missed calls, 99 percent of which are spam; I get to think about that robot voice berating me about my nonexistent car loan every time I see the red badge over my phone app. You don’t even want to know the number screaming at me every time I glance at my email.
> # I am assaulted by my phone every time I unlock it.

These ugly red badges are a reminder of how I’m either a failure (Call your grandparents! Answer that nice text!) or a target (as is the case with the robot spammer hawking auto loans). And because of their hue, they’re difficult to ignore. I am assaulted by my phone every time I unlock it. And I’m not alone.

“They drive me insane,” Paul Sherman, an assistant professor and the program coordinator of the user experience design master’s program at Kent State University, tells me. The red, as he put it, “causes more stress and distress.”

This horrible feeling of anxiety I feel when I open my phone is what’s known as [cognitive overload](&lt;|url|&gt;), which can be roughly defined as the way our brains react to the regular bombardment of information from all corners of our lives, from social media to news to advertisements.

There’s a simple way Apple — and any other phone makers employing red dots — could remedy the issue: Change the color of notification badges, or allow users to select their own.

The clearest outcome of these notifications is that they keep us engaged with our devices. Many neuroscientists and psychologists are [worried](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the negative effects of this technology, from the way smartphones appear to affect our ability to concentrate to the potential correlation with rising rates of mental illness and suicide in teens. There’s also a fair amount of research detailing how notifications themselves [distract users](&lt;|url|&gt;) or even cause stress, as I’ve [written about previously](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Even some Apple shareholders are concerned about the compulsive power of the iPhone. In January 2018, the investment firm Jana Partners, in collaboration with fellow shareholders at the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, released [an open letter](&lt;|url|&gt;) expressing concern over the “unintentional negative consequences” of the phone’s ubiquity among children and teens.

Apple seems to be taking stock of many of these concerns, as is evident with the company’s June 2018 introduction of [Screen Time](&lt;|url|&gt;). The feature informs users of their weekly iPhone use, broken down by app, and how it compares to the previous week. Of course, this information is delivered regularly with an automatic notification that you have to manually turn off. My own nonrandomized, non-placebo-controlled, non-peer-reviewed research on the subject (a [Twitter poll](&lt;|url|&gt;) with 79 participants) discovered that only 27 percent of respondents found Screen Time to have encouraged them to use their phone less, with 30 percent voting that Screen Time doesn’t help. Another 43 percent voted that not only does Screen Time not help—it makes them feel worse. (I excitedly await actual data about this, for what it’s worth.)

In John Herrman’s [wonderful history](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the red notification badge in the *New York Times* *Magazine*, he points out that both Apple and Google, to varying degrees, have attempted to dissuade app developers from overzealous use of badge icons. But the fact remains that the core communication apps on our phones — iMessage, email, and social media — will continue to employ the red badges that Apple has relied on for years unless we turn them all the way off.

Maxim Leyzerovich, a user experience manager for Capital One, explains via email that Apple employed the use of the red notification badge before the iPhone was even invented, in its MacOS Mail app.

“Red made sense to stand out from the pastel (and later baby blues) of the system interface,” he says. “Red — being both the most vivid color for our ocular perception and also the most rarely used one — does significantly multiply the effect of the feedback cycle that pushes us (puns!) into these [addictive] behaviors.”

![Screenshot from [Compétence Mac](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Screenshot from [Compétence Mac](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

All this stress might not be the intended result of the icon zit’s design, but it’s not exactly unexpected, either.

“Long before iPhones and notification UX design, we as a culture accepted red as a color that signifies immediacy and importance,” Michael Wagner, an information architect at design consultancy Markon Brands, tells me in an email. “Using red as a notification badge makes sense because we are already conditioned to pay attention to red signals as items that require our attention.”

Context is everything, but we’re more likely to think of a stop sign than a red dress when we see a red notification badge. A plethora of research shows how seeing the color red causes what’s known as “arousal” (no, not that kind — usually). A [1974 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that viewing the color red caused a greater [galvanic skin response](&lt;|url|&gt;), or changes in sweat gland activity usually caused by some form of stress, than blue or yellow. A [2004 study from Hong Kong](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that when webpages have background colors that lead to greater feelings of relaxation, such as blue, users feel the load time is faster than when the background is red, a color that causes more anxiety.

“It’s a bit more angry than other notifications,” Sherman says. “I absolutely feel like, in the effort to make a notification be noticeable, they contributed to increasing stress. Absolutely. I’m looking at my badges now and going, ‘Oh my god!’”

Currently, the only way to change the appearance of your iPhone’s red notification badges is to[ jailbreak it](&lt;|url|&gt;), which isn’t a good solution for most of us. C.J. Yeh, a professor of communications design at the Fashion Institute of Technology, points to the badge design on the Android Oreo operating system as potential inspiration for Apple moving forward.

In Oreo, the badges are quite a bit smaller than those on an iPhone, and rather than being a unified color across the operating system, they’re a lighter version of the app icon’s dominant color. So, for example, my Phone app badge would be small and light green, while my email icon would be small and pale blue.

“It is clear enough to get your attention, but it is not screaming at you,” Yeh tells me. “Overall, I feel this is a pretty elegant solution.”

![Image from [Mobile Industry Review](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Image from [Mobile Industry Review](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

The Android system also allows for external [launchers](&lt;|url|&gt;), which users can download to change the look of their entire operating system if they so desire. It’s unlikely that Apple, king of the [walled garden](&lt;|url|&gt;), would ever allow external developers to design entirely new looks for its OS. But it could allow a little more breathing room by opening up the option for users to choose between different badge styles. This isn’t out of the question: Over the years, Apple has loosened its grip on notification styles, most recently with iOS 11, [which allows users](&lt;|url|&gt;) to hide the content of notifications on their lock screen.

That’s a feature I personally take advantage of. I just wish Apple would extend more options to badge design as well. With the release of Screen Time, increased parental controls, and more notification options, as well as discouraging outside apps from overenthusiastic badging, Apple is clearly aware that its design is, in many ways, harmful to consumers. By using less anxiety-inducing colors (like purple or blue) or shades (like a less saturated red) for its badges, or by allowing users to choose, Apple could make its product a modicum less stressful. It won’t wipe out all my unread messages or unlistened-to voicemails, but I’ll take whatever I can get.<|endoftext|>

# How Data Hoarding Is the New Threat to Privacy and Climate Change

## Big Tech needs to get better at energy efficiency

![Photo: Sergii Iaremenko/Science Photo Library/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Sergii Iaremenko/Science Photo Library/Getty Images*

As machine learning and other data-intensive algorithms proliferate, more organizations are hoarding data in hopes of alchemizing it into something valuable. From spy agencies to network infrastructure providers, data collection is part and parcel of the digital economy. The best data can be combined with clever algorithms to do incredible things — but digital hoarding and computationally-intensive workloads have externalities too.

The electrical costs — and therefore the environmental impacts — of computation are both extraordinary and growing. Modern machine learning (ML) models are a prime example. They [require an enormous amount of energy](&lt;|url|&gt;) in order to process mountains of data. The computational costs of training ML models have been growing exponentially since 2012, with a [doubling period of 18 months, according to OpenAI](&lt;|url|&gt;). In recent months, similar studies have shown that the electrical costs of [cryptocurrency](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [video streaming](&lt;|url|&gt;) are also significant and growing.

Producing this electricity creates literal exhaust in most cases — there are precious few server farms running on 100% renewable energy — and with climate change looming large, it’s time we acknowledge the environmental impact of computation. Just like wrapping every little thing in a plastic bag is, some of our CPU usage is frivolous and wasteful.

Computer science and engineering experts have been complaining about this for years. Some point out that we [went to the moon with only 4kb of RAM](&lt;|url|&gt;). Others detail how [slow and bloated modern software is](&lt;|url|&gt;). Jonathan Blow went so far as to warn about the impending collapse of the entire software engineering discipline [due to intergenerational knowledge loss](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Most of the time this argument is positioned in terms of engineering elitism. Its supporters nostalgically harken back to a time when it really meant something* *to be a software engineer. They scold beginners for not knowing better while flaunting their beautiful hair, tinged with the silvery gray of experience. Despite the condescension, they’re not completely wrong.

As computers got faster and faster, computer programs actually got slower. End-users didn’t notice because the slower programs still ran fast on the faster computers. As a result, many developers rarely have to focus on using memory or CPU cycles efficiently. Our incredible CPUs can run even relatively inefficient code fast enough for most users. Tools and programming languages that prioritize the developer’s time over CPU and memory efficiency have become the norm. AWS and other cloud services epitomize this tradeoff — why spend weeks of development time optimizing the code when Amazon can just automatically turn on a few more servers when we need them.
> # “More efficient is better,” just doesn’t motivate me the same way as, “we should do our part to conserve electricity, since climate change is an existential threat to humanity.”

There is nothing wrong with professionals trying to hold an industry to high standards. But I do wish the pro-efficiency crowd would use a more persuasive tactic than tautological scolding. Maybe it’s just me, but “more efficient is better,” just doesn’t motivate me the same way as, “we should do our part to conserve electricity since climate change is an existential threat to humanity.” It’s not just about the inefficient electrical use either. The data we generate is itself a kind of digital pollutant — a new kind of trash for the information age.

Some data is a waste product in the same way that junk mail is a waste product. How many computational resources are dedicated to the zillions of spam emails sent every day? How much bandwidth is dedicated to ads sitting unclicked in your sidebar? Increasingly, records of nearly every digital transaction — no matter how trivial — are transmitted to a data center and stored. It may seem hyperbolic to harp on a few wasted bits, but this is a serious problem.

Consider this: Loading Twitter requires about 6mb of data.

![](<|image|>)

Twitter claimed they had about [126 million daily active users](&lt;|url|&gt;) in February. If every user loads the homepage just once per day, that represents 756 terabytes of information transmitted every day. Just for Twitter. Add Amazon, Facebook, Google, and all the rest, and we’re talking enormous amounts of data occupying wires, passing through the air, and taking CPU time. What fraction of that data actually delivers real value to the end-user? What fraction of it glides through our screens with complete irrelevance?

All this data requires infrastructure. We need more and faster cables, routers, computers, and phones. We need to upgrade from 4g to 5g. We need to build data centers and server farms. This digital waste results in an ever-increasing amount of always-on physical infrastructure. The amount of [land used by server farms is staggering](&lt;|url|&gt;). These electronics are hard to recycle and get worn out more quickly under higher load. The constant process of upgrading and replacing these electronics has [created serious environmental and health risks](&lt;|url|&gt;), especially due to the increasing number of discarded electronic components. If we used this infrastructure with greater care — transmitting and storing data as efficiently as possible — we could significantly reduce our infrastructural and electrical needs.

Some of this data is parasitic in nature — it benefits some at the cost of others. [Advertisers track us](&lt;|url|&gt;) as we browse the internet. [Browser extensions](&lt;|url|&gt;) harvest our web history. [Weather apps](&lt;|url|&gt;) track our location. [The list goes on](&lt;|url|&gt;). These different aspects of our personal histories are sold to data brokers, who repackage and resell the combined data to third, fourth, and fifth parties. To most people, this data is waste that should just be discarded. Most people will never perform a thorough audit of their internet history, but for advertisers and political strategists, it can be a goldmine. Worse, governments and corporations will continue to fall victim to hackers. These data sources will inevitably fall into the hands of malicious actors.

There is also a [vast body of evidence](&lt;|url|&gt;) demonstrating that the existence of large data sets — each individually innocuous — can amount to something more dangerous. By correlating information from several different sources, attackers can cobble together a clear profile and use that information to connect more sensitive pieces of data. So many “anonymized” datasets have been compromised using these tactics that some in the field are declaring “[anonymization is dead](&lt;|url|&gt;).” These researchers are calling for a new paradigm that prioritizes transparency regarding data collection over attempts to anonymize the data.

And some data — like radioactive waste, used needles, or bloody tissue — is dangerous to even have laying around. Social security numbers, credit card numbers, driver’s license information, or other highly sensitive information should only be stored if it is absolutely necessary to do so, and with special precautions to keep it out of reach of malicious actors.

It is worth saying that there are,* *of course, a large number of engineers focused keenly on performance optimization and privacy preservation. And much more can still be done. One of the most beautiful aspects of software in the internet age is that we can deploy improvements instantly all around the world. Updates start having an impact immediately, and cuts to processing and data requirements accrue over time.
> # Just like the fossil-fuel industry, many programming firms have enriched themselves with data while ignoring the externalities of their product.

Returning to our crude estimate from above: If just Twitter cut its page weight by half it would save 378 terabytes of data transmission per day. If every company made an effort to store only absolutely necessary data, and secure that data from malicious actors, we would all be safer from privacy violations. Just like the fossil-fuel industry, many programming firms have enriched themselves with data while ignoring the externalities of their product.

Whether or not companies will* *start taking those precautions is another question entirely. Which reminds me: don’t forget to claim your [$125 Equifax payout](&lt;|url|&gt;).<|endoftext|>

# Startups Took Over Earth, and Now They’re Headed to Space — With Creepy Pepsi Ads in Tow

## CubeSats are already defining the sky over your head

![Illustration by [Jon Han](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration by [Jon Han](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Last November, Reuters released a [bombshell report](&lt;|url|&gt;) detailing the location of 39 Muslim “reeducation” camps in China’s Xinjiang province. Now widely understood as detention centers perpetuating serious [human rights abuses](&lt;|url|&gt;), these camps had expanded in secret for years. But for all its restrictions, Beijing couldn’t hide them from a set of eyes hovering in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO).

Reuters, in partnership with Earthrise Media, a company that licenses satellite imagery to media, used photos from a constellation of some 120 [CubeSats](&lt;|url|&gt;) to document the otherwise impenetrable region. These satellites aren’t the big ones you might be familiar with from high school science class: CubeSats are barely bigger than a standard Rubik’s Cube, and are relatively cheap to construct at around $50,000. (Full satellite launches can cost tens of millions of dollars.)

CubeSats allow people to track natural disasters, document deforestation, and monitor crop yields. As *Futurism *recently* [*reported](&lt;|url|&gt;), they might even enable a new kind of orbital advertising — just look at the night sky for a sponsored message from Pepsi. (For its part, the soft drink maker [says it only tested](&lt;|url|&gt;) the technology and has no current plans to roll it out for marketing.)

In any event, these tiny satellites are on the brink of an innovation explosion the world might not be ready for.

[More than 1,000 CubeSats](&lt;|url|&gt;) have been launched so far. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) expects that in the next few years, [as the space industry is estimated to grow eightfold](&lt;|url|&gt;), that number will climb in an unprecedented way, with CubeSats collecting terabytes of data on the world below.

The CubeSat was born in 1999 as part of a partnership between professors Jordi Puig-Suari and Bob Twiggs, of California Polytechnic State University and Stanford University, respectively. They wanted a way to help their students get hands-on experience with satellite technology.

At the time, the process of building any satellite generally took several years and millions of dollars — far too much time and money to waste on students.

“If you worked on satellites, you maybe got to work on one or two your whole career,” says Andy Erickson, director of global security at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. “It used to be a very slow process and, as a student, you never got to work on real hardware.”

CubeSats quickly became an invaluable teaching tool for young scientists and a boon to researchers who wanted to test out new technologies, bolstering university space programs around the world.

Today, the same technological advancements that have allowed smartphones and computers to become smaller and more efficient are poised to allow exponential jumps in CubeSat technologies, and an increasing push into space travel by private companies is opening a new world of commercial interest in the mini-satellites.

One of the leaders in the world of commercial CubeSats is Planet Labs, founded in Silicon Valley, startup style, out of a garage in Cupertino, California. Planet has launched more than 350 CubeSats into LEO since 2010.

“Every three to six months, we have a new generation of the satellites,” says Michael Safyan, vice president of launch at Planet Labs. “Sometimes it’s an improvement on capabilities, like a new telescope, or a reduction in the time it takes to manufacture.” At this point, Safyan estimates that Planet can produce dozens of satellites per week.

![*A “1U” CubeSat without an outer layer of protection*](<|image|>)**A “1U” CubeSat without an outer layer of protection**

Alone, a single CubeSat isn’t terribly powerful. The imaging power of CubeSats is nowhere near the granularity of a billion-dollar satellite like those used by the military. And because they’re so small, there’s no way to build in redundancy, meaning that if one component breaks, the whole CubeSat quickly becomes useless. But what CubeSats lack in size, they make up for in numbers, cheapness, and ease of deployment.

“A constellation of CubeSats gives you some congregant capability that one big system doesn’t give us,” says Air Force Captain Michael Nayak, a scientist with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory whose work focuses on space and planetary science. “From a defense perspective, if you have a constellation of CubeSats, you can take out a few of them and you’ll still be able to gather data effectively.”

For its part, Planet has a swarm of 120 CubeSats that image Earth every single day. But the most valuable thing about a constellation of CubeSats is the data they’re capable of collecting, and the machine learning that can analyze all of it.

Satellite imagery from CubeSats can help NGOs track humanitarian crises or assist scientists monitoring the effects of climate change. In identifying China’s Muslim internment camps, Earthrise Media used satellite images provided by Planet Labs’ CubeSats, among other sources.
> # The “democratization” of space technology by commercial entities also means that private companies now get a say in who gets access to the data collected from space.

Countries that don’t have billions to invest in a space program can use data from commercial CubeSats to monitor crops or extreme weather. And private companies, especially those in the commodities world, can infer valuable information about everything from agricultural yields to power plant productivity by analyzing satellite imagery. Images from satellites monitoring, say, a crop like corn, allow commodities traders to see what’s growing where — weeks before a USDA report on crop yields would normally be released.

But commercial entities’ “democratization” of space technology also means that private companies now get a say in who gets access to the data collected from space. “At one point in time, this kind of technology was controlled by nation states, mostly the U.S. and the Soviet Union,” says Brian Weeden, PhD, of the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit that works to promote peaceful and sustainable use of space. Now, instead of the U.S. government deciding who gets access to the information picked up by a satellite, it’s likely to be a company like Planet, which Safyan says has its own internal review process about which clients it works with.

But leaving these decisions up to private companies has some worrying implications.

“There’s no control, say, on where a company’s venture funding comes from,” says Captain Nayak. “There’s nothing stopping, say, a foreign government [from] coming in and being a venture backer for a CubeSat company and then wanting access to that data.” Though he couldn’t say this has already happened with CubeSats, Nayak offered the example of the [Thirty Meter Telescope](&lt;|url|&gt;) in Hawaii, which has received funding from China, Canada, Japan, and India.

While certain information, like the imaging of a U.S military base, is off-limits for a commercial company to sell, machine learning like the kind Planet is pioneering can process terabytes of data on a daily basis, allowing for near real-time imaging of nearly everything else.

“Countries that are very restrictive of citizens [could] be able to obtain information about people’s movements, and that could be very hard to control,” says Erickson.

An analysis of CubeSat imaging could, for example, tell how crowded a parking lot is at certain times of day — valuable intel for both an investor and someone trying to plan a high-impact terrorist attack.

![*An older photograph of Disneyland’s parking lot taken by one of Planet Labs’ Dove CubeSats*](<|image|>)**An older photograph of Disneyland’s parking lot taken by one of Planet Labs’ Dove CubeSats**

For now, the major factor slowing the deployment of CubeSats is the limited ability to get them into space. [NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI)](&lt;|url|&gt;) allows CubeSats built by schools and nonprofit organizations to hitch a ride as auxiliary payloads on government rockets, but waiting time for space on a rocket can sometimes take a year or more. Even though companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin continue to expand opportunities for launching CubeSats, a satellite can sit on the shelf for months or even a year before getting put into orbit.

Still, while space is certainly not lawless — international treaties and national laws govern much of the world’s peaceful extraterrestrial activities — we have already begun to see the ways in which regulating and tracking the ever-increasing number of satellites poses a challenge. Especially as the satellites themselves get even smaller.

In December 2017, California startup Swarm Technologies, which hopes to provide mobile phone and internet service to remote areas, had its application to launch four experimental SpaceBEE satellites denied by the FCC. The government was concerned that the SpaceBEEs, which are tinier than the smallest CubeSats, were too small for government satellites to track, risking a collision with other satellites.

That should have made the mission a no-go, but Swarm launched anyway, from a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle that took off from India. The company’s aggressiveness paid off financially — a year later, Swarm [announced](&lt;|url|&gt;) it had closed on a $25 million round of Series A venture funding, handily dwarfing the [$900,000 fine](&lt;|url|&gt;) the FCC levied against the group for its launch.

And while the U.S. Space Surveillance Network can track most objects in LEO — probably even these new SpaceBEEs — figuring out what a satellite is monitoring and who it belongs to is far trickier. To that end, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory are starting to work towards one solution: [Extremely Low Resource Optical Identifier](&lt;|url|&gt;) (ELROI), a sort of satellite license plate that would indicate the type of satellite, the satellite’s owner, and its orbital path.

For now, experts say the Trump administration’s [Space Policy Directive-3](&lt;|url|&gt;) is a positive step. Released in June 2018, it designates the Department of Commerce, as opposed to the Department of Defense, as the entity to oversee private space activities like CubeSats, meaning that it also has the power to put into place key regulations. Still, it means the government is playing catch-up.

“It’s behind the times,” says Erickson. “All this stuff wasn’t available to masses, and we’re getting to that point of availability, and we have to start to think about it.”

As CubeSats and other small satellites become more powerful — and even more ubiquitous — they’ll be able to gather ever more granular data about what’s going on below. When that happens, forget intrusive ad tracking or sketchy facial recognition: You’ll want to keep your eyes on the sky.

***Update: **An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated how Swarm launched its SpaceBEEs. It did so via a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.*<|endoftext|>

# Meet the People Coding Our World

## An interview with Clive Thompson, author of the great new book ‘Coders’

Images of computer programmers tend to be charged with stereotypes: the quiet nerd, the punk hacker, the hoodie-wearing loner. But what do we really know about the people who are, more than ever, shaping our lives? As screen times soar and tech continues to replace even the most mundane tasks, it might serve us well to know more about the people behind the programs.

![](<|image|>)

I first became interested in Clive Thompson’s new book, *Coders*, after reading his *New York Times* [story](&lt;|url|&gt;), adapted from a chapter in the book, about the history of women in tech. As a woman in tech myself, I was struck by how thoughtful and thorough his coverage was — and not just for a guy. In *Coders*, Thompson, a longtime tech reporter, brings that same anthropological approach to the world of coding writ large. He deftly guides us through a culture that can often seem inaccessible, boring, or just frustratingly self-involved. He approaches tech with both an insider’s expertise and an endearing fondness, while never failing to offer a healthy dose of skepticism where skepticism is due, making the whole read equal parts fascinating and refreshing.

I had the pleasure of chatting with Thompson on a recent afternoon in Brooklyn. This interview has been edited and condensed.

### **Who’s your ideal audience for ‘*Coders’*?**

**Clive Thompson:** I wrote the book primarily for people who aren’t coders to help them understand who these people are and what they do all day, so the average person can understand what’s going on in the technological world around them, why coders make the decisions they make, how they decide to tackle problems, how they define what a problem is… There are really so few books that have ever tried to explain what coders do, and so many of the Hollywood images are so unrealistic.
> # “The single biggest psychological disposition is the ability to endure unbelievable amounts of daily grinding frustration. I don’t know any other discipline like it.”

### **I love the title of chapter three: “Constant Frustration and Bursts of Joy.”**

All the coders love that one!

When people ask me what makes someone succeed at coding, they expect me to say someone has to be really logical or really good at math or systematic thinking. Some of those might be true. But honestly, the single biggest psychological disposition is the ability to endure unbelievable amounts of daily grinding frustration. I don’t know any other discipline like it.

I sometimes feel like that’s what we should tell kids up front: This is going to be enormously fun when it works, but until it works, this is insanely frustrating. But don’t give up! Don’t feel bad or stupid, because everyone feels that. I talk to people who have been coding for 30 years, and they sit around staring baffled at the screen all day because they can’t get something to work.

### **You make a lot of amazing parallels between writing and coding. I think about this constantly as someone who spans both worlds. I find them incredibly similar. Do you think writers would be shocked at how much they liked coding if they tried?**

Yes! I think a lot of writers would be surprisingly good at coding, because they’re already accustomed to the work rhythms required of coding: blocking aside eight hours to go deep into something, sitting alone all day long. They would also be delighted in the languageyness of it. Coding is great for manipulating language. Most of the coding I do is just scripts that help me with my writing.

I talked about this with [Paul Ford](&lt;|url|&gt;), who is a fantastic writer and coder. He thinks writers have too much learned helplessness. They would have trouble with the binary failure modes and get frustrated with that. On the flip side, unlike writing, you don’t have to persuade someone that the code is working. With writing, you have to persuade your editor and your audience. I don’t have to persuade anyone that the weird little scripts I write are working — they just work!

### **You talk about how companies optimize for engagement. Prioritizing engagement assumes people know what they want. It’s like junk food. Do you foresee we’ll someday have the equivalent of “organic” tech, or a “slow” tech movement?**

Optimizing for engagement itself is already a massive value judgement. Engagement gets us more. But is that always a good thing? Sometimes, sometimes not. We’re already sitting on a world of hidden social environments that no one looks at that are not in any way optimized for engagement — the world of hobbyist BBS.

### **What?**

Bulletin board services. If you and I discover that we’re both into Toyota Corollas, we can go into any number of free bulletin board services. It costs pennies a month to run, so we don’t need ads or to make money. It’s just for fun. Every time I talk to people and ask what they do online, they’ll say Instagram, Facebook, etc. But when I ask what they really *like* doing online, their eyes light up when they talk about some weird forum they belong to. These aren’t optimized for engagement, so they have the normal pain-in-the-ass problems of dealing with humans, but not abnormal problems.

So, in one sense, yes, this will exist; it already exists, but it’s all outside the marketplace. Anytime the hand of the marketplace gets involved, you really start to torque up into the idea that we need scale, which means we need engagement, which means we need algorithms to find the best things to look at, which means toxic garbage and extreme utterances get pushed to the top. I’ve been asking some of the top thinkers how to design a large social network that doesn’t fall into those problems, and no one has a good answer.

### **You mention in the book that things have to change at a structural level, like if venture capitalists changed their investment criteria.**

Yes, if the VCs changed, and if the composition of people who made the tools changed so that you have a better, more diverse set of heads bonking against a problem. In the book, everyone I talked to pointed me toward the main things that would have to change to get a better landscape of social networking services, and that includes VCs not requiring massive crazy metastatic growth, a more diverse group of people creating these things, and something that moves away from ad-based models, because ads require massive engagement, massive engagement requires algorithms, and algorithms wind up getting gamed.

### **I want to ask you about James Damore. I’ve listened to a lot of interviews with him to [respond](&lt;|url|&gt;) to his memo. It seemed the more we ignored his stance, the more empowered he became, backed by “free speech” fighters. How do you balance entertaining these arguments enough to point out their flaws without giving them more attention than they deserve?**

Yes, it is tricky to rebut an argument without giving it more oxygen.

### **Exactly. You did it well.**

Part of the reason I wanted to have him in the chapter was because this idea about the biological unsuitedness of women [in coding] runs deep in Silicon Valley, and it’s massive in all the online forums for disgruntled misogynist dudes. And that exploded in the middle of me writing this book. So, I thought I could use this to try and rebut this whole idea that women are biologically unsuited, but I did wrestle with how to do it economically.
> # “There is absolutely no way that anything biological explains the status of women in coding. That is just a completely surreal argument.”

I wanted to let readers know that these arguments exist. I wanted to indicate that from everything I’ve seen in researching it and talking to people in coding, there is *absolutely* no way that anything biological explains the status of women in coding. That is just a completely surreal argument. I wanted to do that without blowing it up into more than it was. Because everyone reading the book had heard this, so they want to know the answer, and that’s the answer: There’s no way biology can remotely explain the subalternate status of women in tech.

### **Your last book was titled ‘*Smarter Than You Think: How Technology Is Changing Our Minds for the Better*.’ More than five years later, do you still think tech is making us smarter?**

Yes, by and large. The problem is that nobody cares whether or not tech is making us smarter. What they care about is whether tech is making us better — morally better. And I actually wondered about that when I wrote the first book and decided that I was not going to tackle morality, because it’s a completely different question than cognitive ability.
> # “Nobody cares whether or not tech is making us smarter. What they care about is whether tech is making us better — morally better.”

I point out in the politics chapter in the end of *Coders* that there are these despots who got really, really good at wielding tech, and that made them into better despots. So, yes, tech makes you smarter. And if you’re a horrible person, it will make you into a much more horrible person. The problem is that intelligence is morally neutral.

### **Do you think everyone should learn to code?**

I don’t think everyone should learn to code, no, but I think everyone should be exposed to it — certainly at the school level. And they should also be exposed to it in a completely different way than they’re currently exposed to it. Right now, we think: Should I be someone who makes an app? When I look at the coding I do in my life, I have no desire to make forward-facing software, but I have a massive desire to make software that’s valuable to me — scripts that make my life easier, personally and professionally, and art.

There’s something so fun and creative about it. I wish people were exposed to it more with that as the end point.<|endoftext|>

# My Dad Died and All I Got Was This Lousy Game Boy

## Quick reflections on an old gadget made new

![](<|image|>)

*This Is “I Can’t Live Without,” a column about the apps, gadgets, and services that make all the difference.*

We lived on the 58th floor of the John Hancock Center in downtown Chicago. What was it like? The kind of place that was called a center. There was a Jamba Juice in the basement.

And even in this center — with the one old woman who putzed around the marble lobby with her bag-sized poodle, before the condo association said no more dogs — my dad wanted us to work.

The Game Boy Advance (GBA) was looming, as many issues of *Electronic Gaming Monthly *let me know, and I would work for it, even though I was chubby, 12, and mostly talentless. What I could do, though, was roll up to my dad’s advertising agency for a few days and document, with a black point-and-shoot camera — the kind with one of those lens covers you’d slide back like a door in *Star Trek* — every single insurable item in the office. I’d write numbers in thick Sharpie on scraps of paper, put them next to a printer or a lamp, take the shot, write down what I was cataloging, and continue. After a few hours, bored to tears, I pointed the flash of the camera directly into my left eye and pressed the shutter button. When I look back, the memory of this light coalesces like a cheap movie dissolve into the white Game Boy, list price $99.99, games and squiggly purple “[Worm Light](&lt;|url|&gt;)” not included.

That Game Boy, which like anything worth having required some small amount of suffering, however arbitrary and privileged in retrospect (again, the marble lobby, the Jamba Juice, the $99), would come to define an era of my life. I can remember the dry pressure against my neck as I dug it into the wooden step of my bunk bed, angling to light the Game Boy’s screen. I remember the long drive to high school two years later as I played *Final Fantasy *in silence next to my dad, the great man who made me earn this thing, who would get sick a year later and die after two more.

But that wasn’t exactly the Game Boy that changed my life. It would come well over a decade later — just a few months ago, actually — when I’d pony up $134.90 to some guy on Etsy for a “MINT” GBA. It arrived in two days from Bayside, Queens, modified with an AGS-101 backlit display unseen on Nintendo’s original release but coveted for its brightness.

This GBA is a revelation. I can hold its glow-in-the-dark body in one hand, centimeters of skin away from my wedding band and inherited Swiss watch. Flick the astonishingly loud power switch — a real-ass switch! — and the object jingles to life. And then it does one thing: play Game Boy cartridges.

Like many of us, my life in 2019 is defined, to some extent, by a cluster of [things that do everything](&lt;|url|&gt;). Smartphones, smart TVs, smart speakers, the internet-connected Nintendo Switch that lets me take screenshots in *Mario *and tweet them to 7,288 people who couldn’t care less. Overburdened by these new things that connect me to a living internet and its many addictions and demands, I find reprieve in this old Game Boy. It’s a portal to game worlds that are unencumbered by notifications. But it’s also a portal to a time when I was younger and guiltless about ignoring the dad I would lose.

The new Game Boy changed my life in this way: It taught me that emotions do extend from our minds, through our fingers, into the objects we touch. They radiate through time. It’s the Game Boy I play today, the ring my wife placed on my finger two years ago, the watch I snapped on and off many times in the years after a funeral, and the Jamba Juice smoothie you might have gotten at a certain urban center — before it closed forever, years ago.

# Snapchat Needs to Evolve or Die Out

## Despite the app’s decent quarter of earnings, Snapchat needs a marketing overhaul if it’s going to survive for the long run

![Neilson Barnard/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Neilson Barnard/Getty Images*

A few weeks ago, Snapchat published a [report](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Generation Z habits, which was heralded by social media news sites as essential reading for brands who want to connect with younger audiences. So what’s the problem? Well, for one thing, it completely misses the mark on who actually uses Snapchat. As a social media professional who has worked in the industry for several years, and as a millennial, I know bad marketing when I see it — and unfortunately it seems, to me, that Snapchat simply doesn’t know its audience.

You could argue this latest analysis from Snapchat may also be an attempt to regain some of its credibility. Following Kylie Jenner’s [comments on Twitter](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year about the app no longer being relevant*, *Snapchat’s market value dropped by over $1 billion. Her criticism came after the app implemented a redesign of its features which many argued made it less user-friendly.

Snapchat’s second quarter earnings indicated that the company had at least stopped its free fall, with both daily active users and revenue growing and its stock price rebounding, but over the long run, Snapchat is still clutching at straws. It is struggling to understand why no one uses it any more, apart from, perhaps, children between the ages of five and 12 years old, an age group brands wouldn’t want to market to anyway. What is a 5-year-old going to be able to buy? This age group sees the app as a toy, using the filters for fun rather than for anything else. Sure, TV and film studios, or even toy companies, can partner with them to create exclusive filters that may influence this age group, who in turn might ask their parents to go and see the latest Marvel or Disney film or buy some new toy, but ultimately, with this age group, it is still the parents who make the call.
> # Live their truth — are they serious?

The report says: “Gen Z are setting a new tone for visual culture — after an era of posed photos against millennial-pink backdrops, a new wave of content mixes selfies with spoken word, imperfect collages with augmented reality (AR) landscapes, and illustration with candid live streams. This is layered with the need to live their truth, and an acute sense of social responsibility.”

I mean, I can spout nonsense marketing speak and awful buzzwords with the best of them, but this takes it to a whole new level! What on earth are they saying here? “Live their truth” — are they serious? This is a perfect example of a brand senior exec adopting “youth speak” (and not very well) to appear relevant or knowledgeable about what the young people want. Every time I read something like this, all I can think of is…

![](<|image|>)

So what’s the answer? Well, Snapchat needs to capitalize on what it does best — filters! They far supersede those of Instagram and Facebook — ask anyone and they’ll tell you the same thing: “I use the Snapchat filters and then upload the photo or video on my Instagram story.”

Snapchat has tried to reinvent itself time and time again because ultimately, it doesn’t know whether the app should be used as a marketing tool or a social media network. If you’re clever, like Instagram, you know how to be both.

While I doubt a partnership with Instagram makes much sense for Snapchat, what they could do instead is to launch stand-alone kiosks in stores, bars, and more, where users have the opportunity for their photos to be seen on a bigger platform. [Times Square did something similar a few years ago](&lt;|url|&gt;), and, in fact, most hipster bars, coffee shops, and even the likes of New Look and Topshop have in-store photo booths for customers to take snapshots to commemorate their experience, and it is this experiential element that most millennials and younger generations now seek. This is what brands — including Snapchat — need to leverage, or they might not survive.<|endoftext|>

# It’s Time for Tech Companies to Adopt a ‘Do No Harm’ Approach

## Founders and investors need a new code of ethics

![Credit: N Farnon/Moment/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: N Farnon/Moment/Getty*

*Co-authored with Carrie Barron, MD, and Nicco Mele*

Transformational change cannot occur suddenly — and sudden changes rarely turn out to be transformational. It’s clear that common practices at many of our largest tech platforms must change, but hoping for a shouting-at-the-barricades revolution is unrealistic and possibly unhelpful. While we — representing doctors, health tech professionals, and elements of the policymaking community — recognize and share public dissatisfaction with the behavior of many leading operators, boards, and corporations in the tech sector, we don’t believe that the necessary cultural shifts are best advanced through expressions of indignation or outrage. Real reform warrants a combination of emotional discipline, strong modeling, and the adoption of concrete and coherent principles.

For the first time in decades, investors and consumers seem unwilling to tolerate the notion that the ends justify the means, or that only money matters. The world is waking up to the fact that when winners take all — using raw power, subterfuge, and hypnotic prestige — everyone loses. The consequences plainly and, in most cases, negatively affect public well-being and even health. And they actually depress shareholder value — particularly at places like Facebook and Uber.
> # For the first time in decades, investors and consumers seem unwilling to tolerate the notion that the ends justify the means, or that only money matters.

It’s encouraging to see writers and thinkers like Joseph Stieglitz allude to the prospects of a more “[progressive capitalism](&lt;|url|&gt;),” arguing that the term isn’t an oxymoron but indeed an orientation designed to channel the power of the market to better serve society. We agree. The fundamental shifts in corporate behavior that the nation and the world urgently deserve are not the stuff of fantasy. They are real and are, in some instances, already underway.

The 2017 investor insurrection at Uber might someday be regarded as the spark of this change. That year, critics of the increasingly scandal-ridden ride-hailing company engaged in an investor revolt of the sort rarely seen in “rocket ship” growth stories in tech. What we now know, from documents only recently unsealed, is that a syndicate of the company’s leading shareholders drew up a stunning rebuke of then-CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick. In the letter, they detailed grave concerns about the direction of the company, its leadership, culture, and conduct. And to drive it home, they articulated a series of principles and guidelines that are applicable to both Uber and, broadly, the rest of the industry.

Coincidentally, these principles were delivered just four months shy of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther promulgating his own revolutionary ideas, the “95 Theses,” which commenced the Protestant Reformation. And much like Luther’s dramatic nailing of his theses to the church door of Wittenberg Castle, the Uber shareholders punctuated their revolt by delivering the letter in person to Kalanick’s hotel room.

And change ensued. Kalanick stepped down. Other key members of senior leadership followed.

Yet this letter did not signal the end of an era in tech. It was to become just one of many significant developments in an ever-widening drama that continues to unfold in both public and private, as the nation reckons with almost constant revelations of misconduct, abuse of trust, and similar breaches, leaving the brittle landscape of common values in further disarray.

Many observers of the tech industry, and even everyday users of its products (ourselves included), are straining to make sense of where this contentious state of affairs leaves us — more sensitive, to be sure, but less united in our convictions about what our shared values are now or what appropriate and enforceable demands of major tech institutions should be. When it comes to the centrality of technology to our daily lives, we are ever more worried about the risks of pure innovation without proper accountability.
> # We believe it’s time to search for, hotly debate, and someday adopt a basic framework to guide and shape the culture of tech — and the culture that tech imparts to the rest of America and the world.

There remains a conspicuous gap, as wide as the Valley is long, concerning acceptable standards of excellence in behavior, practice, language, and accountability — including assessment tools and enforcement mechanisms to ensure common decency. We must either rely on personal taste or the power of law enforcement to identify criminal malpractice (in cases like Theranos) or fraud (as with the Fyre Festival). As of yet, there’s no set of committed principles, no counterpart to the physician’s Hippocratic Oath, that is required of founders or key company officers. There isn’t even the equivalent of LEED certification for startups or corporations, other than nonbinding passages in articles of incorporation.

That’s why we believe it’s time to search for, debate, and someday adopt a basic framework, along the lines of the principles composed by the Uber shareholders, to guide and shape the culture of tech — and the culture that tech imparts to the rest of America and the world.

We remind ourselves and restate here that platforms are not and shouldn’t be viewed as culprits in a scheme. They’re critical partners and, indeed, agents of the change that we need. Rather than amplifying the shrill tone of rebuke, it’s time to quiet the noise and garner the support of all key stakeholders — founders, investors, corporate officers, and consumers — to shape a better future. Indictments on television and venom in chat rooms might make for good memes, but real progress requires cooler heads. We believe that Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other major players are the critical gatekeepers of contemporary human experience, and meaningful reform can only be achieved with their buy-in and engagement.

That’s precisely why we’re attempting to quiet accusations and engage in more practical conversations, including what might someday be the creation of a new Hippocratic oath for the business of technology as it directly affects behavioral health and well-being. A new edition of business ethics will not do. What we envision is a pledge *from* tech, *for* the world, to build fundamentally healthier products and services.

We don’t yet have 95 theses, but we do have a shared conviction that a simple, formidable framework for product creation and business conduct is fundamental. To that end, we start with two tenets borrowed directly from the Uber investor letter of 2017.

## Principle 1

### **We believe that the cultural values of Silicon Valley urgently need to be transformed to truly embrace integrity, decency, transparency, diversity, and social responsibility alongside growth and the bottom line**.

Transformation is possible; companies need to change in order to succeed operationally and survive in local and global communities. The public perception that technology companies fundamentally lack ethical and moral values needs to be upended. Pledges that fail to satisfy — or clearly depart from — acceptable standards must be exposed and remedied by engaging employees and customers to correct them. Decades of false messianism — masquerading as visions of “changing the world” — must be replaced and reprioritized under a humble determination to change ourselves first.

## Principle 2

### **We believe that founders, leaders, and CEO candidates must have not only a fully articulated strategic vision and expert management skills to lead, but** also **the ability to establish the ethical, values-based culture every company needs to move forward.**

We firmly agree. But in addition to these original two delivered by the Uber investors, we would endeavor to add three more foundational pillars.

## Principle 3

### **Fix real problems.**

Borrowing from both the executive oath of office and from a passage in the Hippocratic oath, we suggest that founders and operators of companies accept personal responsibility to “use all summonable resources, time, talent, and treatment techniques to help address real and recognizable problems, according to their ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrongdoing.” We can’t afford to keep pursuing, or attempting to create, an ever more nettlesome web of intermediate services and parasitic entities that fail to fundamentally serve humankind.

## Principle 4

### **“Do no harm.”**

Companies and operators must embrace and steadfastly abide by two virtues in all dealings with people, products, services, and the delivery or satisfaction thereof: Help, or do no harm to, the public. This applies equally to all matters involving gender, age, race, class, culture, weight, and health diagnoses. It’s worth noting that Google once embraced, but later abandoned, the dictum “don’t be evil.” It may now be time for Alphabet, Microsoft, or venture firms themselves to retake the initiative.

## Principle 5

### **The future is watching** — **act accordingly.**

Our fifth required commitment would, we hope, be modeled after the following lines from the Hippocratic oath:
> Whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, as well as outside my profession in my discourse or exchange with people, if it be what should not be published abroad, I will never divulge, holding such things to be [sacred.]
> Now if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain for ever reputation among all [people] for my life and for my art; but if I break it and forswear myself, may the opposite befall me.

We believe this national conversation and ongoing global dialogue is only in its adolescence, and we are certain that these are not the only five principles that must be embraced. But we hope they help catalyze a critical dialogue about how to alter and positively affect our relationship with and to technology for the betterment of human health, safety, and prosperity, while still acknowledging the exigencies of business, which are real and legitimate.

To certain audiences, these small steps may appear wholly insufficient, but change that is too rapid or radical is often unsustainable, impractical, and, in some cases, even undesirable. What we urgently need now are clear principles, along with ample patience, to guide growth and improve outcomes for every living user of technology in the modern world.

# Should You Get a Genetic Test on Your Health Risks?

## Should you take a DNA test? Science shows knowledge of our genome affects our behavior — and not always for the better.

![Credit: Andrew Brookes/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Andrew Brookes/Getty Images*

Services like 23andMe make it easy to learn about the history hidden inside our genetic code. Although it is fun to learn about our ancestry and whether or not we can [smell asparagus in our urine](&lt;|url|&gt;), genetic testing can raise serious questions about our health. Is it helpful to find out that we are likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease or develop Alzheimer’s in our older age?

Learning about our specific genetic health profile might help us optimize our behavior and lifestyle to minimize our risks. If we know we have a high risk of cardiovascular problems, perhaps we should hop on a treadmill more regularly and take better care of our diet. On the other hand, learning about a high risk of disease is likely to make us unnecessarily anxious, and the stress may even make our health worse.

To make an informed decision about whether to offer our saliva to genetic testing companies, it helps to know how people behave once they gain knowledge about their genetic predispositions.

One group of researchers at Stanford [tested the question directly](&lt;|url|&gt;). They sequenced the DNA of 116 people to understand their risk profile in relation to physical exercise capacity, focusing specifically on a gene known as *CREB1*. People with a high-risk *CREB1* genotype, rather than a protective *CREB1 *genotype, typically have poorer aerobic capacity and struggle to benefit from physical exercises. So the researchers split participants into groups according to these genotypes.

Importantly, this actual genetic risk was not the only variable of interest. The researchers were trying to understand how people’s knowledge and beliefs about their genetic risks could affect their behavior, so they introduced an additional manipulation. For each of the genotype groups, the researchers randomly told half the people in the study that they had the high-risk genotype and the other half that they had the protective genotype. Of course, this involved some temporary deception for men and women who were told they had the wrong genotype, so the researchers were careful to fully debrief everyone at the end of the study to make sure they understood the experiment objectives and the true facts behind their genes.

Here’s the first important result: The belief manipulation worked. Regardless of their true genetic profiles, people who were told they had high-risk genotypes believed they were more vulnerable to poor exercise capacity than people who were told they had protective genotypes. They also expressed more worry and less control over their physical health.

To see how those beliefs affected actual behavior, everyone in the study completed a treadmill running test, both before and after they were told about their genetic risk. This allowed researchers to measure each person’s baseline physical performance before checking how their performance changed after the introduction of specific beliefs.

The people who were told they had a protective genotype showed no change between these sessions; they had the same aerobic capacity before and after the manipulation. But the people who believed they had the high-risk genotype struggled more in the second session. In their final, most demanding minutes of the exercise test, these people hit a plateau in their physiological measures, while the men and women with protective genotype beliefs kept pushing themselves harder in both the baseline and post-belief sessions.

Consistent with these physiological measures, people in the high-risk belief group declined in their running endurance. They stopped 22 seconds earlier on the treadmill compared to their baseline performance. In contrast, people who were told they had a protective phenotype showed the same physical endurance before and after their beliefs changed.

But how did the people in the study actually feel during the exercises? The researchers took several measures of subjective experience as people ran on the treadmill. Compared to their baseline, those with the protective beliefs ran 47 seconds longer before reporting that the exercise was “hard” and 67 seconds longer before saying they felt “hot.” This is true even though they ran at the same intensity during both sessions. The people with the high-risk beliefs showed none of these advantages.

Does this apply to other genes?

To prove that these effects were more than a one-hit wonder, the researchers ran a second experiment, this time isolating a different candidate gene related to obesity known as *FTO*. A [high-risk *FTO* genotype](&lt;|url|&gt;) is linked with reduced satiety after eating and stronger responses in appetite-related brain areas when looking at pictures of food.

Repeating the protocol from the first experiment, the researchers used a genetic test to find people with high-risk and protective *FTO* genotypes and told half of each group their true genotype, while making the other half believe they had the opposite genotype. But instead of asking people to run on treadmills during behavioral testing, they simply asked them to consume a meal before and after the genotype beliefs were manipulated. The researchers then examined whether the people in the study reacted differently to their meals after their beliefs changed.
> # Positive expectations can shift us into a productive mindset, and negative expectations can make us pessimistic about our health, fitness, and self-control.

Once again, the belief manipulations were effective because the people who were told they carried a high-risk rather than protective genotype were more worried about their ability to control their satiety.

Despite eating exactly the same meal in both sessions, the people who believed they had a protective genotype showed greater levels of a hormone related to feeling full after their beliefs changed, in comparison to their baseline. The high-risk-belief people showed no changes. Similar to the participants from the first experiment, people’s bodily functions physically changed depending on their beliefs and expectations — and their subjective experiences fit the same pattern. People with protective beliefs reported feeling more full after eating, regardless of their true genotype.

So, what does this all mean?

For now, there is no easy answer to the question of whether you should learn about your genetic health risks. Positive expectations can shift us into a productive mindset, and negative expectations can make us pessimistic about our health, fitness, and self-control. However, at least in the context of the experiments above, these effects were measured over just a single day, primarily because the ethical implications of deceiving participants about their genotypes would have grown larger with time.

Some other studies have focused on measuring the effects of genotype transparency over the course of several months. One study genetically tested older people to learn about their risk for Alzheimer’s. In that study, rather than including any kind of deception, some people were given the choice to learn their high or low risk, while others went without knowing. Months later, the people who knew they had a high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s [performed worse in memory tests](&lt;|url|&gt;) and judged their memory more harshly than people who never knew about their own high-risk genotype.

However, people in this Alzheimer’s study were not randomly split into groups with different beliefs, which means other group characteristics may have explained why people who chose to look at their genetic disadvantage also had worse outcomes. This is the natural downside of removing all elements of deception from belief manipulations. So we need to wait for stronger evidence before assuming cause and effect.

The results from these studies are a fascinating extension of what we know about [the placebo effect](&lt;|url|&gt;). We know that the beliefs we hold — whether they are true or not — change bodies and behavior. But unlike the traditional placebo effect, people in these studies did not need to take a fake pill to be convinced that their body was being influenced. Instead, they were simply misled about the natural state of their existing bodies. The belief that they had a particular genotype forced their behavior into a mode consistent with that genotype.

For many of the outcomes in the studies, people’s *beliefs* about their genotypes had a more profound impact on their behavior than the actual genotypes themselves, at least in the short term. Genes are, of course, critical in our development, and these results should not encourage us to veer toward a blank-slate hypothesis where we insist that our environment matters more than our genes. It should only reiterate the boring truth about the nature versus nurture debate, which is that both matter enormously. Nature deals us our cards, and nurture determines how we play them.

Given the current unknowns, we should remain cautious. It may be that the long-term costs and benefits of learning your genetic health profile depend on your personality. If you feel you would be highly motivated to improve yourself if you found that you had a high-risk genotype, perhaps it is a good idea for you to gain some certainty about your biological makeup. But if you are particularly anxious, perhaps you are better off not knowing at all. Each of us, as individuals who care about our personal well-being, need to use the available evidence to make our own informed decisions.

As technology becomes increasingly able to reveal deeper facts about our personal identities, we will need to consider which facts we do and do not want to know. Sometimes [too much information can be counterproductive](&lt;|url|&gt;) and even harmful. Maintaining the ideal balance is challenging, but it is a challenge worth fighting. Our false intuitions about statistical risk and biological determinism mean that when we see our genetic vulnerabilities, we may unconsciously act as if those vulnerabilities are already at work. But if we follow the evolving scientific evidence on how expectations affect health — if we remain conscious that human beings can be their own own worst enemy — we can at least live free of fear.<|endoftext|>

# Don’t Be a Phonehead

## Smartphone zombies are ruining city life

![Animation by [Eva Cremers](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Animation by [Eva Cremers](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Sure, we all need to look at our phones now and then. But for a growing population, “head down” is no longer merely a brief moment, but how all walking is done. The neck is bent, the headphones are in; collisions are barely avoided by a last minute glance.

Meet the “phoneheads”: the head-down marchers taking over city streets around the world. You’ve surely seen them; you may even be one yourself — and they’re destroying city life as we know it.

The look of streets is changing fast. What Jane Jacobs once called “the ballet of the good sidewalk,” looks today more like a hunchback bumper derby. The idea of men or women who “look to the horizon” — or even just the world around them — has been surrendered to more apelike aspirations. Not to mention that phoneheads are far more likely to get hit by cars and bicycles. One phone-tapper actually [walked off a cliff](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Collisions aside, phoneheadism is also highly contagious. When another person is staring at their phone, you start to wonder if maybe they’ve seen something you haven’t. There’s an itchy-impulse to pull out your own phone and see what’s up. Soon the entire sidewalk is transformed into a zombie shuffle that cannot be described as attractive.

If the rise of the phonehead wasn’t so annoying, it might be hilarious. Many people come to big cities like New York hoping to be a “be part of it,” whatever that means. Yet day-to-day life is still spent fixated on the back of several small rectangles that could be anywhere. Aldous Huxley was right when he suggested that, in the far future, it would be easy to travel between cities, but that by then there would no real point in doing so.
> # While it seems like we’re here in the city, we’ve all become part-timers, not fully living here at all, but inhabiting it halfway.

But is there more to this problem than just bad posture and more pedestrian collisions? What’s happening here is the kind of small thing that is actually revealing of something larger. It isn’t crazy to suggest that our cities are in the midst of a cold war with the phone screen, or more precisely, the worlds behind it. The rise of the phonehead is at the front line of this quiet struggle.

That’s an assertion demands a little more explanation. Think of it this way: both the city and the phone are competing to be the place where things happen, where commerce, advertising, and design take place, and where human connection occurs. For cities, it is a competition that may be as challenging as the one offered by malls and suburbs that almost killed urban life in the 1980s.

This is probably clearest in economic terms, where the phonehead is the physical manifestation of the face-off between the older capitalism built on physical stores versus its online challengers. There are, to be sure, some ways phones can help stores, like when Instagram brings crowds to a [burger joint with colorful shakes.](&lt;|url|&gt;) But it has also become easier than ever to use the city you live in as merely a showroom, a place to think about purchases you intend to make later, online. The more brazen among us even order from Amazon while still inside a store — which might be the 21st century’s version of shoplifting.

The city’s preeminence in design and fashion is also challenged. What else can one say when an interior is designed not for how it looks when you are there, but how it will look, later, on Instagram? The result is that we are often, in our own lives, like studio audiences, living our lives as if for a show to be aired later.

No one really predicted this partially-online future of ours. In the 1980s and 1990s there were science fiction writers who imagined that “cyberspace” would compete with “real space,” but in a different way. William Gibson and Neal Stephenson assumed that virtual worlds would be other places, separate from this one. You’d have one identity “here,” and another over “there” in that other, wackier world, where you could be whoever you wanted to be.

Cyberspace made for good fiction but *Pokemon Go* has captured the real future more accurately. It turned out to be too much work to build an entire new world (Burning Man only lasts nine days for a reason). Most of the virtual worlds (that are not games) have failed. Instead, it is easier to colonize the real world by creating a population that is always at least partially online: halfway here, halfway there.

What science fiction did get right is that these newer, virtual worlds would be parasitic, feeding off the physical city, depleting it in odd and unexpected ways. (Stephenson also predicted that some people would always be online — he called them “gargoyles.”) And so it is — for while it seems like we’re here in the city, we’ve all become part-timers, not fully living here at all, but inhabiting it halfway.

As E.B. White [wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) of New York in 1950, “the city makes up for its hazards and deficiencies by supplying its citizens with massive doses of a supplementary vitamin — the sense of belonging to something unique, cosmopolitan, mighty and unparalleled.” But if we don’t pay attention to each other at all, we aren’t really part of something, and in some sense aren’t really in the city at all.

But we aren’t quite there yet. Cities have survived much worse, and street life, if more annoying, isn’t gone. What we have really suffered from is a collective failure to use etiquette to draw any lines. It’s time to draw one. Use your phone when you need to, but please, don’t be a phonehead.<|endoftext|>

# Machine Learning Widens the Gap Between Knowledge and Understanding

## And gives us the tools for our next evolutionary step

![Credit: peepo/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: peepo/Getty Images*

The program** **“Deep Patient” doesn’t know that being knocked on the head can make us humans dizzy or that diabetics shouldn’t eat 5-pound Toblerone bars in one sitting. It doesn’t even know that the arm bone is connected to the wrist bone. All it knows is what researchers fed it in 2015: the medical records of 700,000 patients as discombobulated data, with no skeleton of understanding to hang it all on.

Yet, after analyzing the relationships among these blind bits, Deep Patient was not only able to diagnose the likelihood of individual patients developing particular diseases, it was in some instances more accurate than human physicians, including about some diseases that until now have utterly defied predictability.

## Deep learning

If you ask your physician why Deep Patient thinks it might be wise for you to start taking statins or undergo preventive surgery, your doctor might not be able to tell you, but not because she’s not sufficiently smart or technical. Deep Patient is a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning (itself a type of machine learning) that finds relationships among pieces of data, knowing nothing about what that data represents.

From this, it assembles a network of information points, each with a weighting that determines how likely the points it’s connected to will “fire,” which in turn affects the points they’re connected to, the way firing a neuron in a brain would. To understand why Deep Patient thinks, say, that there’s a 72 percent chance that a particular patient will develop schizophrenia, a doctor would have to internalize those millions of points and each of their connections and weightings. But there are just too many, and they are in relationships that are too complex. You, as a patient, are, of course, free to reject Deep Patient’s probabilistic conclusions, but you do so at a risk, for the reality is that we use “black box” diagnostic systems that cannot explain their predictions because, in some cases, they are significantly more accurate than human doctors.

This is the future, and not just for medicine. Your phone’s navigation system, type-ahead predictions, language translation, music recommendations, and much more already rely on machine learning.

As this form of computation gets more advanced, it can get more mysterious. For example, if you subtract the number of possible chess moves from the number of possible *Go* moves, the remainder is still many times larger than the number of atoms in the universe. Yet, Google’s A.I.-based *AlphaGo* program routinely beats the top-ranked human players, even though it knows nothing about *Go* except what it’s learned from analyzing 60 million moves in 130,000 recorded games. If you examine *AlphaGo*’s inner states to try to discover why it made any one particular move, you are likely to see nothing but an ineffably complex set of weighted relationships among its data. *AlphaGo* simply may not be able to tell you in terms a human can understand why it made the moves that it did.

Yet, about an *AlphaGo* move that left some commenters literally speechless, one *Go* master, Fan Hui, said, “It’s not a human move. I’ve never seen a human play this move.” Then softly: “So beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.”

Deep learning’s algorithms work because they capture, better than any human can, the complexity, fluidity, and even the beauty of a universe in which everything affects everything else, all at once.
> # We’re beginning to accept that the true complexity of the world far outstrips the laws and models we devise to explain it.

Machine learning is just one of many tools and strategies that have been increasingly bringing us face-to-face with the incomprehensible intricacy of our everyday world. But this benefit comes at a price: We need to give up our insistence on always understanding our world and how things happen in it.

## Shallow understanding

We humans have long been under the impression that if we can just understand the immutable laws of how things happen, we’ll be able to perfectly predict, plan for, and manage the future. If we know how weather happens, weather reports can tell us whether to take an umbrella to work. If we know what makes people click on one thing and not another in their Facebook feeds, we can design the perfect ad campaign. If we know how epidemics happen, we can prevent them from spreading. We have, therefore, made it our business to know how things happen by discovering the laws and models that govern our world.

Given how imperfect our knowledge has always been, this assumption has rested upon a deeper one. Our unstated contract with the universe has been that if we work hard enough and think clearly enough, the universe will yield its secrets, for the universe is knowable, and thus, at least, somewhat pliable to our will.

But now that our new tools, especially machine learning and the internet, are bringing home to us the immensity of the data and information around us, we’re beginning to accept that the true complexity of the world far outstrips the laws and models we devise to explain it. Our newly capacious machines can get closer to understanding it than we can, and they, as machines, don’t really understand anything at all.

This, in turn, challenges another assumption we hold one level further down: The universe is knowable to us because we humans (we’ve assumed) are uniquely able to understand how the universe works. At least since the ancient Hebrews, we have thought ourselves to be the creatures uniquely made by God with the capacity to receive His revelation of the truth. Since the ancient Greeks, we’ve defined ourselves as the rational animals who are able to see the logic and order beneath the apparent chaos of the world. Our most basic strategies have relied on this special relationship between us and our world.

Giving up on this traditional self-image of our species is wrenching and painful. Feeling crushed by information overload and nervously awaiting the next disruption of our business, government, or culture are just the localized pains of a deeper malady: the sense — sometimes expressed in uneasy jokes about the rise of robot overlords — that we are not as well adapted to our universe as we’d thought. Our minds cannot analyze or predict events as accurately and quickly as A.I. can. Evolution has given us minds tuned for survival and only incidentally for truth. Our claims about what makes our species special — emotion, intuition, creativity — are beginning to sound overinsistent and a bit desperate.

This literal disillusionment is something for us to embrace — and not only because it’s happening whether we embrace it or not. We are at the beginning of a great leap forward in our powers of understanding and managing the future: Rather than always having to wrestle our world down to a size we can predict, control, and feel comfortable with, we are starting to build strategies that take our world’s complexity into account.

We are taking this leap because it is already enabling us to be more efficient and effective, in touch with more people and ideas, more creative, more joyful. It is already recontextualizing many of our most basic ideas and our most deeply accustomed practices in our business and personal lives. It is reverberating through every reach of our culture.

The signs are all around us, but in many cases they’re hidden in practices and ideas that already seem normal and obvious. For example, before machine learning came to prominence, the internet was already getting us used to these changes.

## **The A/B mystery**

When Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign tried out two versions of a sign-up button on its website, it found the one labeled “Learn more” drew dramatically more clicks than the same button labeled “Join Us Now” or “Sign Up Now.”

Another test showed that a black-and-white photo of the Obama family unexpectedly generated far more clicks than the color image the site had been using.

Then, when they put the “Learn more” button together with the black-and-white photo, sign-ups increased 40 percent.

Overall, the campaign estimated that almost a third of the 13 million names on its email list, and about $75 million in donations, were due to the improved performance provided by this sort of A/B testing,* *in which a site tries out variants of an ad or content on unknowing sets of random users, and then uses the results to decide which version the rest of the users will see.

It was even more surprising when the Obama team realized that a video of the candidate whipping up a crowd at a rally generated far fewer clicks than displaying a purely text-based message. What could explain this difference, given their candidate’s talents as an orator? The team did not know. Nor did they need to know. The empirical data told them which content to post on the campaign site, even if it didn’t tell them why. The results: more clicks, more donations, probably more votes.

A/B testing has become a common practice. The results you get on a search page on Google are the results of A/B testing. The layout of movies on Netflix results from A/B testing. Even some headlines used by the *New York Times *are the result of A/B testing. Between 2014 and 2016, Bing software engineers performed 21,200 A/B tests, a third of which led to changes to the service.

A/B testing works without needing, or generating, a hypothesis about why* *it works. Why does some ad on Amazon generate more sales if the image of the smiling young woman is on the left instead of the right? We can make up a theory, but we’d still be well advised to A/B test the position of the model in the next ad we create. That a black-and-white photo worked for Obama does not mean that his opponent, John McCain, should have ditched his color photos. That using a blue background instead of a green one worked for Amazon’s pitch for an outdoor grill gives us no reason to think it will work for an indoor grill or for a book of barbecue recipes.
> # *With A/B testing, we often don’t have a mental framework that explains why one version of an ad works better than another.*

In fact, it’s entirely plausible that the factors affecting people’s preferences are microscopic and fleeting. Maybe men over 50 prefer the ad with the model on the left but only if they are coming from a page that had a funny headline, while women from Detroit prefer the model on the right if the sun just peeked through their windows after two overcast days. Maybe some people prefer the black-and-white photo if they were just watching a high-contrast video and others prefer the color version if the Yankees just lost a game. Maybe some generalizations will emerge. Maybe not. We don’t know. The reasons may be as varied as the world itself.

We’ve been brought up to believe that the truth, and reality, of the world is expressed by a handful of immutable laws. Learn the laws and you can make predictions. Discover new laws and you can predict more things. If someone wants to know how you came up with a prediction, you can trot out the laws and the data you’ve plugged into them. But with A/B testing, we often don’t have a mental framework that explains why one version of an ad works better than another.

Think about throwing a beach ball. You expect the ball to arc while moving in the general direction you threw it in, for our mental model — the set of rules for how we think things interact — takes account of gravity and momentum. If the ball goes in another direction, you don’t throw out the model. Rather you assume you missed some element of the situation; maybe there was a gust of wind, or your hand slipped.

That is precisely what we don’t do for A/B testing. We don’t need to know why a black-and-white photo and a “Learn more” label increased donations to one particular campaign. And if the lessons we learned from a Democrat’s ad turn out not to work for her Republican opposition — and they well may not — that’s okay too, for it’s cheap enough just to run another A/B test.

A/B testing is just one example of a technique that inconspicuously shows us that principles, laws, and generalizations aren’t as important as we thought. Maybe — maybe — principles are what we use when we can’t handle the fine grains of reality.

## The efficacy of complexity

We’ve just looked at examples of two computer-based technologies that are quite different: a programming technique (machine learning) and a global place (the internet) where we encounter others and their expressions of meaning and creativity. Of course, these technologies are often enmeshed: machine learning uses the internet to gather information at the scale it needs, and ever more internet-based services both use and feed machine learning.

These two technologies also have at least three things in common that have been teaching us about how the world works: Both are huge. Both are connected. Both are complex.

Their *hugeness* — their scale — is not of the sort we encounter when we visit the home of the world’s largest ball of twine or imagine all the world’s potatoes in a single pile. The importance of the hugeness of both machine learning and the internet is the level of detail they enable. Rather than having to get rid of detail by generalizing or suppressing “marginal” information and ideas, both of these technologies thrive on details and uniqueness.

The *connectedness *of both of these technologies means that the bits and pieces contained within them can affect one another without a backwards glance at the barriers that physical distance imposes. This connectedness is essential to both of these technologies: a network that connected one piece to another, one at a time, would be not the internet but the old telephone system. Our new technologies’ connectedness is massive, multi-way, distance-less, and essential.

The scale and connectedness of machine learning and the internet results in their *complexity*. The connections among the huge number of pieces can sometimes lead to chains of events that end up wildly far from where they started. Tiny differences can cause these systems to take unexpectedly sharp turns.

We don’t use these technologies because they are huge, connected, and complex. We use them because they work. Our success with these technologies — rather than the technologies themselves — is showing us the world as more complex and chaotic than we thought, which, in turn, is encouraging us to explore new approaches and strategies, challenging our assumptions about the nature and importance of understanding and explanations, and ultimately leading us to a new sense of how things happen.

# How YouTubers Could Save Sex Ed

## How YouTubers Could Save Sex Ed

### *Channels like Queer Kid Stuff offer much-needed resources for young people*

![Credit: Florian Gaertner/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Florian Gaertner/Getty*

Even back in college, Lindsay Amer knew what their calling in life was. They wanted to use theater and storytelling to help kids understand the basics of queer issues and better understand what words like “gay” actually mean, while giving young people a space to see themselves and feel more comfortable with their identities.

As a queer person with a background in creating and directing theater for young audiences, as well as a degree in gender studies, Amer felt like this kind of work was the perfect fit for their skill set. But as they set off on their path, they ran into a few stumbling blocks. Theater spaces and schools were anxious about booking a performance that some might deem controversial. Even when Amer did manage to get a gig, their message was naturally limited to the audience in the room.

Feeling frustrated, Amer started wondering if there might be another way to get their message out into the world. And then inspiration struck. “I was off in London, feeling homesick, watching a lot of American queer YouTubers,” Amer says. “And I realized YouTube was this free, publicly accessible space that kids were in.”

Most conversations around kids, sex, and the internet focus on the potential negatives. There’s been a lot of hand-wringing about the way pornography supposedly [warps](&lt;|url|&gt;) young minds. Meanwhile, even supposedly youth-friendly apps like YouTube Kids have been [accused of exposing children to explicit content](&lt;|url|&gt;), to say nothing of the [bizarre, algorithmically generated junk](&lt;|url|&gt;) that floats around there or the [disturbing conspiracy theories](&lt;|url|&gt;) that bubble up on the larger platform.

Still, the proliferation of harmful content arguably underscores the need to balance these incredibly popular platforms with high-quality material. For educators hoping to pioneer a new kind of youth sex education, one that challenges our ideas of what topics are age appropriate and safe for kids, the internet feels more like a land of opportunity.

Because the internet makes it easy to ask embarrassing questions with the utmost discretion, it has offered awkward young people a nonjudgmental way to get the answers they need. And because the internet doesn’t require the permission of gatekeepers, it has made it far easier to publish and share information that might be deemed scandalous by the school boards, publishing houses, and TV stations that have traditionally been the gatekeepers around sex education content.

Until recently, the internet’s liberalizing effect has been largely limited to media aimed at people who are past puberty. Sites like [Scarleteen](&lt;|url|&gt;) and Columbia University’s [Go Ask Alice!](&lt;|url|&gt;) have been facilitating difficult discussions since the earliest days of the web, providing guidance to young people who aren’t receiving good sex ed at home or at school, and serving as a resource for parents who need a trusted source for their questioning kids. But parents looking for the same open-minded, shame-free vibe for the younger set have been out of luck.
> # “They need to know what their body is and not feel that it’s furtive or shameful to have an anus, to have a urethra, to have a penis”

As more and more young kids have gone online, turning to YouTube instead of the TV in search of their afternoon entertainment, that dynamic has begun to change. Amer’s epiphany ultimately led to the creation of [*Queer Kid Stuff](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a YouTube series that’s currently in its fourth season and has more than 14,000 subscribers. Alongside independent creators like Amer, advocacy groups that have long worked to transform America’s youth sex education are capitalizing on the opportunity provided by the internet.

Earlier this year, [Amaze.org](&lt;|url|&gt;) — a youth sex ed project jointly created by nonprofits [Answer](&lt;|url|&gt;), [Advocates for Youth](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [Youth Tech Health](&lt;|url|&gt;) — launched [Amaze Jr.](&lt;|url|&gt;), a resource full of age-appropriate videos for kids ages four to nine to watch with their parents (as well as some videos for parents to watch alone). Though it’s not quite as boundary-pushing as *Queer Kid Stuff*, which tackles topics like [transitioning](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [asexuality](&lt;|url|&gt;), Amaze Jr. is still far more expansive than what many of us remember from our own youth sex ed, addressing subjects like consent and gender identity.

And it’s not just video content that’s being transformed by the internet. In 2011, award-winning author and sex educator Cory Silverberg had an idea for a book about how babies are made. It would be one that would expand beyond the traditional “Mommy and Daddy loved each other and made you” narrative to be inclusive of trans families, queer families, families who used IVF or surrogates, adoptive families, and more. Publishers saw his idea as too niche, with an audience that’d be far too limited to be worth their time, so Silverberg decided to take the self-publication route. He turned to Kickstarter in search of $9,500, a goal he blew past in the first day, [ultimately raising more than $65,000](&lt;|url|&gt;) for the project.

“I would have never known that there was such a big audience [for the book] were it not for the internet,” says Silverberg, explaining that Kickstarter gave him the freedom to share his message exactly how he wanted to, without modifying it to appease more traditional audiences. It also gave people who were eager to share Silverberg’s complicated, messy, and celebratory view of sexuality and gender with their kids an easy way to find him and promote his work to their friends.

Some adults might worry that exposing kids to information about sex, gender, and queer identity at a young age might be confusing or somehow harmful. Indeed, a search for “queer kid stuff” on YouTube surfaces a number of videos recorded by trolls that tear Amer down for teaching kids about topics like transitioning. But Alice Sterling Honig, professor emerita of child development at Syracuse University’s Falk College, sees a lot of positive benefits to exposing young children to thoughtful discussions of sexuality and gender identity at a young age.

“They need to know what their body is and not feel that it’s furtive or shameful to have an anus, to have a urethra, to have a penis,” Honig tells me, explaining that shutting down conversations is more likely to generate shame than keep kids safe.

When it comes to discussions of sexuality and gender, Honig sees additional benefits to content that encourages kids to be open-minded and embrace diversity. “We need to respect how different we all are,” she says. “If your child is being mercilessly hounded in school because he or she is different, wouldn’t you like to know that your child feels more comfortable and at ease with her body feelings and more accepted among her peers?”

Going online is an instant fix when it comes to youth sex education. “The internet isn’t the answer to everything, and it isn’t this great equalizing space,” says Silverberg, pointing out that there are still gatekeepers online who amplify the voices of the mainstream over their more “out there” or marginalized peers. And projects that have institutional support, like Amaze.org, will always get more attention online than scrappy upstarts.

But there’s no question that the internet is helping to prove that there’s an audience for kids’ media that offers age-appropriate takes on supposedly “adult” topics like queerness, gender identity, consent, and other discussions that help lay the foundation for a healthy attitude toward sex, bodies, and relationships.

There’s also no question that these efforts are helping shift youth sex education offline as well. In the wake of his successful Kickstarter, Silverberg was approached by publishers and ultimately signed a four-book deal with Seven Stories Press, the publisher behind works like Noam Chomsky’s *9-11 *and the annual world report from Human Rights Watch. Amer, too, has been able to break into spaces that once turned them away: Thanks to the popularity of their YouTube channel, they’ve found their way into educational spaces that once considered their work too edgy, booking live performances at libraries, museums, and schools.

Of course, with notoriety comes backlash. “The very first video I did got some press and immediately got picked up by a neo-Nazi publication,” Amer tells me, noting that that attention has generated a lot of bullying from the anti-feminist and alt-right contingent.

Clearly there are major problems with YouTube and other platforms that serve content to young people: The very idea that a kid looking for *Queer Kid Stuff* could instead stumble onto a rant about Amer’s episode on drag queens proves the point. But it’s clear that by giving diverse voices a way to be heard and find an audience, the internet has helped prove that there’s an appetite for comprehensive, inclusive sex education even for the youngest of audiences. It has helped ensure that the next generation will grow up less confused and more open-minded about topics that far too many of us have been raised to think of as taboo.<|endoftext|>

# Who Owns Your Health Data?

## Companies are denying people access to their own data as security risks run rampant

Today, much of our lives — and our health — is observed digitally. We discuss what’s for dinner with our families and our dieting apps. Athletes work to improve performance based on the personal metrics on their watch. Mothers watch their babies grow both in the flesh and on their screens. People with diabetes can go about their day at ease, having precise knowledge of their blood sugar levels. And some people have even reported [developing new senses](&lt;|url|&gt;) from meticulously tracking their health.

We now have mobile health devices that are very attuned to our bodies, capable of detecting the subtle changes in our heart rate and sleep cycle. These devices offer us a new avenue to view our health on a daily basis, yet strict corporate data policies often stand in the way of our ability to make use of our data in the context of our own health.

Many people will use a device or download an app looking to address a specific health problem or develop a good habit. But in practice, users struggle to see what their data could mean for their health beyond post-workout reports and heart rate graphs. People with chronic conditions might want to use their devices to help track long-term changes in their condition but are forced to dig deeper to understand how to tailor an off-the-shelf tracking device so it can monitor their particular situation.
> # When companies deny people access to their own data, they’re likely to rebel.

Hugo Campos, a heart patient, wanted to understand how everyday activities affected his heart and saw that he could use the data from his implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to inform his lifestyle decisions. He needed online access to his heart data, which his ICD didn’t display for him. When Campos made the request, however, the device’s manufacturer denied access, deeming him to be an illegitimate user of that data — his data. “A built-in computer running proprietary software monitors my every heartbeat,” Campos [said](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a 2015 piece for *Slate*. “But the data it records via sensors in my heart is entirely beyond my reach. It is wirelessly transmitted to a monitor set up in my bedroom and sent via telephone lines to the manufacturer’s data warehouse, bypassing me altogether.”

If you take your blood pressure at the doctor’s office, the results are protected by HIPAA rules. Take your blood pressure with a personal health monitor, however, and that information will be sent back to the device’s manufacturer. The data collected by consumer health devices will most likely become the company’s property, making the information less accessible to the people who have generated it.

Companies can get away with claiming the data is theirs because consumer health data lacks the protections of patients’ data in clinical settings. And while many of these companies might see the potential in adapting their data products to consumers’ needs, social scientists Gina Neff and Dawn Nafus [point out](&lt;|url|&gt;) that their “business processes sanitize and genericize, making [them] unable to appreciate just how much self-tracking data could matter to people.” Companies just aren’t in the business of understanding the value of data for users, even though this is how they present their data products.

And this fact doesn’t sit well with people like Campos who believe they could benefit from interpreting their personal health data. When companies deny people access to their own data, they are likely to rebel. To get around the manufacturer’s strict data policy, Campos bought a pacemaker programmer and took a two-week course to learn about heart rhythms so he could siphon the data from his device and interpret it for himself.

Some people will also want to add functionalities to their devices that can enhance their quality of life. This might also require data access. [Dana Lewis](&lt;|url|&gt;), who has Type 1 diabetes, saw that she could use her blood glucose readings to build an algorithm that could automatically administer her insulin — an artificial pancreas. She used an older model of her continuous glucose monitor to get around data policies. Parents whose children have Type 1 diabetes have also [hacked](&lt;|url|&gt;) their devices so they can monitor their children’s health remotely, allowing their kids to go to school without needing constant supervision.

Hacking your own device, however, comes at a cost. Many users buy parts overseas to hack their devices. Others have gotten around restrictive data policies by using older models of their health monitors to get access to their data. When users take control of their devices, they run the risk of introducing insecurities to their devices that hackers could use to gain access.
> # “If a pacemaker for a patient gets hacked, you can’t take that back.”

Cybersecurity researchers recognize the potential for hackers to cause harm to patients through their devices. Although to date there have been no documented cases of hackers hijacking personal medical devices, it is possible. Billy Rios and Jonathan Butts, both security researchers, [demonstrated last year](&lt;|url|&gt;) how they were able to hack a Medtronic pacemaker and insulin pump. They remotely reprogrammed a pacemaker such that it could disrupt a patient’s heart rhythms and showed how a wireless signal can be sent to an insulin pump to deliver an inadequate amount of insulin to a patient. “If a pacemaker for a patient gets hacked,” Rios warned, “you can’t take that back.”

While some users can put themselves at risk of outside attacks, all users are still at risk as the data from their devices isn’t fully secured. Companies are offering their services in exchange for personal information, participating in what Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff calls [surveillance capitalism](&lt;|url|&gt;). This means companies can profit from stockpiling as much data as they can. Their devices are broadcasting data back to their headquarters for them to stockpile, bypassing the people who have generated it. And to collect this data, the companies have to maintain security loopholes. “As long as companies are free to gather as much data about us as they possibly can,” security expert [Bruce Schneier](&lt;|url|&gt;) says, “they will not sufficiently secure our systems. As long as they can buy, sell, trade, and store that data, it’s at risk of being stolen. As long as they use it, we risk it being used against us.”

Currently, there is no omnibus privacy legislation in the United States to prevent third parties like insurance companies, employers, and credit card companies from discriminating against people whose data they gain access to. Legal scholar Frank Pasquale [retells](&lt;|url|&gt;) the case of Walter and Paula Shelton, who were denied health insurance based on Paula’s prescription history. Some employers have invested in corporate wellness programs to encourage healthier lifestyles among their employees and to reduce health insurance premiums. However, employees who don’t meet their employer’s ideal health metrics can face additional costs. The tire company Michelin has set health standards for factors such as blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and waist size. Employees who didn’t reach the targets [could lose out on an annual $1,000 deductible credit](&lt;|url|&gt;) toward their health insurance. Similarly, CVS required employees to disclose information about their body fat, blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol or pay $600 a year. These cases of data discrimination raise further concerns about how our health is being surveilled today.

Many people already struggle to figure out how to make their data work as it is, much less reconcile secondary issues of security and discrimination. Companies have been intentionally ambiguous about use cases for their devices to make them appeal to a wide consumer base. This means they’re leaving the guesswork to users to “make it work” for their lives. Even if some people can make it work, revealing our health information through our devices has continuing consequences for us in this industry built on exploiting our data.<|endoftext|>

# The Party Drug That Could Help Stop Depression

## The anesthetic ketamine receives official FDA approval to treat depression. Is the tradeoff worth it?

![Credit: Florian Gaertner/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: Florian Gaertner/Getty Images Plus*

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 5 approved a form of ketamine to be prescribed for treatment-resistant depression. The drug, called esketamine, is administered as a nasal spray and is the first version of ketamine to be cleared to treat depression. It’s also the [first new type of antidepressant drug](&lt;|url|&gt;) since Prozac was released over 30 years ago. Many psychiatrists and pharmacists see the ruling as a win for desperate patients with few options, but others have raised concerns about the drug’s possibly serious side effects and have questioned its efficacy.

“On the whole, I think they made the right choice,” says Richard Friedman, a professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College who was not involved in the decision. “This is a group of people who are really ill and for whom there are limited therapeutics. There’s no question ketamine has antidepressant efficacy, and it’s a new target.”

Esketamine will be sold under the brand name Spravato and is made by Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. “Because of safety concerns, the drug will only be available through a restricted distribution system and it must be administered in a certified medical office where the health care provider can monitor the patient,” said Dr. Tiffany Farchione, acting director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research [in a statement](&lt;|url|&gt;).

The FDA said that people who take the drug must be monitored by a health care provider for at least two hours after receiving it. Patients cannot take the spray home.

An estimated 30 to 40 percent of people with depression fail to respond to traditional antidepressant drugs like Prozac (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or SSRI) and Cymbalta (a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor or SNRI), classifying them as “treatment resistant.” These patients have few alternative options, as all current antidepressants act on the same three neurochemicals: serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Ketamine, by contrast, acts on an entirely different pathway: the glutamate system, which is the brain’s primary excitatory neurochemical and is involved in learning.

Scientists aren’t exactly sure how ketamine acts as an antidepressant, but it may do so by increasing the number of connections, or synapses, between cells in the brain, particularly in the prefrontal cortex. Stress and depression degrade these connections, and ketamine could reverse the damage, regrowing the lost synapses. “It’s like fertilizer in the brain,” says Friedman.

**“**There’s no question ketamine has antidepressant efficacy, and it’s a new target.”

The [first study of ketamine as an antidepressant](&lt;|url|&gt;) was published in 2000, with a single dose of the drug dramatically improving depression symptoms in a majority of people. A rush of clinical trials followed, in addition to the opening of ketamine clinics where doctors provide people with the drug off-label. [On an anecdotal basis](&lt;|url|&gt;), the drug has proven remarkable, with suicidal people reporting that the drug saved their lives.

Researchers, though, are much more measured. “I think any hope that this is a new wonder drug should be tamped down,” says Steven Meisel, director of medication safety at Fairview Health Services and a member of the FDA advisory committee that initially recommended ketamine. “This is a drug that will benefit a minority of people greatly, and a majority of people not at all. For those it does help, it could be dramatic, but it’s going to be a minority.”

In its review, the FDA evaluated esketamine based on five clinical trials presented by Janssen. However, only two of the studies showed significant positive results compared to a placebo. In one, roughly 53 percent of people who used esketamine twice a week for a month had a significant improvement in their depression scores, compared with 39 percent of people who took a placebo. The other study showed that people who initially responded to esketamine relapsed when they were switched to a placebo, whereas people who remained on the drug did not.

Many health professionals are concerned about ketamine’s notable side effects, particularly the ones that gained it notoriety as a party drug. Ketamine was first developed as an [anesthetic in the 1960s](&lt;|url|&gt;). By the 1990s, ketamine had become a popular club drug for its dissociative qualities. At high doses, people are so sedated they become out of touch with their surroundings, feel unable to speak or move, and can start to hallucinate — an experience often referred to as a “k-hole.” But if you’re not looking to get high, these psychoactive effects might be off-putting.

“This drug is known as a pretty nasty drug,” says Meisel. “One of the well-known side effects is what’s called dissociation, which means that you don’t feel a part of your body anymore, you feel like you’re in a different place. And that could be very troublesome for some folks.”

Other side effects include long-term changes in blood pressure and bladder problems. Ketamine also activates the opioid system in the brain, which has led many researchers and clinicians to worry about the drug’s potential for abuse.

Because of these concerns, as well as its side effects, the FDA committee recommended a strict risk mitigation plan for the drug. Ketamine will only be available at specialty pharmacies, clinics, and doctor’s offices, and it has to be administered on-site. The patient must wait for a minimum of two hours for the drug’s psychoactive effects to wear off before they can go home.

The FDA hopes the plan will help prevent ketamine from being abused by patients or diverted into the community for recreational use on the black market. But the need to visit a clinic for several hours every week will likely be a burden for many people and could limit access for people who live in more rural areas.

While the risk for side effects and abuse is not insubstantial, Meisel, Friedman, and the FDA believe the benefits outweigh them. People with treatment-resistant depression are 15 times more likely to attempt suicide than people without depression, so a new effective form of treatment could be a literal lifesaver. “The risk is there. On the other hand, the risk of untreated treatment-resistant depression is far greater. I mean, the risk of suicide is orders of magnitude higher in those people,” says Friedman. “So you’re balancing the risk and the benefit. The risk of the drug is real, but the risk of the untreated disease is far greater.”<|endoftext|>

# Your Dirty AirPods Are Grosser Than You Think

## Your Dirty AirPods Are Grosser Than You Think

### Here’s what lives on your grimy earbuds — and how to clean them

![Illustration by [Julian Glander](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration by [Julian Glander](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Take a good look at your earbuds. Is the mesh clogged with earwax? Is there a strip of dirt or lint lining the plastic seams? Maybe there’s even an oddly intense and dark dust clinging to the interior edges of your AirPods case.

If your earbuds are disgusting, know this first: no shame. This is an obscenely common issue, an element of high-tech hygiene that is, oddly, overlooked, given how ubiquitous buds have become since the introduction of the iPod in 2001. But these little hunks of plastic, mesh, and rubber collect particles of dust, lint, earwax, metal, dirt, and pollution, all of which is in turn infested with bacteria and even fungi, which we then insert into our ears, sometimes for hours at a time. You wouldn’t stick something so filthy up your nose, but somehow into the ear doesn’t seem quite as gross.
> # I received at least 50 images of people’s gunked-up earbuds, and while I have no intention to shame anyone, I have to admit that some of the pictures were alarming.

How dangerous is all that crap on your earbuds? The answer is complicated, but at the very least, you’re unlikely to get ill from the months-old gunk left to build on the plastic and mesh. But there are certain circumstances in which you could be at some risk, so while there’s no need to panic — or, God forbid, remove the buds from your ears, which might mean you have to talk to someone — it’s never too late to start a healthy earbud-cleaning regimen.

It’s obvious a lot of us could benefit from such direction. I received at least 50 images this week of people’s gunked-up earbuds, and while I have truly no intention to shame anyone, I have to admit that some of the pictures were alarming.

![[*Image courtesy of Austin Flack](&lt;|url|&gt;)*](<|image|>)*[*Image courtesy of Austin Flack](&lt;|url|&gt;)**

One woman’s third-grader brought home his earbuds looking like this:

![[*Image courtesy of Sarah Ewy](&lt;|url|&gt;)*](<|image|>)*[*Image courtesy of Sarah Ewy](&lt;|url|&gt;)**

And, of course, there were plenty of photos of earwax left to collect on the amplifier mesh and surrounding plastic.

![*Image courtesy of anonymous*](<|image|>)**Image courtesy of anonymous**

Most of the people I talked to never cleaned their earbuds—or only occasionally did, using items lying around, such as pens or tissues. And while the above images are on the more intense end of the scale, most of them looked a bit like Tori’s (last name withheld for privacy), who says she typically uses a staple or paper clip, along with a Clorox wipe, to clean them when it occurs to her. Even still, she says, it isn’t enough. “Are you going to help keep this from happening? I don’t want to live like this,” Tori says. “Please send help.”

![*Image courtesy of Tori*](<|image|>)**Image courtesy of Tori**

While the wax and dust buildup in the above images isn’t deadly, it’s also not totally harmless. “Bacteria such as *staph aureus* or *pseudomonas*, as well as fungus such as *aspergillus*, can cause outer ear infections if these germs are on the earbud and then the earbud is placed into the ear,” says Erich Voigt, an otolaryngologist at New York University Langone Health. [Swimmer’s ear](&lt;|url|&gt;), which, contrary to its name, does not only afflict swimmers, is one such infection that can be caused by earbud use. It occurs when broken or inflamed skin in the ear comes into contact with [bacteria](&lt;|url|&gt;) or fungus — and if you rarely clean your earbuds, there’s a chance such bacteria could be present on its surface, particularly the more porous areas like the mesh or the rubber tip.

Sarah Mowry, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, says that people with skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis should exercise a little more caution when it comes to earbud use. That’s because those disorders can irritate the ear’s thin, delicate skin, making it more prone to infection caused by bacteria or fungi found on an earbud. Mowry add that if you already have an ear infection, you should definitely lay off the earbud use until it’s been treated.
> # Luckily for all of us whose earbuds are in a foul state, if you’re not already at heightened risk of infections, you probably aren’t going to get sick from your nasty earbud.

Voigt notes that diabetics and those with immune deficiency should also be more careful with their earbuds, but even if your ears aren’t in bad health, using earbuds can push earwax farther down into the ear canal. This can cause (temporary) hearing problems, and the impacted wax will need to be professionally removed. Sticking a cotton swab in your ear [isn’t a great method](&lt;|url|&gt;) for avoiding this, either, according to Voigt, who says that overusing Q-tips and removing the protective wax can leave you more prone to infection.

Luckily for all of us whose earbuds are in a foul state, however, if you’re not already at heightened risk of infections, you probably aren’t going to get sick from your nasty earbud. Mowry says she has rarely seen patients come in with ear infections caused by earbud use. But studies directly on the earbud–ear infection relationship are sorely lacking. I was able to find just one, [from 2008](&lt;|url|&gt;), which found bacterial growth on 68% of subjects’ earbuds. So, yes, it appears that the hazards posed by dropping your earbud on the bathroom floor only to put it back in are low but present, though it’s hard to say for sure.

Like leaving a sink full of used dishes or piling your dirty clothes in a big heap on the floor, while the health risks of nasty earbuds are minor, keeping them clean is nevertheless common courtesy — if only to yourself. But unlike laundry, which has a clear directive for cleanliness — clean clothes in drawer, dirty clothes in hamper — it isn’t especially obvious how to clean earbuds.

[Apple recommends](&lt;|url|&gt;) using a “dry, lint-free cloth” to clean AirPods and a Q-tip to clean out the wire mesh, although in my experience that isn’t a particularly great method for removing the wax. Several people on Twitter told me that [sucking the gunk](&lt;|url|&gt;) out of AirPods with their mouths is an effective method of clearing them out, which is so absolutely disgusting that I refuse to try. I will look at pictures of waxy AirPods all day long, but I won’t do that. Still, it comes highly recommended, so go with God.

More reasonable are the suggestions to use a brush to gently scrub at the mesh to loosen the wax from the surface. The [OXO Electronics Cleaning Brush](&lt;|url|&gt;) has a brush on one end and a silicone sponge on the other, although the brush is soft and might not be ideal for more stubborn bits of wax; a medium- or firm-bristled toothbrush would work even better. Kyle Wiens, founder of tech repair site [iFixit](&lt;|url|&gt;), recommends scrubbing the AirPods with a sponge. For even more thorough cleaning, lightly spritz the brush or sponge with alcohol or vinegar, but don’t get it too wet, as Apple’s AirPods aren’t waterproof. If you have earbuds with a removable rubber tip, you can wash the tip with soap and water and gently rub the inner speaker with a cleaning brush or toothbrush. Make sure the rubber tip is totally dry before returning it to the earbud.

[Blu-Tack](&lt;|url|&gt;), the slightly sticky wall adhesive popular in elementary school art shows, is a Reddit favorite for cleaning earbuds. Soften it up a bit between your hands and gently press it to the earbud mesh. The wax should lift right out. Be careful with this method, though, since pushing the putty too firmly against the metal mesh can potentially [push the wax](&lt;|url|&gt;) farther into the bud.

A Q-tip lightly sprayed with alcohol will work at removing dust and lint from the case, but you can also get [colorful dust guards](&lt;|url|&gt;) that will help prevent buildup. An [exterior case](&lt;|url|&gt;) can also help prevent the staining that can occur when dye on denim or leather transfers to the plastic.

All this said, there’s no really perfect way to clean earbuds, especially those with the exterior mesh like AirPods. Eventually, a small amount of wax will build up in the mesh, dampening the sound and making them look vaguely sticky. (Although chances are that by then you’ll have already lost them.) But with diligence, care, and the right tools, you can ensure that your earbuds are cleaner than those of your friends — and less likely to give you swimmer’s ear.<|endoftext|>

# Apple Stands to Revolutionize Period Tracking — If It Doesn’t Mess Up

## A lot is riding on how much the company is willing to share with the public

![](<|image|>)

Dr. Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple, was met with cheers on Monday during the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference when she announced the tech giant had created a service specifically for monitoring menstrual cycles.

“This one is for you,” Desai said, addressing the women in the crowd. “Cycle Tracking.”

“Knowing more about your menstrual cycle gives you a window into your health, from simply ensuring you’re prepared to understanding your personal patterns and regularities,” she added.

For now, the service is available only to developers, but it’s scheduled for a full consumer release with [watchOS 6](&lt;|url|&gt;) this fall. Apple Watch and Apple Health app users will then have the option of inputting data about their menstrual cycle history, such as the date of their last period, length of cycle, and symptoms. The service will use this information to make period cycle and “fertile window” predictions for the user.
> # “We have very limited information about how Apple intends to proceed.”

Those cycle predictions will alert women when their period is about to start. Fertile window predictions will tell women, based on their health data, which six days in a month they’re most likely to be fertile. ([A footnote](&lt;|url|&gt;) in Apple’s watchOS 6 press release notes “fertile window predictions” — otherwise known as the rhythm method — “should not be used as a form of birth control.”)

“We are so excited to bring more focus to this incredibly important aspect of women’s health,” Desai said at WWDC.

But not everyone is sold on Apple’s entry into reproductive health.

“We have very limited information about how Apple intends to proceed,” says Chelsea Polis, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research group that focuses on reproductive health. Polis notes it’s difficult to understand how accurate Apple’s Cycle Tracking app is without understanding the algorithm the tech company is using to predict upcoming periods and fertile windows.

“This could be the beginning of a disaster or an opportunity to lead, by ensuring appropriate testing, communication, and education of the public regarding how to appropriately use this technology,” Polis says.

It remains to be seen how transparent Apple will be about the workings of its prediction algorithm. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, although it provided some background information about the cycle tracking service.

Polis, who describes fertility as “a field that has a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation and confusion,” says she’s concerned about Cycle Tracking’s fertile window feature. She points to the do-not-use-as-birth-control footnote on the press release as an opportunity for Apple to be more transparent.

“I’d prefer it to be in flashing lights,” Polis says of the birth control footnote. And while some menstrual tracking apps are intended to prevent pregnancy, vague and misleading recommendations about how women are supposed to use their period tracking apps has been a problem among Cycle Tracking’s existing competitors.

![*Cycle Tracking on the Apple Watch*](<|image|>)**Cycle Tracking on the Apple Watch**

“Generally speaking, there are a number of other apps and devices walking in this very gray, fuzzy area of not being clear what the device is approved for use for,” Polis says. This gray area can be dangerous when it comes to health apps in particular. In the case of a period tracking service, a woman could try to use it as birth control and put herself at risk for unintended pregnancy.

Other app companies have run afoul of reproductive health experts for their misleading marketing practices. Daysy, a $330 thermometer and accompanying period tracking app, which is manufactured by the Swiss Company Valley Electronics, [claimed it could predict a woman’s fertile window](&lt;|url|&gt;) with 99.4% accuracy, according to a study published in the journal *Reproductive Health* in 2018. Last month, however, the journal retracted the study and issued a [statement](&lt;|url|&gt;) explaining “fundamental flaws in the methodology” meant “the conclusions are unreliable.”
> # It’s impossible to say whether it will improve, or threaten, women’s reproductive health.

“I worked for an entire year to get a company to clean up its act,” says Polis, who spearheaded the pushback against Daysy’s marketing. Still, the damage was done. The device was already sold around the world, including on Amazon.

Without information about how Apple plans to market Cycle Tracking, it’s impossible to say whether it will improve, or threaten, women’s reproductive health.

Onstage at the Worldwide Developers Conference, Desai called attention to the scope of Apple’s reach. “Because we wanted to make this available to hundreds of millions of women around the world, cycle tracking is also available without a watch in the Health app in iOS,” she said.

With those hundreds of millions of existing customers, Apple is positioned to change the way women understand their menstrual cycles. Of course, this also means the company has the responsibility to avoid widespread confusion stemming from the information it provides. Here’s to hoping they take that responsibility more seriously than their predecessors.

# Dark Mode Isn’t the Answer to Our Screen Problems

## Dark Mode Isn’t the Answer to Our Screen Problems

### *Research suggests the feature is overhyped as an accessibility tool*

![Photo: Andrew Brookes/Cultura/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Andrew Brookes/Cultura/Getty*

The night is overtaking our computer screens.

It’s coming in the form of dark mode, a trendy feature in the tech industry in which the standard bright backgrounds are substituted with a muted navy or black. Twitter [launched](&lt;|url|&gt;) its dark mode for web in 2017, while Facebook Messenger [introduced](&lt;|url|&gt;) a dark mode feature in April of this year. Most notably at WWDC last week, Apple announced it will include a dark mode option in iOS 13, which launches this fall. Apple [claims](&lt;|url|&gt;) that dark mode will “make every element on the screen easier on your eyes,” while some users assert that dark mode is better for people with people with [migraines](&lt;|url|&gt;).

But there’s little data to show that dark mode is actually easier on the eyes for most people. Even for users with vision impairments, dark mode isn’t necessarily better than other accessibility options that have been available for years, though there is little research on the subject overall.

One thing is certain: in most daily settings and for most people, dark mode will do nothing to increase productivity or ease eye fatigue. It’s likely nothing more than another aesthetic option — not a life-changing accessibility tool or productivity-enhancer.

In fact, for most people, dark modes will decrease readability and productivity. [A 2003 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) looked at how users’ task comprehension was affected by different screen display conditions, including negative polarity (light text on a black background) and positive polarity (black text on a white background). It found that test subjects had an easier time completing tasks when the screens were in a positive polarity mode.
> # Dark mode is likely nothing more than a reasonable aesthetic option — not a life-changing accessibility tool or productivity-enhancer.

Another [study](&lt;|url|&gt;), from 2013, looked at the impact of positive and negative polarity on both young and elderly subjects, since an older person’s worsening eyesight could theoretically determine how they’re affected by screen brightness and contrast. The study found that both populations performed better when screens were in a light mode.

Though black text on a white background may technically be the most efficient way to use a screen, dark mode devotees do have one point: the feature may be genuinely useful at night.

That’s because, like looking at a light bulb in a dark space, or attempting to see down a dim hallway from a brightly lit room, if a phone screen is significantly [brighter](&lt;|url|&gt;) or darker than the surrounding area, the eye will have trouble adjusting. Anyone who’s ever had to squint at their phone screen when checking it before dawn or attempted to view a dark television image in a bright room will be familiar with the experience. This type of situation, according to the [Mayo Clinic](&lt;|url|&gt;), can lead to eye strain, with symptoms including eye dryness, fatigue, and headache. In the long run though, it likely won’t lead to lasting damage.

Many smartphone models and computers now come equipped with ambient light sensors, which adjust the brightness of a screen relative to the light of the room you’re in. But for those who are particularly sensitive to light, or simply dislike the warm tone of Apple’s night mode, dark mode features may be a welcome addition.

“Dark mode can be very helpful for people who have sensitivity to brightness, because it reduces the overall intensity of the screen,” says Lauren Milne, an assistant professor of computer science at Macalester College whose research focuses on accessibility issues. “Many people with low vision, especially people with tunnel vision, prefer white text on a black background as they find it easier to distinguish the words.” For years, operating systems have allowed for color inversion, in which dark screen colors are made light and vice versa, but such settings can have an unsettling Andy Warhol-esque effect that may not always be welcome or aesthetically pleasing.

But according to Syed Billah, a PhD candidate in computer science at Stony Brook University, dark mode may not be as effective for low-vision users as the more traditional color inversion. In his research on accessible technology for people with vision impairments, he found that users with certain conditions, like glaucoma, preferred large text in high-contrast modes. In these modes, text appears as yellow, white, or green on a black background. “This is quite different than Mac’s dark mode,” he says. “Dark mode uses different shades of gray, boundaries [and] edges are not very prominent [or] discernible in dark mode, and it doesn’t work for the non-Mac applications very well.”

So while Twitter’s dark mode, for example, may be attractive to people with normal vision, with its navy blue background and white or grey text, it may not work as an accessibility feature for people who genuinely need it. That isn’t to say that dark mode is harmful — just that it won’t make screens any easier to see for people with vision impairments.

Remember, though, that there isn’t a lot of research on modern dark mode interfaces that extends beyond their impact on readability for users with normal vision. Conceivably, well-executed dark modes could improve the experiences of people with photophobia (light sensitivity) or other vision impairments. But because there’s such a dearth of information on the topic, it’s difficult to know to what extent it could help, or what the best implementation of dark mode would be.

“I really wish there were more good, up-to-date studies on the light-on-dark versus dark-on-light issue,” says Silas Brown, a partially-sighted computer scientist at Cambridge University. People with brain conditions that can affect visual processing, such as dyslexia, migraines, and autism, can have sensitivity to light and certain color combinations, but “all of these brain conditions are poorly understood, and each one is really an umbrella term for a whole range of sub-conditions, so we certainly can’t say display settings help in every case.”

Still, Brown and Milne both say that multiple options are better than none, and some people may find that dark mode will help them have better experiences with their screens. “I am always happy when a [developer] officially adds options like dark mode,” says Brown. “It enables individual users to find out for themselves if it makes a difference in their particular case or not.”

It’s great that Apple and others are offering the option to use dark mode, though it isn’t necessarily the best way to look at your screen in bright ambient lighting. But because many of us look at our screens all day every day — and often at night — we need more research about the healthiest ways for those screens to work. Right now, there are a lot of gaps. This is especially true for people with low vision, people who get migraines, and those with other visual impairments. Dark mode may be a cute update for now, but there’s potential for something much better — if companies ever decide to make this kind of accessibility a genuine priority.<|endoftext|>

# The Artificial Womb Moves Forward

## Researchers successfully nurture extremely preterm lamb fetuses outside a natural womb

If you live for about 80 years, your nine months in the womb will represent less than 1% of your time on Earth. But those nine months represent a crucial period for growth and development.

Sometimes, though, babies are born before they get those nine full months in utero. And while the accepted protocol is to place premature infants in an artificial incubator — protecting the baby from infection and maintaining temperature and humidity — soon there may be better options.

Researchers at the University of Western Australia and Tohoku University Hospital are testing artificial wombs: plastic bags filled with synthetic amniotic fluid and connections for placenta-based life support. The team recently revealed in the [*American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology](&lt;|url|&gt;)* that they have successfully sustained premature lamb fetuses using their artificial wombs.

“We have proven the use of this technology to support, for the first time, extremely preterm lambs… in a stable, growth-normal state for five days,” said senior author Matthew Kemp in a statement from [Tohoku University Hospital](&lt;|url|&gt;).

This research may help treat preterm human babies in the near future. According to the [*Lancet](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, nearly 15 million babies around the world were born preterm in 2014. Preterm or premature babies are not simply undersize or underweight—they are underdeveloped in very important ways. Often, their lungs are too small and their hearts not strong enough to function properly. This is especially true if a premature human baby is born at 28 weeks or earlier, which makes them extremely preterm. At this point, they still need gas and nutrient exchange through the placenta in order to grow, which means it’s hard for them to live on their own.

Making an artificial womb function like a natural womb isn’t easy. Not only do the fetuses need to be safe, but they also need life support and the right combinations of nutrients so they don’t develop infections or brain injury. The goal is also to promote the same growth and cardiovascular function that develops in a natural womb.
> # Existing artificial incubators are already emotionally difficult to deal with for parents. Infants in bags of fluid may be even harder to accept.

Kemp’s group was able to support and promote growth and development in extremely preterm lamb fetuses inside an artificial womb for 120 hours, or about five days. The lamb fetuses didn’t show any signs of infection, inflammation, or brain injury.

A different research group, based at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, published results of a similar experiment in [*Nature Communications](&lt;|url|&gt;)* in 2017, in which they supported lamb fetuses in artificial wombs for up to four weeks. The team demonstrated successful life support for lamb fetuses that were 105 days old.

Kemp’s group also tested their artificial womb on lamb fetuses that were 95 days old, the youngest fetuses so far. That’s equivalent in size and weight to a 24-week-old human fetus. Starting with a lamb fetus in an artificial womb 10 days earlier than previous experiments means the fetus is developmentally that much more premature—and that could make survival much more difficult. For an experiment that lasted only five days, it’s unclear how long this system could successfully support a lamb or a human fetus and if it can ultimately increase survival.

Experts are concerned about how this kind of research will translate to actual practice. Claire Roberts of the University of Adelaide reviewed the *Nature Communications* paper and wrote a commentary in [*Nature](&lt;|url|&gt;)* warning that although lambs may not show brain injury, human brains develop differently. Roberts also made the point that existing artificial incubators are already emotionally difficult to deal with for parents. Infants in bags of fluid may be even harder to accept.

Others have commented on the [potential ethical questions around abortion](&lt;|url|&gt;), asking whether this kind of work could affect abortion policies. If this research progresses to the point where human fetuses even younger than 24 weeks can be supported in artificial wombs, that may change when a fetus is considered viable, which in turn could affect the cutoff point for the fetus age when abortion is legally acceptable. State laws vary in the United States, but many prohibit abortion after 20 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.

But the goal of this field of research has never been to completely replace a natural womb. It aims to create a space outside the natural womb where preterm babies can continue to grow and develop safely until they can survive in the outside world. And though the research is progressing, an artificial womb for human use won’t be usable anytime soon.

“Based on data presently publicly available, there are many years of work remaining before it will be possible to justify using technology of this nature in the clinic,” Kemp says.<|endoftext|>

# Facebook’s Video Player Isn’t Designed for You

## The social network prioritizes “engagement” over enjoyment in video — hurting publishers and users alike

![Credit: NurPhoto / Contributor/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: NurPhoto / Contributor/Getty Images Plus*

From the outside, it’s hard to know what, exactly, Facebook wants from its video platform. For years, the company told publishers that [video was the future](&lt;|url|&gt;), even as it allegedly [goosed statistics behind the scenes](&lt;|url|&gt;) to make the format look more important than it was. In 2017, the social network rolled out a [major update](&lt;|url|&gt;) to its video player that added a kind of picture-in-picture mode to the News Feed, among other changes, in an effort to make “watching video on Facebook richer, more engaging and more flexible,” according to the company. Then last year, [Mark Zuckerberg announced](&lt;|url|&gt;) the company would de-prioritize video from brands in favor of content that “encourage[s] meaningful interactions.”

The message seemed clear: Time spent watching video doesn’t matter to Facebook if people don’t also like, comment, and share those videos. In that statement, Zuckerberg referenced “connecting” or “interacting” with people [nine times](&lt;|url|&gt;) while disparaging what he called “passive” viewing twice. His model offers a curious contrast to most video platforms, which have been passive by nature since the Lumière brothers [put on](&lt;|url|&gt;) the first public screening of motion pictures in 1895. When you go to a movie theater, there’s nothing to engage with but the screen in front of you. (Keep that phone in your pocket, please.)

Netflix has tried [and failed](&lt;|url|&gt;) to become more social, and its video player is still a sit-back experience, [*Bandersnatch* notwithstanding](&lt;|url|&gt;). Even YouTube, notorious for its [unruly comment sections](&lt;|url|&gt;), keeps most of its social features below the fold.

So how can Facebook encourage “meaningful interaction” with content that seems meant to be viewed passively? The design of its video player offers a clue. Where most video platforms make the ritual of “[Like, Share, and Subscribe](&lt;|url|&gt;)” an optional step after you view a video, Facebook’s video player guides users to engage first.

Consider this scenario: You’re scrolling through Facebook on your computer and find a video your friend has shared. You click on the video to start playing it. After watching a bit, you need to pause for a second. How would you do it? In players like Netflix, YouTube, and Vimeo, you can click anywhere on the video to pause. Facebook takes a different approach. Click on the video in your Facebook feed, and this will happen:

![](<|image|>)

The video enlarges and redirects to a page with a large “How People Reacted” section on the right side in addition to the usual comment section below. Prominent “Like,” “Comment,” and “Share” buttons appear directly below the video along with a tally of how many people have interacted with it.

This new section leads to the original source of the video: If your friend shared a clip from [LADbible](&lt;|url|&gt;)’s page, for example, tapping the video brings you to that publication’s original post. You’re no longer in a feed populated by your Facebook friends but on a comments page filled with strangers. It’s hard to describe this as “meaningful,” to draw on Zuckerberg’s favorite word, but it is certainly an “interaction.”

A similar thing happens if you attempt to full-screen a video from your feed. While most video players have a full-screen button — usually denoted with arrows or brackets indicating the corners of your screen — Facebook only has an “Enlarge” button with two arrows pointing to the corners. Click this, and you might expect the video to go full screen, but instead the same reaction occurs: You’ll be hit with a slightly larger video and much more prominent engagement buttons. Only then can you click another button to go truly full-screen, but Facebook doesn’t want you to forget that the option to engage is there — always.

Even if you scroll on from a video in the News Feed, it’s difficult to disengage. On other scrollable platforms like Twitter or Facebook’s own Instagram, you can click on a video to play it, but scroll onwards and the video will go away. Not so on Facebook.

Keep your eye on upper-right corner in the clip below:

![](<|image|>)

The video follows you as you scroll through your News Feed. And in the bottom right corner of that mini player are “Like” and “Share” buttons. These buttons take up more real estate inside the mini player than any other button (including the “X” in the top-right corner that dismisses the video).

It’s hard to say whether this video player has been intentionally designed to funnel as many people into engaging as possible or if it’s just a clumsy interface. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Whatever the case, the benefit to the company is clear. According to [the company’s most recent earnings call](&lt;|url|&gt;), per-user revenue was up nearly 20 percent compared to the previous year, [despite a scandal-filled 2018](&lt;|url|&gt;). Analysts credit, among other things, [Facebook’s strong engagement trends](&lt;|url|&gt;).

According [to a study from social media manager Hootsuite](&lt;|url|&gt;) in July 2018, videos on Facebook had a 6 percent engagement rate, which is a full 2 percent higher than the average rate for all other post types. Video was also the only post type to see an overall quarter-over-quarter increase in engagement.

The more users engage, the more valuable they become. If a subtle, slightly annoying tweak to a video player leads to more shares and comments, Facebook can make more money, even if the user experience is worse.

These changes leave Facebook video stuck, however, unable to fully please any of the groups that use it. Viewers can ignore video in their feed entirely, but if they accidentally tap a clip while they’re scrolling, they have to jump through hoops to perform basic functions like pausing or closing the video.

Many publishers have meanwhile stopped making Facebook video a priority since the platform’s algorithms have changed. [Advertisers have sued Facebook](&lt;|url|&gt;) for misleading statistics about how well its platform is performing (though [that hasn’t stopped them from spending](&lt;|url|&gt;)). No one is totally happy.

As Dan Olson, the YouTuber behind the media criticism channel [*Folding Ideas](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, explains, the experience has degraded for creators and users alike.

“I experimented with uploading video directly to Facebook and it was terrible,” Olson tells *OneZero*. “The interface is bad, the guidelines are bad, the metrics are bad (and, as we know now, [largely fabricated](&lt;|url|&gt;)). So, I wouldn’t use it because it’s an awful system with negligible returns.”

But for now, Facebook’s video player is the only viable option for sharing or watching video on the largest social platform in the world. It’s an obvious but serious point, given that [1.52 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) people reportedly log onto the site every day. Many of them will see videos in their News Feeds, and they will continue to feed the machine — however accidentally — that puts them there.<|endoftext|>

# Elon Musk Wants to Read Your Brain

## The tech entrepreneur’s startup Neuralink wants to implant a brain-computer interface in people as soon as next year

![Images: Neuralink](<|image|>)*Images: Neuralink*

Elon Musk says he wants to merge your brain with a computer. But by his own admission, the idea of allowing people to control their smartphone or connect directly to the internet with their thoughts is many years away. “It will take a long time,” Musk said at an event for his brain-computer interface startup Neuralink Tuesday night in San Francisco.

Nonetheless, Musk claimed that Neuralink could be ready to test its technology in human beings who are paralyzed as early as next year. In a much-hyped presentation that was half neuroscience conference, half Silicon Valley spectacle, the San Francisco-based company, which Musk has invested $100 million in, revealed that it has developed tiny, thread-like implants far thinner than a human hair that are capable of recording neuron activity.

A brain-computer interface is meant to provide a direct pathway of communication between the brain and an external device. These interfaces use electrodes to “read” brain signals, plus a computer that translates these signals into commands, which carry out a desired action on a computer program or device.

Eventually, Musk sees a future in which anyone could opt in to getting one of these interfaces and achieve what he calls a “symbiosis with artificial intelligence.” Musk envisions an elective brain surgery that would be minimally invasive and take just a few hours, similar to a modern LASIK procedure. With such an interface, he says people will “have the option of merging with A.I.” — an area of particular interest for Musk, who has warned about the existential threat that ever more powerful A.I. could eventually pose to humanity.
> # Neuralink says that eventually its interface will allow people with disabilities to speak, hear, and see.

But the first use of the company’s technology will be far more practical: to allow people with complete paralysis from spinal cord injuries to gain “naturalistic control” of a computer, according to Neuralink researcher Philip Sabes. In a question and answer session after the presentation, Musk said the goal is to allow people with quadriplegia — paralysis of the limbs and torso — the ability to type at 40 words per minute. Current brain-computer interfaces can allow such patients to type at about 10 words per minute. Neuralink says that eventually its interface will allow people with disabilities to speak, hear, and see.

Even for use in the most severely affected patients, marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is likely years away. The FDA has already approved deep brain stimulation, a type of implant that produces electrical pulses in the brain, to treat Parkinson’s and a few other conditions. But interfaces for direct control of devices are still only used for research purposes and are not commercially available.

Research on brain-computer interfaces began in the 1970s, and the first crude devices were implanted in humans in the 1990s. They’ve so far been used to restore a limited range of motion in severely paralyzed people, permitting them to control computer cursors or robotic arms directly with their thoughts. But right now, these devices have mostly been tested in research labs and are years away from being practical devices that people could use in their daily lives.

Current interfaces also involve invasive brain surgery, requiring neurosurgeons to drill through the skull to implant electrodes. And many interfaces for motor movement have used metal pedestals that connect the electrodes in the brain to a computer with a cable. External devices, like robotic limbs, also need to be connected to a computer.

![](<|image|>)

![](<|image|>)

Musk wants to get rid of all that clunkiness. He says the interface Neuralink is developing will be completely wireless (though his system wouldn’t be the first). A prototype of the company’s chip shows a small device, about the size of a hearing aid, that will sit behind the ear. Max Hodak, Neuralink’s president, said the whole interface will eventually be controlled by a smartphone app.

It’s unclear how much of what Neuralink is promising actually exists yet. What the company did reveal on Tuesday is that it has created arrays of small, flexible “threads” with thousands of electrodes on them. Current interfaces rely on rigid metal electrodes that are implanted in the brain. These electrodes can cause scar tissue to form in the brain, affecting their ability to record neural signals over time. By contrast, Neuralink’s polymer threads are about a tenth of the width of a human hair, according to Musk. The company claims these threads are 15 times better at reading information in the brain than current electrodes.

At Tuesday’s event, Musk also described a sewing machine-like robot that can precisely insert these flexible threads into the brain. The idea was first explained in a [March paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the preprint server bioRxiv by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco and the University of California, Berkeley. Two of those researchers, Sabes and Timothy Hanson, have since joined Neuralink.

While Musk focused on future use of the interface technology in human beings — and claims that the first human subjects could be part of a trial by the end of 2020 — the [white paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) the company released on Wednesday describes a small study in rats. In 19 surgeries, the robot was able to successfully place the threads 87% of the time in the rats’ brains. (Musk also said, almost in passing, that “a monkey has been able to control a computer with its brain,” but stopped short of providing details.)

There are drawbacks that come with using smaller electrodes. “The body is a harsh place. These materials can break down over time,” Vikash Gilja, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, San Diego who served on the technical team at Neuralink from July 2017 to June 2018, told *OneZero*. “If you shrink the materials down, they may be more susceptible to breakdown because you’re putting less of that material in or because you’re using a material that hasn’t been tested yet in those conditions.”

Assuming the company can develop an interface that can remain stable in the brain for years — few people would volunteer for annual brain surgery to maintain the machine — the success of Neuralink’s implant will come down to the data rate: how many neurons the interface can simultaneously record and stimulate.

“Having more data means that you can control a larger number of degrees of freedom,” said Matt Angle, CEO and founder of Paradromics, a company based in Austin, Texas, that’s also building high data rate brain-computer interfaces. In the case of prosthetics for conscious control of movement, a higher data rate would give a person more dexterity. In terms of communication, a bigger data rate would increase your typing speed. With a visual prosthesis, a higher data rate would translate to sharper resolution.

Neuralink says it has the ability to record from 1,000 neurons at once. Melody Jackson, a brain-computer interface researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology, told *OneZero* the technology is “completely feasible.” She said reading 100,000 neurons would be even better — the human brain has about 100 billion neurons — but the problem researchers have run into is how many holes to drill in the brain and where to place the electrodes.

One question she has for Musk’s team is how it plans to interpret these neural signals. Usually that relies on machine-learning techniques. “That’s the key,” Jackson said. “Getting the brain signal is not hard. When you have the brain signal, what does it mean? That’s the hard part.”
> # These devices won’t be connecting our brains to the internet anytime soon.

Other companies, like Kernel and CTRL-labs, are developing brain-computer interfaces that are non-invasive.

These devices won’t be connecting our brains to the internet anytime soon, but Angle can imagine a broader use in a few years for treating psychiatric diseases. “As these [implantable] devices are shown to be safe, it will become thinkable for larger and larger groups of patients to have them,” he says.

The first human tests of Neuralink’s device will still require traditional brain surgery, Musk said, but his grand vision is to be able to robotically implant these interfaces in a few hours in an outpatient facility. Angle says that scenario is likely 10 to 15 years off, which gives us a time frame to start thinking through not just the technical questions posed by Neuralink and Musk’s inventions, but the societal and ethical ones of connecting our brains — the organ that makes us human — to a computer.<|endoftext|>

# The Next Wellness Trend Should Be Google Spreadsheets

## The Next Wellness Trend Should Be Google Spreadsheets

### *How focused planning—and color-coded rows and columns—can make stress melt away*

![Image: Manuel Breva Colmeiro/Moment/Getty](<|image|>)*Image: Manuel Breva Colmeiro/Moment/Getty*

I’ll be honest: Modern life is too complicated for me. Anxiety can often lead to disorganization and confusion, and as a result, I have no idea what I’m doing half the time. But the other half works in large part thanks to a handful of Google spreadsheets.

I can thank a spreadsheet for my writing career, at least in part. It allows me to immediately see where I’ve pitched, what I’ve written, and who has paid me. A spreadsheet dedicated to trip planning is the primary reason I’m confidently going on my first vacation as an adult in May. Another spreadsheet is devoted to overall health: It’s where I track how many servings of vegetables I’ve eaten that day, how many alcoholic beverages I’ve had in a week, and how often I’ve worked out. It keeps me accountable to myself.

But here’s the most surprising thing about all these spreadsheets: They’re enjoyable. You could use productivity apps to track your habits, but they’re not as endlessly customizable, creative, or purposeful as spreadsheets. It’s fun to puzzle out the best way to organize them and maximize the amount of information you can include without making them unwieldy. And it’s a joy to see them fill up and show off all the books you’ve read this year or how much you’ve exercised.

“List making, if done right, can help you organize your goals and keep track of your to-do list,” says Rachel Hershenberg, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Emory University and author of the book [*Activating Happiness](&lt;|url|&gt;): A Jump Start Guide to Overcoming Low Motivation, Depression, or Just Feeling Stuck*. “Finding a sense of accomplishment from things that are hard to do is an important part of improving depressed mood and low motivation.”

[Research](&lt;|url|&gt;) from psychologists E.J. Masicampo of Wake Forest College and Roy Baumeister of Florida State University, which looked at how plan-making affects cognitive processes and productivity, found that using concrete tasks to plan for and achieve a specific goal leads to greater success than merely committing to a goal without a concrete plan. The study found that subjects with plans were more focused, had better reading comprehension, and had fewer occasions of mind-wandering than those without plans.

Tracking your daily food intake in a list can also have an impact on weight loss. A [2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that those who tracked their daily food consumption had “significant and sustained” weight loss, even during the holiday season, when many people struggle to maintain a healthy diet.
> # My philodendron houseplant needs regular, consistent watering to thrive, and so does a goal-tracking spreadsheet

And gratitude lists, in which one regularly lists the things they’re grateful for, [have been shown](&lt;|url|&gt;) to improve mood and decrease symptoms in subjects with depression. It’s a method my own therapist has recommended, and which I’ve found helpful. Compelling yourself to remember the things in your life you like and are happy about can edge out any mental space you might devote to dwelling on things that make you anxious or unhappy.

The problem, of course, is that for those of us who are procrastinators, the mere resolution to begin a gratitude journal or food tracker isn’t enough to compel us to regularly do so. Consistent dedication to list-planning can be crucial to achieving goals; in the food-tracking study, researchers found that those who wrote down their food intake five days a week had a much higher rate of success than those who tracked inconsistently.

Depending on what you’re using it for, though, a handwritten list on a blank journal page can be messy and disorganized. And a list in a word processing document can appear unstructured and difficult to navigate. But a spreadsheet—with clearly delineated columns and rows, color-coding, and the ability to have the program itself organize the content—can make lists considerably easy to review.

Spreadsheets in particular make it immediately clear—simply by opening and glancing at a document—when you’ve been neglecting your good habits. My philodendron houseplant needs regular, consistent watering to thrive, and so does a goal-tracking spreadsheet, which otherwise appears riddled with holes made of missing data. The motivation to fill out the spreadsheet is baked into the form: All those sad, empty boxes need to be filled in, and only you can do it, by completing whichever task you’ve set out for yourself and then marking it as done in the correlated column.

“Rather than fall into patterns of procrastination that just breed more stress and hopelessness, a brief and specific to-do list can help you stay on track,” says Hershenberg. “When you make any steps toward that item on your to-do list, you can and should celebrate that effort. Finding a sense of accomplishment from things that are hard to do is an important part of improving depressed mood and low motivation.”

A spreadsheet provides a sense of accomplishment through something as simple as seeing the numbers tick up in a series of columns.

Hannah Orenstein, a journalist and author, says that a spreadsheet is what got her over the finish line on her second book, [*Love at First Like](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. “I updated the spreadsheet regularly with how many words I wrote per day, plus how many words I had accumulated in total,” she says. “I found that watching the numbers tick up as the weeks and months went by was incredibly motivating… I am 100% convinced I would have not have stayed on track with my goals if I hadn’t lived in fear of adding red cells to my spreadsheet instead of green ones.” She says that the spreadsheet was such a success that she’s employing it again for her third novel, currently in progress.

![*Orenstein’s writing spreadsheet*](<|image|>)**Orenstein’s writing spreadsheet**

What a green cell communicates to Hannah, and anyone who uses a similar method of spreadsheet design, is that she kicked ass that day. She got her word count. A red cell, conversely, shows that she didn’t fulfill her end of the bargain, didn’t complete her goal, and now that long beautiful row of green will be marred by a [stressful little red box](&lt;|url|&gt;). And while list-making can be beneficial on its own, utilizing a grid that can be visually marred by empty space or the wrong color is a [surprisingly effective motivator](&lt;|url|&gt;).

While spreadsheets are, of course, extremely useful for tracking work tasks and career goals, they’re also well-suited to recreational purposes and home projects.

“I actually tend to be kind of disorganized, which I think is why I’m a spreadsheet freak,” says Meg Clark, a social media editor in New York. “It’s a coping mechanism for my tendency to forget and misplace things.” Meg, who says she uses spreadsheets for “everything,” has a budget spreadsheet, multiple vacation and party spreadsheets, and a spreadsheet where she and her friends track all the perfumes they’ve tried and how they feel about them.

![*A sample from that perfume spreadsheet*](<|image|>)**A sample from that perfume spreadsheet**

Spreadsheets dedicated to planning parties and tracking events seemed novel to me, a relative hermit, but numerous people told me they depend on spreadsheets to help them stay organized when planning for guests or facing down the holiday season. Lindsey Ellefson, a producer at NY1, has a spreadsheet dedicated to events that she manages alongside friends and acquaintances who can add their own parties and corresponding details to the doc.
> # “Maybe it’s like I’m creating my own little world with my own formulas and charts and colors. I’ve literally spent hours doing it.”

And Matt Fratiani, a government worker in Cincinnati, says he uses spreadsheets for a wide variety of activities, from party-planning to household chores to one for his fantasy football league. He sometimes makes them just for kicks. “I don’t know what it is,” he says. “Maybe it’s like I’m creating my own little world with my own formulas and charts and colors. I’ve literally spent hours doing it.”

Spreadsheets should be the next bullet journals. They work for just about everything. If you’d like to start your own, Google Sheets offers a number of templates, including several for budgeting and even a wedding planning template. I’ve also created several of my own, many of them heavily inspired by spreadsheets that sources sent to me. I’m including them below. Copy the entire document, paste into a new one, and take your first step into hyper-organized spreadsheet bliss.

* [Google Sheets 101](&lt;|url|&gt;): The Beginner’s Guide to Online Spreadsheets. Bless Michael Grubbs, the person who made this. He’s done us all a great service.

* [Packing list spreadsheet](&lt;|url|&gt;): This spreadsheet has two tabs, one with a summer vacation packing list and another for a winter trip packing list. Checkmarks won’t copy and paste into a new document, so to insert your own, highlight the cells where you want them to appear, go to “Insert” in the top bar, and click “Checkbox.” Voilà!

* [Social media behavior spreadsheet](&lt;|url|&gt;): If you, like me, struggle with “[keeping it in the DMs](&lt;|url|&gt;),” tracking every day that you did can help keep your behavior in check. This spreadsheet can be adapted for any kind of behavior you want to change or modify. (This one was inspired by Therapist Aid.)

* [Wellness Assessment spreadsheet](&lt;|url|&gt;): If you’re working on mood regulation or other mental health self-analysis, tracking your mental health on a daily basis can be beneficial to discovering triggers and finding solutions. (Another Therapist Aid!)

* [Focus Plan spreadsheet](&lt;|url|&gt;): Have an overwhelming task you need to take care of? This spreadsheet, which helps you break down your responsibility into more manageable parts, can help you get it done. (And another from Therapist Aid.)

* [Party Planning spreadsheet](&lt;|url|&gt;): Party-planning can be taxing, but this spreadsheet (inspired by Meg Clark) helps you lay out just want you need to do to prepare.

* [Good Content spreadsheet](&lt;|url|&gt;): There is a lot of excellent content out there, and trying to follow along on social media isn’t an especially organized way to keep track of it. This spreadsheet (from La Rainne Pasion), which is meant to be shared with friends, will help.<|endoftext|>

# This Company Wants to Help Women Hack Their Fertility

## How helpful is it really to know your ovarian hormone levels?

![Illustration: [Ana Kova](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Ana Kova](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Fertility is like most aspects of medicine — it’s rarely discussed until a problem arises. But as women wait longer to start families, sometimes those discussions come too late.

Modern Fertility is one of a growing number of biotech companies that want to start the conversation sooner. It and other startups in the “femtech” field — technology companies that offer products around women’s reproductive health, such as period-tracking apps, birth control subscription services, and egg-freezing boutiques — are providing women with access to private fertility services that used to be solely within the purview of doctors. Their goal, the companies say, is to help women be better informed and more proactive about their health.

“There is a lot of confusion when women are trying to conceive,” says Afton Vechery, co-founder and CEO of Modern Fertility. “It’s a black box, and they are looking for more data to understand what’s going on.”

The [rise of femtech startups](&lt;|url|&gt;) — which have raised more than $1 billion since 2014 and are projected to be a $50 billion industry by 2025 — has coincided with a declining U.S. birth rate, in part due to women waiting longer to start trying to conceive. The U.S. [birth rate dropped](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2017 in every age group except women over 40, and women ages 30 to 34 now have a higher birth rate than women in their twenties. As women continue to delay having children, more are turning to assisted reproductive technology, such as egg freezing and in vitro fertilization. Like other direct-to-consumer health care startups, femtech companies view this space as being ripe for major disruption — and money.

Modern Fertility has carved out a diagnostic niche. The company offers an at-home testing kit for up to eight different hormones, including the three most important ones related to fertility: anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol.

As an unmarried woman in my early thirties who would like to have kids someday, I was curious about my own numbers, so I ordered a test from Modern Fertility. The kit arrived in the mail in the smooth, matte white packaging popularized by Apple, with a chic but discreet logo on the front. Following the instructions, I laid out all the materials on my kitchen table, washed and sterilized my hands, and punctured the tip of my left ring finger. I massaged my forearm and held my hand over the collection card, watching the blood slowly drop onto a small target square. After waiting 90 minutes for the blood to dry, I popped the card into the special packaging Modern Fertility provides and mailed it back.

Modern Fertility says that knowing your AMH, FSH, and estradiol levels can give you insight into your ovarian reserve, egg-freezing and IVF options, and even your timeline for menopause. AMH, or anti-Müllerian hormone, is produced by egg follicles in the ovaries and provides a rough estimate of ovarian reserve — the number of eggs waiting in the wings. The more follicles left, the higher the hormone levels. AMH levels are highest in puberty and decline as women lose eggs as they age. When a woman reaches menopause, her AMH levels drop to zero, because there are no more egg follicles left.

FSH, or follicle-stimulating hormone, is secreted by the pituitary gland and travels through the bloodstream to the ovaries, where it tells the follicles to release their eggs. When a woman has a high egg count, only a little bit of FSH is needed to trigger ovulation, but as egg reserves become depleted, the brain has to produce more FSH to get the same result. In general, higher FSH levels are thought to coincide with lower egg reserve.

However, estradiol, an estrogen steroid released by the ovaries, can suppress FSH production, artificially lowering test results. To get an accurate read on FSH, doctors recommend testing for the hormones in tandem and only during the first few days of a woman’s monthly cycle, when estradiol levels are low. Birth control also messes with FSH and estradiol, so a woman using a hormonal contraceptive — birth control pills, implants, and some intrauterine devices (IUD) — won’t be administered those two tests.

Lynn Westphal, an emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University, says that while the hormones Modern Fertility tests for can help evaluate egg reserve, the results are far from definitive for a person’s fertility. In fact, [one recent study](&lt;|url|&gt;) showed no connection between AMH and FSH levels and natural conception rates in 750 women over the age of 30.

AMH is, however, a strong predictor of how well a woman will respond to fertility drugs if she undergoes IVF or egg freezing. “When we see that the numbers are in the range where we expect them to be, then that’s reassuring in terms of ovarian function,” Westphal says. “But it’s not telling someone their overall fertility, because there are so many factors involved.”

“It takes an egg, a sperm, and a uterus to have a pregnancy. We focus on ovarian function because we know that’s the one thing that clearly changes over time.”
> # At my doctor’s office, on a bare-bones insurance plan with a high deductible, a single elective test for AMH paid for out of pocket cost $50.

I use a hormonal IUD for birth control, so my Modern Fertility test included only AMH, which isn’t influenced by hormonal contraceptives. Despite that, I was still charged the full $159 for the test. Modern Fertility says that’s because I also gained access to its other offerings: a one-on-one consult with a fertility nurse, the company’s weekly webinar to review results, and an active Slack channel of other women who’ve taken the test.

One of the company’s selling points is that its test is cheaper than going through your doctor or a fertility clinic. On its website, Modern Fertility claims a hormone panel can cost $1,500—a number Vechery also cited in our conversation based on her experience at a fertility clinic. At my doctor’s office, on a bare-bones insurance plan with a high deductible, a single elective test for AMH paid for out of pocket cost $50.

Less than a week after sending in the test, I received a notification in my inbox that my results were ready. According to Modern Fertility, my AMH levels fell within the normal range for my age. I got a different number from the AMH test I took the following week through a venipuncture blood draw at my OB-GYN, which placed me in the low-to-normal category.

The discrepancy in my results doesn’t necessarily mean that one of the tests is inaccurate. Westphal says it’s “not unusual” to see variations from lab to lab, and it’s “not as big of a difference as it may seem.” Modern Fertility recently [published a peer-reviewed paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) showing a tight correlation between fingerstick and traditional venipuncture hormone tests. But the difference between the tests does drive home the fact that I shouldn’t place too much weight on either number.

Even if the results were consistent, the tests don’t tell me very much about my odds of getting pregnant. Despite the wealth of scientific information Modern Fertility provides to explain the results and put them in context for my age — way more than I received from my doctor and, to me, the company’s most useful offering — a single test can’t tell me how many eggs I have left, how quickly they’re falling, or the quality of those that remain. It provides no information about the state of my uterus and, of course, nothing about that other half of the equation — my partner.

“The talk of a fertility test is a bit problematic, because it’s not really a fertility test—it’s an egg quantity test,” says Alan Penzias, a reproductive endocrinologist at fertility clinic Boston IVF and an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School. “Egg quantity may have some bearing on fertility treatment outcomes when you’re trying to do fertility therapy, but it may be completely unrelated to whether or not somebody gets pregnant.”
> # “If they say, ‘Tell me my egg quality,’ I say, ‘Show me your driver’s license.’ Because that’s the best I can do.”

The other major factor is egg quality — the likelihood that an egg will be successfully inseminated and develop into a healthy embryo. Quality, like quantity, declines with age, but scientists have no way to measure it.

“If somebody says to me, ‘Tell me what my egg quantity is,’ I say, ‘Well, show me your blood,’… and with some caveats around that, I’ll give you a rough categorization,” Penzias says. “If they say, ‘Tell me my egg quality,’ I say, ‘Show me your driver’s license.’ Because that’s the best I can do, the closest I can get to egg quality.”

Penzias’ concern with private tests provided without consultation from a doctor is that the results could either unnecessarily scare or falsely reassure women. A recent [*New Republic* article](&lt;|url|&gt;) asked whether the rapidly proliferating femtech industry is “alleviating women’s anxieties or exploiting them.” There are perhaps no issues more fraught or more primal than personal health and reproduction. Companies like Modern Fertility want you to believe that they can give you data-driven insights into these topics, like a Fitbit for your ovaries. A friend of mine described these products more accurately, I think, as an Ouija board.

But Westphal, who was recently named chief medical officer of the boutique fertility clinic Kindbody, says more information is almost always better. “I think it’s always good to be educated and have information. Anything that makes women think carefully about when they want to have their children, I think it’s good to have that conversation early, because I see too many women who are misinformed about their fertility.”

Femtech may have become a fast-growing industry because it’s a genuinely needed one. There has long been a dearth of knowledge and investment in women’s health, and while companies like Modern Fertility are capitalizing on that gap, they’re also filling it with data.

Vechery, who has worked in health care private equity evaluating IVF clinics, as well as at personalized medicine startups like 23andMe, says her own expensive experience getting her hormones tested and her friends’ subsequent questions about the process inspired her to start the company.

“A core part of why we started Modern Fertility was to make this type of testing and information as accessible as we possibly could,” Vechery says. “We launched [this company] because we wanted this resource. We wanted this for ourselves, our friends, our sisters, our family members.”

Personally, I don’t think the company’s tests provided me with that much information, although maybe I feel that way because my numbers were relatively normal. I do have some peace of mind that I don’t need to start thinking about having children tomorrow. But ask me again in nine months, when Modern Fertility suggests I spend another $159 to recheck my levels to see how my numbers have changed, and maybe my answer will be different.<|endoftext|>

# How a Veteran Turned Tech Exec Organizes Her Home Screen

## ‘There’s definitely a sense of organization and efficiency’

![Niki Marin](<|image|>)*Niki Marin*

*This is “What’s on Your Home Screen?” a Q&A column from *OneZero*. We want to understand more about how people use their smartphones — those life-consuming devices we dump hours into every day — to pave a way toward a better future. Or at least a more reflective one. We’ll add new entries regularly, and each will feature a new interview with a notable person about the apps they use, how they’re organized, and whether those red bubbles drive them nuts.*

Niki Marin’s job is to keep you safe. She’s the head of operations and strategy at Jigsaw, an Alphabet company that develops security technology like [Intra](&lt;|url|&gt;), which guards against some common attacks your phone may be vulnerable to.

It’s not the first time she’s had security on the mind. Marin is a West Point grad with experience in the U.S. Army, earning the rank of Captain during her deployment in Afghanistan.

So it may not shock you that she runs a tight ship on the home screen front. All folders, no junk, no excess badge notifications, barely any social media — save for a rarely updated but incredibly charming Instagram account dedicated to her bulldog.

*What follows is our chat, edited for length and clarity.*

![](<|image|>)

### **OneZero: Let’s start with the birds-eye view of this home screen. It all seems very deliberate.**

**Niki Marin:** It’s reflective of my personality. I use this particular home screen for personal and work. There’s this magic blue button that deciphers between work apps and all my personal apps.

My background is a little bit of a shout-out to the Pixel camera — that camera is phenomenal. I have a Pixel 3, and that was with no filters. It was taken in Hawaii, which is a soft spot in my heart. It’s where I met my husband — we go there every year. I love being able to have a background that’s serene. I love the blues.

On the organizational piece, I’m a West Point graduate, and I served in the military before coming into tech. There’s definitely a sense of organization and efficiency that is a part of my daily practice. The way I’m able to sort my information to make sure it’s easily accessible, that I’m able to surface the most important things to me at a moment’s notice — I love taking the time to build that foundation. That’s why I have the different folders.

### [**I talked to Farhad Manjoo at the *New York Times](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, and his home screen was kind of the polar opposite: It was extremely disorganized, I don’t think much if anything was in folders, he had, I think 14 pages of apps —**

It was 16!

### **Sixteen! Yeah, it was some crazy number. But, he said he uses the search functionality to surface exactly what he’s looking for. You, on the other hand, want to be able to look at your home screen and be able to access whatever you want without searching, necessarily, and I wonder if you could speak to why having everything centralized works for you. This [Tristan Harris](&lt;|url|&gt;) guy has spoken a lot about mindful tech use, and [how having everything on your home screen is maybe not such a good idea because it encourages mindless use](&lt;|url|&gt;). Why does having everything front and center work for you?**

We all have the creative flexibility to reflect on what works best for us. There’s a lot of noise out there, but I never want to restrict myself. I love the idea of being able to search and find apps, but I have my home screen organized the way that it is because I’m naturally a more organized and tidy person. It definitely de-stresses me to have things orderly and in place.
> # I like to have my home screen representative of something that’s a bit tidier — it minimizes the noise.

As I’m thinking this through, there’s this subconscious thought that comes through. By having everything centralized on my home screen, and with just the click of a button, a particular folder will surface really relevant and helpful apps, it actually de-stresses me. I feel like there’s a sense of chaos when I’ve looked at other screens, and there’s apps all over the place. I like to have my home screen representative of something that’s a bit tidier — it minimizes the noise. And it allows me to see that beautiful palm tree more!

### **It’s intentional, which is a theme I continue to find as I talk to people about their home screens. Even Farhad had intentionality with his home screen. That brings me to something else: You’re only the second Android user I’ve spoken to for this, which I guess makes sense. Does Google have a gun to your head, or is Android your personal preference?**

Google is actually incredible supportive of using any device! I’ve taken it upon myself, working in the Google ecosystem, that I should be a user of our products. It helps me to better understand what we’re providing for our users.

### **Right. And Android has this feature where you can switch profiles for work and personal. It kind of silos the two. Tell me why that’s useful.**

Along the lines of simplicity, I really don’t like having multiple phones. I’ve gone that route before, where I’ve balanced between a couple of different ones, and I just prefer to have one single device, and these separate profiles are huge.

In my personal life, because I use Gmail, I use Calendar, I use Hangouts, it’s a really clear separation, and it’s really seamless. It’s just the click of a button and it separates between the two. I don’t allow notifications to come through for my work profile on Gmail, but I do for pings on Hangouts, because when someone reaches out that way, there’s a little more sense of urgency. Finding a balance between when I receive email and when I look at them — it’s nice to not have the flow of notifications. I believe there’s a sense of personal ownership, that you have to create some boundaries.

### **That’s interesting. The default for everyone always seems to be iOS, but there’s a lot of flexibility on Android to set your own terms for how you want to use your device. It’s funny, there’s this whole conversation about mindfulness in tech, but it seems like people don’t always look at all of their options, in terms of switching devices, et cetera. You have this interest in security, and you do have the Jigsaw folder on your home screen: How do you bring your expertise and thoughts around security to how you use your device in general?**

Google has made a concerted effort to improve privacy settings that are owned and controlled by the actual user, and that in itself helps me feel that my information is safe, and I do believe in our privacy efforts.

I love to travel. There’s one particular Jigsaw product called Intra, which is basically an app that protects you from DNS manipulation, which again is basically a cyberattack that’s used to block access to sites, social media platforms, messaging apps. I like knowing that I have this extra protection barrier in place. Intra also protects against phishing and malware.

### **Alright. Two more specific things: You have an entire “phone” folder. I barely use the one phone app I have. What are these apps?**

That’s actually a great question. *[Laughs] *Those are things that, like, are actually related to hardware for my phone. So I use Bose wireless headphones, so there’s an app there that helps to manage the settings. The other thing is, I use Verizon, so I have a Verizon app in there. It’s all of the things that are related to the device that sit outside of the phone.

### **I see. So you’re not like, going nuts with the phone calls or anything.**

Yeah, that’s it. *[Laughs]*

### **And then, your “food” folder: We’ve got Starbucks in here. Are you eating at Starbucks a lot?**

It’s a coffee situation. I do like to jump on points and rewards programs.

### **The last thing is, at a glance, you’ve got two Instagram-related apps, WhatsApp, and Skype. Are you kind of off social media?**

I’m very minimal. I don’t have a presence on social media. My dog has an Instagram account. It’s not the most active account.


### **What’s the account?**

[KingBaileyMarin](&lt;|url|&gt;). He’s an English bulldog. Again, it’s not the most… You’ll see. It’s not the most active account.

### **Only 165 followers.**

Yes, exactly. Keeping that close with some friends.

### **You might get some more followers from this. I like his little sombrero that he has in this picture. But that was posted two years ago!**

I can update some content. *[Laughs]*

# I Saw ‘Dark Phoenix’ So You Don’t Have to

## I Saw ‘Dark Phoenix’ So You Don’t Have to

### Here’s what you need to know, because you clearly aren’t going to see it yourself

![Evan Peters and Sophie Turner in “Dark Phoenix.” © Fox Movies](<|image|>)*Evan Peters and Sophie Turner in “Dark Phoenix.” © Fox Movies*

Did you see the newest installment in the *X-Men* movie franchise last weekend? Based on the box office, [probably not!](&lt;|url|&gt;) Congratulations, because it turns out that was a smart decision, because I sat through it and… oof.

Let my pain be of some use, as I answer every question you might possibly have about *Dark Phoenix* in the most mean-spirited way possible.

*(Spoilers ahead, obviously.)*

### **How is the movie?**

My full review: “Oof.”

### **What does that mean, exactly?**

You know when you go to a wedding reception and the groom’s best man gives a speech, and he’s clearly already nervous, but then it turns out his notes still have a few typos in them, so he misspeaks a lot and he pokes a little fun at the bride, but it isn’t funny, so it feels a tiny bit mean? And then he starts telling a story about the groom and realizes halfway through it’s too inappropriate to say in front of his family, so he has to bail on it, and by that point he’s sweating, and the groom has to approach and give him an awkward hug to sort of close the curtains on it?

### **Yes…**

That’s *Dark Phoenix*. It basically means well, but there’s also such a feeling of relief when it’s over.

### **So what’s the movie about?**

Do you remember 2006’s *X-Men: The Last Stand*?

### **Vaguely.**

*Dark Phoenix *is* X-Men: The Last Stand*. That means it’s partially a second attempt to adapt one of the *X-Men* comics’ most beloved storylines, [the Dark Phoenix saga](&lt;|url|&gt;), in which the telepathic superhero Jean Grey turns both evil and all-powerful after she becomes possessed by a cosmic entity of destruction. In 2006, *The Last Stand* adapted the storyline — sort of — and did it very, very badly.

### **So, isn’t *Dark Phoenix* trying to tell the story again a good thing?**

On paper, sure. In some ways, *Dark Phoenix* is an improvement over its predecessor, but that’s a very low bar. But *Phoenix* really blows this second chance, because for some reason it’s less an adaptation of the comic books and more a remake of *The Last Stand*.

### **Wait. It’s a better version of a bad movie?**

Exactly. And “better” does not necessarily mean “good.”

### **I’ve forgotten everything about *The Last Stand* except that it was bad. What happens in *Dark Phoenix*?**

It’s set in 1992, nine years after the events of *X-Men: Apocalypse*, in which mutants — mainly the usually evil Magneto (Michael Fassbender) — destroyed a significant portion of the planet in service of a 5,000 year-old Egyptian god played, beneath a lot of blue makeup, by Oscar Isaac. But now everything is somehow hunky-dory between humans and mutants, to the point that the president is personally calling Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) to ask for the X-Men’s help whenever humanity has a boo-boo.

### **Well, that sounds like good news for mutants.**

Don’t worry, they mess it all up pretty quick. The aforementioned boo-boo occurs when a newly-launched space shuttle encounters some sort of giant cosmic anomaly that messes it up, so Xavier sends the X-Men up in their own, much nicer, X-themed spaceship to help.

### **Seems a little weird for a private school to have more sophisticated spacecraft than NASA.**

Capitalism, baby! Long story short, the X-Men save all the astronauts before the shuttle explodes, but somehow Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) ends up in there without a spacesuit when the ship is finally torn to pieces. Then, she sucks up the anomaly like a redheaded Dustbuster, floats in the vacuum of space for a bit, and dies. But then, she wakes up and is totally fine!

### **Really?**

No, of course not. Because after being bombarded by a giant cloud of unknown cosmic energy Jean has become… [the *Fantastic Four](&lt;|url|&gt;)*!

### **Wait, what?**

Just a little nerd joke. This anomaly is the Phoenix Force, which amplifies her already immense power and… Well, it doesn’t make her evil so much as it gives her poor impulse control.

### **Hey, wait. This is when Jean gets her Phoenix powers?**

Yep.

### **Then why is she emitting giant phoenix-shaped energy [at the end of the last movie](&lt;|url|&gt;)? It’s literally how they literally defeat Apocalypse. Xavier tells her to unleash her full power.**

Uh, that was… a… coincidence?

### **Try again.**

Foreshadowing?

### **Good enough, but barely. What happens then?**

A series of unfortunate, arbitrary, and very dumb events.

### **What do you mean?**

I mean the movie’s plot isn’t a story so much as it is a ping-pong ball thrown against a hallway wall, where it careens constantly back and forth and only random, unsupported events and character decisions keep the ball moving. It starts when a troubled Jean learns her dad is alive and takes off to see him, only to discover he secretly abandoned her after her powers freaked out years ago, causing a car wreck that killed her mom.

### **That’s sort of a tired trope.**

It is, but that’s not the point. The X-Men arrive, ready to attack Jean instantly, even though 1) she was a beloved friend and teammate an hour prior; 2) her freak-outs are obviously 100% not her fault as she’s been possessed by a space cloud; and 3) she hasn’t actually done anything evil yet.

Then, some cop cars inexplicably arrive solely so Jean can smush them and justify the X-Men fighting her. Jean spanks all the X-Men around until she accidentally tosses Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) onto a few exposed rebars, killing her.

### **Isn’t that a pretty crappy way for one of the most important characters in the series to die?**

Yes, but the real problem is that based on everything that’s happened up to that point, Jean killing Mystique is completely out of left field. It’s basically an excuse for the rest of the movie to happen. On a positive note, however, Mystique’s death is a mercy killing of sorts, as it finally sets Jennifer Lawrence’s free from a franchise she would have preferred to be done with several years ago.

### **That’s true. Okay, so what happens next?**

Jean makes the strange decision to visit Magneto for advice on how not to kill people, even though Magneto was always killing people on purpose and thus is not really an advocate of self-restraint. It’s a scene that exists solely so the character — and more importantly, Michael Fassbender — can be dragged into the film. Then, Beast (Nicholas Hoult) — who has decided to straight-up murder Jean because he loved Mystique — makes the bizarre decision to enlist Magneto’s help in said murder. Please remember that by the end of the last movie, Magneto was responsible for destroying a significant portion of the planet and killing millions. Everyone in this film is just cool with him again, but for some reason it’s Jean who has to be taken out.

### **That does sound rather inconsistent.**

Then, Jessica Chastain’s character finds Jean and takes her to a brownstone in New York City for an exposition dump, a location chosen solely so a fight scene between the “kill her” and “not kill her” factions can take place there.

### **I forgot Jessica Chastain was in this film. Who does she play?**

Jessica Chastain plays no one.

### **But… she’s in the film, right?**

Oh, Chastain is a character in the film. But saying she “plays” a role implies she acts in the film, which she very much does not. Chastain was cast as an alien named Vuk, and portrays her with zero emotion every second she is on screen. It’s incredible, and I mean that in the strictest sense of the word, with no positive value judgment. Vuk is part of an alien race called the D’Bari, whose entire planet was destroyed. She’s desperate to gain the Phoenix Force to remake her home world, yet Chastain plays her like she’s grocery shopping.

### **Why would she choose to do this?**

Perhaps because Vuk is underwritten to the point of insanity. Oh, she has many scenes — a shocking amount of scenes, almost none of which convey any information or advance the plot — but in a film full of nonsense, Vuk takes the nonsense cake.

### **What’s her deal?**

As Vuk explains to her, Jean Grey is the only entity the Phoenix Force has entered without destroying. Then, Vuk explains Jean now has the power to rebuild the D’Bari’s planet, except Jean would rather get rid of the Phoenix Force entirely. Luckily, it turns out she can give it to Vuk like it’s a *Magic: The Gathering* card. Equally luckily, it turns out Vuk is also someone who can have the Phoenix Force without exploding, which is something she absolutely could not have possibly known beforehand. It’s all just really, really dumb.

### **Why is Chastain’s character even in the film, then?**

Solely so the X-Men and Jean and Magneto can get together and fight somebody else in the final act. Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) manages to stop Vuk before she can absorb all of the Phoenix Force, Jean falls unconscious, all the mutants get taken by the government and locked up on a train, and then dozens of D’Bari appear out of nowhere and attack it. The government frees the X-Men to help fight off the aliens, and Professor X is forced to wake up Jean.

### **Wasn’t the whole point of the movie subduing Jean? Is there any reason for Xavier to believe Jean has stopped being crazy and/or evil?**

Not at all. But luckily — so much luck in this movie — Jean has stopped being crazy and/or evil, and also even though Vuk can absorb some of the Phoenix Force, it turns out she actually can’t absorb all of it, which is just more poor planning on her part. Luckily, yet again, it turns out Jean still has oodles of Phoenix Force left over, so she just feeds Vuk power until they both explode. Or maybe Jean merges with the Phoenix Force entirely. It’s not clear or interesting.

### **Wait, so Vuk wanted all the Phoenix Force power…**

And when Jean gave her a second dose of that power it was too much for Vuk and she blew up.

### **Seriously, what the hell was Vuk’s plan?**

Chase the giant cosmic entity that killed her entire race until she also managed to get killed by it, apparently.

### **What a sad way for Fox’s *X-Men* movie franchise to end.**

On the plus side, the sooner this iteration of the franchise can be swept under the rug, the sooner Marvel Studios can reboot them.

### **Think Marvel can do *Dark Phoenix* right?**

I mean, look at their track record. But “could” doesn’t mean “would.”

After two botched adaptations, I’d bet it’ll be a decade-plus before Marvel attempts it, if it ever does. (Look at how their new *Spider-Man* movies have studiously avoided the villains Sony’s versions used.) Audiences will definitely be excited for more *X-Men* movies after a few years, but I doubt anyone will be interested in revisiting this particular storyline anytime soon. And yet, there’s something poetic about that.

### **What’s that?**

A phoenix is a mythical bird that is always reborn after it dies. The first *X-Men* movie franchise was effectively killed off by a crappy adaptation of the *Dark Phoenix* storyline, and was reborn as *X-Men: First Class*. Now this second continuity has died, telling the same story just as badly. And now the series will be reborn over at Marvel.

### **Don’t phoenixes usually burst into flames when they die and then are reborn in the ashes?**

Yes. But it’s not like *Dark Phoenix* is burning up the box office.

### **Oof.**

THAT’S WHAT I SAID.<|endoftext|>

# How Whole Foods Lost Employees’ Trust

## Whole Foods Worker: “Mid-level People… Don’t Trust Whole Foods Corporate Anymore.”

### The grocery giant faced struggles long before Amazon showed up

![Illustration: [Glenn Harvey](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Glenn Harvey](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

*Valued at nearly $1 trillion, Amazon is one of the most powerful companies in the world. The Seattle-based retail giant employs over 600,000 people and operates 100 sortation and fulfillment centers in North America, sometimes sending out as many as 1 million items per day to customers. But Amazon does more than just retail. Amazon publishes its own books and comics, finances TV shows and movies, operates a Texas wind farm, builds robots, streams music, delivers prescription medications, and operates web services for everyone from Medium to the CIA. And that’s not even counting its high-profile acquisitions, which include Twitch, IMDB, Zappos, and Whole Foods, among countless others.*

*Nearly all of us use Amazon, one way or another. But what is it like working inside the beast? Over the next few weeks, we’ll be bringing you stories from workers at every level of the Amazon empire to find out.*

*Welcome to The Amazon Diaries.*

In June 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion, not only extending its reach as a food delivery service but also picking up some 430 distribution centers — otherwise known as Whole Foods stores — with lucrative, built-in customer bases. As Derek Thompson [pointed out in *The Atlantic](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, Whole Foods’ real estate was at least as valuable to Amazon as Whole Foods’ business itself, if not more so. But where did the acquisition leave the human beings who worked in those stores?

One Whole Foods worker *OneZero* spoke with, “Tyler,” started at the company about 10 years ago. (Tyler requested anonymity for this interview to speak freely about his experience.) In 2008, Tyler had lost his finance job at a health care company. “I started stocking shelves part time, and then after I’d been there for eight or nine months, I decided to see if I could make a career out of it,” he told me. “I’m a food nerd, I like to cook, I used to go and get things at Whole Foods and just really liked things at Whole Foods. And there’s still a lot about Whole Foods that I really love.”

After five years on the sales floor, Tyler, who is based in the Rocky Mountain region, moved into Whole Foods’ tech division. Even before the Amazon acquisition, he says, things at the company began to change: stores had less autonomy in what to stock and how to stock it, hours were cut, and teams consolidated. But it was the 2017 sale that pushed Tyler into action. He was specifically concerned about the news that the newly acquired Whole Foods would cease its practice of profit sharing with lower-level workers.
> # It’s a self-organizing network of workers across the country, commiserating over shared experiences and strategizing over how to respond to labor cuts, layoffs, and meddling from Whole Foods Corporate.

Tyler is now a core organizer with [the Whole Worker movement](&lt;|url|&gt;), which [announced itself to management](&lt;|url|&gt;) with a letter in September 2018. “Without our hard work and dedication today, Whole Foods would literally be worth next to nothing,” it read. “We cannot let Amazon remake the entire North American retail landscape without embracing the full value of its team members.”

Although Whole Worker members in some Whole Foods locations are leading union drives, Whole Worker itself isn’t a union. (In 2013, CEO John Mackey [said](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the company was “not so much anti-union as beyond unions.”) Rather, it’s a self-organizing network of workers across the country, commiserating over shared experiences, swapping gossip and information, and strategizing over how to respond to labor cuts, layoffs, and meddling from Whole Foods Corporate. “We just wanted to get together and do something. It wasn’t necessarily about unionization,” Tyler says. “When we launched, we just made a Slack channel, made it easy for employees to come on anonymously. Within a few weeks, we had a few hundred people on there.”

*OneZero* spoke with Tyler about what working at Whole Foods is like both before and after Amazon, and how the Whole Worker movement has continued to develop since going public. Amazon and Whole Foods have not yet responded to requests for comment for this article.

*The interview below has been edited and condensed for clarity.*

### **OneZero: How did life at Whole Foods change with the Amazon acquisition?**

**Tyler: **In the media, we typically see narratives like, “Amazon is changing Whole Foods.” I don’t think that’s very accurate. Whole Foods was changing for a long time — going downhill for a long time. That really began in 2014, which was the year that Costco and Walmart outsold us on national organic goods. For most of its early years, the 1980s and 1990s, Whole Foods had this long stretch where it just faced no serious competition. But when conventional retailers started getting into natural, organic products, Whole Foods just couldn’t compete for a number of different reasons — the biggest probably being that those big national chains do national buying. That’s when they started cutting back, laying people off, consolidating positions. That’s when the relationship with their stores and the people that work on the sales floor really started to change.

### **What did that look like?**

It got really serious when an [activist investor group](&lt;|url|&gt;) started buying up shares of Whole Foods and putting a lot of pressure on the board of directors to either sell or make labor cuts — that’s when they did the Whole Foods 365 thing. [Ed: *An effort to open [cheaper, smaller stores](&lt;|url|&gt;) marketed to millennials.*] Basically, how this manifests for people on the sales floor is that… you start getting tasked with more things to do than you have the time for in a day, and they get rid of people that have been there for longer, or are making a higher wage.

If you were a team leader, you may have had 30 people on your team, you may have been managing one department, and you had two associate team leaders [ATL] helping you, plus buyers and people underneath. In 2015, they started consolidating those teams aggressively, which means now you’re heading two departments or three departments, and you have one less ATL. You still have just as many team members, just as many responsibilities, but they started really aggressively consolidating those positions. Most team leaders I know work 60 hours a week, all the time. A lot of them work much more than that. [*Ed: [According to Glassdoor](&lt;|url|&gt;), the average team leader is paid $24 per hour.*]

On the sales floor, that’s just extremely stressful and demoralizing. Whole Foods has these really high retail standards — execution standards, organic compliance. If you cut back on labor and consolidate positions and give people less resources but you don’t change the standards, then that is extremely stressful. Any team member that’s been in a Whole Foods in the past five years would probably describe it like that — it’s just a lot of pressure.

The biggest surprise to me when we launched our movement was that we didn’t reach out to people in leadership, but most of the people that have come forward to leak stuff, help us get things off the ground, are like, mid-level management. For instance those union videos, [the anti-union trainings](&lt;|url|&gt;) — those were leaked to us by a team leader. A lot of our best sources are people who wouldn’t even be able to be in any kind of union.

### **Why do you think some of the employees in management are turning on Whole Foods?**

Mid-level people, and even some higher level management, don’t trust Whole Foods Corporate anymore. It’s not just about being nice to their employees and giving them more hours or whatever, but the decision-making process. When we talk about Whole Foods Corporate in Austin, Texas [*Ed: Where the company is headquartered*] — they used to be a much smaller outfit. When I started, Whole Foods was really run regionally and then locally. People at the store level had a lot of control over the products they carried, how they merchandised.
> # They’re told what to do, they’re told what to stock, how to stock, how to do their jobs, and there’s just no deviation.

You have a company full of semi-intelligent individuals, or above-average intelligent individuals, who are making choices at their store, and they’re passionate about their jobs. And then, more and more they are no longer part of that decision-making process. They’re told what to do, they’re told what to stock, how to stock, how to do their jobs, and there’s just no deviation. It’s just a really top-down thing. I think that’s what people are angry about. So anything that can alter that power dynamic, I think, resonates with people.

### **How did the Whole Worker movement come together? And why has it taken this form?**

One of the things that attracted me to Whole Foods was that they used to be a really progressive corporation. There was a lot that was attractive, given my core beliefs and politics and all that. Even for retail, their benefits are well above average. There was really good profit sharing. We got stock grants once a year, options, there was a good bonus structure, good incentive structures.

For me, the organizing started when, after the Amazon acquisition happened, I learned that there were mass layoffs planned at the store level. They laid off a lot of marketing people, graphic artists. And we found out that [profit sharing had gone away](&lt;|url|&gt;), that it wasn’t something Amazon wanted to bring back, and that they had already given store team leaders Amazon stock grants.

We launched with a company-wide email just saying, “Hey, this happened, and there’s no reason we should trust Amazon — in fact there’s no reason we should trust Whole Foods Corporate.” We spoke to issues that had been happening for a long time — labor cuts, layoffs. We talked about future layoffs. People were just angry, and they just saw the general direction in which Whole Foods was going was the opposite of their values. I think a lot of people who work at Whole Foods, especially those who’ve worked there for a long time, are passionate people. So we tried to appeal to that, just saying that we thought it was bullshit and there was no reason we should trust these people.

### **How many chapters of Whole Worker are there? How are they distributed across the country?**

I’d rather not say how many there are, but they’re kind of all over. There are some on the West Coast, the East Coast. The most prominent one is probably in Chicago. That’s the one Whole Foods knows about and is most worried about.

Whole Worker is a small movement still. We’ve done things that have been impactful. We were talking to people in Bernie Sanders’s office about the [$15 an hour wage increase](&lt;|url|&gt;). There were a lot of factors at play leading to Amazon announcing the minimum wage raise, but we felt we played a small role. But whatever impact we’ve had, we’ve done it at zero cost on old smartphones and Chromebooks. Anyone can do that.

### **Why do you think it’s been so difficult to organize unions at Whole Foods?**

I run into people that are just afraid to do anything, all the time. And it’s totally rational. If you work retail and you lose your job, you lose your health insurance, what do you do? Are you gonna deliver food? You gonna Uber? In 2019, if you’re a person who has a job with health insurance, it’s an increasingly rare thing.

So it’s appropriate to be afraid of speaking out. They can’t fire you for organizing without risking a lawsuit, but it’s easy to fire someone for any number of technicalities. But if you have a smartphone, there’s so much you can do. If you see unsafe things at work, if you see unethical business practices, if you see people being harassed or bullied or abused in any way, it’s so easy to record and document and share that with people online or in the media without compromising your identity. It’s a very real fear people have of becoming unemployed and not being able to support yourself or have access to health care. A lot of people are afraid of that. But it’s also easier, now than ever, to get involved.<|endoftext|>

# The Avengers Messed Up

## The Avengers Messed Up

### How our favorite superheroes ruined the world they meant to save

![© Marvel Studios](<|image|>)*© Marvel Studios*

It’s no spoiler to reveal that in *Avengers: Endgame*, the good guys end up defeating the bad guys. That’s just how superhero stories work — at least in the second half of a two-part film series. But the Avengers don’t seem to realize that they’ve created many more problems in the process. The end result: The Earth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is still totally screwed.

**(Major spoilers for *Avengers: Endgame* follow. But come on — you’ve already seen it.)**

Oh, those Avengers. Both individually and together, they’ve saved the planet many times over. Sure, sometimes they accidentally create [a robot that freaks out and decides the best way to protect Earth is by destroying humanity](&lt;|url|&gt;), which is, admittedly, not technically incorrect — but the Avengers mean well!

After Thanos wiped out half the life in the universe during *Infinity War*, the Avengers finally have a chance to live up to their name and actually, you know, avenge something in *Endgame*. Unfortunately, it takes them five full years to do so — five years during which the remaining population of Earth is forced to live with the loss of countless loved ones, in a world where every aspect of civilization is suddenly half-staffed. *Endgame* doesn’t really linger on the horrifying effects this must have had, emotionally and socially, other than to briefly show how many people still can’t cope with their losses, and how the survivors have tried to consolidate their lives in a much emptier world than the one they used to live in.
> # Literally every single person who disappeared would have lost their jobs as companies, industries, consumers, and profits adjusted to the new normal.

This makes sense, because it’s pretty dark stuff. So when the Avengers manage to figure out how to travel through time, you’d probably expect them — I certainly expected them — to prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers at all, erasing the half-decade of suffering and chaos from ever happening. Nope. Because of the very specific time travel rules *Endgame* establishes (which are dodgy!) the Avengers can only bring back those who were killed to their new present. Which they do, and herein lies the problem.

There is absolutely no way [the Earth could handle its population suddenly doubling](&lt;|url|&gt;). Food production would have most likely been halved since the snap, meaning the returning 3.5 billion people would have very little to eat, for months at minimum — although it’s not like they’d be able to afford to buy food. Literally, every single person who disappeared would have lost their jobs as companies, industries, consumers, and profits adjusted to the new normal. In the instant of the Great Unsnap, the world’s unemployment jumped to around 50%. The global economy would likely collapse entirely.

To be fair, resurrecting half the universe didn’t technically make the Avengers responsible for making sure these people were fed and sheltered. So let’s turn to a massive problem that is entirely of their own making: Time. As I mentioned above, almost no time travel movie has rules that make sense, although *Endgame* sure goes out of its way when Tilda Swinton’s Ancient One and Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk establish the importance of not altering the past, so alternate timelines are not created. The Hulk explains that by borrowing the Infinity Stones in the past and returning them to the same minute they were taken, assuming no one notices, nothing in their timeline will have actually changed. Of course, this also assumes that the Avengers don’t screw things up.

Boy, do the Avengers screw things up. They mess with the timeline so much, in fact, it’s almost comical — to the point that it’s genuinely baffling that the movie pretended there were rules at all. The big alteration, of course, is that when present-day Nebula returns to 2014 to steal the Power Stone (just before the events of *Guardians of the Galaxy*), it turns out she shares the same Wi-Fi network as 2014 Nebula, allowing 2014 Thanos to discover the Avengers’ plan and hitch a ride to the present, using the Avengers’ time machine. The end result is that the Avengers win when Tony Stark unsnaps this younger Thanos and his minions out of existence.

You don’t need to be Stephen Hawking to figure out the problems of the Avengers killing the Thanos of five years earlier — before he managed to get his big purple hands on the Infinity Stones at all. It means, of course, that the first Snap never happened at all, because Thanos died before he could do it. So no one ever died at all! This actually sounds great, except this impossible act has definitely created one or more timelines, which is a huge no-no.

That’s the big time travel problem, but there are plenty more. By bringing Gamora and Nebula from 2014 to the present, the events of the *Guardians of the Galaxy* movie didn’t happen. Surely a major Hydra agent believing Captain America was also a Hydra spy for the two years between the first *Avengers* movie and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* would have changed many things, perhaps even leading to the discovery of Hydra’s infiltration of SHIELD a lot sooner. Even Captain America’s decision to return to the 1940s, and live the rest of his life from there, would make changes to the timeline — and even *Endgame* directors, the Russo brothers, don’t seem to know how Cap returned to the prime timeline! And then there was one other small change: There’s a new Loki on the loose with a new Cosmic Cube.

We don’t even need to worry about how Loki’s freedom would affect the events of the second and third *Thor* movies, because now the trickster god has his own Infinity Stone, thanks to Captain America, Ant-Man, and Iron Man totally flubbing their mission to steal it when they travel to 2012 and the events of the first *Avengers* film. During some straight-up nonsense, [the Cube — aka the Tesseract aka the Space Stone](&lt;|url|&gt;) — gets knocked to the feet of the handcuffed Loki, who grabs it and disappears.

The Space Stone allows its bearer to teleport anywhere across the universe or to warp space itself, which essentially allows telekinesis on a major level. Hey, remember in *Infinity War* when Thanos threw a damn moon at Iron Man? That was the Space Stone’s doing.
> # By bumbling through the pasts of their previous film, the Avengers are screwing things up very, very badly.

So Loki, who was already a major pain in the ass when he only had his illusion powers, now has an Infinity Stone. Remember, this Loki hasn’t yet had the pangs of conscience that inspired him to be slightly heroic during *Thor: The Dark World* and *Thor: Ragnarok*. The consequences for Earth, Asgard, and the universe could be — and surely would be — staggering.

I know all this is nitpicking, but Marvel’s decisions here are weird as hell. All the time travel nonsense would have actually been completely fine if *Endgame* hadn’t stressed how any alterations of the past would create new timelines, and that this was an unequivocally bad thing. Then, all the time travel shenanigans could have been hand-waved away, like in every other time travel movie. Instead, audiences are forced to recognize that by bumbling through the pasts of their previous film, the Avengers are screwing things up very, very badly.

But even this bizarre choice pales in comparison to keep that five-year gap. Sure, the fact that the surviving part of the world has had to live in a nightmare for half a decade certainly highlights the pathos of the Avengers living with their failure — but making it a canonical part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s continuity is stark raving mad. Half the planet has been deeply traumatized for a five full years! Many characters are suddenly five years older than their supporting casts! Even if everyone just gets over it off-screen, any future stories Marvel tells will need to account for this to some degree. (For instance, what will Wakanda look like in *Black Panther 2* when their king has been MIA for so long?) It’s such a weird decision, and so unnecessary — especially when the Avengers ended up having zero problems wrecking the timeline in countless other ways. Why not have them erase the Snap as well?

If you’re wondering how this could be done, let me introduce you to the greatest, most powerful [deus ex machina](&lt;|url|&gt;) in any universe: [The Infinity Gauntlet](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s all the plot justification the movie needs to do anything, really. If it’s powerful enough to rewrite reality so half of all living beings in the entire universe can be subtracted from or added back, it can do or undo anything the story needs or wants. If nothing else, I can assure you it’s not just for genocidal finger snaps.

The bright side is that all these plot holes don’t make *Avengers: Endgame* a bad movie. In fact, it’s pretty difficult to even notice these issues when you’re watching practically everyone in the 22 films that make up the [Marvel’s “Infinity Saga”](&lt;|url|&gt;) stop by to kick ass in the movie’s beyond-epic final act. I’m certainly not telling anyone to not go see it, in part because the [box office numbers](&lt;|url|&gt;) indicate you already have, and in part because it’s a genuine, uh… marvel. It’s just that with a few extremely easy plot alterations, the Avengers could have saved the universe better.<|endoftext|>

# The ‘New York Times’ Crossword App Was a Friend When I Needed One

## The black and white squares kept me sane, and now I can’t live without them

![](<|image|>)

*This is “I Can’t Live Without,” a column about the apps, gadgets, and services that make all the difference.*

There are certain words the *New York Times* crossword always comes back to. It is fond of the creme-filled OREO, of tides that EBB, of an old Russian TSAR (or [CZAR](&lt;|url|&gt;)). It enjoys IMO*,* shorthand for a texter’s expression of opinion. And it inexplicably loves the musician Brian* *ENO*.*

I would guess that most crossword puzzle enthusiasts have similar lists in their heads. The words may differ, but the existence speaks to one thing: a keen familiarity with their favorite black and white squares. Once I finished enough *New York Times *puzzles — which, like the paper itself, hew to a very particular voice — I began to notice these words. They set off small flares in my mind in the same way that you start to remember someone’s habits once you spend enough time with them. I now think of the crossword like any other relationship in my life: The creators are like friends, some of whom I like, and some of whom I don’t. It has good days and bad days. Sometimes I can finish its sentences, while other times I want our time together to end so I can go home and eat a sandwich on the couch.

I started doing the *New York Times *crossword while traveling after leaving my job in 2017. I had experimented with crossword puzzles over the years, but I could never sit down and finish one. I also thought they were pretentious — and in fairness, they often are.
> # I paid $40 for a yearly subscription to the app, because it gave me the twitchy, thumb-driven satisfaction I would like to wean myself off but never will.

This time, though, things were different. Perhaps it was because I had the time to commit to a new habit, or because I was staying with my aunt and uncle, both of whom are crossword people, and we did them together after dinner. Soon, it became a way to bond with my boyfriend at the time, who was half a world away in New York.

Mostly, I loved the puzzles because they kept my mind busy. After I quit my editing job, I could no longer depend on working in the news to keep me going. Initially, the lack of manic stimulation was a stupendous relief. Then I began to miss thinking about words. Some people need to understand the complex mechanics of a car’s engine before they can drive stick; I just need a verbal explanation of what to do with my feet while I shift gears. My brain has always run on words, and puzzles filled the space the daily tasks of editing and writing left behind. They made me feel like I was still myself, even as a fundamental part of me — the part that wrote because it was the only thing I was good at — was a shapeless mess of [questions and dread](&lt;|url|&gt;). While I debated whether I was cut out for the life of a professional writer, or whether I even wanted it, the clues and their answers kept me calm.

Once I started to recognize all these things, I decided the puzzle and I had finished our courting phase, and it was time to commit. I could have bought a book of them. Instead, I paid $40 for a yearly subscription to the app, because it gave me the twitchy, thumb-driven satisfaction that I would like to wean myself off but never will. Crossword purists may read this and scoff, but I will scoff right back. The app is delightful. It plays a fun little tune when you complete a puzzle, it has an archive going back to 1993, it has mini puzzles, and it sends you a notification when the next day’s puzzle is available. It also compiles your playing statistics, which, if you are a competitive menace like me, is profoundly satisfying. It is one of two premium services I pay for — the other is Spotify — and I consider it a much better use of my money than giving Amazon Prime $119 for Jeff Bezos’ “establish luxury space condos” pile.

Now that we are well acquainted, I turn to the crossword app in times of need, which is to say when I want to mindlessly scroll through Twitter. If I’m waiting for the doctor, the train, a friend at a bar, or any other interminably boring but necessary human activity, I pull up the crossword. Instead of reading things that make me angry, I learn facts both pointless (nicknames for Yale) and pleasing (luging became an Olympic sport in 1964). I discover new words (ELAN, EOSIN) and see wacky and occasionally idiotic ways of using words I already know. I marvel at the *Times’ *talent for sounding like [Lenny Wosniak](&lt;|url|&gt;) when it repeatedly uses the word BAE.

I’ve never been someone who has hobbies, and this is the closest I’ll come to one. My mother always tells me to meditate, but I prefer to do the crossword. It accomplishes the same thing: gently nudging me to set aside time each day to separate from the rest of the world, from my problems, worries, and neuroses. It’s not directly tethered to the other parts of my life, which makes it sacred.

But like anything else, my relationship to it has changed over time. With practice, I’ve gotten comfortable enough to solve through Thursday. (They get progressively more difficult as you go through the week.) I still fear the Friday and Saturday puzzles, but I’m slowly getting better. I’ve started doing the Sunday on paper with a group of friends, because it’s far too big for a tiny phone screen. And I’ve loosened my rules on looking things up. Now, I don’t beat myself up for it — as long as I learn something new and interesting in the process, it doesn’t matter how I come to an answer.

But enough of this: I’ve got a crossword to finish. Do you know a five-letter answer for “Verses versus verses events”? I certainly don’t. You win this time, Shortz.

# Home Internet Is Becoming a Luxury for the Wealthy

## Poorer Americans are increasingly reliant on smartphones as their primary way to access the internet

![Photo: Boston Globe/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Boston Globe/Getty Images*

There’s a growing divide between the rich and the poor when it comes to how they access the internet.

In the United States, people with higher incomes are maintaining home internet connections — think broadband services for a desktop computer — while those making less than $30,000 a year are increasingly reliant on their smartphones, according to a [new report](&lt;|url|&gt;) from the Pew Research Center.

Though the number of people who have high-speed internet in their homes is rising overall, a larger portion of lower-income people are using smartphones as their only way to get online compared to [previous years](&lt;|url|&gt;).

This year, 26% of U.S. adults who earn less than $30,000 said they’re “smartphone only” internet users. That’s up from 12% in 2013, 20% in 2015, and 21% in 2016. The number of smartphone-reliant people in the top income bracket of $75,000 sits at 6% — relatively unchanged from 5% in 2013.

Hispanic and black adults in the U.S. also have higher rates of being “smartphone only.” In 2019, 23% of black and 25% of Hispanic adults only had a smartphone and no home broadband.

One interesting wrinkle: The numbers reflecting smartphone dependency are slightly lower this year compared to 2018. Monica Anderson, senior researcher at Pew and author of the 2019 report, says the overall narrative remains the same, however.

“I would say that even though we’ve seen a small dip (down 3 percentage) in smartphone-dependency [overall], that the story around smartphone dependency being more common among lower-income or black and Hispanics, for example, remains the same,” Anderson says.

She also notes that not all changes in sub-groups are statistically significant, as the 2019 data had a smaller sample size than 2018.

![](<|image|>)

Meanwhile, 92% of U.S. adults surveyed in 2019 who make more than $75,000 a year have internet in their homes, while 56% of people who make less than $30,000 a year do.

![](<|image|>)

This divide makes it crucial for certain websites, like government services or job boards, to function properly on mobile browsers. Indeed, U.S. government [reports](&lt;|url|&gt;) have shown that people are increasingly accessing federal services on smartphones, and in 2018 the U.S. passed the [Connected Government Act](&lt;|url|&gt;), requiring federal services to have mobile-friendly websites.

There are other issues for using smartphones as a primary way of connecting to the internet, including data caps and the ability to fill out online forms required for tasks like [job applications](&lt;|url|&gt;), according to other Pew research. Smartphones are less than ideal for multitasking or using some proprietary software, including potential educational tools or portals for younger students.

It’s crucial that technology accommodates not only those with access to laptops and desktops. If it doesn’t, those with lower incomes will pay the price.<|endoftext|>

# Apple vs. Facebook Enters a New Era

## Apple vs. Facebook Enters a New Era

### *With two pivots on the horizon, here’s what you should know*

![Image: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty](<|image|>)*Image: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty*

People are expected to draw a line between public and private life — it’s why you (probably) don’t go to the office in your slippers and underwear. There’s a fundamental expectation that the companies we interact with every day can manage that divide as well.

Some tech companies understand this dichotomy better than others. Facebook hasn’t traditionally cared much for it, [for example](&lt;|url|&gt;), while Apple has [bent over backwards](&lt;|url|&gt;) to market privacy features. But the tide may be shifting, depending on how you interpret some recent product announcements. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently [committed himself](&lt;|url|&gt;) to “building a privacy-focused” platform, while Apple [announced a slate of new services](&lt;|url|&gt;) that a different, less scrupulous company might use to harvest user data.

At this pivotal moment, it’s worth examining how the two approaches differ and what users might realistically expect as we enter a new era for these technology giants.

For starters, take Apple’s new services. In all these products—from original TV shows to magazines, games, and banking—understanding performance, user metrics, and activities is crucial to success. Magazines in News+ will rely on ad sales to make money. Advertisers may demand detailed metrics not just on overall impressions but also on which magazines and ads users looked at next. And then there’s Apple Card, the company’s waltz into the world of banking, backed by Goldman Sachs and Mastercard — you can imagine the potential issues there.

Apple has done its best to make its position on your data across all these services abundantly clear: It has no interest, and your privacy still comes first.
> # None of these services rely on advertising to drive revenue for Apple.

It may be easy for Apple to maintain that commitment since none of these services rely on advertising to drive revenue for Apple. Though much was said about Apple’s revenue split with publishers on its News+ subscription service, it reportedly allows those publishers to [keep 100%](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the ad revenue they generate. For the most part, Apple will collect monthly fees for its services, except for its banking program. The financial instrument Apple plans to launch later this year will put the company to its greatest test, as partners Goldman Sachs and Mastercard will be involved with those Apple Card transactions.

Apple [has said](&lt;|url|&gt;) Goldman Sachs “will never sell your data to third parties for marketing and advertising,” but it hasn’t addressed the obvious fact that Goldman Sachs can see your transaction data.

The reality is that data privacy is a daily test for companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, and many others. Needless to say, they fail that test from time to time. Earlier this month, *Bloomberg* [reported on](&lt;|url|&gt;) millions of Facebook user records sitting unprotected on a publicly accessible server.

As it prepares for its next act, the social network needs to reverse years of insisting that [privacy is no longer the social norm](&lt;|url|&gt;). Zuckerberg now says he expects communication between Facebook friends to shift to the more private Facebook Messenger platform, a chat system he plans to rebuild so that it adheres to the end-to-end encryption architecture popularized on WhatsApp.

Facebook’s radical shift comes after years of rapid expansion that involves swallowing as much data about us as possible, while selling much of it — anonymized, of course — to advertisers. That business strategy is essentially the foundation of Facebook’s financial success. Advertising [drives around 90%](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the company’s revenue. It was hard to imagine Facebook ever doing anything to threaten that revenue stream.

“For a really long time, privacy was positioned as a barrier to innovation,” says Michelle De Mooy, former director of the Privacy and Data Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology. She adds that even after [the Cambridge Analytica scandal](&lt;|url|&gt;), Facebook’s privacy efforts were more focused on marketing than actual product updates.

It’s no wonder why: The product is based on ads. On the other hand, Apple has traditionally sold us hardware — phones, tablets, laptops, etc. — and subscription software services that support them. It has a very direct revenue pipeline and hasn’t sold advertising for [most](&lt;|url|&gt;) of its history. Apple builds privacy into its hardware and software because it has virtually no need for consumer data.

Still, Apple does have a relationship with many of the companies accused of the greatest privacy abuses. Facebook’s products live in the App Store and run on the iPhone, iPad, and MacBooks. The same goes for Google’s apps and, yes, Safari’s default search engine: Google.

On the other hand, Apple’s disinterest in your data has led to it developing its growing list of services and apps differently. While Google sends every query to its cloud, Apple manages its intelligence locally. While Google may be the default search engine in Safari, the web browser still has some protections that Google Chrome, for example, doesn’t.

Safari blocks third-party cookies and cross-site tracking by default. Since tracking codes and behaviors change regularly, Safari uses local machine learning to identify and cordon off trackers, renaming them so other sites can’t identify the trackers, essentially neutering their cross-site tracking capabilities. (Deleting all cookies on a single-site experience could result in a vastly diminished experience. For example, a banking site might lose your identity from page to page without a cookie.)
> # “If you’re a company that really believes privacy is a fundamental human right, then you’d be locking down or kicking out apps that are leaking data.”

Even in cases where information does leave your iPhone, Apple transforms it so that it knows as little about your activities as possible. In the case of Maps, Apple snips off the origin and destination of turn-by-turn queries sent to Maps.

Of course, all of this is rendered moot by certain third-party apps. I consider Apple’s app review system one of the best, if not the best, in the business, but there have been bad privacy actors on the platform.

“The fact that they have an app review is really good,” De Mooy says, “but if you’re a company that really believes privacy is a fundamental human right, then you’d be locking down or kicking out apps that are leaking data or not following values that Apple is stating.”

Apple does act when alerted to companies running afoul of its data collection guidelines, as Facebook did in February when Apple kicked a handful of Facebook’s [corporate apps off the App Store](&lt;|url|&gt;). But acting after the fact is not the same as catching these data-sucking apps before adding them to the store.

The inescapable fact of data privacy in the tech industry is that if your business is advertising, you cannot survive without consumer data. It’s the oxygen you breathe. When you sell hardware directly to consumers, as Apple has for most of its existence, it’s less of an obvious concern. The company’s services pivot, however, means that the work to maintain control of user data may no longer be as effortless.

Which brings me back to the sea change Zuckerberg is proposing for Facebook. Even if Facebook becomes a million tiny private hubs where only small groups or individuals share their secrets, there will always be a public side to Facebook.

As Andrew Burt notes in the [*Harvard Business Review](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, Zuckerberg’s proposals suffer from a number of fundamental flaws, not the least of which is that the needs of Facebook do not align with those of its users.

Facebook’s need for time, attention, and data, Burt says, means it has to keep users engaged with the platform. In addition, there’s not much Facebook can do about its scale. The service is so big, with so many users, that “massive failures — related to cybersecurity, privacy, propaganda, and more — are simply inevitable.”

Even if Facebook somehow solves these issues, it can’t afford to change user interaction without completely remaking itself.

“Facebook was built to be a surveillance platform with invisible tentacles all over the internet gathering information about aspects of people’s lives,” De Mooy says. “Changing that model will mean a complete upheaval, from the company’s culture to the training the engineers receive to the coding and software to the UX/UI design and monetization strategies.”

Perhaps the solution lies in Facebook leaning even further into the old Apple way, selling more hardware to consumers to decouple a bit from user data and make up the data-selling ad revenue shortfall. The company is already selling Oculus VR headsets and the new Portal. (Portal comes with its own [privacy concerns](&lt;|url|&gt;), of course.) The model could work, but only if Facebook can figure out how to disentangle its hardware from its ad business. [That’s already a struggle.](&lt;|url|&gt;) No matter how Facebook does it, the privacy changes Zuckerberg and company seek to create could take years.

In the realm of privacy, Apple will continue to have the upper hand simply by being vigilant and maintaining a focus on hardware. It’s a path that Facebook cannot easily follow.<|endoftext|>

# Sexual Health Apps Can’t Replace Real Sex Talk

## Sexual Health Apps Can’t Replace Real Sex Talk

### *What a new service that purports to confirm users are taking HIV prevention medication gets wrong about relationships*

![Credit: serezniy/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: serezniy/Getty Images*

*In I/O, columnist Lux Alptraum explores how technology intersects with sexuality and relationships. I/O will embrace the uncertainty of our future and help us craft a better tomorrow, together.*

Back in 1984, during the early days of the HIV epidemic, Armistead Maupin’s novel *Babycakes* imagined a service that would help people partner up amid the crisis. “How do you let someone you are interested know that YOU ARE SAFE?” *Babycakes*’ fictional ad copy reads. “Now you can let others know simply by wearing your ‘I’M SAFE’ ring or pendant.”

Now 35 years later, dating with HIV is wildly different. HIV tests have gotten more accurate, enabling doctors to detect positive status within weeks of infection, rather than months. Major advances in treatment have made it possible for HIV+ people to live full, healthy lives. And medications like Truvada (also known as PrEP) help HIV– people have sex with HIV+ partners without fear of infection.

Even with all this progress, however, there’s still a market for products that purport to help people navigate tricky conversations about sexual health—or avoid having them in the first place. UrSure, a urine test that confirms the presence of PrEP in the body, recently partnered with Healthvana, a health app that helps people keep track of their lab results, to offer something of a modern approach to *Babycakes*’ ring.
> # “If the purpose [of showing a partner your test results] is that you believe you can further control the situation with another human, you’re doing it wrong.”

“Dating is hard to begin with, and those who have HIV or an STD need to be as careful as those who do not,” the press release declares. “Most sites allow users to self-report they are being treated or are on PrEP for HIV, but how can you prove it to your new date?” The press releases answers its own question in short order, noting that it’s now possible to show potential partners a screenshot from the Healthvana app that “proves” you’re adhering to your medication regimen.

![A sample screenshot from the Healthvana app depicting one’s sexual health.](<|image|>)*A sample screenshot from the Healthvana app depicting one’s sexual health.*

The partnership is hardly surprising in an era where tech has infiltrated every aspect of our daily lives, but the idea is misguided. Granted, there are some significant differences between *Babycakes*’* *ring and a time-stamped, physician-certified lab result that confirms PrEP adherence. But both of these sales pitches promise consumers an easy way to outsource a challenging and uncomfortable discussion that everyone needs to have with their potential (or current) sexual partners. Simply put, there is no screenshot-friendly solution to the complicated risks of sex in 2019.

Our susceptibility to these sorts of promises—which have popped up elsewhere, like the “STD-verified” dating app [NeatClub](&lt;|url|&gt;)—is worth considering more deeply. Decades into the AIDS epidemic, why are people turning to apps to gauge their partners’ trustworthiness? Though our culture feels increasingly open about sex, many of us still have difficulty talking honestly about it, even with someone we’re about to have sex with.

Bryan Stacy, the CEO and co-founder of Biem, an [STI testing telemedicine platform](&lt;|url|&gt;), has seen firsthand how quickly users jump on the possibility that technology can help them sidestep challenging conversations. “When we first launched Biem, a lot of people were like, ‘Why don’t you create a dating website with this?’” Stacy tells me over the phone. (He dismisses the notion as “ridiculous.”)

While Stacy does see some value in enabling people to use STI treatment and testing apps to open up conversations with their partners, communication needs to extend beyond the quick flash of a screenshot.

“Anything that’s going to allow that conversation additional validity, additional reason to have the conversation, is good news,” says Stacy. “But—it’s a big but—it is not a proof; it is not a validation of somebody being STI-free. All it is, really, really simply, is proof that somebody is sexually health conscious.
> # Sexual behavior is far too complicated and unpredictable to be reduced to a single test result.

“If the purpose [of showing a partner your test results] is that you believe you can further control the situation with another human, you’re doing it wrong,” Stacy continues.

As useful as test results can be, they only provide a snapshot of someone’s health rather than an ongoing illustration of their sexual behavior and choices. It may be comforting to think we can ensure our safety just by pulling up a screenshot that confirms that someone has tested negative for an STI or proved compliant with their PrEP regimen, but sexual behavior is far too complicated and unpredictable to be reduced to a single test result.

Yes, knowing that your partner is actually sticking to their daily PrEP routine—and that their urine tests show that the medication is in their system—can be comforting, but that screenshot doesn’t tell you much beyond the fact that they were routinely taking their medication at the time their urine was analyzed. It may not be relevant to the moment you see the screenshot, in other words.

When I chat with Ramin Bastani and Dr. Giffin Daughtridge, respectively the CEOs of Healthvana and UrSure, they’re far more measured about the potential of their products than the press release I received would suggest.

For Daughtridge, the ability to confirm someone’s adherence to PrEP is a powerful tool, enabling people who are on the drug to offer their partners an objective measure of their compliance—something that can feel important when many people who claim to be on PrEP aren’t actually sticking to the regimen. And yet, Daughtridge notes, PrEP requires rigorous adherence to be effective: If you don’t take your pill every day at the same time, you might not be protected. And as a result, last week’s results aren’t any guarantee of continued compliance with one’s medication regimen. At best, UrSure is one part of an ongoing, long-term conversation about sexual health practices—not a permanent guarantee of a partner’s HIV– status.

“It’s better than the status quo,” Bastani says. “A lot of times you have self-reported information,” which can be unreliable, particularly when it comes to something like PrEP adherence. Based on current usage, Bastani is hopeful that the combination of Healthvana and UrSure will enable users to kickstart a conversation about how they’re taking responsibility for their sexual health—rather than shut down the conversation entirely.

Sex and dating will always be fraught with risk and anxiety, and even more so when health concerns are in the mix. But staying safe requires taking responsibility for our own needs, having honest and vulnerable conversations, and allowing ourselves to trust people. There’s no app for that, and it’s unlikely there ever will be.<|endoftext|>

# The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet

## This is also what the internet is becoming: a dark forest

![Photo by [Rosie Fraser](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Rosie Fraser](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

In his sci-fi trilogy *The Three Body Problem*, author Liu Cixin presents the dark forest theory of the universe.

When we look out into space, the theory goes, we’re struck by its silence. It seems like we’re the only ones here. After all, if other forms of life existed, wouldn’t they show themselves? Since they haven’t, we assume there’s no one else out there.

Liu invites us to think about this a different way.

Imagine a dark forest at night. It’s deathly quiet. Nothing moves. Nothing stirs. This could lead one to assume that the forest is devoid of life. But of course, it’s not. The dark forest is full of life. It’s quiet because night is when the predators come out. To survive, the animals stay silent.

Is our universe an empty forest or a dark one? If it’s a dark forest, then only Earth is foolish enough to ping the heavens and announce its presence. The rest of the universe already knows the real reason why the forest stays dark. It’s only a matter of time before the Earth learns as well.

This is also what the internet is becoming: a dark forest.

In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the internet, and away from the mainstream.

This very piece is an example of this. This theory was first shared on a [private channel](&lt;|url|&gt;) sent to 500 people who I know or who have explicitly chosen to receive it. This is the online environment in which I feel most secure. Where I can be my most “real self.”
> # These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments.

Podcasts are another example. There, meaning isn’t just expressed through language, but also through intonation and interaction. Podcasts are where a bad joke can still be followed by a self-aware and self-deprecating save. It’s a more forgiving space for communication than the internet at large.

Dark forests like newsletters and podcasts are growing areas of activity. As are other dark forests, like Slack channels, private Instagrams, invite-only message boards, text groups, Snapchat, WeChat, and on and on. This is where Facebook is pivoting with Groups (and trying to redefine what the word “privacy” means in the process).

These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments. The cultures of those spaces have more in common with the physical world than the internet.

The internet of today is a battleground. The idealism of the ’90s web is gone. The web 2.0 utopia — where we all lived in rounded filter bubbles of happiness — ended with the 2016 Presidential election when we learned that the tools we thought were only life-giving could be weaponized too. The public and semi-public spaces we created to develop our identities, cultivate communities, and gain knowledge were overtaken by forces using them to gain power of various kinds (market, political, social, and so on).

This is the atmosphere of the mainstream web today: a relentless competition for power. As this competition has grown in size and ferocity, an increasing number of the population has scurried into their dark forests to avoid the fray.

The web 2.0 era has been replaced by a new “Web²” era. An age where we simultaneously live in many different internets, whose numbers increase hourly. The dark forests are growing.

The dark forests grow because they provide psychological and reputational cover. They allow us to be ourselves because we know who else is there. Compared to the free market communication style of the mass channels — with their high risks, high rewards, and limited moderation — dark forest spaces are more Scandinavian in their values and the social and emotional security they provide. They cap the downsides of looking bad and the upsides of our best jokes by virtue of a contained audience.

This is a trade more and more people are looking to make.

### **The Bowling Alley Theory of the Internet**

I went dark on the internet a few years ago. I took social apps off my phone, unfollowed everyone, the whole shebang. This was without a doubt a good decision. I’ve been happier and have had better control over my time since. Many others have done this and are doing this. A generation of modern wannabe monks.

But even as my personal wellness grows, I see a risk in this change.

You could argue that these decisions removed me from the arena. I detached from the mainstream of conversation. I stopped watching TV. I stopped looking at Facebook and Twitter. I silenced my voice on the platforms where the conversation was happening because of the strings, risks, and side effects they created in return.

This detachment wasn’t just in politics. It was also true of how I shared my personal life. Milestones for me and my family were left unshared beyond our internet dark forests, even though many more friends and members of our families would’ve been happy to hear about them.
> # Those of us building dark forests risk underestimating how powerful the mainstream channels will continue to be.

Not sharing was my choice, of course, and I didn’t question it. My alienation from the mainstream was their loss, not mine. But did this choice also deprive me of some greater reward?

Not everyone who joined a bowling league (when people did such things) loved bowling. Many loved being with other people first and bowling came second or not at all. Being together is what mattered. The venue did not.

This is the Bowling Alley Theory of the Internet: that people are online purely to meet each other, and in the long run the venues where we congregate are an unimportant background compared to the interactions themselves. Did we meet on MySpace, Tinder, or LinkedIn? Does it matter?

When I went offline for reasons of personal wellness and productivity, I stopped going to the bowling alleys altogether. But lately, I’ve started to question that decision.

I’m reminded of what happened in the 1970s when the hippies — bruised and bloodied from the culture wars of the ‘60s — retreated into self-help, wellness, and personal development, as Adam Curtis documents in his series [*The Century of Self](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. While they turned inward, the winners of the ‘60s culture wars took society’s reins. A focus on personal wellness created an unintended side effect: a retreat from the public arena, and a shift in the distribution of power ever since.

It’s possible, I suppose, that a shift away from the mainstream internet and into the dark forests could permanently limit the mainstream’s influence. It could delegitimize it. In some ways that’s the story of the internet’s effect on broadcast television. But we forget how powerful television still is. And those of us building dark forests risk underestimating how powerful the mainstream channels will continue to be, and how minor our havens are compared to their immensity.

The influence of Facebook, Twitter, and others is enormous and not going away. There’s a reason why Russian military focused on these platforms when they wanted to manipulate public opinion: they have a real impact. The meaning and tone of these platforms changes with who uses them. What kind of bowling alley it is depends on who goes there.

Should a significant percentage of the population abandon these spaces, that will leave nearly as many eyeballs for those who are left to influence, and limit the influence of those who departed on the larger world they still live in.

If the dark forest isn’t dangerous already, these departures might ensure it will be.

# You Can Now Get Your Whole Genome Sequenced for Less Than an iPhone

## But will people buy it — and is all that genetic information actually worth it?

![Images: Veritas](<|image|>)*Images: Veritas*

Veritas Genetics is making a big bet that people want to know what’s in their genome.

The[ Boston-based company](&lt;|url|&gt;), which started offering whole genome sequencing in 2016 for $999 — the first company to do so below four figures — announced today that it is lowering the price to $599. For much less than the price of the latest iPhone model, consumers can get a full readout of their DNA.

Veritas’ move is a clear signal that genetic sequencing technology is getting cheaper as it becomes more automated — but whether people will want to know about the disease risks that may lurk in their genomes is yet to be seen. But Veritas thinks its new price point will be low enough to convince customers that decoding their entire genome is worth it.

“This price point will change the paradigm of how people look at genomics and how they access it,” Mirza Cifric, CEO of Veritas, told *OneZero*.

Whole genome sequencing is the process of spelling out a person’s entire DNA sequence, all 6 billion letters. By contrast, most consumer genetic tests, including 23andMe and AncestryDNA, use a less comprehensive technique called genotyping, which only decodes a few specific genes of interest. It’s the difference between reading the entire book of life versus just a few pages.

In 2003, after 13 years and an estimated $2.7 billion, an [international research effort](&lt;|url|&gt;) completed sequencing the first human genome. The project provided researchers with more insight into human genes and their functions than ever before, but it wasn’t long before the industry realized the financial value of the decoded genome. By 2007, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company called Knome had introduced the first direct-to-consumer genome sequencing test for $350,000. A few years later, San Diego company Illumina, which manufactures the most widely used sequencing machines in the U.S., began offering genome sequencing to consumers with a doctor’s permission at an initial price of around $50,000.
> # Veritas’ whole genome product — dubbed myGenome — gives customers information on more than around 200 health conditions and 80 genes, including 20 so-called highly actionable ones.

From there, it was a race to the “$1,000 genome,” a slogan that became a goal for the burgeoning genetic sequencing industry. Illumina claimed that achievement in 2014 when it said it was able to produce the[ first genome for $1,000](&lt;|url|&gt;) — but that referred to the cost of generating the data and interpreting it, not the higher price it charged labs and hospitals.

Veritas’ whole genome product — dubbed myGenome — gives customers information on more than 200 health conditions and 80 genes, including 20 so-called highly actionable ones, like whether you have certain alterations in the BRCA genes that raise your risk of breast and ovarian cancers or whether you carry genetic mutations associated with Long QT syndrome, a potentially life-threatening heart rhythm condition. The report also reveals how effectively you metabolize or potentially react to 170 drugs, and whether you’re a carrier for 40 genetic conditions that can be passed on to future children, including cystic fibrosis, hereditary deafness, and Tay-Sachs disease. The test requires a physician sign-off. You can get it from your own doctor, or you can pay an additional $129 to get authorization from a partner doctor who works with Veritas.

![](<|image|>)

Back in November, Veritas offered its myGenome product for $199 as a pre-Thanksgiving promotion. The sale was supposed to last two days, but the 1,000 genomes Veritas was offering as part of the campaign sold out in just six hours — proof to the company that there was consumer demand for cheap whole genome sequencing. For comparison, 23andMe — which has [more than 10 million customers](&lt;|url|&gt;) — charges $199 for its combined health and ancestry test, which looks at a person’s genetic predisposition for 12 different conditions, including late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s, celiac, and selected BRCA mutations.

At the time, Cifric said the company was [taking a loss](&lt;|url|&gt;) on those $199 genomes. At $599 a genome, however, he says Veritas is making a small profit, though he wouldn’t comment on how much it actually costs the company to do the sequencing. (As a private company, Veritas doesn’t release financial data.) But Cifric says it has been able to reduce the cost of sequencing in part thanks to machine learning and artificial intelligence tools, like Google’s [DeepVariant](&lt;|url|&gt;), which have helped automate the interpretation of genetic data.

Veritas says it will make additional money off a new subscription model it plans to launch this fall. Customers who purchase Veritas’ $599 myGenome offering will have the option of paying a monthly fee around the price of a Netflix or Spotify subscription to get regular bulletins about their genome, updated with the pace of genetic research.

“As the science is rapidly increasing, people are interested in staying at the cutting edge of knowing about their genomics and how it affects their lives,” Cifric says.

What Veritas hopes is that users will repeatedly return to its online portal and mobile app to continue exploring their genome. It’s not a new business model, however. The genomics company Helix rolled out a DNA “app store” in 2017. Customers paid an initial $80 to sequence a portion of their genome called the exome — the 2% that contains most of the known important genes. That information was then stored by Helix and given out to other companies selling DNA “apps” on the Helix platform. Those apps ranged from tests grounded in medical genetics, like ones that revealed your risk for inherited cholesterol and heart problems, to more whimsical (and less scientific) ones, like those that claimed to tell you your wine preferences based on your DNA.

But Helix recently [pivoted away from the consumer market](&lt;|url|&gt;), saying that it would instead work with health care providers. And Color Genomics, which offers a $249 genetic cancer risk test that can be ordered like Veritas’ test, has decided to shift its focus from individual consumers to large health care organizations. It’s a sign that companies in the genetic sequencing space think they can reach more patients through health care partners — and perhaps, that ordinary consumers are more interested in their ancestry results than genetic health information.

Veritas thinks it can succeed where others couldn’t because the company provides more health data per dollar than others in the space. But even at $999 — Veritas’ older price point — consumers weren’t clamoring to get their entire genomes sequenced. Veritas says that since 2016 it has sold between 4,000 to 5,000 genomes directly to individual consumers. That doesn’t include genomes ordered by researchers or through the company’s partnerships with health care organizations, like the Mayo Clinic. At $599, the company projects it will sell between 15,000 and 20,000 genomes this year on the consumer side alone.

“Moving from $1,000 to $600 will absolutely lower the bar,” says Gary Gustavsen, partner and managing director at Health Advances, a health care consulting firm, who’s not involved with Veritas. “I think we’ll see more patients and even a lot of healthy people ordering these tests.”

Whole genome sequencing is increasingly being employed for patients who have cancer, serious genetic diseases, or symptoms that doctors can’t explain. The test can help determine the genetic drivers of disease, providing diagnoses and guiding treatment. But it’s far from clear how useful such tests are for otherwise healthy people, and most doctors aren’t trained to communicate complicated and often uncertain genetic results to patients. And because many diseases can have both genetic and environmental causes, it’s often hard for physicians to make specific health recommendations to patients based off genetic data.

“The concern is that we’re opening Pandora’s box,” Gustavsen says. “A lot of physicians are not recommending that healthy patients receive widespread genetic testing at this point.” Plus, insurers don’t always cover it.

But George Church, the prominent Harvard geneticist who co-founded Veritas and started Knome before it, thinks of genome sequencing like an insurance policy. “Insurance will pay you if something bad happens to you,” he says. “Here you pay a fraction of that. This is to avoid something bad happening to you.”

![](<|image|>)

From whole genome sequencing, you could find out whether you have a higher risk of developing a certain condition like cancer, which might then prompt you to take preventive measures like exercising more, changing your diet, or getting certain health screenings. Church, who has sequenced his own genome, says the process can also help advise prospective parents of their risk of passing on certain genetic conditions to their children.

Another one of Church’s companies, [Nebula Genomics](&lt;|url|&gt;), offers a free version of genome sequencing to customers, but only if they answer detailed questions about themselves, including family medical history and drinking habits, and agree to share their genomes with researchers who subsidize the cost of sequencing. Nebula’s offering also isn’t the clinical-grade sequencing that Veritas is selling, the kind that is used in medicine and research, but rather what’s known as “low-pass” genome sequencing, a cheaper option that doesn’t provide as much information.

But while an expert like Church can understand what his genetic data means, some in the medical community worry that the health risk information from whole genome sequencing could be confusing, stressful, or even overwhelming to ordinary people who aren’t suffering from an obvious disease. For instance, there’s a risk that people could take extreme or unnecessary preventive measures like getting a mastectomy if they find out they have a BRCA mutation. Testing positive for a mutation in a disease-causing gene doesn’t mean you have that disease or will ever develop it. And at the same time, just because sequencing doesn’t reveal a potentially harmful mutation now doesn’t mean you don’t have one that has yet to be discovered. Geneticists are still identifying new genes and learning about how different genetic alterations and interactions can cause disease.

Though Veritas’ price drop will likely net it a new class of customers, the cost of DNA sequencing has been plummeting for years and is almost certain to continue falling. But price may prove less of a barrier than expertise — masses of genetic data won’t prove truly useful to average consumers until health care providers can figure out how to deliver results to patients and turn that information into actionable medical advice. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will make genetic sequencing faster and cheaper, but it still takes doctors to make meaning of it all.<|endoftext|>

# Why Angry Taylor Swift Fans Lash Out Online

## Why Angry Taylor Swift Fans Lash Out Online

### *Fandom is all about community — even when it gets toxic*

![Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty*

Last week, I made a huge mistake. I tweeted [something negative](&lt;|url|&gt;) about Taylor Swift’s new single.


It was only 10 minutes or so before the Swifties found me. I counted them — 50 total Twitter users, 45 of whom identified themselves as fans in their bios, handles, banner photos, or profile photos. That isn’t a huge number as Twitter warfare goes, but at the time it felt like an army, a massive swarm of pastel-clad, smiling blondes descending upon me.

Some accused me of being [bitter](&lt;|url|&gt;). One [sarcastically thanked](&lt;|url|&gt;) me for promoting the song. Another told me I couldn’t even “[make the front page](&lt;|url|&gt;)” (of what, I’m unsure) while Taylor’s song shot to number one on the charts. (I will concede that Taylor Swift’s career is doing better than mine.) Several accused me of [being sexist](&lt;|url|&gt;), and others were genuinely funny, like [the one](&lt;|url|&gt;) from the Taylor Swift fan, also known as a Swifty, who said, “Sis she’s been with the same man for 3 years. Your last date was a stained futon and ramen.” (I’ve been in a relationship for nine years and, blessedly, no longer have a futon — just a [couch that I really hate](&lt;|url|&gt;).)

![](<|image|>)

The tweets were generally harmless, but they were a nuisance, like walking through a cloud of gnats at the park. And, I thought, I couldn’t relate at all to the people who sent them. Why did they define their entire Twitter presence by this one pop star? Why were they so upset that I, a self-professed fan, didn’t like her newest song? What compelled them to flock to their idol’s defense — a conventionally attractive, blonde, white woman worth an approximate [$400 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) who certainly doesn’t need defending from anonymous Twitter hordes?
> # It isn’t that Taylor Swift fans are unhinged lunatics, although you could argue they’re a little sensitive. Their behavior is human, built on a very natural desire to belong and feel understood.

Because what these fans missed is that my disappointment in “ME!” stemmed from my own years-long love of Taylor Swift. Though I’ve never considered myself a Swifty, her music has resonated with me since she released *Fearless* in 2008. A song as obnoxious and headache-inducing as “ME!” is a blight on her canon.

It isn’t that Taylor Swift fans are unhinged lunatics, although you could argue they’re a little sensitive. Their behavior is human, built on a very natural desire to belong and feel understood. Even after spending several days reading studies and talking to researchers about fan behavior, I can’t quite shake my irritation at the event — I’d rather not be swarmed by anyone — though I get it now. Fandom, and the online swarming behavior often associated with it, exists to strengthen interpersonal bonds and make participants feel like they’re part of something larger than themselves. It’s not so different from any other clique or community, though when fans converge on critics, or others they view as threats, it can certainly appear that it is.

For fandoms, the community is as important, or even more important, than the object of the fandom itself. That sense of community is one of the driving forces behind fandom. It’s also the main difference between fandom participants and fanship participants.

Research conducted [in 2010](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that fandom and fanship are two distinct, but related, modes of being. [Fanship](&lt;|url|&gt;) is more related to the object than the community, and delineates how much interest and attachment a fan has for the object, such as Taylor Swift. Fandom, on the other hand, is about how close to the community that has sprung up around the object a fan feels, and how important that community is to them.

So while I consider myself a *Game of Thrones* fan — I watch the show every week, I identify with the characters, and I [consume](&lt;|url|&gt;) [content](&lt;|url|&gt;) related to the show — I’m not a participant of the *Game of Thrones* fandom, for whom the show and surrounding community is important to their sense of self.

For fans, feeling part of a cohesive community can be really healthy. “Feeling a sense of connection with a fan interest and belonging to a group of fans is also related to better psychological well-being,” says Stephen Reysen, an associate professor of psychology and special education at Texas A&M University. “Having a supportive social network is often related to better psychological health.”

His [2013 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) looked at the psychological impact of belonging to the furry community and found that furries who engaged in the community, self-identified as furries, and accepted their furry affiliation, had a greater sense of well-being than those who didn’t. The strength and support gleaned from being part of a community helps participants cope with the alienation that members of stigmatized groups, such as furries or those who practice BDSM, often experience. A [2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) supports these findings. It found that participating in the *Harry Potter* fandom helped members feel more secure in their sense of self.

Fandom participants often find strong and long-lasting friendships in fan communities, according to Gayle Stever, an associate professor of social and behavioral sciences at SUNY Empire State College and author of the book [*The Psychology of Celebrity](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. “The bonds that are formed are lifelong and strong, and most often end up having little to do with the original artist who brought them together at all,” she says.

Participants often turn their obsessions into careers, she adds, noting that “a man who organized the very first official Star Trek fan club (back in the 1970s) has gone on to a very successful career in publishing and entertainment.” This may be attributable, in part, to the mentoring that happens within many fandoms, as a [2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) discovered by analyzing thousands of fan fiction comments and reviews. The study found that the overwhelming majority of the fan fiction reviews were positive or offered constructive criticism, and that fan groups provided distinct and significant psychological and social support to their members.
> # To fans, though, it might not feel like bullying but like supporting and defending their community and the object of their fandom against a perceived threat.

Stevers, who has been studying fandoms since the 1980s, noted that she finds the most energetic fan behavior to be performative. “On the Michael Jackson tour in 1989, I went to my very first concert expecting to see frenzied behavior in the crowd and was shocked to see people acting normally,” she says. “As soon as the newsperson and camera were gone, they calmly went back to their conversations… I see a great deal of this behavior as performance behavior, whether for a media camera or for each other.”

Such frenzied behavior has transformed online, in part, into hyperactive bullying and harassment of critics and outsiders. This dynamic has been particularly apparent in recent weeks, as stars like Ariana Grande, Olivia Munn, and Lizzo have either [weaponized](&lt;|url|&gt;) their fandoms or — at best — disregarded their power when lashing out at critics.

To fans, though, it might not feel like bullying but like supporting and defending their community and the object of their fandom against a perceived threat.

“When individuals feel a tight attachment to an in-group, they are particularly wary of any attacks on members of their community, especially when they are anonymous and when they are targeting an anonymous or unknown outsider,” says Nick Brody, an assistant professor of communication studies at the University of Puget Sound who has [studied cyberbullying](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Thus, they are likely swift in their response to attacks.”

Reysen agrees, saying that “fans who are highly identified with the group feel successes and failures of the fan object as though they were happening to them … When a group is threatened they often band together to fight off the threat.”

When I tweet about how much I disliked Taylor Swift’s “ME!” it makes the Taylor Swift fandom feel as if they’re under attack, and they respond in kind. And honestly, I get it. When people complain about my favorite *Game of Thrones* character, for example, (it’s Sansa), I bristle, as if that person were somehow insulting me by extension. Of course, that usually isn’t true, but it sometimes takes a minute before I remind myself that the things that I appreciate and enjoy don’t make up who I am.

But if I were a member of the *Game of Thrones* fandom, spending lots of money on *Game of Thrones*-related objects and events, and forming relationships with others based on that fandom, I, too, might react aggressively to people’s insults.

It’s easy to forget, when confronted by an angry Swifty with a penchant for cyberbullying, that they’re looking for the same thing I am: respect and companionship from a community, wherever we may find it. And although I won’t be sending any wolf emoji to the Sansa haters who plague the internet, I’m always down for [a conversation](&lt;|url|&gt;) about how she’s the real *Game of Thrones* MVP.<|endoftext|>

# To Trust Apple Sign-In, You Need to Trust Apple

## Experts agree that it’s not perfect, but it’s almost certainly better than what you’re using

![](<|image|>)

Apple wants to own the only account you use to sign in to services across the internet. On Monday, the company unveiled [Sign In with Apple](&lt;|url|&gt;), a log-in service similar to those offered by Google and Facebook. Unlike those two, Apple says it will protect your privacy by creating new, anonymized email addresses for each service access via Sign In. That’s all well and good, but there’s a bigger concern to be addressed: Is using your Apple account to sign in to apps and services safe in the first place?

When it launches later this year, Sign In with Apple will let users log in to services on any platform using their Apple account. On the iPhone, [you can even use Face ID or Touch ID](&lt;|url|&gt;) to confirm your identity, which spares you from remembering complex passwords or dealing with randomly generated authentication codes.

For people inside the Apple ecosystem, it could be one of the most secure systems around. If you step outside of Apple’s world, however, security gets a bit weaker.

Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment, but [according to the company’s website](&lt;|url|&gt;), Sign In with Apple will be available on the web, which means it can be used on any non-Apple device, obviously without the protections offered by Face ID or Touch ID. In that case, users will have to rely on the security of their Apple account itself, and it appears they’ll only be able to [protect their account ](&lt;|url|&gt;)with [weaker, SMS-based](&lt;|url|&gt;) two-factor authentication (2FA). That could leave not only their Apple accounts more vulnerable, but any app they log in to with Apple, as well.

Apple’s new sign-in feature — as well as its Google and Facebook counterparts — is what’s known as a “Single Sign-On” (SSO) service. You log in to one product, like your Facebook account, on your computer or phone. Then, when you want to log in to another service on that same device — Spotify, say — Facebook generates a token that confirms your identity. Instead of having to remember passwords for hundreds of different apps, you can remember just one.

It’s an appealing promise, but it’s not flawless. The biggest drawback to SSO — whether it comes from Apple or someone else — is that if there’s a failure in the way you sign in to your primary account, then it can make all your accounts vulnerable. Someone with access to your Facebook account could, for example, [also get in to your Spotify account](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s like putting all your eggs in one basket. Security for your primary SSO account has to be as good or better than all of the other accounts you use it to sign in to.

Fortunately, that is often the case. Google, for example, offers [one-tap](&lt;|url|&gt;) 2FA that lets users tap a single button on their phone to confirm who they are, providing a powerful extra layer of security. This is easier than entering a code with an authenticator app and safer than using SMS. Facebook, on the other hand, has [undermined trust in its own security features](&lt;|url|&gt;) by attaching the phone numbers to users’ personal profiles, but it does offer stronger, app-based 2FA options, too.

Apple currently sits somewhere between these two. When first setting up your account, Apple uses that less safe, SMS-based authentication. After setup, iOS users can rely on Face ID, Touch ID, or pop-up prompts on their phones to confirm their identity, though SMS remains the only option if you don’t own an Apple product.

Despite all the options, many people practice poor security hygiene. In 2017, when the Pew Research Center [conducted a study about cybersecurity](&lt;|url|&gt;), 39% of adults in the United States used the same or very similar passwords across many sites, while an overwhelming 86% of them kept track of passwords by simply memorizing them. [Both of these are inherently unsafe options](&lt;|url|&gt;). Reusing the same password means that if someone gets access to one of your accounts, they could have access to many of them. And the simpler a password is, the easier it is for an attacker to crack it.
> # You don’t just have to trust that your individual account is secure; you have to trust that the company’s servers are safe.

The best password is a long, complicated one that even you don’t know. Ideally, you’d store it in a password manager — but the key is to differentiate for each website. Even the CEO of password manager [Dashlane](&lt;|url|&gt;), Emmanuel Schalit, admits that kicking the poor password habit is more important than using the perfect system.

“It is much better for someone to use something other than the same password everywhere, without a doubt,” Schalit says.

However, he also points out that SSO systems are vulnerable to attacks that password managers aren’t. In September 2018, Facebook disclosed a massive breach wherein hackers stole SSO security tokens for [tens of millions of accounts](&lt;|url|&gt;). This token let attackers trick Facebook’s servers into believing they logged in to vulnerable accounts legitimately, highlighting another flaw with SSO: You don’t just have to trust that your individual account is secure — you have to trust that the company’s servers are safe. After Facebook spent most of 2018 dealing with [breach](&lt;|url|&gt;) after [breach](&lt;|url|&gt;) after [breach](&lt;|url|&gt;), that can be a tough sell.

This means that whether any given SSO is “safe” can depend heavily on how much you trust the company you’re using. On this front, Apple might fare better than its competitors. Earlier this year, Apple dealt with [a major FaceTime bug](&lt;|url|&gt;) that may have allowed bad actors to listen in on your microphone, but nothing quite so serious as millions of Facebook accounts being exposed.

As Matias Woloski, CTO of identity management platform [Auth0](&lt;|url|&gt;), explains, Apple’s track record will go a long way toward building trust. “Apple has a lot of experience in dealing with these types of things,” Woloski says. “They had to work hard to develop their security practices… I would say, not at the level of Google, but it has gotten much better over time.”

Apple is banking on edging out Google by playing the privacy angle. Those other companies, Apple argued in its keynote, will give away your private info every time you use their sign-in button. As mentioned, Sign In with Apple will let you randomly generate an email address to avoid exposing even that level of data, theoretically protecting you from invasive tracking.

Single-use email addresses aren’t a new idea, but the open question is whether Apple can make them intuitive enough that everyday users understand them. “It is not a bad idea to do the kind of things Apple is recommending with disposable emails,” says Schalit. “Our consumer research showed that, conceptually, [people are] still struggling with the idea of randomly generated emails… So, we’ll see if Apple’s able to get traction.”

[According to Apple](&lt;|url|&gt;), its anonymous email feature should work entirely behind the scenes, so users might not even notice a difference. Users will simply tap “hide my email” and Apple will create a middleman email address that forwards any messages you receive from the app to your real email account. You’ll receive emails like normal, but the app never knows your actual address.

Finding that right balance between the best possible security practices and what consumers will actually use isn’t easy. Apple seems to be getting close. You might technically be safer if you use a password manager to randomly generate passwords, enable app-based two-factor authentication everywhere — or better yet, use a physical security key — and never use a single SSO. But that’s a big ask.

Most people will make some compromises on security, and they may have to deal with the consequences eventually. It’s possible that one day someone could breach Apple’s servers and steal users’ tokens, as happened to Facebook.

On the other hand, Apple has made its living on making complicated things easy for the average user. The Macintosh made PCs easy for people who weren’t familiar with “personal computers” and the iPod with iTunes turned managing a complex music library into an everyday task. If using Sign In with Apple means some users stop reusing their simple passwords and keep their email addresses private, the trade-off might be worth it in the long run.<|endoftext|>

# A Vision of the Dark Future of Advertising

## Companies will know more about you than you can even imagine

![Photo by [Thomas Ribaud](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Thomas Ribaud](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

It’s obvious that in 50 years the amount of data collected about us will be much, much larger than it is now. By the middle of the century, all of us will leave a comprehensive, high-definition, information-rich digital exhaust everywhere we go. As the cost of adding computer chips to objects falls, our baby monitors, coffee machines, Fitbits, energy meters, clothes, books, fridges, and facial expressions will all create data points. So will our public spaces, lampposts, storefronts, and traffic lights. A 70-year-old in 2069 will have had most of her life datafied. This is what most analysts complaining about Facebook or Google miss: The profiling and targeting of people has only just started.

Far more powerful computers than we have now will crunch through this. Though Moore’s law, the “[golden rule](&lt;|url|&gt;)” dictating that computing power doubles every two years, has recently [slowed](&lt;|url|&gt;), it’s a safe bet that future computers will be several orders of magnitude more powerful and cheaper than ours.

Far more data plus far better computers equals significantly more sophisticated ways of understanding you. Much of this will involve pattern spotting — supercomputers churning through vast fields of random information to draw weird and unsettling correlations between the data you create and what you like. Though this kind of targeting is already obfuscated to some extent — it can be hard to understand exactly why a particular video has been served to you on YouTube, for example — these correlations will eventually make even less sense to us, creating new ethical problems.
> # People do things, feel things, think things, and buy things for reasons they don’t understand.

The driving force behind this is a simple but powerful point: People do things, feel things, think things, and buy things for reasons they don’t understand. Who knows what correlations will be thrown up? I have no idea, and neither will anyone else. All that matters is that these correlations exist. There is no truth anymore, the experts will say, only inputs and outputs.

Some theoretical examples:

* People aged 30 and 35 who eat eggs on Thursday and have a below average heart rate are more likely to be adrenaline junkies who enjoy…

* People who watched YouTube videos between 7 and 9 a.m. as teenagers and travel by public transit are more likely to be traditionalists and…

Far more of this profiling will be inferred, meaning automated systems will generate insights about people based on their behavior and not because they’ve explicitly stated a preference. Good examples of this in practice today are the psychographic techniques used by Cambridge Analytica. The group calculated personality types based on surveys and cross-referenced the results against Facebook likes to build a predictive personality model based on likes alone. Despite all the outrage, there’s little evidence this actually worked. But at some point, it will.

In fact, psychographics will be just one of a cluster of techniques that extract something personal about you without your knowledge. Your facial expressions give away your innermost feelings. (One area research around this is called emotional analysis, which tries to determine emotional states from images and video via facial expression analysis.) Your Fitbit data, combined with data generated by your clothing, fridge, and smart meter, will determine when you are depressed. I expect inferred data sets will become the big data scandal of the 2030s and 2040s, since it won’t be clear whether this is personal data that should be kept private.

I should quickly add another trend, even though it will be with us far sooner than 2069: total personalization. I don’t know what devices or platforms you’ll be using in 50 years, but any ads you receive through them will be for you and you alone — and not because you’re in a bucket called “*Medium* readers ages 18 to 60 using an Apple device.”

The end result will be ad targeting so effective that you may well question the notion of free will altogether. Via complex analysis that no one will understand, taking in data from your fridge, smart car, work calendar, facial expressions, and toilet, your smart TV will fire off a personalized ad about buying that shiny new handgun just at the moment you’re starting to feel… well, in fact, you won’t know what the reason is. It won’t matter, either.

Of course, politicians will also pick up these techniques, which will present significant questions around manipulation and election legitimacy. But that’s for another essay.

People will complain that it’s unfair, illegal, creepy, a breach of privacy. There will, surely, be a concurrent wave of tech-based countermeasures: personalized [Faraday cages](&lt;|url|&gt;) and facial recognition–blocking masks. I hope someone’s working on these. There may even be a full-scale social rejection of these tracking technologies. But experience suggests this will only delay the development of advanced ad targeting rather than stop it. Privacy, after all, is increasingly about controlling the data that’s collected about you, rather than preventing it from being collected in the first place.

We will also have to decide what to do with the data of the dead. It’s estimated that there will be more dead people than living ones on Facebook by 2065. Should their data be part of the complex algorithm that helps work out other people’s preferences?
> # There is no truth anymore, the experts will say, only inputs and outputs.

But the most significant change of all will be automation. The trends affecting other industries are coming to advertising as well: The future is a fully automated ad creation and delivery system capable of reaching millions of consumers with personalized, dynamic content. Ad people will of course say something warm about intuition and the human touch, and no doubt general strategy and creative direction will be set by the well-paid higher-ups. Premium advertisers will promise “human-only” work. But according to a recent survey, A.I. experts [reckon](&lt;|url|&gt;) there is a 50 percent chance of A.I. outperforming us in all tasks within 50 years. Gifted, intelligent, and talented as I’m sure they are, this presumably includes ad execs.

I anticipate a company called iData, which will stand for something like: Individualized Dynamic Automated Targeting Applications. (I can even imagine its motto: “Know your customers better than they know themselves.”) iData will use natural language generation, a machine learning technique that works out what sort of message each person would best respond to and automatically creates it without any human involvement. It will iterate as it goes, constantly testing and refining. The underlying technology is being [developed now](&lt;|url|&gt;) but will take several years to mature. Some advertisers are already experimenting with early prototypes. Campbell’s, for example, has used this approach to [advertise soup](&lt;|url|&gt;) when weather data in a local area indicates it is cold or raining and to suggest a set of dishes and recipes given an ingredient provided by a user. In 2017, the senior digital director of Coca-Cola [signaled](&lt;|url|&gt;) his intention to use A.I. to help generate music and scripts for the company’s ads.

Taking humans out of the loop will introduce a troubling dynamic where gut checks are jettisoned for greater efficiency. What if it turns out that we respond best to the most outrageous base stereotyping? Or perhaps you can sell 15.3 percent more antidepressants to someone if you catch them at a certain point in the week and use messages that play to low self-esteem. What if payday loan ads and gambling offers were precisely worded and targeted at the very moment when someone is most vulnerable or short on cash? To a machine, all of this is irrelevant.

Automation will have other uses as well. The past decade has seen the rise of the social media influencer who posts branded content that appears more authentic than typical advertising. This will also become become algorithmic and automated, perhaps leading to nano-influencers getting automatically paid nano-amounts whenever an algorithm spots them sharing brands with their small number of followers. If you happen to be wearing a pair of Doc Martens in a photo that’s shared by 100 people, for instance, you’ll receive 15 cents.

In the end, despite all the whizzy innovation, correlation, and automation, we will still face the same problem we’ve always had: The more personal and intrusive the profiling, the more effective the ads, which also creates greater opportunity to manipulate and control. When that’s powered by machines and algorithms that no one understands, the underlying tension won’t change — but the stakes will be higher.<|endoftext|>

# What Do Social Media Breaks Accomplish?

## What Do Social Media Breaks Accomplish?

### *It depends on who you are*

![Original Photo by [Gunnar Sigurðarson](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Original Photo by [Gunnar Sigurðarson](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

*In Microprocessing, columnist Angela Lashbrook aims to improve your relationship with technology every week. She’ll go deep on the little things that define your online life today.*

Like many people before her, Molly realized she had a problem when her social media use started interfering with her romantic relationship.

“It wasn’t so much that we were fighting—more like I had a harder time being present,” says Molly, who asked that her last name be withheld to protect her privacy. “Our interactions were becoming really surface level.”

That wasn’t the only issue — the endless onslaught of bad news from these platforms and the resulting effect on her mood was also a factor. Molly decided social media was having a significantly negative impact on her life. So she decided to take a break.

Her situation is hardly unusual. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat are becoming so ingrained in our lives — and so [absolutely exhausting](&lt;|url|&gt;) — that there are now numerous terms for its negative effects: [social media fatigue](&lt;|url|&gt;), [information overload](&lt;|url|&gt;), [social media burnout](&lt;|url|&gt;).

As a result, many people are electing to take temporary breaks from their feeds. A [2018 Pew research poll](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that 74 percent of adult Facebook users have attempted to reevaluate their relationship with the network, from deleting the phone app (26 percent) to adjusting their privacy settings (54 percent) to taking a break for at least a few weeks (42 percent).

And while people announcing their social media breaks can seem [performative](&lt;|url|&gt;) or even a bit annoying (sorry, y’all), they might have the right idea. Taking a break from social media isn’t a silver bullet for having a perfect relationship with our online accounts, but when done thoughtfully, it can make a difference.

The perils of social media are well documented. It [encourages disassociation](&lt;|url|&gt;), meaning we have difficulty remembering that behind an avatar is (usually) a real-life person with their own emotions, thoughts, and sensitivities. Social media can foster [toxic conversation](&lt;|url|&gt;) and compels users to say outrageous, inflammatory things to earn more engagement from their followers. And it can simply make us feel bad: [One 2015 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) looked at how college students emotionally respond to social media and found that the more they checked their social media accounts, the worse they felt. A [2018 Pew poll](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that 54 percent of surveyed teens felt they spent too much time on their phones.
> # “If you stop logging into Facebook, you’re not going to get the shakes and start vomiting and going into physical withdrawals.”

“What I’ve seen in my work, which is more qualitative in nature, is that people don’t like the fact that they’ve become sort of fixated on [social media],” says Jeremy Birnholtz, an associate professor of communication studies and director of the Social Media Lab at Northwestern University. Users decide they want to leave social media when “they don’t feel like they’re getting benefits from social media anymore… or they’re spending too much time looking at their feeds, seeking engagement, figuring out things to post.”

And a lot of them, apparently, are having a hard time breaking away, even temporarily. [A 2014 study](&lt;|url|&gt;), one of only a handful that directly address intentionally temporary social media hiatuses, looked at people who give up Twitter for Lent and found that just 64 percent of them were able to do so successfully. One school-aged participant in the study told the authors that she typically checked Facebook immediately upon waking, posted a picture on Instagram while getting ready for school, checked Facebook about five times during each class, as well as during all breaks and after school, and stayed on her phone periodically until she went to sleep.

“Giving up social media for a week and not knowing if she was being messaged or not was nerve-wracking,” the study reports. “A month would be ‘torture’ at first, but she would learn to break her habit.”

[Another paper, from 2018](&lt;|url|&gt;), analyzed the experiences of 152 participants who were instructed to stay off social media for a week. It found that 90 participants were unable to stay offline the entire time without “relapsing”; a significant number also experienced mild “withdrawal” syndromes, such as heightened cravings and boredom.

It’s worth noting, however, that the use of the word “addiction” is somewhat controversial among researchers who study social media. Eric Baumer, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Lehigh University who has studied social media “nonuse,” as he puts it, tells *OneZero *that so-called social media addiction can be better compared to problematic gambling or gaming.

“If you stop logging into Facebook, you’re not going to get the shakes and start vomiting and going into physical withdrawals,” Baumer says. It’s more like a gambling problem, he says, because “it’s less a question of addiction and more a question of impulse control.”
> # A 2016 study of more than 1,000 participants found that people who took a one-week break from Facebook had greater life satisfaction.

Baumer says he has found in his research that after a hiatus, the people who elect not to return to social media might not be who you’d expect. “You see things like people talking about missing out on photos and birthdays from friends and family and various events. Interestingly, the people who talk about those kinds of experiences were less likely to go back to the site.”

Instead, the people who struggled to stay away were those whose interactions with social media were compulsive, not intentional. “The thing that really draws us back to Facebook when we try to leave, it’s not necessarily about the strength of our connections with our friends and family members,” Baumer says. “It’s about that habitual usage.”

This is precisely what a social media break can help people kick. While quitting, even temporarily, can be difficult for many of us, it might actually pay off. [A 2016 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) of more than 1,000 participants found that people who took a one-week break from Facebook said they had greater life satisfaction and positive emotionality. These results were particularly pronounced among heavy Facebook users and those who experienced FOMO, or fear of missing out. [Another study](&lt;|url|&gt;), from 2018, randomly assigned 143 college students to limit either Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat to no more than 10 minutes a day. It concluded that limiting social media use “may lead to significant improvement in well-being.”

Laura Bright, an associate professor of strategic communication at Texas Christian University, has found in her forthcoming research that taking social media hiatuses can be beneficial to users’ mental health.

“Many times, [participants] will report feeling more connected with friends during breaks and feeling better about themselves and their station in life, because they’re not doing constant social comparison,” Bright tells *OneZero*.

Baumer says that one of the greatest things social media users may gain from a hiatus is a greater sense of control. He conducted a study in which Facebook users who had previously considered leaving the platform deactivated their account. “Regardless of whether people went back to the site or stayed off, they described their actions as giving them a greater sense of agency,” he says. “Being off Facebook, they felt like they were more in control [of] themselves.”

However, taking social media breaks, or quitting altogether, isn’t a great option for everyone. Birnholtz, who has studied how young LGBTQ men use the internet, says that for young gay men in rural or conservative areas, taking a break from social media means taking a break from much of their community and closest friends. And Baumer tells *OneZero *that in his study, users who relied on Facebook for professional reasons actually felt less agency when off the platform.

Still, for those of us who feel compelled to tap those little Facebook or Instagram icons or who automatically start typing “twitter.com” when opening a new window, a hiatus may prove beneficial. It’s possible that making a concerted effort to cut down on daily use, rather than going cold turkey, could help realign your relationship with social media, quell that desire to frequently check for updates, and tamp down the need for constant engagement and validation.
> # Taking social media breaks, or quitting altogether, isn’t a great option for everyone.

Social media is [designed](&lt;|url|&gt;) to hook users. It’s meant to “addict” us, to keep us checking it constantly and stay on longer once we do. But strategies like temporary breaks or limiting use to a certain amount of time per day can make it a lot easier to approach our online time in a way that feels more rewarding and meaningful.

As for Molly? Her break wasn’t perfect — she says she shopped more and missed her cadre of online friends, who are “mostly refugees from the comment sections of now-defunct sites.” But all in all, her hiatus went well: She says she exercised more and went out more often, and now that she’s back, Molly is much more aware of when her use starts getting excessive. Even better, she tells *OneZero* that she and her partner “had several difficult and ultimately really rewarding conversations, and we actually got engaged.”

If that’s not a wonderful sign of success, what is?<|endoftext|>

# A New Vision for the Future of Driving

## A New Vision for the Future of Driving

### *At CES, car companies are showcasing new designs that will fundamentally alter the automotive experience*

![Toyota’s Dr. Gill Pratt explains Toyota Guardian system. All photos: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*Toyota’s Dr. Gill Pratt explains Toyota Guardian system. All photos: Lance Ulanoff*

If the last 15 years was the age of the smartphone, the next 15 promise to be the dawn of the smart car.

Our stalwart, four-wheel friends are riding a wave of interest and innovation to become the most important mobile technology in our lives. And nowhere is this trend more evident than at CES 2019.

Spurred by the rise of mobile broadband, zero-emission technologies, and the promise of self-driving vehicles, auto tech has attracted the attention not just of traditional car manufacturers, but of software, hardware, and silicon companies.
> # Car companies and their partners are imagining car intelligence that recognizes the needs of a new type of customer that’s less interested in actually owning and driving a vehicle.

In my first 48 hours at CES’s parade of private and press events, I lost track of how many companies mentioned cars, autonomy, integrated intelligence, and the incredible promise of 5G for car-to-car communication.

At a breakfast hosted by BMW, company execs painted a vibrant picture of a near future called [BMW Vision iNEXT](&lt;|url|&gt;), where the traditional car controls — all those annoying buttons — fade away in favor of voice, touch, and gesture control.

![BMW’s all-electric IX3.](<|image|>)*BMW’s all-electric IX3.*

Everyone wants to replace the traditional dashboard with screens. Byton showed off an all-electric car with a display as wide as seven iPads, per [CNET](&lt;|url|&gt;). And because you can’t have too many screens, Byton put one in the steering wheel, too.

![Qualcomm’s all-screen dashboard is the wave of the future.](<|image|>)*Qualcomm’s all-screen dashboard is the wave of the future.*

Cars have always been a collection of sourced parts, but unless you were a car nut, you really didn’t know much about where those parts came from. That’s changing, too, as Samsung [touted ](&lt;|url|&gt;)its Cockpit 2019 concept (co-designed with Harman Kardon). It has multiple screens and includes a version of the company’s Bixby digital assistant.

Qualcomm also showcased a cockpit of the future called [Automotive Cockpit Platform Gen 3](&lt;|url|&gt;), complete with lovely, dashboard-spanning LG Displays that were loaded with digital products from Amazon.

![Do not judge a concept cockpit by its cover.](<|image|>)*Do not judge a concept cockpit by its cover.*

The concept vehicle the company showed it off in was laughably basic, but it was packed with digital features. There was Amazon Alexa, Amazon Prime Music, and Prime Video (to be played on screens in the rear compartment). But what caught my eye was the real-time distracted driving monitor that showed the driver and his passenger. So, you watch the road while your car watches you, gauging your attention level.

![If Qualcomm gets its way, your car will be monitoring you for distracted driving.](<|image|>)*If Qualcomm gets its way, your car will be monitoring you for distracted driving.*

It’s still not entirely clear how these chip manufacturer cockpit concepts will become reality. The car companies basically consider them suggestions.

On the other hand, Qualcomm, Samsung, and other silicon firms like NVIDIA are already having success convincing traditional car companies to integrate their custom-built car chips and intelligence systems. NVIDIA has its Drive Autopilot System (which provides [Tesla V9 Autopilot](&lt;|url|&gt;) levels of self-driving autonomy), and Samsung just introduced the [Exynos Auto V9](&lt;|url|&gt;), which Audi has already promised to adopt.

Cars are the new platform battleground, with tech and traditional car companies in a race to define the future of driving. I noticed how each chip company was eager to share their car company partner lists.

Obviously, the race to add intelligence is driven primarily by the steady growth of automation. But it’s not just about self-driving cars: Auto manufacturers and their partners want to build safer cars, too.

![Toyota Guardian shares control with the driver.](<|image|>)*Toyota Guardian shares control with the driver.*

Toyota’s Guardian technology, for instance, seeks to improve road safety by splitting the difference between human and autonomous control. Instead of taking over driving chores, it’s designed to assist in moments when the driver’s skill might be insufficient to avoid a collision. Toyota Guardian uses many of the same technologies as autonomous driving, but with a twist. In the event of, say, a near crash, Guardian becomes a co-pilot, assisting in maneuvering but never fully taking control out of the driver’s hands. That bit of assistance could mean the difference between an accident and a near miss.

![Samsung put 5G at the center of its Digital Cockpit plans.](<|image|>)*Samsung put 5G at the center of its Digital Cockpit plans.*

5G weaves through many of the auto innovations planned for the coming years, but instead of enabling better calls and 4K streaming to a pair of back-seat displays, Qualcomm, Toyota, Samsung, and others are positioning 5G as a digital safety net. Qualcomm explained how Cellular to Everything, also known as C-V2X, supports the bandwidth for not only car-to-car communication, but car to anything else that happens to be equipped with 5G communication capabilities. The idea is to deliver intelligence back to vehicles, so the car’s autonomous systems can make split-second decisions to avoid accidents. Ford has committed to including C-V2X capabilities in all new cars by 2022.

When tomorrow’s cars aren’t helping you survive, they’ll be assisting with more mundane tasks, often through voice.

![The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.](<|image|>)*The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.*

BMW has its own Personal Digital Assistant, there to help you access hidden car features, and alert you if the car needs maintenance. It could even help you de-stress. BMW execs described telling the personal assistant that you’re tired and having the car run a relaxation routine that includes mood lighting, a seat adjustment, music, and a change of temperature. But why have just once voice assistant when you can have two? BMW has no interest in answering general interest questions or helping us buy diapers, so it’s integrating Amazon Alexa, as well.

In fact, Alexa and Google Assistant are set to pop up in all kinds of cars. Google’s monolithic structure in the parking lot outside the Las Vegas Convention Center has a few cars on display to illustrate how you can say “Okay, Google” to activate its assistant inside vehicles. And there are Alexa-infested cars inside the convention center, as well. Samsung is even trying to jam its lesser-known Bixby inside cars. Few people use the assistant, but it hooks into Samsung’s huge line of home appliances, no doubt making it an attractive option to some. Imagine being a mile from home and asking Bixby to turn on your Samsung oven or check the laundry in the Samsung dryer.

Even the way traditional car companies design cars is changing.

BMW explained on Monday that it’s now focusing much more on the human experience and how making each vehicle feel like a customizable, private living room. Yes, really: In its latest concept car, the BMW IX3, the rear seats are replaced with a bench that wraps around to the doors, so you can nuzzle into the corner as you would a couch. At CES, the company has a [Mixed Reality installation](&lt;|url|&gt;) to help consumers understand the future, friendlier, in-cockpit experience.

![BMW’s Mixed Reality Mobility window.](<|image|>)*BMW’s Mixed Reality Mobility window.*

I might argue, though, that the design decisions are starting at a deeper level than the plush surface of the passenger bench might suggest. Amid all the talk of autonomous driving and ride-hailing, car companies and their partners are imagining car intelligence that recognizes the needs of a new type of customer who is less interested in actually owning and driving a vehicle.

Ultimately, the car of the near-future is less of a car than an information pod, whisking us from one destination to another. And we can tell our grandchildren that it all started here.<|endoftext|>

# Why Game Streaming Will Finally Work

## Why Game Streaming Will Finally Work

### *Services like OnLive have tried and failed. Stadia and xCloud should succeed.*

![Google vice president and general manager Phil Harrison shows the new Stadia controller during the Game Developers Conference on March 19, 2019.

The future of gaming won’t require a powerful console sitting under your TV. In fact, it’s boxless, wireless, and streaming from a magic server, miles and miles away.

At least that’s the vision spun up by some of the world’s most important companies. Google is preparing to launch its [Stadia](&lt;|url|&gt;) streaming gaming platform later this year, Microsoft has xCloud, Ubisoft’s got UPlay+, and so on. The race is on to become the dominant cloud console — but it’s actually a race that started quite some time ago.

A service called OnLive offered streaming games back in 2012 that connected players to a virtual desktop running on a remote server. The company lasted a few years and came to offer a dedicated device for connecting to its service, but it [eventually folded because of lack of customer interest](&lt;|url|&gt;). OnLive was only ever available in a few markets, and it had data centers installed directly in the heart of those cities.

There is also Sony’s PlayStation Now service, which launched in 2014 and allows gamers to stream an array of titles to their console or PC. Nvidia’s GeForce Now is another, though it’s still in beta.

These earlier efforts never quite took off, in part because they didn’t work well for a wide range of people. PlayStation Now, for example, [still has issues](&lt;|url|&gt;) on slower internet connections. Infrastructure has been another major problem: Streaming services rely on servers around the world, and proximity to a user’s location can be a major issue.

So what makes the modern wave of game streaming any more promising? Two things: better technology and the sheer scale of the companies entering the field. Here’s how it all works, and why the next generation may finally fulfill the promise of these earlier services.

## Faster, better, stronger

One of the problems with early game streaming services was that they were, in essence, streaming video of a game directly from a powerful computer and nothing more. They relied on streaming technologies designed for one-way video streams of content to your machine — think Netflix, for example. But streaming video games requires a fast, two-way connection — the game needs to make its way from the server to your screen, and any inputs you make must then be communicated back to the server. Then it streams back the reaction to what you just did, and the cycle continues.

The internet has come a long way since these first services were imagined. Stadia, for example, uses a [standard called WebRTC](&lt;|url|&gt;), which is largely known for making video calls faster and reducing latency by [connecting people’s computers directly to one another](&lt;|url|&gt;), rather than routing them through a centralized server. You’ll still need a good internet connection for this to work properly (more on that in a second), but the technology is better equipped to mitigate latency issues than previous efforts like OnLive were.

By using WebRTC along with other standards like [QUIC](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [BBR](&lt;|url|&gt;), which further reduce latency and connection congestion, Stadia is able to make an end run around a lot of the problems encountered by early services, because the video stream and controller commands aren’t intricately linked together.

When your connection gets flaky — as even the best broadband definitely will sometimes — the stream will still feel responsive. Instead of glitching around the screen like in traditional multiplayer games — itself a major problem that can make games unplayable, as you miss your targets and those with better connections destroy you — the stream will simply drop video quality to compensate, becoming pixelated or distorted as when YouTube has buffering issues. Because the congestion is being managed by these new protocols and your controller commands are processed separately from the video stream, your character still responds, and as the connection recovers, the video quality ramps back up again.

The real magic, however — and what makes me so optimistic about Stadia — is that no additional software will be required. Google promises that you’ll be able to play on any device that has a Chrome browser, with a single click. If it works — and [early](&lt;|url|&gt;) [reports](&lt;|url|&gt;) indicate it [very well could](&lt;|url|&gt;) — Stadia will completely transform how games are experienced on every level.

And the gaming industry could use some disruption. When you buy a game today, you’re inevitably faced with a 40-gig update and a lengthy install process before you can even start playing — and that’s assuming your drivers are all up to date and compatible with the software.

Game streaming will remove all of these pain points. By lowering the barrier, these services can expand the appeal of video games to the millions of people out there who are gaming curious, but who never made the move to buy a console, or who find themselves unsure of what they’d like to play. It’s easy to imagine that a future streaming service might offer the first 30 minutes of a game for free as a one-click taste, like a traditional demo on steroids.

Of course, this is all assuming your internet connection is up to the task.

## The cloud is already in your city

![(Google Cloud’s reach as of 2019. Credit: [Google](&lt;|url|&gt;))](<|image|>)*(Google Cloud’s reach as of 2019. Credit: [Google](&lt;|url|&gt;))*

The problem that killed every streaming service before now was latency — the time between issuing a command like “move forward” and the remote game actually responding.

With OnLive, you might have been looking at the game on your screen, but it was rendered far away in a data center. Actually doing something involving the controller’s buttons meant sending a signal up to that remote server, which then needed to be processed and sent back your way. The process only took milliseconds, but the delay was perceivable as lag to the player.

The thing is, OnLive actually worked pretty well if you happened to have a data center physically located in the city you lived in. The further away your data center was, the more OnLive became a laggy mess. The company’s challenge was building out data centers full of powerful servers in hundreds of cities across the United States.

![(Microsoft’s existing Azure data centers. Credit: [Microsoft](&lt;|url|&gt;))](<|image|>)*(Microsoft’s existing Azure data centers. Credit: [Microsoft](&lt;|url|&gt;))*

Google and Microsoft don’t have this problem, because they’ve spent a decade building hundreds of data centers in every corner of the world for their cloud platforms. This infrastructure is what allows services like Google Drive to work.

Because these companies want services like Windows Update and Google.com to load as fast as possible, they have dedicated content delivery networks. These data centers are as close as possible to the majority of their users, hidden in cities and suburbs to shave crucial milliseconds off loading times. Previous services like OnLive simply lacked the massive cloud infrastructure Google and Microsoft have spent billions to develop over the years.

All that said, you may have noticed significant gaps in those connectivity maps above, like New Zealand floating out there without any connections. Game streaming services clearly aren’t going to reach everyone immediately, particularly those in countries where connection speeds are slower, or where there aren’t enough people to justify a dedicated data center.

That’s precisely why Microsoft is still building Xbox hardware, with a new console coming in 2020, and why most of us are looking at cloud gaming the wrong way. It’s the next step in the evolution of gaming, which will make games accessible to millions of people for the first time without buying consoles — but it won’t replace* *hardware for a long time. They’ll co-exist for years.

Still, it’s clear now that streaming technology has completely transformed. All that remains to be seen is whether anyone actually wants to pay for it.

# Our Tech Addiction Is Creating a ‘Toxic Soup’

## It’s time to address the crisis

![Illustrations: [Judson Collier](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustrations: [Judson Collier](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

The pool at the bottom of the [Lavender Pit](&lt;|url|&gt;) pit is the color of rust, burnt red and bleeding. The pit is part of the inactive Copper Queen mining complex in Bisbee, Arizona. On the crater’s rim is a commemorative plaque that asks, “Why dig the pit?” Because, the plaque goes on to answer, “every electronic gizmo from refrigerators to iPods needs copper wiring.”

The Lavender Pit opened in the 1950s, the midpoint of a century scientists call the [Great Acceleration](&lt;|url|&gt;) for the huge — and swift — impact that modern human life had on the planet. The period was marked by changes in how natural resources were extracted and used, especially for new technologies. These changes can be pinpointed in time by the emergence of [technofossils](&lt;|url|&gt;), artifacts composed of materials that occur rarely or not at all in the absence of technological and scientific intervention. Think purified forms of iron, aluminum, and titanium; artificially isolated forms of metals like [neodymium](&lt;|url|&gt;); or synthetic glasses and plastics. All these materials and more go into the making of today’s digital devices.

You can imagine your old television or even the smartphone you’re reading this on becoming the technofossils of tomorrow. But everything digital devices are made from and that enables them to operate was, at some point, extracted from the earth. In a real sense, technofossils aren’t something our devices are waiting to become at some distant point in the geological future. Our devices are made of fossils now.

Extracting those fossils, constructing our gadgets, and, eventually, discarding them is a destructive cycle that only stands to get worse in the coming decades as demand for electronics grows around the world. It is a crisis that can no longer be ignored.

Today, we generate around [55 million tons](&lt;|url|&gt;) of discarded electronics every year. Try to imagine 5 million elephants or 110 Burj Khalifas piled on top of each other and you’ve got the rough idea. That number is expected to grow by 3 to 5 percent annually, as reported in the [2017 Global E-Waste Monitor](&lt;|url|&gt;). Assuming 3 percent growth, our e-waste generation will double in a little more than 23 years. At 5 percent, the doubling time declines to about 14 years.

If estimates are correct, people will be discarding about 110 million tons of electronics sometime between the years 2033 and 2042. Things would look considerably more dramatic by 2069 if current trends continue.

![](<|image|>)

Troubling though the numbers may be, they include none of the waste that arises in the mining, making, or using of those electronics. And there is plenty.
> # Strip the earth. Get the metal.

In fact, the waste from discarding gadgets is dwarfed by the waste created from mining the materials to make them in the first place. Over the operational life of the Lavender Pit, for example, about 600,000 tons of copper were extracted from the ground. (Your iPhone [contains](&lt;|url|&gt;) a little less than eight grams of copper. Apple [reportedly](&lt;|url|&gt;) sold more than 217 million iPhones last year, theoretically requiring some 1,900 tons of copper.)

Getting that much metal from the Lavender Pit also meant generating 256 million tons of waste. That’s about 426 tons of waste for every ton of desirable metal produced from the pit. It’s what miners call a strip ratio. Strip the earth. Get the metal.

Today’s electronics are complex amalgams of plastics, metals, and glass. These materials do not, of course, spring forth from the earth ready to be assembled into chips, screens, phones, or servers.

Plastics, for example, are petroleum products. Canada’s oil sands are a global powerhouse in petroleum products: In 2012, the country’s national statistics agency reported that around 710 million tons of waste was generated from oil sands production. Of course, only some small portion of total oil sands production eventually becomes plastics that might be used to make electronics, but the scale of waste arising from resource extraction begins to put postconsumer e-waste in a different perspective.

![Photo: [Wikimedia Commons](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo: [Wikimedia Commons](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Making electronics is an energy- and materials-intensive endeavor. When Seagate, a major data storage device manufacturer, conducted an internal audit of the chemical footprint of its manufacturing, the company found that “[the volume of chemicals not incorporated into the products is conservatively estimated to be four times that of product chemistries](&lt;|url|&gt;).” In other words, the amount of chemicals required to make the devices is quadruple the amount of chemicals in the devices themselves.

Seagate’s situation is hardly unique. Many brand manufacturers regularly publish data about the carbon footprints of their devices. Over and over, these companies’ own data show that emissions arising in production usually outweigh those arising from transportation (that is, distribution from factory to consumer), product use, or end-of-life management (or recycling).

Any digital device with a screen involves the use of an especially potent class of greenhouse gasses called fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-GHGs), which are used to etch the thin-film components of flat screens typical of today’s TVs, phones, tablets, and monitors. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s emerging studies of F-GHGs in electronics manufacturing suggest that the use of these gases may be on track to double by next year. If that trend were to continue, F-GHG releases from flat-screen production could double 10 to 16 times over in 50 years.
> # The Silicon Valley region has more federal Superfund sites than any county in the United States.

That’s almost certainly impossible, which is, in a sense, the whole point. Such doubling would be roughly equivalent to today’s total CO2 emissions from the United States. And so the industry, facing a literally unsustainable manufacturing process, must confront a stark necessity to innovate.

![](<|image|>)

F-GHGs are not incorporated into the digital devices they are used to make. Instead, they are released into the atmosphere. They are odorless, tasteless, and invisible, but once in the atmosphere, F-GHGs have a global warming potential [thousands of times higher](&lt;|url|&gt;) than CO2. They also remain in the atmosphere for [centuries to millennia](&lt;|url|&gt;). Manufacturers have committed to being more efficient in the use of F-GHGs, but efficiency gains are no guarantee of overall reductions if demand increases.

Even as production networks for electronics have been [globalized](&lt;|url|&gt;), manufacturing of computers, electronics, and their [components](&lt;|url|&gt;) still happens in the United States—as do [releases](&lt;|url|&gt;) of toxic [chemicals](&lt;|url|&gt;) from their manufacture. The [Silicon Valley region has more federal Superfund sites](&lt;|url|&gt;) than [any county](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the United States. Nevertheless, the electronics industry still manages to trade on images that are the opposite of heavy industry (think: “[the cloud](&lt;|url|&gt;)”).

Parts of Silicon Valley today [sit atop](&lt;|url|&gt;) a toxic soup of discards from electronics left behind from historical manufacturing in the region. One of those sites is the [Middlefield-Ellis-Whisman](&lt;|url|&gt;) (MEW) Study Area. The MEW is a legacy of groundwater contaminated by leaking underground chemical storage tanks at facilities once owned by Silicon Valley founders Fairchild, Raytheon, and Intel. A consultant’s report found that it will take [700 years](&lt;|url|&gt;) for the MEW to be cleansed of chemicals to the point where the water would meet EPA drinking standards.

[Some](&lt;|url|&gt;) of Google’s [facilities](&lt;|url|&gt;) sit on top of the MEW today. Among the chemicals percolating through the site out of the ground and into the air is trichloroethylene, a chemical compound the [EPA has found](&lt;|url|&gt;) to be “carcinogenic in humans by all routes of exposure.”

The “cloud” is a metaphor that [misleads](&lt;|url|&gt;). The infrastructure on which our clicks run, the server farms where our data are stored, all need [a lot of energy](&lt;|url|&gt;). That energy has to be generated one way or another, and how it’s created matters a lot for the tonnage and toxicity of emissions and other wastes produced as a result. Today’s data centers consume about 1 to 1.5 percent of total electricity generated globally. But rates of growth are [estimated](&lt;|url|&gt;) to be between 11 and 16 percent annually. If those rates remain constant, power consumption by data centers will double at least seven times over between now and 2069. With those doublings will come a wake of discarded electronics, highly variable in their tonnage, toxicity, and harms to the people, places, and things they encounter.

There are some dangerous temptations built into imagining today’s TVs as tomorrow’s technofossils. One of those dangers is mistaking the husks of our digital devices for their effects. Toxicants released in the mining, making, and using of those devices are active agents. They will shape the [future well beyond 2069](&lt;|url|&gt;).<|endoftext|>

# The Biggest Challenge for Facebook’s Libra Is Money

## The social media platform’s planned experiment with cryptocurrency needs to work as well as regular currency

![Photo: SOPA Images/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: SOPA Images/Getty Images*

It’s a question you might start hearing more: “Cash, credit, or crypto?”

A recent spate of retail businesses like AT&T and Whole Foods have started [accepting payment in Bitcoin](&lt;|url|&gt;). Meanwhile, Facebook announced [its new cryptocurrency platform Libra](&lt;|url|&gt;), with the goal of making one global digital currency that everyone can use to make payments and store money. Yet they all struggle to answer a basic question: do consumers really need to pay their bills with cryptocurrencies?

Cryptocurrencies present a unique problem for retailers. On the one hand, it makes sense to accept payments through any means possible, and currencies like Bitcoin can have [much lower processing fees](&lt;|url|&gt;) than credit cards, which saves companies like AT&T money. On the other hand, almost no one is clamoring to pay for things with cryptocurrencies. When PornHub started accepting crypto payments — arguably the ideal use case for [pseudonymous](&lt;|url|&gt;) payments — [less than 1% of its customers took the option](&lt;|url|&gt;).

[Facebook’s Libra platform](&lt;|url|&gt;) is designed to help this problem by making cryptocurrency accessible to its billions of users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Libra is backed by major payment processors like Visa and Mastercard, and will be supported by companies like Spotify, Uber, and Lyft when it arrives in 2020. Libra will be managed by the Libra Association, which means Facebook won’t have sole control over it, but it will build its own wallet and payment apps on top of Libra that will give its billions of users the ability to store money and make payments with the currency.

First, though, Facebook will have to convince people they want to buy and pay for things with Libra in the first place.

There are two basic problems with using a cryptocurrency to pay your everyday bills: acquiring the cryptocurrency in the first place, and knowing how much what you have is worth. Anyone who has ever traveled to a country with a different currency might be familiar with this pain. How many [yen is one dollar worth](&lt;|url|&gt;)? Where do you go to [trade your dollars for Euros](&lt;|url|&gt;)? And [how much is that going to cost me](&lt;|url|&gt;)?
> # If all of that sounds like it’s way more complicated than just, you know, paying your bill with a credit card, that’s because it is.

Payment systems like [Flexa](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [BitPay](&lt;|url|&gt;) are designed to simplify this process for typical cryptocurrencies. Users can connect their crypto wallets to these services, and companies like [AT&T](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Whole Foods](&lt;|url|&gt;) can partner with these payment processors to accept those currencies as payments. BitPay even lets you convert your Bitcoin to dollars so you can [pay with a prepaid Visa card](&lt;|url|&gt;). If you don’t already have any cryptocurrency, you can use services like [Coinbase](&lt;|url|&gt;) to buy some with the money you already have, then transfer it to services like BitPay.
> # In layman’s terms, [crypto] is less like a currency you use to pay your bills and more like investing in a particularly volatile stock market.

If all of that sounds like it’s way more complicated than just, you know, paying your bill with a credit card, that’s because it is. According to [a joint study](&lt;|url|&gt;) by Survey Monkey and the Global Blockchain Business Council in 2018, only 5% of Americans owned any Bitcoin to begin with, and an overwhelming percentage of those who did viewed it as a growth investment rather than a store of value. In layman’s terms, it’s less like a currency you use to pay your bills and more like investing in a [particularly volatile](&lt;|url|&gt;) stock market.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin behave more like investments because they have very little stability. At its peak in December 2017, one Bitcoin was worth around $20,000 USD. Six months ago it was worth $3,500. Today, it’s in the area of $11,000, although by the time you read this it could be significantly higher or lower. If you can buy low and sell high (not always an [easy trick to pull off](&lt;|url|&gt;)), then you can make money buying Bitcoin. For speculative investors, it’s an exhilarating asset that exists in [a legally murky area](&lt;|url|&gt;) with potential for great gains or huge losses.

None of that, however, translates to the kind of currency you’d want to use to pay your bills. When your AT&T bill is due, you need to pay whatever the Bitcoin equivalent of your $80 phone bill is. Whether the value of your Bitcoin is high or low doesn’t really matter. Your bill is due. If the value is down that day, then you’re out of luck. You’re forced to realize those losses or your phone gets turned off.

Typically, people don’t pay their bills using assets that vary in value for precisely this reason. No one uses, for example, Apple stock to pay their bills because there’s no telling [what it will be worth in the future](&lt;|url|&gt;). If the $80 worth of Bitcoin you spend on your AT&T bill today is worth $200 in a year, then you’ve wasted money.

It was exactly this kind of volatility that led to gaming storefront Steam [dropping support for Bitcoin payments in 2017](&lt;|url|&gt;). According to the company, customers would transfer money to pay for a game, and by the time the transaction could be completed, the value of the Bitcoin they used had changed “significantly.” BitPay, Steam’s former partner, currently tries to fight this by [locking in the exchange rate during the transaction](&lt;|url|&gt;), but it can’t control the value of Bitcoin once the transaction is over.

Facebook’s new Libra system is designed to reduce that volatility by tying its cryptocurrency to existing fiat-based currencies. Libra is backed by currencies like the U.S. dollar, so as long as the dollar continues to be worth something in the global marketplace, so will your Libra coins. That could make it easier to at least complete your transaction when paying for something with cryptocurrency, but it doesn’t solve all of the problems.

Even if Libra is more stable than, say, Bitcoin, using it still involves extra steps over paying for something with regular money. You get paid in regular currency, convert that currency into Libra coins, then hope that whatever services you need to pay for accept Libra. Until then, your money is stored within one of Facebook’s (or some other company’s) apps and can’t be used at most stores. So why not just keep your money in a regular bank and use a debit or credit card?

For starters, not everyone has access to a bank or credit card. According to [a 2017 survey](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or FDIC), 6.5% of households in the U.S. alone were “unbanked” meaning they had no accounts at any banking institutions. Worldwide, [1.7 billion adults remain unbanked](&lt;|url|&gt;), especially among developing nations.

Facebook and the Libra Association are banking (quite literally) on the notion that these groups will find a stable cryptocurrency useful. It costs nothing to store your money in a cryptocurrency wallet, unlike banks which may require a minimum balance or charge a monthly fee. If payment fees are low, and more companies accept Libra payments, then maybe the platform can bring modern banking conveniences to the next billion people on the planet.

In developed nations with strong financial infrastructure, though, the cryptocurrencies still make little sense for daily life. In the best case scenario, it’s a novel, if slightly inconvenient way to pay your bills by funneling your money through a secondary currency. In the worst cases, the fluctuating value of currencies like Bitcoin can make even basic payment logistics impossible. There may be edge cases where cryptocurrencies are useful as investment vehicles or pseudonymous payments, but for now, even Libra doesn’t seem well positioned to make cryptocurrencies a part of your everyday life.<|endoftext|>

## A New Dating App Thinks Video Chats Will Help Prevent Assault

### *There’s just one big problem*

*In I/O, columnist Lux Alptraum explores how technology intersects with sexuality and relationships. I/O will embrace the uncertainty of our future and help us craft a better tomorrow, together.*

If you give people a novel new technology, they’ll use it to get laid. Long before Match.com formalized the concept of online dating as something people might pay a fee to access, lonely singles were turning to chat rooms and online bulletin boards in search of a little companionship.

Despite the fact that people have been hooking up online since the early days of the internet, there are still quite a few of us who remain convinced that meeting people online comes with an elevated risk. A [list of online dating safety tips](&lt;|url|&gt;) that ran in *Bustle* in 2016 advises readers to withhold personal information like their full name and employer, avoid taking their date home the first night they meet, provide friends with a detailed summary of where they plan to go, and even carry pepper spray.

And it’s not just the media amping up the idea that we should proceed with extra caution before meeting people from the internet. Filter Off, a new dating app that sets users up on 60-second video dates with potential matches, [boldly foregrounds ](&lt;|url|&gt;)the potential risk of meeting people online, arguing that, with their platform, you can feel a little safer when you ultimately meet someone in the flesh.
> # “My hope with this app, Filter Off, is that you can really get a sense of who that person is through video” — and, presumably, lower your chances of ending up on a date with a rapist.

“We have eliminated swiping and messaging, so users are forced to get to know the person in a more intimate manner, allowing them to vet a match prior to the date,” the company says in a recent [blog post](&lt;|url|&gt;).

But while the idea that your Tinder date puts you at greater risk than, say, drinks with your co-workers or a friend of a friend is a compelling one, it’s not necessarily based in fact. Still, Filter Off’s founder thinks his service is the right idea.

“If you Google sexual assault and dating apps, it’s story after story of ‘someone on a dating app gets assaulted or sexually assaulted or raped,’” says Zach Schleien, the founder of Filter Off. Schleien points to a [*Vice* story documenting a 450% increase](&lt;|url|&gt;) in reports of rape related to online dating in the UK from 2009 to 2014.

“That’s 2016, more and more people are now on apps,” Schleien adds, suggesting that rates have likely gone up.

For Schleien, who repeatedly notes that safety — and especially the safety of female users — is a major concern for Filter Off, these stats are a sign that online dating needs to be done differently, in a way that enables users to assess their matches face to face, the way one might when meeting in person. “What is I realized is, from a woman’s perspective, every time they go on a date, there obviously is some risk,” says Schleien. “My hope with this app, Filter Off, is that you can really get a sense of who that person is through video” — and, presumably, lower your chances of ending up on a date with a rapist.

Setting aside the question of whether you can really identify a rapist through a mere minute of video chat — spoiler alert: you can’t — it’s worth taking a moment to examine the underlying premise of Filter Off’s pitch. Is online dating truly more dangerous than, say, meeting someone in a bar or at work or through a friend? And if it’s not, why are we so convinced that it requires some special, additional screening process that we don’t ask of people we meet through other means?

In some sense, our fear of the serial predator seeking out victims on Tinder is just a modern update on the rapist supposedly lurking in the bushes, one aided by a healthy dose of the panic that accompanies any sufficiently popular new technology. Those digital safety strategies proffered by innovative apps and well-meaning listicles aren’t all that different from the age-old advice that women should avoid dark streets at night, or check behind themselves when they’re entering their apartment buildings, or, yes, even carry pepper spray.

“We like to believe that there’s a set of decisions that can keep us safe,” says Jaclyn Friedman, author of [*Unscrewed: Women, Sex, Power, and How to Stop Letting the System Screw Us All](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. “It makes us feel like we have some control over sexual violence in a way that we do not.” If the threat of sexual violence is coming from a stranger in a dark alley, or a predator lurking behind a Tinder profile, then it feels easier to avoid: you can skip the hookup apps, take a self-defense class, or mind your drink when you’re out at the bar.

But the available data on sexual assault suggests this mindset has things backwards. “Most sexual violence happens between people who already know each other,” says Friedman. Indeed, RAINN — the nation’s largest anti-sexual assault organization — reports that [the vast majority of sexual assaults are committed by someone the victim already knows](&lt;|url|&gt;). A little over 19% of rapes are committed by a stranger while 33% are committed by a current or former partner, and 39% are committed by an acquaintance.
> # More often than not, the people who are the most likely to cause us harm are the ones we already know, love, and trust.

Even that terrifying statistic about a 450% rise in reports of online dating-related assaults starts to seem a little less extreme upon further examination. Yes, the reports of people raped during their first face-to-face meeting with an online paramour did increase nearly sixfold from 2009 to 2014, but in raw numbers that means the number of reports went from 33 to 184, during a time period when [the total number of rapes increased 84 %, from 13,096 to 24,043](&lt;|url|&gt;), in part due to survivors’ increased willingness to report their assaults to the police.

“Our perspective is that one incident of sexual assault is one too many,” says Schleien. “RAINN [recommends](&lt;|url|&gt;) people video chat before meeting up… If users ever feel uncomfortable during the video chat, they can exit or report the other user for inappropriate content.”

Filter Off may be a fun new way to meet people that allows you to get a sense of someone’s personality before you devote a whole evening to hanging out. Still, the idea that it — or an app like it — could make online dating safer is pretty far-fetched.

It’s tempting to see the threat of violence and sexual assault as coming from a stranger hiding in the alley, or assume that our risk is escalated by some novel new technology; to believe that if we stay close to home and don’t get too adventurous, we’ll be able to protect ourselves from violence. But more often than not, the people who are the most likely to cause us harm are the ones we already know, love, and trust.<|endoftext|>

# Apple Doesn’t Need a Monopoly to Lock You Into Your iPhone

## iMessage is still the stickiest part of iOS

![Credit: Westend61/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Westend61/Getty Images*

Apple is facing a crucial battle over one of its core moneymakers. Thanks to a ruling against the company [by the Supreme Court](&lt;|url|&gt;) this week, Apple will have to successfully argue that its App Store doesn’t constitute a monopoly. Part of the company’s case — that users are free to buy apps from other platforms — is undercut by another product with an inescapable, blue-bubbled grip on iPhone users: iMessage.

In the recent case of *Apple v. Pepper*, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that Apple could be sued for allegedly driving up prices of apps and preventing its customers from using third-party app stores. “The plaintiffs allege that, via the App Store, Apple locks iPhone owners ‘into buying apps only from Apple and paying Apple’s 30% fee, even if’ the iPhone owners wish to ‘buy apps elsewhere or pay less,’” Justice Brett Kavanaugh [wrote for the majority’s decision](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Apple has argued that its closed platform is necessary to protect users from malware. It has also argued that if users don’t like prices on the App Store, they’re welcome to switch to another platform like Android and buy their apps from Google’s Play Store. There’s just one problem with this argument: Apple makes it incredibly hard to switch platforms. And a major part of that lock is its proprietary texting service.

iMessage is the default messaging service on Apple products. If you have an Apple device and send a message to someone else with an Apple device, you get to use iMessage and all its accompanying bells and whistles, like [Animoji](&lt;|url|&gt;). You live in the blue bubble. But if you communicate with anyone who’s not on an Apple platform, they get a regular SMS message. They’re [a lower-class green bubble](&lt;|url|&gt;).

At first, it might seem like there’s no problem. Apple is simply providing extra features on top of SMS — an [outdated texting method](&lt;|url|&gt;) to begin with — for its customers, while still making it possible to text the plebs on other platforms. It’s a value-add — until users try to leave for another platform.

Anabel Quan-Haase, professor of information, media studies, and sociology at the University of Western Ontario, found that switching from an iPhone to Android came with a lot of unintended consequences. “I thought it was quite hard, because I have family abroad,” she says. “With the messaging, that was really problematic, because there were a lot of people that I couldn’t message at all.”

If you want to leave iOS, but you relied on iMessage in the past, you first have to [“deregister” your phone number](&lt;|url|&gt;) from your account. If you still have your old phone, that means digging into your settings and disabling the iMessage toggle. If you don’t have it, you have to head to [this online tool](&lt;|url|&gt;), enter your phone number and confirm a code. Neither option is terribly obvious if you don’t know it’s there.

If you skip this process, Apple will continue to assume any messages sent from its Messages app to your phone number should go through iMessage. It will then route them to your other devices, like your Mac laptop or your iPad. Or you might not get them at all if you only had one Apple gadget to begin with. Apple was [sued in 2014 over this issue](&lt;|url|&gt;), but the company created its deregistering tool and [the case was dismissed](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Even if you do follow the process exactly, some messages can still get lost. Group chats where some users have iPhones and some have switched to Android can sometimes drop messages [even after you deregister your phone number](&lt;|url|&gt;). Even switching to a new Apple device can create problems [if you don’t check the right settings](&lt;|url|&gt;). Some solutions involve asking your friends to dig through their settings and enabling a “send as SMS” feature, which can be an embarrassment as well as a hassle.

These are problems that cross-platform apps simply don’t have. Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Viber are available on Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS. If you switch devices, just download the app on your new phone or computer, sign in, and you’re right back where you left off. No deregistering, no settings, no muss, no fuss.

Android’s default texting app uses basic SMS and MMS, but even Google’s ([latest](&lt;|url|&gt;)) attempt at a better messaging experience, simply called Chat, is [aimed at solving the problem at the carrier level](&lt;|url|&gt;). Instead of being a proprietary app, it’s pushing a protocol that other companies like Apple could choose to implement.

Even the design of iMessage and its two-tiered system — blue bubbles for Apple users, green bubbles for everyone else — arguably leads to a social stigma against switching. “There is a social pressure there,” says Quan-Haase. “I think it’s also intertwined with status… being able to demonstrate that you are texting via iMessage is a signal of belonging to the community, but also a community that has a higher status.”
> # “Courts don’t want to get into the business of deciding what’s a good design decision and what’s not.”

It’s inconvenient, to be sure, but does this sort of quiet lock-in really constitute anticompetitive behavior? Ramsi Woodcock, assistant professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, explains that it’s a hard question to answer. “This has been sort of a vexing problem for antitrust for a very long time,” says Woodcock. “The question is whether a company should have a duty to design a product for interoperability, and whether to make markets more robust.”

iMessage isn’t designed to make life easy for people who switch to other platforms, but it makes a few concessions to avoid drawing too much negative attention. You can talk to people with other phones, of course, although Apple hasn’t released a version of iMessage for Android or Windows to let other customers into the blue bubble party.

The company has made it possible to switch without losing your past conversations, but it’s not an easy or intuitive process. You have to already know that you need to deregister your phone number — Apple won’t tell you when you leave — then go through the extra steps just to receive your messages on your new device. As inconvenient as this might be, however, the company might not have any legal responsibility to do more.

Apple could make iMessage an opt-in feature, rather than the default. According to Woodcock, though, if the current method is better for most users, Apple can get away with a little anticompetitive behavior. “[Apple will] say consumers love iMessage functionality, they love being able to get read receipts, they love being able to send longer texts,” explains Woodcock. “And so while this may have anticompetitive effects, it’s a product improvement. And antitrust has a very well-established rule that if you can show that exclusionary conduct is a product improvement or innovative in some sense… the courts won’t condemn it.”

Apple’s perspective, then, is that iMessage represents a justifiable sacrifice. The value that users get from using iMessage instead of basic SMS is worth it, even if it might lead to an inconvenience for those users who switch to another platform. Unless this creates a substantial anticompetitive roadblock, courts might not want to get involved. “Courts don’t want to get into the business of deciding what’s a good design decision and what’s not,” says Woodcock.

Still, while it may not be illegal for Apple to forcefully nudge its users into iMessage, the effect is noticeable. Apple has argued in court that its App Store can’t possibly be a monopoly in part because users are free to switch to another platform and shop there. At the same time, Apple has engineered a service that’s on by default and discourages users from leaving iOS. Apple may not stop you from leaving, but it strongly prefers that you stay.<|endoftext|>

# Game of Thrones’ Final Season Is Destined to Disappoint You

## Game of Thrones’ Final Season Is Destined to Disappoint You

### **Here’s why — and why that’s okay**

![Credit: HBO](<|image|>)*Credit: HBO*

This has felt like a very long year for many reasons, but the fact that it was the first year we didn’t get a new season of *Game of Thrones* didn’t help. The fantasy phenomenon wrapped up its penultimate seventh season the summer before last, and the show’s [tens of millions of fans](&lt;|url|&gt;) still have to wait until April of next year to know the fates of Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, and the other remaining survivors. I’m dying to see the story’s end as much as anyone — but I’m also kind of afraid, because I don’t think there’s any possible ending that will be truly satisfying.

[Endings are hard to do well](&lt;|url|&gt;), period. Even just sticking to modern TV dramas, there are plenty of excellent shows that left their viewers either wanting more (*The Sopranos*), wanting something different (*Mad Men*), wanting their proverbial money back (*Lost*), or wanting to have never wasted their time in the first place (*Dexter*). There are always a few series that stick the landing (*Breaking Bad*), but they’re the exception, not the rule. And the more time and attention fans have invested in a story, the more anticipation they have for the story’s end, continually raising their expectations — and their chances of being disappointed, too.

*Game of Thrones* is most like *Lost* in that it is a cultural phenomenon, a series with a huge audience that transcends any specific group as a proverbial “water cooler” show. (If you had told me 10 years ago that my mother, who’s never picked up a fantasy book in her life, would be calling me on Sunday nights, desperate for answers about that night’s episode of a show with dragons in it, I never would have believed you.) The immense popularity of the show gives it more real estate in the modern pop culture consciousness, which inspires fandom and media coverage and merchandising, which attracts more viewers, which increases pop culture landholdings, etc.

To be fair, it will be genuinely difficult for *Game of Thrones* to pull out an ending that is as unsatisfying as that of *Lost*, if only because Martin has had a basic plan for how his story would end since he kicked off the *A Song of Ice and Fire *series with* A Game of Thrones* back in 1996, and has given the TV adaptation’s [a bit of a head’s-up](&lt;|url|&gt;), while *Lost*’s arbitrary ending seemed to [prove the rumors](&lt;|url|&gt;) that there had never been an end in mind at all. But *Game of Thrones* has a greater impediment to finding a conclusion that will satisfy its fans — which, ironically, has also been its greatest strength.
> # I’m dying to see the story’s end as much as anyone — but I’m also kind of afraid, because I don’t think there’s any possible ending that will be truly satisfying.

Dragons and ice zombies may be part of *Game of Thrones’* appeal, but that’s not why the series has drawn such a wide audience since its 2011 debut. As the people watching the show, despite things like dragons, will tell you, their fandom is owed to its compelling, well-rounded characters and unidealized feudal setting, both of which ground the series and make it an epic drama, first and foremost, and a fantasy spectacle second.

It’s the “epic” part that’s the problem. *Game of Thrones* is a tale of dozens of major characters, going on individual micro-journeys while several major factions vie for control on the macro level, all buoyed by centuries of their own historical context, set on an enormous stage, creating a sense of infinite possibilities. *Game of Thrones* author George R.R. Martin augments this with his penchant for ignoring genre tropes — most famously by killing off characters it feels impossible for the story to lose — and primarily because of his uncanny ability to create an organic narrative, where everything affects the overarching plot, where something seemingly innocuous can have major repercussions many chapters (or even books!) later, and where even the most shocking, unexpected events feel like a natural, logical progression of the story he’s telling.

Since the TV series has largely replicated Martin’s storytelling on screen, it’s enjoyed similar success and inspired similar passion as the books. But now that the show is ending, it’s been narrowing down those infinite possibilities in order to reach its conclusion — in a sense, tearing down *Game of Thrones*’ most enthralling quality like the White Walkers tearing down the Wall in the season seven finale. It’s utterly necessary to complete the story, and completely unavoidable, but it makes the infinite finite. The series will have to diminish itself in order to complete its story, regardless of the actual content of the ending.
> # Game of Thrones’ fandom is owed to its compelling, well-rounded characters and unidealized feudal setting, both of which ground the series and make it an epic drama, first and foremost, and a fantasy spectacle second. It’s the “epic” part that’s the problem.

Let’s take, for instance, what will most likely be the final major development of the series: Who will sit on the Iron Throne? There’s only one major (remaining) character whose journey has been specifically to rule Westeros, and that character is Daenerys. She’s the obvious choice to win the throne game — so obvious, in fact, that it would feel like a letdown for a series that’s been so dedicated to upending standard fantasy story beats. Still, the next best (possibly most popular) option would be to give it to Peter Dinklage’s Tyrion, since his life has been full of misery and indignity, and he’s shown himself a capable administrator in the past. This makes narrative sense and is probably the closest the show could get to a happy ending. But should *Game of Thrones* have a happy ending? Do we want it to? Wouldn’t it, in some way, feel like a cheat — like the story wasn’t being true to itself?

But the problem isn’t really with Daenerys, Tyrion, or all the other characters that may end up ruling Westeros or whether anyone rules Westeros or if it splits back into seven kingdoms or suddenly becomes a democracy or whatever. (Okay, that last one would be very crappy.) It’s that *Game of Thrones* is so popular and so epic and its ending so anticipated that every possible outcome, regardless of how good or bad it is, is inherently not as exciting as the spectrum of possibilities that precede it.

That’s a bummer, but it can also be liberating. However the show ends, whatever issues the final season might have, your enjoyment of *Game of Thrones* the series does not have to be dependent on it. Maybe the characters make decisions that no longer make sense. Maybe the quality of the writing keeps dropping. Maybe all semblance of quality storytelling is dropped for the spectacle of seeing giant battles of the living and the dead, but with dragons (eat your decomposing heart out, *The Walking Dead*). Maybe it turns out the show has just been a board game played by a bunch of kids in Milwaukee in the ’70s, and the series’ grounded realism is shattered into a million pieces.

Any one of these could happen, or all of them could. Maybe the one thing that will finally unite our country, and thus the world, will be in our universal agreement that the final season totally blew. But it will still only be a part of the series that you liked, loved, or were so completely consumed by that you purchased the [Game of Thrones Cookbook](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a fit of crazed fandom after the “Battle of the Bastards” episode, and it’s been collecting dust ever since.

If you end up disappointed with the end of *Game of Thrones*, it will be because of how much you enjoyed *Game of Thrones* prior to it. Try to remember that during the series’ final shot of Cersei Lannister and her new husband Samwell Tarly holding the first democratic elections in Westeros.<|endoftext|>

# Why Machines Need to Dream

## The ingenious neurobiology of mammalian sleep has been mathematically modeled to streamline A.I. memory and storage capacity

![Illustrations: [Ana Kova](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustrations: [Ana Kova](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Dreams are, for the most part, delightful. As we sleep, visual and audio fragments combine into nonsensical snippets and epic narratives. Loosely recalled moments merge with vivid, imagined scenes; we interact with characters known and characters conjured up; we explore our fantasies and, sometimes, face our fears. Yet sleeping and dreaming do not exist for our nocturnal pleasure alone.

As we slumber, our brains filter information collected in waking hours. Neurological processes spring into action. They discard what is irrelevant and consolidate what is important; they form and store memories. These mechanisms — found throughout the mammal world — are so effective that a team of Italian researchers have mathematically modeled them for use in artificial intelligence.

The result is an algorithm that expands the storage capacity of artificial networks by forcing them into an off-line sleep phase during which they reinforce relevant memories (pure states) and erase irrelevant ones (spurious states).

## **When math meets mammals**

Adriano Barra is a theoretical physicist at the University of Salento in Italy. Barra is eager and animated when he speaks to me, frequently using a pack of Marlboro cigarettes as an unlikely prop to illustrate the finer points of A.I.

Along with his colleagues Elena Agliari and Alberto Fachechi, Barra studies complex systems, such as brains, and makes mathematical models of their neurobiology. “We theoretical physicists have a teeny advantage over engineers,” says Barra. “As the mathematics is the same, almost for free, we can apply our results in artificial intelligence. We are a bridge between neurobiology and engineering.”

The classic blueprint for artificial neural networks is the Hopfield model. Developed by John Hopfield in 1982, it describes how artificial networks learn and retrieve information using mechanisms, such as pattern recognition, that mimic real brains. The most popular learning rule for a Hopfield network is Hebbian learning, which proposes how the synapses between neurons are strengthened during the learning process.

There is a drawback, however. The Hopfield model is now decades old, and can only store a limited amount of information. Expressed mathematically, the maximum storage capacity for this symmetric network** **is α∼0.14. However, the theoretical limit is 1, or α=1.
> # Networks in an awake, or online, state are always learning new patterns of information. As well as desirable patterns, however, they collect irrelevant, even fake patterns.

A network’s capacity is determined by the number of neurons (*n*) it contains. Each bit of information, such as a digital pixel, is a distinct pattern (*p*) of information. “You can store, at maximum, a number of patterns that is *p* equal to 0.14 times *n*,” says Barra.

Why, then, is the storage capacity only a fraction of what is theoretically possible? Why is it 0.14, rather than 1?

![](<|image|>)

Networks in an awake, or online, state are always learning new patterns of information. As well as desirable patterns, however, they collect irrelevant, even fake patterns. “You get the network to store these important patterns but unavoidably it will also store mistakes,” says Barra. “You cannot avoid them. They are automatically generated.”

He grabs his Marlboros and compares them to a pack of Camel cigarettes. “If you keep storing details about these packets of cigarettes — the blue one is Camel and the red one is Marlboro, etc. — but you also take in all the redundant information, the network eventually gets stuck.” Jammed with irrelevant and spurious information, maximum capacity is reached at 0.14.

This limited capacity** **does not stop A.I. from carrying out specific tasks, but clogging up valuable space with useless data is wasteful and inefficient.** **The Italian team’s solution is an algorithm that forces networks into an off-line phase that echoes mammal sleep, which is used to reinforce important memories and erase irrelevant ones.

“It is deeply related to sleep,” says Barra, “because if you don’t get rid of all these spurious mistakes, they become too much, and the network is no longer able to discriminate between what is a Marlboro and what is a Camel.”

## **Freeing up space**

Mammalian brains are also constantly collecting new patterns of information. But like a fishing boat indiscriminately trawling the seabed, along with relevant information­, they also suck up unimportant details.

“When you are awake, you store a lot of information passively; you don’t really need it and don’t really want to store it,” says Barra. “We also produce spurious and fake patterns of information. We want to get rid of that. We do this by sleeping.”

During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the phase of sleep in which we usually dream, our brains are busy erasing irrelevant memories. This makes room for storing new ones. In slow-wave (SW) sleep, important memories are reinforced. While most dreaming occurs during REM, we may experience indistinct dreams that are harder to recall during SW sleep.

The research team knew that mammalian brains use highly efficient mechanisms to clear out storage space during sleep. Their analysis of this fact was the starting point for their algorithm.

“We said, okay, let’s go through the neurobiological paper that explains this phenomenon in a real brain and try to model it mathematically,” says Barra. “Then we asked: What can happen if we apply this mathematical backbone to the Hopfield model?”
> # Evolution has provided the criteria mammalian brains rely upon to determine what should be consolidated and what should be erased, but artificial networks need people to take on the task.

Their answer is presented in a paper published in[ *Neural Networks](&lt;|url|&gt;) *in April*.* Under the new framework, artificial networks continue to learn and store patterns of information (as memories) during standard online, or awake, sessions. However, when storage capacity hits 0.14, the network is forced into an off-line, or sleep, session. This sleep phase is used to delete irrelevant information and consolidate the important stuff, or more technically, for “spurious-pattern removal and pure-pattern reinforcement.” By implementing a new off-line regimen, the team was able to free up storage space and increase capacity to 1.

Evolution has provided the criteria mammalian brains rely upon to determine what should be consolidated and what should be erased, but artificial networks need people to take on the task. “They [networks] are absolute slaves of our perception, so we have to say to them, ‘This is important, pay attention to it. This is not important,’” says Barra. “They don’t have the concept of importance.”

There are other technical differences too. For instance, in human brains, erasing and consolidation occur during two distinct stages of sleep (REM and SW); when networks sleep, both tasks happen simultaneously. Perhaps the thing that most distinguishes human from machine sleep is that we have autonomy over our slumber and naps. Artificial networks’ sleep sessions are triggered by math — no cozy blanket required.

With the new framework in the public sphere, Barra’s job is over. “I am a theoretical physicist; I develop the mathematical backbone,” he says. “Now it is a matter for the engineers to implement it.” And maybe he — and artificial networks — can take a well-deserved nap.<|endoftext|>

# A Flawed FAA Drone App Risks Midair Collisions

## Air ambulances across the U.S. are under increasing threat from consumer drones, and a safety app that omits some heliports isn’t helping

![Credit: Omer Messinger/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Omer Messinger/Getty Images*

Early in the morning of Independence Day 2018, Laura Smith lost control of her blue Dodge pickup while towing a Cadillac on a remote stretch of Interstate 84 in Idaho and slammed into a FedEx truck traveling the opposite direction. The Cadillac then came loose and hit a Jeep, and the resulting chaos closed the freeway for five hours.

Smith and another casualty were rushed by ambulance to the small Minidoka Memorial Hospital in the nearby town of Rupert. Smith needed more care than Minidoka Memorial could provide, so hospital director Tom Murphy picked up the phone and did something he did several times every week — called for an air ambulance.

There are around 1,000 helicopter air ambulances in the United States, transporting an estimated [half a million people](&lt;|url|&gt;) each year. Whether providing swift assistance following major incidents or whisking patients to expert care, air ambulances provide an essential, life-saving service, especially in rural areas.

But the safety of the air ambulance network, pilots say, is being increasingly threatened by the dangerous use of consumer drones — with potentially lethal consequences should a drone hit a helicopter’s windshield, engine, or rotors. The problem is being made worse by an official FAA app designed to help drone operators avoid other aircrafts which, *OneZero* has learned, fails to account for private helipads — including hundreds or even thousands of hospital and air ambulance bases nationwide.

When Laura Smith needed airlifting from Minidoka Memorial, a helicopter was scrambled from nonprofit air ambulance service Life Flight Network. By the time it reached Rupert, the July Fourth holiday parade was in full swing. As the pilot came in to land at the hospital’s helipad, just a few hundred yards from the festivities, he spotted a drone flitting about below him.

The pilot immediately aborted his landing and radioed back to his dispatcher, who contacted the Rupert police department. Officers fanned out through the holiday crowds in a desperate effort to find the drone pilot, and [members of the public](&lt;|url|&gt;) helped locate the operator and ground the drone.

The helicopter eventually landed and safely loaded Smith on board. “In the end, it didn’t negatively impact care, but it certainly was something that could have been very dangerous if the drone had accidentally run into the helicopter,” Murphy says.

The Minidoka incident is far from unique. Drone scares have interrupted air ambulances across the United States, from [California](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [Ohio](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Tennessee](&lt;|url|&gt;). In September 2017, an air ambulance pilot submitted an anonymous report to the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) confidential [Aviation Safety Reporting System](&lt;|url|&gt;). In it, the pilot described a near midair collision one block from a hospital as a drone flew directly over the helicopter’s main rotors while it was climbing away from the helipad.

“Ground all private drones,” the helicopter pilot wrote. “They are going to cause a mishap with a manned aircraft. The regulations… do not provide helicopters with a margin of safety that is acceptable to flight crews who cannot see them because they are too small… They also do not register on radar systems.”

The FAA estimates that up to 2 million drones have been sold in the United States, and the agency has [many regulations on where and how](&lt;|url|&gt;) the public should fly them. There are some sensible rules: never higher than 400 feet; never out of sight; and never over groups of people, near emergency responders, or within five miles of an airport.

The Minidoka drone pilot should have known better than to fly over a busy parade, but even the most conscientious operator might not always know how close they are to their nearest airport, which includes seaplane ports, glider runways, balloon bases, and, of course, heliports.

The FAA realizes this, which is why one of its suggestions to drone operators is that they download and use its [B4UFly safety app](&lt;|url|&gt;), “which provides real-time information about airspace restrictions and other flying requirements based on your GPS location.”

If you open the app and search for Minidoka Memorial Hospital, it sits at the center of a yellow circle and flashes a warning icon highlighting the flight restriction. But navigate to Kaiser Permanente’s Manteca Medical Center, a hospital in California’s rural Central Valley that also has a helipad, and you will see instead a friendly check mark welcoming drones to take to the air. Manteca’s helipad does not appear in the B4UFly app because it is not in the FAA’s nationwide master database of airports. And it’s not alone.

California requires the owners of hospital heliports to register with the state. [Its list](&lt;|url|&gt;) shows that 35 of the state’s 169 hospital heliports are missing from the FAA’s records. Fortunately, most are close enough to other airports to trigger a warning icon in the B4UFly app. But five, including Manteca Medical Center and another Kaiser Permanente hospital, are not.

Kaiser told *OneZero* that it hadn’t had problems with drones at these facilities, which it classifies as “helistops” because they do not have fueling or support facilities and are used much less frequently than its other helipads.

In the absence of independent registries in most other states, it’s difficult to know how widespread this problem is across the country. But Rex Alexander, a former air ambulance pilot turned aviation consultant, has been doing his best to find out. Over the past few years, he has single-handedly plotted every airport in the FAA’s database for Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and Missouri on a map and then tracked down each hospital helipad in the five states.

“The average number of missing hospital heliports in each state was 38,” Alexander says. “So, do the math — you’re potentially missing 1,900 heliports or more across the country.”

The problem is actually even bigger than that. In addition to hospitals, private helipads can be found at police stations, office buildings, television stations, and some upmarket homes. Many of these are also likely missing from the FAA’s systems. In 2017, an FAA research engineer [noted](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the helipad at a New Jersey State Police base and one on the Hard Rock casino in Atlantic City — the former Trump Taj Mahal — were missing from the FAA’s database. They still are.

Even heliports that are in the system can cause problems. In his five-state survey, Alexander found numerous helipads whose actual location differed by more than a mile from that in the records — including one helipad that was more than 50 miles away.

Registering a private heliport with the FAA involves multiple inspections and can take up to two years, Alexander says. Perhaps surprisingly, it is also entirely optional. “The FAA can’t force [owners] to do anything, because they’ve never been given legal authority by Congress to have any oversight over private facilities,” Alexander notes.

The FAA confirmed to *OneZero* that reporting privately owned helipads is currently voluntary but said that it expedites requests to register heliports at first responder facilities such as hospitals. While its app does advise drone operators to “proceed with caution” and observe other restrictions for events or around critical infrastructure, it still doesn’t map most helipads in the United States.

Alexander says that some owners avoid registering because they mistakenly believe they would have to make expensive upgrades or meet strict safety conditions. Others have either simply not gotten around to it or have neglected to keep their records up to date. In one case, Alexander discovered that the person listed in the FAA database as a contact for drone pilots to call had actually been dead for six years.

Before the advent of cheap drones, it was easy for hospital administrators to dismiss heliport omissions and discrepancies. “They were willing to look the other way because, in their minds, they were saving lives,” Alexander says. “But this is a lie they’re telling themselves to justify an unsafe situation.”

The good news is that change seems to be coming, occasionally driven by the hospitals themselves. In Raleigh, North Carolina, WakeMed Hospital has just started to use drones to transport [blood and other lab samples](&lt;|url|&gt;), despite having its own busy (FAA-registered) heliport.

“We coordinate with the hospital’s air ambulance dispatch center and halt drone flights when a helicopter is inbound or outbound,” says Jim O’Sullivan of [Matternet](&lt;|url|&gt;), the company providing the quadcopter drones. “Typically, a helicopter will result in a delay of about 10 minutes. It’s not ideal, but transport by drone is still faster and more predictable than the alternatives.”

The FAA has also been considering swifter electronic registration for private heliports and is planning to relaunch its B4UFly app later this year in partnership with [Kittyhawk](&lt;|url|&gt;), a drone software startup. However, Kittyhawk’s own app does not include Manteca Medical Center or the other missing California hospitals. ([AirMap](&lt;|url|&gt;), a rival drone flight-planning service, does place automatic restrictions around hospitals and schools.)

Ultimately, it will be down to individual hospitals to recognize the liability issues, not to mention the bad publicity, should the worst ever happen.

“I hope it doesn’t take a bad accident to wake people up,” Alexander says. “The prevention of accidents is our aim. But if there is a tragedy and Congress says fix this, the FAA will get mandated, and then it will become a priority.”

In the meantime, drone pilots will need to rely on common sense as much as smartphone apps to find safe locations to fly — and to steer clear of police stations, parades, and especially hospitals.<|endoftext|>

# It’s Time to Rebel Against the Existential Threat of Climate Change

## When the fate of the human species is at stake, panic is the right response — if it’s followed by action

![Credit: Mike Kemp/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Mike Kemp/Getty Images*

During a [recent speech](&lt;|url|&gt;) at the European Union parliament, the teenage activist Greta Thunberg began her talk as follows: “My name is Greta Thunberg. I’m 16 years old. I come from Sweden. And I want you to panic.”

Her reasoning goes like this: While panicking is counterproductive when there’s nothing to panic about, it serves an important purpose when there’s a genuine cause for alarm. Panicking about vaccines causing autism or commercial airliners leaving chemtrails at 35,000 feet is an obvious waste of energy. But if you find yourself alone in the Alaskan wilderness and an angry grizzly charges at you, it would be suicidal not to freak out.

There’s a catch, though. Certain forms of panic can lead to paralysis rather than action. This may especially be true with respect to climate change: The threat is so massive and our individual potential to effect change so miniscule that it’s easy to throw one’s hands in the air and, to [quote](&lt;|url|&gt;) the philosopher Peter Singer, just “party our way into extinction.” Jennifer Jacquet, a professor of environmental studies at New York University, has dubbed this the “[anthropocebo effect](&lt;|url|&gt;),” on the model of the “[nocebo effect](&lt;|url|&gt;),” whereby merely “mentioning the side effects [of a drug] makes them more likely to occur.” In this case, merely mentioning the catastrophic consequences of climate change can make it more probable that they’ll occur.
> # The environmental crisis is transgenerational and global in scope: It will affect virtually everyone around the world for hundreds of generations to come, assuming the human race exists that long.

But the truth is that our environmental situation really is dire. Our species emerged about 2,000 centuries ago in the grassy East African savanna, where we evolved to meet the challenges of that specific environment. To survive — meaning survive long enough to pass on our selfish genes — we needed to think about the future on timescales of hours, days, and weeks. There was no reason to worry about the well-being of people beyond the perimeter of our tribe. Our motto could have been “Think locally, act locally!”

The environmental crisis, though, is transgenerational and global in scope: It will affect virtually everyone around the world for hundreds of generations to come, assuming the human race exists that long. The sheer enormity of the problem boggles even the most capacious minds, a problem that the education scholar Christopher Williams [refers to](&lt;|url|&gt;) as “brain lag.” Quite simply, our brains lag behind the times: They’re evolutionarily incapable of comprehending the consequences of present human actions, nor are they able to muster the moral sympathy needed to change our behaviors to avoid catastrophic harm to people in the far future.

Indeed, one of the most significant consequences of climate change is biodiversity loss, which will be our single greatest legacy on this planet after the final chapter of *The Biography of Homo Sapiens* has been written. According to the [2018 Living Planet Report](&lt;|url|&gt;), the global population of wild vertebrates declined by a shocking 60% between 1970 and 2012. We are watching, in real time, a major mass extinction unfold, one could that be no less devastating than the mass extinction that obliterated the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Except that extinction event was caused by an asteroid merely obeying the fixed laws of nature. There is no law of nature that forces humans to destroy their only home in the universe.

We didn’t always need to panic. If I were writing this in the 1980s, my fingers would be trembling a lot less — although then I’d be worried about a nuclear conflict, a risk that [still haunts us today](&lt;|url|&gt;). But today, panic is the only option left.

If you find the need to panic objectionable, don’t blame me — or Thunberg, or anyone else — for delivering the message. Blame the climate-denying politicians, blame the misinformation campaigns by big media outlets like Fox News, blame the fossil fuel industry and its powerful Washington lobbyists, blame the anti-intellectual foolishness of half the American population — a demographic of people who are, as Shakespeare [might have said](&lt;|url|&gt;), most ignorant of what they’re most assured about. If only we’d acted decades ago, when scientists sounded the first alarm, we wouldn’t be in a predicament that requires schoolchildren to strike once a week for reasonable climate policies.

Yet the news is even grimmer than this, because we don’t just need to act on climate change and biodiversity loss, both of which could render the planet uninhabitable for a large portion of the population. There is a [blizzard of additional risks](&lt;|url|&gt;) associated with emerging fields of research like synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence. Moving forward, these will pose increasingly menacing hazards to human prosperity by, for example, enabling terrorists to create designer pathogens that globe-trot at the speed of a commercial jet and propagate with ease through dense urban areas like the mega-slums around Mumbai, Cape Town, and Nairobi.

Every generation has declared itself to be the last, usually for religious reasons. But this time really is different: We live in the Age of Anthropogenic Apocalypses. It commenced in the early 1950s when the United States stockpiled enough nuclear weapons to bring about a global-scale nuclear winter, and it’s unlikely to conclude until we safely get off this planet — although even that [might not save us from ourselves](&lt;|url|&gt;).

How one responds to such news is obviously important. Panic must not lead to defeatism, if only because defeatism is unwarranted by the evidence. Yes, we face a veritable avalanche of risks to our survival. But the truth is that not a single one of these problems is unsolvable. We can redirect incoming asteroids, defuse supervolcanoes, stop climate change by transitioning to nuclear power and renewables, and avoid a bioterrorist attack through effective counterterrorism measures. We just need the motivating wisdom to actively find the solutions.

A [study from 2015](&lt;|url|&gt;) usefully identifies three responses that people have to thoughts about the “end of the world.” The first is fundamentalism: They view this possibility through the prism of religious eschatology, or “the study of last things.” The second is nihilism: They succumb to the anthropocebo effect, declining to act because the problems are just too big. And the third is activism: They convert their fear of global destruction into energetic action aimed at mitigating the threats before us. What we need is panic that turns people into activists. As Henry David Thoreau [once declared](&lt;|url|&gt;), “To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.” We could update this as follows: “To ensure that future people flourish, that is the highest of moral acts.”

Such activism is precisely what we’re seeing in the U.K.-based movement known as “[Extinction Rebellion](&lt;|url|&gt;),” or XR. I recently attended a massive protest in London during which multiple people, including a pregnant woman, superglued themselves to the road in an effort to disrupt traffic. It worked, and after hours of lying under a hot sun on the even hotter pavement, they were removed and hauled away by police. Meanwhile, a crowd of thousands chanted, “We love you,” followed by a call and reply that began with a man standing just next to me who bellowed, “Extinction!” to which everyone in earshot screamed, “Rebellion!”

Although XR has been criticized for its tactics, with some arguing that non-violent disruptions like those I witnessed could repel potential allies, it’s hard to know what else to do given that, as Bob Dylan might [say](&lt;|url|&gt;), “It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there” — indeed, at a frighteningly accelerating pace.
> # We need more activists. We need people who hear the wailing sirens of imminent calamity but reject the dual failures of fundamentalism and nihilism.

The reality is that those of us on what I call the “right side of futurity” (not just history) have argued with politicians to no avail. We’ve made speeches, written articles that have gone viral, and published award-winning books on the topic. We’ve lamented that it’s easier to imagine civilization collapsing than capitalism coming to an end. And some have increasingly resorted to colorful language not usually employed by professional scientists, such as when the geophysicist Brad Werner [gave](&lt;|url|&gt;) a conference talk that he titled, “Is Earth Fucked?” A reporter later asked whether he thinks we really are screwed, to which he answered, “More or less.” The answer today is “more than less.”

Indeed, the general consensus among experts of existential risk is that there’s about a 20%chance of human extinction before 2100. To put this into perspective, imagine that planes had a 20% chance of crashing every time they took off. Would you board the plane? I certainly hope not. But here we are, midflight, and it’s too late to get off. Let’s hope we have some good pilots.

Right now we need more activists. We need people who hear the wailing sirens of imminent calamity but reject the dual failures of fundamentalism and nihilism. We need people who understand that this is our best shot ever to prove that we really are, or at least can become, *Homo sapiens*, despite our long history of being something closer to *Homo halfwitus*.

This being said, there are several important strategies for persuading people to become activists. One is forward-looking and, as such, it emphasizes how good the future could be if only we play our cards right today. If we avoid a terminal catastrophe, there’s every reason in the world to believe that the future could be not just better, but much better than the present. The prescient science fiction writer H.G. Wells predicted this possibility way back in 1902, [writing](&lt;|url|&gt;):
> All the past is but the beginning of a beginning, and that all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn. It is possible to believe that all that the human mind has ever accomplished is but the dream before the awakening… We are creatures of the twilight.

Wells is right. The fact is that medical advances could eliminate all disease — cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and more — and perhaps even reverse the aging process. According to the visionary gerontologist Aubrey de Grey, there’s a good chance that [the first person to live 1,000 years has already been born](&lt;|url|&gt;). Even more fantastical is the possibility of hooking our brains up to the internet, communicating telepathically and achieving digital immortality by simulating the microstructure of our nervous systems. Just recently researchers [announced](&lt;|url|&gt;) that electrodes on the brain could translate brain waves into audible speech — words and sentences produced by thinking alone. That’s incredible, it’s exciting, and it’s worth fighting for.

So, I very much agree with Thunberg and those in Extinction Rebellion that now is the time for panic. But we can’t leave it at this. It will also do us well to underline that the future could be profoundly better than it is today — just as the present is much better than, say, hundreds of years ago during the Spanish Inquisition, when people were executed for nothing more than uttering the wrong words. This could inspire people to become activists, to strive for a world in which humanity doesn’t linger under multiple guillotine blades.

“Why should I care about posterity?” Groucho Marx [once joked](&lt;|url|&gt;). “What’s posterity ever done for me?” While climate change and other existential threats will indeed affect people in the very distant future, the truth is that, as Thunberg argues in her EU speech, the house is burning down right now. We have to get out, which means that, to survive, we must act with a trembling sense of panicked urgency and move.<|endoftext|>

# Hacker Video Games Are Experiencing a Renaissance

## Why do people love to roleplay as a hacker, and what do these games teach us?

![Illustration: [Sally Thurer](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Sally Thurer](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Dave Kennedy once broke into a bank vault with a password he found in a worker’s desk drawer. The desk was locked, but picking it was trivial, and it took about 30 seconds to get the code that would give him access to safety deposit boxes and bags of cash. “Unfortunately,” he laughs now, “we had to give it back.”

Kennedy is a security consultant and co-founder of the cybersecurity firms [Binary Defense](&lt;|url|&gt;), which defends against hackers, and [TrustedSec](&lt;|url|&gt;), which simulates their attacks. “We get to be simulated bad folks but we don’t have to go to prison,” he says. “Which is awesome.”

Given the enjoyment he finds in playing at someone he’s not, it’s not surprising that Kennedy, now 36, is a lifelong video-game player. As a kid, he learned how to code so that he could run his own text-based online multiplayer game known as a *Multi-User Dungeon*, which later helped him get his first job in cybersecurity for the Marines. Kennedy thinks that video games could help people develop skills needed to meet the growing demand in the cybersecurity industry, especially now that so many games are designed to make the player feel like a hacker themselves.

The term “hacking” [used to](&lt;|url|&gt;) just mean exploring and understanding systems more deeply. But around the 1980s, the mainstream media began to use it to signal malicious intent: unauthorized intrusion through manipulation and exploitation of technology and, as with Kennedy’s bank vault, the people who use it. Hollywood took this definition and ran with it. The hackers of 1980s and ’90s movies were meddling kids going places they shouldn’t, like 1983’s *WarGames*, in which a teenage Matthew Broderick accidentally gains access to a military supercomputer and almost starts a nuclear war.

Video games have a long history of looking to Hollywood. Just two years after the release of *WarGames*, Activision CEO Jim Levy demonstrated their new game *Hacker* to [journalists](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 1985 by pretending his attempts to access the company server had accidentally led him to an unknown computer system. Movies were sometimes inspired in turn by games: in the 1995 movie *Hackers*, Dade and Kate (played by Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie) compete on a beta version of the futuristic racing game *Wipeout*.
> # “Cybersecurity now, in real life, is a lot more like movies from the 90s, in that it’s governments and mysteries and conspiracies.”

At the turn of the millennium, a group of computer science students at Imperial College London who had spent their young lives watching these movies founded an independent game development company called Introversion. They created a bestselling hacking game that many players and developers cite as the pinnacle of the genre. [*Uplink](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, released in 2001, is packed with references to pop culture and real events, like the 1990 [raid](&lt;|url|&gt;) of Steve Jackson Games by the U.S. Secret Service, which believed the company possessed materials involved in criminal activity. (In addition to protecting high-level government officials, the Secret Service is also charged with investigating cybercrimes.) One in-game server copied from *WarGames* can only be accessed with a password from the movie.

“Everything you’ve ever seen in a video game about hacking is inspired by movies,” says American game developer Zach Barth. His company [Zachtronics](&lt;|url|&gt;) is known for complex, open-ended puzzle games, and their latest is the 2018 hacking-themed [*Exapunks](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, which he likes to describe as *Hackers* fanfiction. Barth theorizes that a 20-year cycle of nostalgia may explain the renewed interest in hacking as portrayed in ’80s and ’90s movies, though it may also be their apparent prescience. “Cybersecurity now, in real life, is a lot more like movies from the 90s, in that it’s governments and mysteries and conspiracies,” says Barth.

Hacking is big in current pop culture. Kennedy has advised on the award-winning television show *Mr. Robot*, and even appeared in a 2017 [music video](&lt;|url|&gt;) for Zoey Dollaz’ *Post and Delete*, for which he wrote a legitimate exploit, a piece of software that takes advantage of a vulnerability on a computer.

![Credit: Uplink/Introversion Software](<|image|>)*Credit: Uplink/Introversion Software*

But while those are set in the modern day, games often look backward. *Exapunks* is set in 1997 and has a sense of historical authenticity, with printable hacking zines that teach you how to play and lingo from the 1996 *Wired* style guide. *Uplink*, which asks the player to create an account to access a bulletin board of freelance hacking gigs, looked so convincing that reviewers at *PC Gamer* unplugged their office network in case it turned out to be some malicious virus.

When it comes to what the player actually does, *Uplink’s* developer Chris Delay says the game comes before realism. Inspired by all those movies, he implemented a countdown timer. Players who fail to cover their tracks get a permanent game over. “It’s all about the paranoia,” he says. “If you don’t have that then you’re not experiencing this criminal life properly.”

Movies and games add these embellishments for the sake of excitement. Katie Goode and John Campbell, co-founders of U.K. independent game developer [Triangular Pixels](&lt;|url|&gt;), live down the road from [GCHQ](&lt;|url|&gt;), the headquarters of the British secret service in Bude, England. “You’ve got people around town that are everyday spies,” says Goode, “And they’re just totally normal people.”

In their [BAFTA-nominated](&lt;|url|&gt;) virtual-reality infiltration game [*Unseen Diplomacy](&lt;|url|&gt;) *(2016), hacking is based on a particularly unrealistic episode of [*NCIS](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, in which a man tries to help a woman to thwart a hack by typing on the same keyboard at the same time. Goode and Campbell mimicked this frantic typing effect by requiring the player to run between three keyboards and mash the keys.

Brendon Chung, who runs the one-person Californian independent game developer [Blendo Games](&lt;|url|&gt;), also exaggerated the action in his award-winning 2016 [*Quadrilateral Cowboy](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. The player controls three female hackers for hire in an alternate-reality 1980s world of clunky technology, and the** **main tool is a portable computer known as a hacking deck. “One of the trickier parts of doing hacking games is that the stuff you do is very intangible,” he says. “So I wanted to push it more toward the analog part of the spectrum.”

These games all want to help the player achieve a sense of mastery. Chung compares hacking to *Harry Potter*, using a magical secret language to talk to computers. [*Beglitched](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a 2016 game from independent developers [AP Thomson](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Jenny Jiao Hsia](&lt;|url|&gt;), goes so far as to call its hacker a computer witch.

Swedish independent game developer Erik Svedäng thinks games could encourage people to learn these secret languages. In his 2015 game [*else Heart.Break()](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a coming-of-age adventure in which boy meets girl and girl turns out to be a hacker fighting an oppressive government, players can hack objects using a programming language that Svedäng based on existing ones. “The hard part was to make it an easy language for people to use,” he admits. But he thinks that those who do get to grips with his language could go on to learn to code for real.

It’s clear that hacking games aren’t going anywhere, and while some are nostalgic, others — like *else Heart.Break()* — are tackling current concerns. [*A Normal Lost Phone](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and [*Another Lost Phone: Laura’s Story](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, both 2017 games from French independent developer [Accidental Queens](&lt;|url|&gt;), simulate smartphones, with password-protected apps, documents, and photos for the player to dig through for information. The big-budget hacking-themed action-adventure games [*Watch Dogs](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and [*Watch Dogs 2](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, released in 2014 and 2016, center on a system of mass surveillance in U.S. cities. The next installment is [rumored to be set](&lt;|url|&gt;) in London — which would be timely, given that U.K. police forces have been [trying out](&lt;|url|&gt;) facial recognition technology.

And if any developer wants to add some extra authenticity to their next game, and perhaps even teach players something about cybersecurity, Kennedy is willing to lend a hand: “Any video game company out there that wants a real-life hacker, let me know.”

# America’s New Data Privacy Bills Won’t Protect Us

## We need to have a much bigger conversation about privacy in relation to our increasingly digital lives

![Credit: ISerg/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: ISerg/Getty Images*

[California](&lt;|url|&gt;). [Hawaii](&lt;|url|&gt;). [Maryland](&lt;|url|&gt;). [Massachusetts](&lt;|url|&gt;). [New Mexico](&lt;|url|&gt;). [New Jersey](&lt;|url|&gt;). [New York](&lt;|url|&gt;). [North Dakota](&lt;|url|&gt;). [Rhode Island](&lt;|url|&gt;). [Washington](&lt;|url|&gt;). The last time I checked, each of these states had introduced draft “privacy legislation” to address the rights of consumers online. While Washington State has introduced a [GDPR-style proposal](&lt;|url|&gt;), most states have put forth copycat legislation along the lines of the [California Consumer Privacy Act.](&lt;|url|&gt;) In addition to the draft state laws, there have also been a [number of calls](&lt;|url|&gt;) for comprehensive federal legislation. Yet, despite this deluge of draft “privacy” proposals, we are still not having a meaningful conversation about our privacy in an increasingly digital world.

While these measures represent a positive expression of consumer sentiment and political will, they do not approximate meaningful privacy protections for individuals because they only address data privacy. The difference between privacy and data privacy is not a question of semantics. To varying degrees, the proposals listed above address our rights in relation to data that we have shared “online,” requiring things like enhanced transparency in privacy policies, better notice and consent, improved access rights, and robust data security measures to protect your data that’s been collected by companies. These proposals are fundamentally about data — how it’s collected and shared, and how it is treated and protected once it’s been collected or shared — in the context of our known commercial or contractual relationships with digital intermediaries.

While important, it’s naive to think that we can contain digital invasions of our privacy by merely regulating these commercial relationships. We already know that companies, like Facebook, track users as well as [nonusers](&lt;|url|&gt;) who are not registered with the platform, that advertisers build [shadow and inferred profiles](&lt;|url|&gt;) on individuals who have never shared any data directly, that individuals are targeted for their membership, or perceived membership, in a certain population or group, and that negative inferences can be drawn in the absence of the individual’s participation or not. Demystifying privacy policies, enhancing notice and consent, and providing access to and transparency in the data we’ve shared are irrelevant and impotent measures when we are exploited outside of our contractual or commercial relationships.

The reality is that we are being tracked, targeted, stalked, and harassed by commercial actors via digital means, whether or not we have direct contractual relationships with them. Advertisers are routinely targeting and profiling “audience segments” on the basis of gender or race — for example, junk food ads are [disproportionately targeted](&lt;|url|&gt;) at black and Hispanic youth. Our location data, biological markers, and other personal information is now captured not just by our digital devices — including smartwatches, mobile devices, fitness trackers with a lack of transparency about their design or motives — but also through cameras, beacons, facial recognition technologies, and other digital tools that we did not purchase or acquire. For these reasons, the real privacy invasions in the digital space cannot be contained with data privacy laws. And they cannot be contained by a myopic focus on our data.

In general, we do not tolerate tracking, targeting, profiling, and stalking in the real world. When we do, we expect these measures to be subject to significant limitations and procedural hurdles imposed by law. For example, racial profiling and targeting, when conducted by law enforcement, are subject to constitutional challenges on equal protection grounds and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure per the Fourth amendment. In [*Grady v. North Carolina](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, the Supreme Court held that North Carolina’s satellite-based, ankle bracelet monitoring program effectuated a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth amendment because it was “plainly designed to obtain information” and “does so by physically intruding on a subject’s body.”

The legal constructs of privacy are rooted in civil, political, and human rights that are aimed at promoting individual autonomy by limiting intrusions and interferences with our persons, families, bodies, homes, and certain personal effects. Real privacy preserves a space around the individual to think, feel, and act for him or herself. Real privacy cannot be negotiated through commercial terms and contracts. While I welcome the conversations motivated by the various draft data privacy proposals on the table, we need to have a much bigger conversation about privacy in relation to our increasingly digital lives. If we don’t, our data may end up having more privacy protections than we do.<|endoftext|>

# Why Instagram Made Multi-Photo Posts More Annoying

## It’s all about the engagement

![Photo by [Kate Torline](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Kate Torline](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Two years ago, Instagram changed our feeds forever with the introduction of multi-photo posts. Users could now choose up to 10 images to display, in precisely the order they want to display them. “Create a step-by-step cake recipe that people can always find on your profile,” the company suggested in its [announcement](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Something has changed since then. Multi-photo posts will now often start on the second image in a series. These “photo nudges,” as I call them, seem to occur when you scroll past an image without engaging with it. [Instagram’s algorithm](&lt;|url|&gt;), growing smarter every day through the data users create, reinserts these series into your feed disguised as something new by “nudging” the second image forward. Whenever this happens, Instagram’s watching eye suddenly becomes a visible presence in my experience, and an annoying one at that.

Instagram did not return a request for comment about photo nudges, but a few design experts had some thoughts. As you’d expect, there’s a good chance the move is all about Instagram’s bottom line — and not your own experience with the app.

“It’s all in the pursuit of engagement, making sure that when you log in, you keep seeing posts that resonate with you,” says Kate Moran, a user experience specialist at Nielsen Norman Group. She adds that the feature might also “encourage and make sure that the posts that you submit are getting likes, so that you’re more motivated to keep posting in the future.”

Moran was quick to point out that she’s just speculating, but her point makes sense. “Presumably, people are probably organizing those multiple-photo posts in some sort of meaningful way,” she says, but Instagram prioritizes engagement and algorithmically sorts your timeline as is. Rearranging the images within a multi-photo post could be just another way to encourage interactions from viewers.

That theory, she says, helps explain other features, like notifications encouraging people to interact with posts from what the company defines as “at-risk users” — those who use and post to the app infrequently.
> # “It’s all in the pursuit of engagement.”

Frank Garofalo, principal consultant at Garofalo UX, also speculates that the second-photo feature could be a fix for users who are accustomed to vertical scrolling, but not necessarily the horizontal swiping required of multi-photo posts.

“If their analytics of usage was showing that, across the board, there was a low use of scrolling through multiple photos of a single post, this might be an attempt to try to increase those analytics and that actual usage count,” he says.

That begs another question: does the format even make much sense to begin with? Instagram is all about moving through a vertical space. Kevin P. Nichols, executive director of experience at AvenueCX, for one, says multi-photo posts disrupt user expectations.

“It’s mimicking the functionality of a carousel,” he says. “I think there’s better design approaches to do it than what we’re seeing here.”

Nichols suggests multi-photo posts displayed in single, gridded tile may be easier to interact with. A horizontal scroll for the feed could be another option that more naturally matches the multi-photo feature, though Instagram tested that in December — and immediately faced a user [revolt](&lt;|url|&gt;).

In any case, the multi-photo feature signals a departure from Instagram’s initial functionality.

“The point of Instagram is you’re trying to showcase a particular image or idea or theme and then comment on it, so multi-photo posts kind of defeats that purpose and dilutes that purpose,” Nichols says.

So, the next time you’re alone absentmindedly thumbing through your feed while sitting on the couch or the toilet, you may come across an interesting photo only to swipe left and realize it’s a post you had seen before. In that moment of technological deja vu, remember that Instagram is always watching — and changing based on what you do.<|endoftext|>

# Free Will in an Algorithmic World

## In this brave new world, many of our choices aren’t choices at all

![Credit: Yaroslav Kushta/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Yaroslav Kushta/Getty Images*

Tai, a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, wakes up at the perfect time every morning—well-rested, but not late for classes or appointments. Today that meant rising at 7:18 a.m. He did not set his alarm for that time. Rather, it was chosen for him. His phone’s sleep-tracker app had been following his sleep patterns over the past few months, monitoring his REM cycles and periods of lighter rest. Using this information, it set a smart alarm that wakes him during a light stage of sleep, while also trying to maintain some level of consistency over time. The theory is that this schedule will prime Tai for greater energy and concentration throughout the day.

Tai needs to be sharp. He’s at a turning point in his life, about to step away from the relatively safe world of college—of information-gathering, homework, and exams—into the “real” world of practical problem solving: finding a job, choosing a place to live, and negotiating the wonderful but complicated details of a romantic relationship that’s getting more serious by the day.

Tai rolls over in bed and, with one eye open, grabs his phone and checks his notifications: 14 likes on his latest Insta, seven Facebook notifications, and three comments on his new Facebook profile picture. Not bad for a Monday night. He scrolls down his Facebook feed. An article shared by his friend Harry grabs his attention with its headline, “The Wealth of New Choices With Robot Vacuum Cleaners.” He clicks and, liking what he reads about the Eufy RoboVac cleaner, forwards the article to his girlfriend, Kate.

There’s an email from his mom, too, with a link to a *New York Times *article, “What I Wish I’d Known Before Moving in Together.” Tai groans. Mention even a possibility* *to his mother, and she sets it in stone. The picture accompanying the article shows an attractive couple in their thirties sitting on an unblemished white staircase, smiling into each other’s eyes. He types, “Ha ha thanks. That middle-aged couple looks happy, see. How did you find this?” Calling them middle-aged will definitely get on his mom’s nerves. But there’s no time for more needling: It’s already 7:28 a.m.

Tai rolls out of bed and, walking across his dusty carpet, opens his dresser, pulling out a pair of stretch washed chinos from Bonobos (he follows the online clothing retailer on Instagram), blue-and-gray argyle socks (top-rated on Amazon), and a dress shirt and tie. He has a job interview today.

As he sits down for breakfast, Tai thinks of the fortuitous circumstances that led to the interview. He found the job posting through his friend Samantha, who LinkedIn’s algorithms had reminded him to congratulate on her six-month work anniversary. Their conversation had been a little awkward, as Tai and Samantha had matched on Tinder a few years earlier. She was an artsy girl with a bubbling self-confidence; lots to like about her, but neither of them felt any sparks. And although they became friends, it had been hard for Tai to keep up with her since she graduated, especially since Kate wasn’t Samantha’s biggest fan.

Tai’s friendship with Samantha is hardly the only thing that’s been getting on Kate’s nerves lately. Their discussion about possibly moving in together seems to be stressing her out. Over the weekend, Tai had sent Kate a *Huffington Post* recommended article: “15 Things Couples Should Do Before Moving In Together,” which she read with great interest—especially point number 15, “Have an exit strategy.” Tai suggested that if they did split up, it would make sense for her to be the one to move out—after all, he had found the new apartment for the two of them. But it was only a contingency plan. Her angry texts on the subject were still awaiting his reply.
> # *It all seems kind of random at one level. But he can’t help but wonder about the degree to which the algorithms employed by Facebook, Google, Tinder, and Amazon have a role to play in his present circumstances.*

After dressing, Tai checks his phone again to see if there are more texts. Nothing new from Kate, but there is a reply from his mom about the *Times *article: “Oh, I was looking for housewarming gifts for you and Kate, and it popped up on Google. Why don’t you send it to her, sweetie? And good luck on your interview this morning!”

Tai can hear Chance the Rapper, chosen for him by Spotify Discover, rapping on the other side of his bedroom wall, which is now glowing with the light of the rising sun from the east window. It’s time to head out for the interview. He looks for an Uber to take him to campus. The price is $11.23, which feels a bit steep; yesterday it had been $9.34 for the same route. He closes the app and relaunches it. The price is now $10.82. It’s not clear to Tai why it changed, but he confirms the booking this time and waits at his door for the Toyota Corolla to pull up.

As he exchanges pleasantries with the driver, Tai opens a notebook to work on his case interviews, the part of business school job applications where students are asked to think through a challenging business scenario and present a solution. The case prep document shared by another student includes the question: What is root cause analysis?

Tai jots down some notes, applies that technique to analyze his day today, and produces a diagram:

![](<|image|>)

It all seems kind of random at one level. But he can’t help but wonder about the degree to which the algorithms employed by Facebook, Google, Tinder, and Amazon have a role to play in his present circumstances. Will he have some cooked-up equation from a programmer to thank for his next job? And is this job really the best next step for his life and career or just the accidental result of inconsequential past decisions—clicks of a mouse and swipes on a screen? Tai likes to think of himself as being in the driver’s seat. But this Uber ride suggests he’s not — both figuratively and literally.

Or maybe he’s just overthinking things, the aftereffect of an in-class discussion we had on personalization algorithms just a few days earlier. He sends me an email: “Have something interesting to show you. Do you have 10 minutes after class?”

Tai sighs and shuts his notebook. Maybe all he and Kate need is to get away for a bit to reconsider this moving-in idea. He pulls out his phone and opens Expedia’s app. It might have some good hotel recommendations.

Since 2004 I’ve been teaching a class at Wharton called “Enabling Technologies.” In hindsight I should have named it “What’s Going On in Tech,” because that’s a more accurate and descriptive name. One topic that has remained a constant in the course through the years is algorithmic decision-making. The sort of question that Tai asked—to what extent are we in control of our own actions?—is coming up in the class more and more often.

Consider these facts: 80 percent of viewing hours streamed on Netflix originate from automated recommendations. By some estimates, nearly 35 percent of sales at Amazon originate from automated recommendations. And the vast majority of matches on dating apps such as Tinder and OkCupid are initiated by algorithms. Given these numbers, many of us clearly do not have quite the freedom of choice we believe we do.

One reason is that products are often designed in ways that make us act impulsively and against our better judgment. For example, suppose you have a big meeting at work tomorrow. Ideally, you want to spend some time preparing for it in the evening and then get a good night’s rest. But before you can do either, a notification pops up on your phone indicating that a friend tagged you on Facebook. “This will take a minute,” you tell yourself as you click on it. But after logging in, you discover a long feed of posts by friends. A few clicks later, you find yourself watching a YouTube video that one of them shared. As soon as the video ends, YouTube suggests other related and interesting videos. Before you know it, it’s 1:00 a.m., and it’s clear that you will need an all-nighter to get ready for the following morning’s meeting. This has happened to most of us.

The reason this behavior is so common, as some product designers have noted, is that popular design approaches—such as the use of notifications and gamification to increase user engagement—exploit and amplify human vulnerabilities, such as our need for social approval or our inability to resist immediate gratification even when we recognize that it comes with long-term costs. While we might feel as if we are making our own choices, we’re often nudged or even tricked into making them.

Another reason we aren’t truly in control of our choices is that when we search for a hotel on Expedia, browse online dating profiles, or shop for a book, we’re seeing only a small fraction of all the potentially relevant information available. Although we experience a clear sense of free will by making the final decision regarding what we see, read, or buy, the fact is that 99 percent of all possible alternatives were excluded.

You probably don’t mind saving all the time you might have wasted in sifting through inferior options to arrive at a final choice. But algorithms do not simply help us find products or information quickly, which we might have found eventually without their assistance. In truth, they exert a significant influence on precisely what and how much we consume.
> # *The conventional narrative is that algorithms will make faster and better decisions for all of us, leaving us with more time for family and leisure. But the reality isn’t so simple.*

We also experience the impact of algorithms on social media websites, where we are likely to believe that our friends are the chief drivers of the content we see. In reality, algorithms play an equally important role. In 2012, Facebook conducted a study in which they tweaked their news feed algorithm to show some users more “hard news”—think more “war in Iraq” and less “cats fitting in boxes.” They then measured how many of these users clicked the “I voted” button that most of us saw at the top of our Facebook feed in November 2012. They compared the self-reported voter turnout of this group against a control group whose news feed algorithm had not been modified. The researchers found that users who had their news feed algorithm tweaked increased their voting turnout by three percentage points, from 64 percent for the control group to 67 percent for the treatment group. A follow-up survey found that these users were also significantly more likely to report that they paid attention to government. Three percentage points might not sound like much, but the outcomes of elections, including the U.S. presidential election in 2016, are frequently determined by smaller amounts.

Look around you and ask what drives your product, media, and people choices. Unless you are a tech Luddite, algorithms are silently rearranging your life. The conventional narrative is that algorithms will make faster and better decisions for all of us, leaving us with more time for family and leisure. But the reality isn’t so simple. In this brave new world, many of our choices are in fact predestined, and all the seemingly small effects that algorithms have on our decisions add up to a transformative impact on our lives. Because who we are, ultimately, is the sum total of the various decisions we make over a lifetime.

# Meet the World’s Most Bio-Tracked Man

## Scientist Michael Snyder tracked his own basic measurements for years. Now he’s released a study of over 100 people using similar data to make lifesaving discoveries about heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.

![Illustration: [Joseph Melhuish](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Joseph Melhuish](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Michael Snyder might be the most bio-tracked man in the world. He’s tested 14 of his “-omes,” such as the standard genome and microbiome as well as the less-well-known metabolome, transcriptome, proteome, immunome, and [exposome](&lt;|url|&gt;). At any given time, he has eight devices on or around his body tracking his heart rate, blood oxygen, step count, blood glucose, radiation exposure, and even the surrounding air quality.

“It’s data galore,” says the Stanford University genetics professor on a recent Saturday afternoon at his office. Snyder is an animated talker and quick to laugh, with deep smile lines around his eyes. He is a man who loves what he does, and it shows. “I’m a pretty big nerd,” he says. “Here I am on a Saturday. That probably tells you all you need to know.”

Snyder thinks the way we approach medicine is entirely wrong and that mining our personal health data could be the key to fixing it. His ambitions are two-fold: Instead of focusing on treating people when they’re sick, he wants to concentrate on keeping them well. And rather than basing treatment decisions on population studies, he believes medicine should be individualized. The idea is that if you know you have a genetic risk for a disease, you can proactively manage your health better, and awareness of your baseline measurements provides earlier insight into when you might fall ill.

“We are very focused on treating people when they’re sick,” he says. “It’s very reactive. We should obviously be focused on keeping people healthy.”

Snyder is applying his background in biology, chemistry, and big data to try to fix the field of medicine. His original claim to fame is conducting large-scale analyses of DNA, RNA, and proteins, often in yeast. When he moved his lab to Stanford from Yale 10 years ago, he also decided to change his research focus. Now he’s using the same technology to try to improve people’s health. And in the tradition of many scientists before him, he’s using himself as a guinea pig.

Thanks to his obsessive monitoring, Snyder discovered he had a genetic risk for diabetes, caught the onset of his high blood sugar, and managed to get it relatively under control through diet and exercise. He also learned that his diabetes is a special subtype that doesn’t look like either Type 1 or Type 2. His cells respond to insulin normally, and his pancreas produces the hormone just fine, but it doesn’t release insulin into the bloodstream very efficiently. This means many of the normal diabetes medications, such as metformin, don’t help him.
> # “The goal is to really understand what does it mean to be healthy, what does a healthy profile look like, how does it change over time, and what happens when people get sick at the earliest times.”

Snyder monitors not just what’s going on inside his body, but what’s happening outside of it as well. By measuring the particles and chemicals in his environment, Snyder learned that what he thought was an allergy to pine pollen was in fact a reaction to eucalyptus trees. He expanded the [exposome study](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2018 to 15 people in San Francisco and revealed that people were regularly exposed to 3,000 chemical signatures, including bacteria found in sludge and traces of the insect repellent ingredient deet.

In a new study published May 8 in the journal [*Nature Medicine](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, Snyder extended his philosophy to 108 other people, tracking them for an average of three years. They had their whole genomes sequenced, wore fitness trackers, and came in quarterly for other -omics screenings, primarily through blood testing. If they got sick during the course of the study, even with something as simple as a cold, they came in for more samples immediately during and after.

“The goal is to really understand what does it mean to be healthy, what does a healthy profile look like, how does it change over time, and what happens when people get sick at the earliest times,” says Snyder. “Along the way, you might discover things important for people’s health, and we did.”

Out of the 109 study participants (counting Snyder), the researchers made more than 67 actionable health discoveries. These include identifying genetic risks for heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as well as catching early signs of the conditions in a few of the participants.

For example, one person learned they had early-stage lymphoma before they showed symptoms. The researchers discovered the cancer from an ultrasound scan that revealed an enlarged spleen and a test of the person’s immunome, which measures levels of immune chemicals in the blood. Thanks to clues from the frequent screens, Snyder thinks they may have identified an early biomarker for cancer, too. In blood tests a year before the person was diagnosed, one immune chemical was much higher than normal. After the person was successfully treated, the levels went back down, suggesting it may have been an indicator of the disease.

“I think this is very much what medicine in the future will look like,” says Christopher Mason, an associate professor of physiology and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine who was not involved in the study. “You want to build as much information about every individual so that you can look for any change in their health trajectory.”

“This is a paper that is important for ushering in the potential utility of long and deep data,” says Eric Topol, executive vice president of the Scripps Research Institute, who also was not part of the research. “So often when we collect data, we do it as a one-off. Here, they’ve done a longitudinal time series of data capture. It just shows you the power of this type of data.”

Of all the tests they administered, Snyder says the two with the biggest effects on health and behavior are ones that are commonly used today: genetic testing and continuous glucose monitoring.

Fifty-five people in the study learned they were prediabetic (the group was preselected as having a high risk for diabetes). By tracking their blood sugar with the continuous glucose monitor, the participants were able to identify which foods caused their blood sugar to spike. The culprits were often very personal (one person responded more to rice than potatoes while another person was the opposite) and surprising (someone had a large increase in blood sugar after eating lentils). However, nearly everyone spiked in response to eating cereal and milk.

“For the continuous glucose monitors, that’s where people learned the most about their diet and how it was affecting them. It served as almost a biofeedback device,” says Sophia Miryam Schüssler-Fiorenza Rose, a neurosurgery instructor at Stanford who was the first author on the paper. “It might be worthwhile for people, even before they have diabetes, to learn more about how their diet is affecting their blood sugar. I think when people see that, they’re more able to make changes.”

Participants also made changes based on their genomic screens, including switching their medications thanks to so-called pharmacogenomic discoveries. For example, one person had a heart attack during the course of the study. It turned out they had a genetic variation that placed them at a greater risk for a heart attack from an interaction with a medication they were on. Once the researchers discovered the gene variation, they were able to alert the participant and their doctor, who subsequently changed the medication before they had another heart attack.

Other -omes, like the transcriptome and metabolome, are more dynamic, assessing acute changes in proteins and other factors in the blood that can indicate the progression of a disease. Despite their potential, however, Rose says making sense of the data is still a work in progress. “They’re not quite as far along as genomic testing is at this point,” she says. Rose and Snyder hope these tests will one day help them subtype diseases better so doctors can give people the best drugs for their specific strain.

Not everyone thinks this amount of testing is necessary — or realistic. The screening is expensive (a whole genome screen still costs about $1,000), and the vast majority of preventative tests, genomic or otherwise, aren’t covered by insurance. “The American medical system would definitely need to change in order to incorporate this,” says Joanne Berghout, a research assistant professor of biomedical informatics at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study.

There are also concerns that people will become anxious or overreact to their potential risk for a disease. “Too much testing and incidental -omics, you basically wind up inducing hypochondria,” says Topol. “You wind up not only with anxiety, but you can find things that get unnecessarily tested and all sorts of incidental findings.”

There have been past incidents of misdiagnoses by going off of genes instead of symptoms. For example, at least one [healthy person got a defibrillator implanted](&lt;|url|&gt;) because their doctor thought they had a genetic risk for a heart arrhythmia even though they didn’t have any symptoms. Later, the gene variation turned out to be unrelated, and the person was perfectly healthy.

Snyder agrees that this type of comprehensive testing may not be for everyone. He’s also quick to point out the new paper is a research study and is not meant to be rolled out into a health care setting just yet. As testing becomes simultaneously cheaper and more precise, though, he is adamant that personalized medicine is the way of the future.

“We’re all going to get diseases, we’re all going to die of something,” he says. But if you’re armed with the right information, “you can better manage yourself. I think what we all want is to live good health spans and then just pop away.”<|endoftext|>

# The Tyranny of Convenience

## Welcome to the future we all chose, but that nobody seems to want

![Credit: Greg Baker/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Greg Baker/Getty Images*

“I just boarded an international @JetBlue flight. Instead of scanning my boarding pass or handing over my passport, I looked into a camera before being allowed down the jet bridge,” MacKenzie Fegan [tweeted last week](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Did facial recognition replace boarding passes, unbeknownst to me? Did I consent to this?”


The quick answer? Yes and no.

Yes, facial recognition did replace boarding passes for international travelers in some U.S. airports recently, and — if the Trump administration [has its way](&lt;|url|&gt;) — it will be the default check-in method in many more airports by 2020. And no, Fegan did not overtly consent to this specific use of facial recognition. Nor did anyone else, presumably. In a subsequent tweet, JetBlue [told](&lt;|url|&gt;) Fegan that passengers can “opt out of this procedure,” suggesting that JetBlue considers consent to be implied by default.
> # If we take the airline’s word for it, JetBlue assumed that its passengers would find biometric check-in more convenient than the conventional method.

Part of the answer as to why JetBlue might have made that assumption — that people would actually want their faces to serve as a boarding pass, instead of a piece of paper or their smartphone — appears in a [press release](&lt;|url|&gt;) JetBlue linked to in its response thread with Fegan.

Back in November, when biometric boarding was introduced at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, JetBlue’s senior vice president of customer experience was quoted praising the technology as “a testament to the airline’s ongoing work to create a personal, helpful, and simple experience.” If we take the airline’s word for it, JetBlue assumed that its passengers would find biometric check-in more convenient than the conventional method.

In the ongoing and growing opposition to the seemingly dystopian world technology companies are building, convenience is often overlooked. But it’s convenience, and the way convenience is currently created by tech companies and accepted by most of us, that is key to why we’ve ended up living in a world we all chose, but that nobody seems to want.

Convenience is signing up to a social media platform to keep in touch with friends and family and keep abreast of current events, and then [discovering](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the personal information you’ve been required to upload to enable your account has been used to micro-target you with disinformation.

Convenience is buying a digital assistant for your home to make hands-free information searches easier, and later finding out that employees of the company that makes it are [able to listen](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the commands you’ve been giving it — or that its recordings of the ambient sounds of your home [have been mailed](&lt;|url|&gt;) to someone you don’t know.

Convenience is downloading a weather app to check whether you need to pack an umbrella, only to later realize that the app’s code makes it easy for someone [to track your movements](&lt;|url|&gt;) with such specificity that no amount of anonymization of the data would hide that it was you entering a Planned Parenthood, or riding along with the mayor of New York City.

Convenience is watching one video online by someone who thinks the world is flat, and [tumbling down a rabbit hole](&lt;|url|&gt;) of aggressive and increasingly swivel-eyed conspiracy videos until you end up believing that Hillary Clinton is a lizard from another planet. Better yet, convenience is sitting your child down in front of a supposedly child-friendly video only to discover a while later that the same autoplay function has dug up [videos](&lt;|url|&gt;) of their favorite cartoon characters being mutilated.

Convenience is driving a car for a ride-hail company because it promises flexible hours, only to find yourself making less than minimum wage and subject to [phantom price surge](&lt;|url|&gt;) promises, the [absolutism](&lt;|url|&gt;) of personal star ratings, and constant surveillance, including messages that prompt you to get back to driving like [a notification](&lt;|url|&gt;) that your phone is unmounted.
> # Most importantly, convenience is a value, and one we hold personally.

Convenience is booking a flight online quickly and cheaply, only to discover upon arriving at the airport that you are required to subject yourself to a facial recognition “procedure,” where your image is captured and automatically checked against a federal database, affording you little recourse if it [happens to mismatch](&lt;|url|&gt;), in order to board your plane and embark on your trip.

Convenience is allowing the “if, then” logic of an algorithm to shape the music you hear, the books you read, the information you see, the news you read, the things you watch, and the people you interact with.

Convenience is the powerful marketing tool deployed by utopian evangelists to describe a world of total ease and seamless interactions that deliberately masks a frantic race to monopolize a near-bottomless well of behavioral and biometric data. It is the device used to reduce our personal agency, strip us of personal choice, and ultimately [render us helpless](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the terms and conditions to which we have unwittingly clicked “[I agree](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

Most importantly, convenience is a value, and one we hold personally. Ultimately, this is why it keeps winning, outweighing the more abstract ideas like privacy, democracy, or equality, all of which remain merely issues for most of us. That’s why Fegan’s encounter matters. Her moment of realization at the airport is one we will all face one day: the instant when we realize that the convenience we value is not only inseparable from those issues, but that, taken far enough, that they can’t exist simultaneously. Convenience doesn’t simply supercede privacy or democracy or equality in many of our lives. It might also destroy them.<|endoftext|>

# Wikipedia Shows How to Handle Political Polarization

## Even when editors disagree sharply, the site’s firm rules enable them to produce accurate entries

![Photo: Hindustan Times/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Hindustan Times/Getty Images*

Is there an upside to political polarization? A cursory glance at the state of social media would suggest not: Twitter is a cesspool of abuse, Facebook a repository of viral misinformation, and YouTube a broadcaster of conspiracy theories and vicious trolling.

Given the lamentable state of political discourse online, one might expect that Wikipedia — a crowdsourced encyclopedia to which anyone can contribute and edit information — would suffer from similar epistemic rot. But research recently[ published](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the journal *Nature Human Behavior* suggests just the opposite: on pages where Wikipedia editors are ideologically polarized, the quality and truth of their output actually improves.

The study, entitled “The Wisdom of Polarized Crowds,” comes out of the University of Chicago’s[ Knowledge Lab](&lt;|url|&gt;), which investigates how groups of people come to know things together. The director of the lab and professor of sociology, James Evans, told me that part of this research project involves assessing the extent to which individual political commitments contribute to a group’s ability to produce knowledge.
> # They found that when an editing community is politically polarized, the depth and accuracy of the information significantly improves, and inversely, as editing communities become ideologically homogeneous, the quality of the page dramatically declines.

Evans has observed that while many studies show how diversity of socioeconomic background, gender, and race can[ lead](&lt;|url|&gt;) to better group outcomes, the conventional wisdom is that this isn’t the case for extreme political diversity, which is often [characterized](&lt;|url|&gt;) as polarization. He and a team of three researchers wanted to test this presupposition and assess whether political diversity could sometimes produce better perspectives, in much the same way demographic diversity can.

To do so, they turned their attention to how knowledge is produced on Wikipedia. On every Wikipedia entry there is a “[talk page](&lt;|url|&gt;),” the backend where a community of editors try to persuade other editors to accept their contributions. Evans and his team measured the political composition of more than 200,000 of these editing communities, assessing to what extent the editors were split between conservative and liberal ideologies.

They found that when an editing community is politically polarized, the depth and accuracy of the information significantly improves, and inversely, as editing communities become ideologically homogeneous, the quality of the page dramatically declines.

Feng Shi, a co-author of the paper and data scientist at the University of North Carolina atChapel Hill, believes Wikipedia’s capacity to harness diversity is due to the platform’s firm editing guidelines, which[ demand](&lt;|url|&gt;) neutrality, proper citation, and respectful discourse. “Editing on contested topics is like arguing in a court of law,” Shi says. “You have to be tough, have endurance, but most importantly, have a strong commitment to the rules.”

Shi adds that on contentious Wikipedia pages with ideologically diverse editors, these guidelines are fastidiously maintained, with each competing faction using them to hold opponents to account. On Donald Trump’s page, for instance, the editors have[ collectively](&lt;|url|&gt;) agreed that if you add a new fact, and someone corrects it, you can only revert that correction once every 24 hours, in order to prevent spiraling “[edit wars](&lt;|url|&gt;).” (As a recent *Slate* [feature](&lt;|url|&gt;) made clear, the debates over Trump’s page can get incredibly heated — but imagine how much worse it might be without Wikipedia’s firm rules.)

Justin Knapp, a[ prolific](&lt;|url|&gt;) Wikipedia editor with more than 2 million contributions, agrees that Wikipedia’s robust bureaucracy is crucial to cultivating a space for meaningful disagreement. One of the pages Knapp contributes to concerns the 40-year-long conflict in the[ Western Sahara](&lt;|url|&gt;), between the Polisario Front,** **a** **rebel national liberation movement of the nomadic Sahrawi people, and the Kingdom of Morocco. Knapp is sympathetic to the political cause of the Polisario Front, which he views as an indigenous people fighting for self-determination and decolonization. He often runs up against editors who hold the opposite position. But Knapp says that even when political disagreements are fierce, or seemingly unresolvable, the clear set of editing principles — to cite facts properly, to present information in a neutral voice — allows editors to resolve disputes without devolving into toxic arguments.
> # “Because of the shared mission, Wikipedia editors generally have an overlap in their set of values. And these values generally override a disagreement on a particular issue.”

More than any specific editing guideline, Knapp believes that it is Wikipedia’s sense of collective purpose that allows it to work so well. “Wikipedia has a serious collective goal and that is to create an encyclopedia,” Knapp says. “Because of the shared mission, Wikipedia editors generally have an overlap in their set of values. And these values generally override a disagreement on a particular issue.”

For Evans, this spirit of collectivity contrasts dramatically with the segregated “echo chambers” of social media, where each dissenting voice can create its own version of reality. “If you disagree with what the Wikipedia page says about climate change, you can’t just create a new, alternative one,” he says. “Because there is a single page on each topic, you have to go to the talk page and try to convince the other editors of your position.”

If Wikipedia’s editorial guidelines and collective spirit fosters political heterogeneity, the platform comes up short on other diversity measures. A 2018 survey[ found](&lt;|url|&gt;) that 90% of Wikipedia editors are men, the vast majority of whom are young, college educated, white, and living in the global north. This impacts Wikipedia’s content, which skews in favor of topics popular with this demographic: Western philosophy, European history, computer games. [Lots and lots of computer games.](&lt;|url|&gt;)

In response to this homogeneity, the[ Wikimedia Foundation](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the nonprofit that operates and supports Wikipedia and its global community of volunteers — has rolled out diversity initiatives, such as editing training sessions for women across the globe, as well as Edit-a-thons, which [started](&lt;|url|&gt;) as part of a 2013 strategy[ aimed](&lt;|url|&gt;) at the site’s leveling the content and contributor gender imbalance.

But Rachel Wexelbaum, a Wikipedia editor who promotes LGBTQ+ contributions on the platform, says that demographic homogeneity still acts as a barrier for women and LGBTQ+ folk who want to join the conversation on contentious pages. “While we might be able to add new content about our own community interests, when we try to edit or add something to a popular page, we are often met with aggression from existing editors,” she says. “It begins with an argument in the talk pages, but then it can quickly become flat out rudeness. Sometimes it even turns into harassment and abuse.”

Sydney Poore, the trust and safety specialist at Wikimedia, says she is aware of harassment that takes place in the talk pages, and in response, her team has developed a number of strategies to curtail it, including muting features and blocking functions that allow page administrators to stop a user from contributing to a page where they have behaved contrary to the spirit of “[respect and civility](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

While common sense might suggest that the most intense abuse occurs on pages that are ideologically divisive, the Knowledge Lab found that it’s just the opposite. Using an automated text-analysis tool to analyze the talk pages of hundreds of thousands of Wikipedia pages, the researchers discovered that polarized editorial teams actually lead to more civil conversation and that, conversely, politically homogeneous editing communities more regularly turn toxic.

Evans explains that this is because on ideologically uniform pages, a group of editors will sometimes “gang up” on an editor with a dissenting view. But when there is a population of editors that is balanced, yet polarized, each group holds the other to account. “The balanced diversity essentially self-disciplines the editorial process,” Evans says. “This means the conversations go on longer, the debates become more specific, and the rules are appealed to more often.”

For Evans, the broader implication of these findings is that diversity improves not just the output of knowledge production, like a Wikipedia page, but is integral to the process itself. “To come to know things together there has to be a belief that each perspective really cannot contain the whole,” he says. “And to get to that place, we have to believe that diversity really does matter.”<|endoftext|>

# Why Our Devices Stopped Playing Nice With One Another

## Why Our Devices Stopped Playing Nice With One Another

### Walled gardens aren’t the limitless digital future we were promised

![Credit: NurPhoto/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: NurPhoto/Getty*

Science fiction has long created the expectation that we would eventually be able to make a video call from any device, to anyone in the world, with just the flick of a wrist.

But no visionary writer predicted what that would actually mean, circa 2019: Installing six separate messaging apps on your phone and five video-calling tools, none of which work together. Sure we can video call, *Star Trek*-style — but first, we have to decide whether we’re calling on Skype, Messenger, Snap, WhatsApp, or FaceTime. The magic of technology brought us the ability to summon a car from the internet and ride with a stranger to any destination, but I still can’t figure out if I’ll ever be able to get my mum to call me on Google Duo instead of FaceTime, since I’ve switched to Android and FaceTime isn’t available here.

Our smartphones have become overrun with walled gardens, such that choosing a phone now means being locked into an entire ecosystem of devices and services around it — and being blocked from anything that isn’t sanctioned. Companies like Apple have also started to find ways to [extend their reach to other platforms](&lt;|url|&gt;) in an effort to keep you in their ecosystems.

We’ve had to deal with some version of this battle for years now, of course. Back in 2012, [Instagram blocked Twitter](&lt;|url|&gt;) from showing embeds of its photos on the service, largely to drive more clicks to its own service. Twitter, in return, [banned Instagram](&lt;|url|&gt;) from using its API to find your friends on the service.

But as the internet begins to creep into our homes in new ways — through devices like HomePod, Google Home, Alexa, and a myriad of other smart devices — the battleground has shifted. Now it feels as if we have no choice but to lock ourselves into a single ecosystem, leaving our most personal spaces to be defined by that choice.
> # I still can’t figure out if I’ll ever be able to get my mum to call me on Google Duo instead of FaceTime

Take smart speakers, the front line for tech companies’ battle over your home. Products like Alexa or Google Home are usually the first smart devices consumers will purchase, and since any smart devices you buy after that must be compatible with your speaker, which one you choose is incredibly important. A great example of the effects of that choice can be seen in two of the world’s most popular messaging apps: Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger.

Both of these apps are used by billions of people, yet they’re conspicuously missing from major smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home, which are selling in the millions. Why? Well, Facebook wants a piece of the smart speaker action with its Portal device. If you want to make a video call with WhatsApp or Messenger through a smart speaker, you need to own a Portal. You can control your Google-owned Nest thermostat via your Google Home by simply saying “turn up the heat” out loud. But good luck making it work with an Apple HomePod. Speaking of that HomePod: You’d better believe Apple’s smart speaker [makes it a pain](&lt;|url|&gt;) to use Spotify, Apple Music’s main competitor.

Alternatives like the Nest Hub Max and the Alexa Show should have no problem using WhatsApp or Messenger, just as Apple probably wouldn’t have a difficult time more seamlessly integrating Spotify. These aren’t technical barriers — they’re corporate barriers.

You can see evidence of this phenomenon even among the most basic of product lines. The headphone market hasn’t traditionally been subjected to walled gardens because there’s only so much power a company can wield over the 3.5 mm audio jack, which has been the industry standard for decades. And that helps explain why Apple removed the jack from its phones beginning with the iPhone 7 in 2016 — just three months before the wireless AirPods came out.

Apple argued that removing the headphone jack allowed for more internal component space — it put a plastic “[barometric vent](&lt;|url|&gt;)” there — but it also coincidentally meant that you couldn’t plug your headphones in without a dongle. Perhaps that made you more likely to buy Bluetooth headphones, instead, and maybe you wanted the option with extra features designed just for your new iPhone: the AirPods.

AirPods can do a lot of cool things, like share music with a friend’s pair, or quickly connect to a new device without fidgeting with Bluetooth menus — but you need an iPhone for any of it to work. While AirPods can technically function as normal Bluetooth earbuds on different hardware, they’re at their best when they take advantage of the proprietary system Apple built with its own headphone chips, allowing for these extra features.

Meanwhile, [Sony’s latest headphones](&lt;|url|&gt;) can read out your messages and other notifications proactively with Google Assistant — but only if you use an Android device. If you buy one of these devices and find yourself wanting to switch to iOS, you’ll be sacrificing a significant amount of functionality. (That said, at least the Sony headphones allow you to use Amazon’s Alexa assistant on both iOS and Android.)

It’s not that companies technically lack the ability to make everything play nice — it’s just that their own products can be made “stickier” by closing users in. If you love your AirPods, maybe you don’t switch from iOS to Android. Your Nest thermostat already works so well; why switch from a Google Home to an Apple HomePod, and sacrifice some of that seamless functionality? If you love WhatsApping with your uncle, Facebook Portal may be the choice over an Alexa Show.

Thankfully, some companies are bucking the trend toward walled gardens. Sonos, for example, has fought to allow its smart speakers to switch between voice assistants, [offering both Alexa and Google Assistant on the same device](&lt;|url|&gt;). IKEA is getting its toes wet in the smart home market with products like smart lights, but it’s making sure that its products are compatible with any device that might want to use them. [Tradfri](&lt;|url|&gt;), Ikea’s smart lights brand, works with both iOS and Android but uses open standards. And there are physical controls, too, for those who don’t want to use a smart device at all.

Still, the norm for the most powerful tech companies is to seek market dominance by cutting off their competitors. That puts the burden on consumers to maintain openness at home. Consider each of your purchases well, and learn about the ecosystems they work in. Otherwise, you may be locking basic functions in your home to the decisions tech giants make for you. And no one wants to toss their blender just because Apple’s HomeKit won’t support it.<|endoftext|>

# Why People Buy $30 Power Cords Against All Reason

## An informed theory

![Credit: sombatkapan/iStock/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: sombatkapan/iStock/Getty Images Plus*

Maybe you’ve heard** **of Occam’s Razor? It’s the logical principle that holds that the simplest answer to a question is usually the correct one. And the simplest answer, according to Occam’s Razor, is the one that requires the fewest number of assumptions or jumps in logic to reach the correct conclusion.

With that in mind, a question recently came up in conversation: Why in the world would anyone buy Apple’s $30 [6.5-foot Lightning-to-USB cable](&lt;|url|&gt;)? A couple of answers arose:

1. All of the seating the potential buyer possesses is comically far from an outlet, and they have an aversion to extension cords.

1. The extra 3.3 feet of cable over the standard-issue 3.2-foot cable allows for a greater range of motion to allow for wild gesticulating (the imagination reels with possibility) while reaping the benefits of a charging iPhone.

Of course, neither theory rationalizes a $30 price tag. These aren’t special cables. They aren’t threaded or colored. They’re the standard-issue cable that comes with an iPhone, just with more cable and exponentially more expensive than the exact same cables you can buy elsewhere.

If Apple were the only company making six-foot iPhone cords (or iPhone cords period), they could charge whatever the hell they want to the extension-cord-averse among their constituency.

And yet: They’re not! You know this because as a warm-blooded, Internet-reading human, you’ve walked into a bodega/gas station/drug store sometime over the last three years and seen Lightning-to-USB cords for sale near the checkout counter.
> # Non-Apple cables are essentially identical to Apple cables, with that certification. They’re also comically cheaper.

So ubiquitous are these squirrelly power-transferring electronic white snakes, and so utterly universal is their propensity for abduction by the junk demon who consumes all seminecessary small items in our lives—items as annoying to lose as they are utterly replaceable—that you can now throw in an extra Lightning-to-USB cord with a sixer of Tampaxx Pearl, a tallboy of Molson Ice, some scratchers, and a pack of Winston Lights. This modern age! How delightful.

And if you wanna get really nasty, just forget* *about what else can be in your cart when you pick it up from Amazon (which will be more socks, obviously).

But about buying this same cord online: Amazon Basics retails a 6-foot Lightning-to-USB cord for $12.99. They even come in colors! Rose gold! [Neon pink](&lt;|url|&gt;)! You know what kind of cable $30 will* *buy you on Amazon?

Not just one, but
[two
color-blocked
10-foot Lightning-to-USB](&lt;|url|&gt;) cables! What a bargain! What bounty! What resplendency among us!

But none of that explains why Apple charges 30 bucks.

Now, you’re probably thinking: “Those cords aren’t authorized by Apple! Those cords are trash. Those cords won’t work. Those cords will set my house on fire. Those cords are made of ‘inferior’ material.”

While you’re correct that these off-brand cables are not, in fact, manufactured by Apple, each Lightning-to-USB cable third-party manufacturer can get their products MFI Certified, which means they have to be up to Apple’s own manufacturing standards (meaning it has to work, it has to be safe, it has to be made of nonradioactive materials, etc).

[One company wanted to see](&lt;|url|&gt;) just what a pain it is to get MFI Certified. Turns out? Kind of a pain! But they do it, and you can check for that certification when you buy a (cheaper) cord. You should, too, unless you want to [burn out your iPhone](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # Apple can, in fact, sell the same product at more than triple the price of where you can buy it elsewhere because people will buy it. That’s why.

So, now you know: Non-Apple cables are essentially identical to Apple cables, with that certification. They’re also comically cheaper. Thus, the question remains: Why does Apple even bother selling a $30 Lightning-to-USB cable?

Let’s return to Occam’s Razor:

* Maybe* *they’re happy to take advantage of customers who aren’t close to a place where they can buy an (unquestionably cheaper) cable, but that would assume that the buyer isn’t close to gas stations, 7–Elevens, or the internet, which happens to be accessible via the iPhones that require those charging cords. If you can make it to an Apple Store, you can make it to a non-Apple store that sells cheaper non-Apple cords.

* Maybe* *Apple has an argument for why their cable is superior to third-party cables: Because it’s an Apple product. But if that were* *the argument, could Apple reasonably make it with a straight face to the tune of a 100 percent price-differential? Not so much! Also, as mentioned, Apple sells practically identical third-party cords on their own website.

* Maybe Apple is conducting a massive sociology experiment to see who among us are the most emotionally attached to the equity buying from their brand, despite making a wildly economically irrational decision. (Maybe more important than ever, seeing as iPhone [sales are down](&lt;|url|&gt;).)

And the thing is, that last one? While it’s conspiratorially minded, tinfoil-hat-wearing nonsense, it’s also the one that’s closest to the truth of why they do this:

Because they can.

Apple can, in fact, sell the same product at more than triple the price of where you can buy it elsewhere because people will buy it. That’s why.

And Apple, a publicly-traded company, will make every single dollar they can off of consumers, no matter how irrational the transaction might actually be. Remember that word: irrational. It’s important to keep in mind when considering that Apple is far from the first company to be able to get consumers to commit to an irrational transaction and profit endlessly off it.

For example, your drugstore—the same one where they now sell off-brand iPhone cables by the checkout counter—also has shelves lousy with generic, store-label cola next to near-empty shelves of regular Coca-Cola. Why is this?

One might argue: I know how Coke tastes, and that trash fizzyswill ain’t Coke!* *Okay, fine*.* But do people take Advil for the taste? (They don’t, or at least most don’t.) Then how do we explain the bottles of generic ibuprofen that get left on the shelf in favor of Pfizer’s Advil, which costs a few bucks more, even though both products are regulated by the FDA to ensure there is literally no difference* *in the core composition of the two products—it’s against the law* *for there to be a difference.

One takeaway from a 2013 [*Quarterly Journal of Economics *study](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that informed drugstore consumers—meaning pharmacists, nurses, or doctors—almost always buy generic brands over established brands, while the rest of us are more likely to fall victim to our biases and wrongheaded “beliefs” about “better” brands. How much money could be saved if we all bought generic drugs, as opposed to their major pharmaceutical brands? Not millions, but [up to a billion dollars](&lt;|url|&gt;).

And yet, a confession:

I still buy Advil. I like looking at my dresser and the way my eyes zero in on its weird yellow-and-hunter-green labeling slapped over its squat, dumb little body. I like the way this bottle beckons me with the promise of ending the throbbing in my skull, the relief I feel the first time I see it as I tumble toward it once the rosy-fingered dawn of an agonizingly dehydrated Sunday is in full swing. I like the way my brain begins to soothe itself even more once those maroon Advil-imprinted moons nest in my hands in the moments before I dry-dock them into my dumb, hungover gullet [Dr. House-style](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Yes, I still pay a few bucks more for Advil.

Yes, This is an irresponsible financial decision.

Yes, I could, theoretically, train myself to buy dumb-brand Advil, and dumb-brand all-kinds-of-products that contain the same stuff as their branded contemporaries. Cetaphil face wash. Dawn dish soap. Bounty paper towels. Whatever it is.

It’s why entire non-brand brands have appeared to ostensibly rescue us from the oppression of our lizard-brains. Enter [Brandless](&lt;|url|&gt;)! Enter (if you have a meth-lab technician’s understanding of skin care products) [The Ordinary](&lt;|url|&gt;)! Enter [Great Jones](&lt;|url|&gt;), here to declare war on Le Creuset and All-Clad, a veritable Visigoth of cookware here to decimate the old gods of overpricing and iconicism! These are exciting, freeing times to be a consumer, a liberating moment for low-level participants in late-stage capitalism if there ever was one!

And here, one might cut in again, and note: Hey, pal, you like your dumbass on-brand Advil. You think Coke tastes better out of a (more expensive) glass bottle. Why cheer these guys on?

To which I would respond:

Because I am an idiot. And so are you. And so is everyone.

Enter University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler, who won a [Nobel Prize in Economics in 2017](&lt;|url|&gt;) for his work regarding this very revelation. And if Thaler needs to buy an iPhone cable, I’ll bet you the $13 price difference that he’ll go for the off-brand one. Thaler is a pioneer in the field of behavioral economics and was given the Oslo Ovation for his work detailing the fact that, we do not always make rational decisions that benefit us economically, even as we know what bad decisions we’re making, as we’re making them, and even as a better option is right there in front of our eyes.

Why do we do this? Because we’re humans. And humans do irrational things all the time—even when they know better.

Not that you needed someone to win a Nobel Prize to tell you that, but this man did substantial research into just what lizard-brained disasters we collectively are. And yes, it’s a fact of life that we are wired this way, that we make terrible decisions, decisions that conflict with our self-interest, decisions that we make again and again and don’t learn from, decisions that hurt other people, that hurt ourselves, maybe because we need to feel the pain of being human, and the pain of poor-decision making makes us feel alive, gives us relief from the condition of the endless and inescapable tomes of our self-inflicted narratives, in love, in life, with friends, with families, with lovers, in our pasts, in our present, in our wallets, at a drugstore checkout counter, or simply, in that all-too-common and universal moment of self-loathing that unites us all, every time we’ve lost yet another goddamn iPhone cord.

That’s probably why Apple sells it. Not just because they can, but because one of your fellow idiot humans will buy it. And maybe you will too.

This is probably true of most of the companies, selling most of the bullshit in the world.

# The Woman Who Sees Space First

## The Woman Who Sees Space First

### Candice Hansen-Koharcheck is a firsthand witness to some of the most iconic images of outer space

![Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Gerald Eichstädt/Seán Doran](<|image|>)*Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Gerald Eichstädt/Seán Doran*

For decades, space scientists could only speculate about what the surface of Mars looked like. It wasn’t until 1965 that NASA’s Mariner 4 spacecraft sent the first images of the red planet back to Earth. Today, spacecrafts on and around Mars continue to capture images that help the agency understand what our outer worlds look like.

Imagine being the person who sees these images before anyone else. That person is Candice Hansen-Koharcheck, the deputy principal investigator of the HiRISE camera on NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and one of the co-investigators on NASA’s Juno mission to Jupiter. Over her 40 years at NASA, Hansen-Koharcheck has been present for the capturing of some of the most iconic images of our solar system.

These photos are aesthetically stunning, but they also contain valuable scientific data. Before the HiRISE camera started documenting Mars in detail in 2006, scientists believed the planet was a barren, flat, lifeless world. “When we were designing the camera, the conventional wisdom was that Mars was monochrome,” Hansen-Koharcheck says. “It had this reddish tint everywhere, because everybody knew the global dust storms would redistribute that dust everywhere, and it would mask all the color on the surface.”

But the photos Hansen-Koharcheck got back from her camera revealed a blue Mars with a snakeskin-like terrain, active dunes, and rippling hills. “Who knew it was going to look like that?” she says. “This is a gorgeous planet, and it’s not all monochrome red.”

![Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona](<|image|>)*Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona*

There’s no doubt Hansen-Koharcheck has one of the coolest jobs in planetary science, but it took hard work to get where she is now. In the summer of 1979, Hansen-Koharcheck was tasked with making sure the Voyager 1 spacecraft captured some of the first photos of Jupiter and its moons. In preparation for the first flyby, she’d pull all-nighters watching the camera feed, taking naps in in her baby-blue 1955 Chevy in the parking lot of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The long-awaited Jupiter encounter required all hands on deck. “We had to figure out what time to take the picture, how many different filters to use, what the exposures should be,” she says. “It was really a lot of work and with fairly rudimentary tools.”

Voyager took thousands of images during the flyby, but the most special image for Hansen-Koharcheck was the first picture of Jupiter’s ring. “No one had ever gotten a picture of it, and nobody knew for sure it was even there,” she says. Scientists had posited that Jupiter had some kind of ring, as most large planets do, but until that picture, no one knew for sure.

“When that image came in, [an engineer] came running downstairs, finds me, huffing and puffing, and he says, ‘Candy, what have you done? You broke the camera!’” she recalls. “I took one look at the image and went, ‘Oh my God, it’s the ring.’”

![Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Gerald Eichstädt/Seán Doran](<|image|>)*Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Gerald Eichstädt/Seán Doran*

In another historic discovery, while working on the Cassini mission, Hansen-Koharcheck and her team captured an image from a flyby of Saturn’s moon Enceladus. The picture revealed that the moon was erupting water into space, and the material released from the moon’s icy surface was creating Saturn’s outermost ring.

“Being in that room where everybody was putting the picture together and all of a sudden realizing, holy crap, there’s a big eruption,” Hansen-Koharcheck says. “It’s enough to supply the E ring. All of a sudden, just all these pieces fell into place, and it was very exciting.”

![Image: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute](<|image|>)*Image: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute*

Today, Hansen-Koharcheck splits her time between studying the images from Mars and those from Jupiter, as part of her job on NASA’s Juno mission. She’s part of a small team that operates the camera called JunoCam, and she is the first person to put raw images from Jupiter online.

As part of the project, Hansen-Koharcheck calls on amateur astronomers to upload their own telescopic images and data of Jupiter, which help inform NASA’s mission planning on which images of the planet to acquire. Even though scientists now know what Jupiter looks like, more detailed images offer a more complete picture of the planet’s makeup.

“To me, these places have gone from being points of light in the sky to being real places,” Hansen-Koharcheck says. “That transition happened in the last 50 years. How do you put your arms around something that huge? I guess I’m just speechless. I consider myself one of the luckiest people on this planet.”<|endoftext|>

# How the Tiny Scanner App Saved Me From Total Paperwork Dysfunction

## Fear and loathing in the modern office

![](<|image|>)

*This is “I Can’t Live Without,” a column about the apps, gadgets, and services that make all the difference.*

The unsung hero of my busted iPhone 6 is the [Tiny Scanner app](&lt;|url|&gt;), which, if you’re not familiar, does exactly what its name suggests. It scans documents, and insofar as conventional scanners dwarf my phone, it is tiny. It is also a hedge against chaos and decay, and filing cabinets. It helped restore a sense of control after dysfunction derailed my professional prospects.

I’ve never been able to do paperwork. I assert this from the calm shores of self-acceptance, and I realize how prosaic it must sound, how typical. After all, everyone struggles with this stuff. Everyone agrees it sucks. Nobody has a facility for taxes, nobody likes submitting travel and expenses, we all [hate TPS reports](&lt;|url|&gt;), and nobody — except lovelorn fifth graders and President Trump — delights in their own signature.

But these are the elements of adulthood’s forever bureaucracy, so people step up. They get their shit together. They sign things, send them, save them. They go to Kinko’s on their lunch breaks. Even as millennials acknowledge [the systemic tendrils of generational burnout](&lt;|url|&gt;), they still RSVP to weddings and apply for new rentals. To say you just can’t do it — any of it — strains credulity.

But here’s a simple truth: I honestly cannot deal. Documentation is the most enervating fight of my daily life — it’s so endless, so voluminous, so incomplete. I’ve feared it since childhood. As the years passed it has assumed grotesque new forms: from school-trip-signature papers to college application papers to the papers delineating my early career, offer letter papers, 401(k) papers, and papers proving I am who I say I am.

The early 21st-century office is a rusty machine lubed by paper, and it’s made a mess of me. I’ve forfeited hundreds of dollars to unlogged expenses and unclaimed subsidies. I’ve left a trail of lobotomized human resource personnel from Newark to Singapore, kindly paper workers who wrestled with my inability to perform basic duties before ultimately zonking out in my presence. I’ve stopped replying to some paper collectors altogether. The company in charge of my retirement account surely thinks I’m dead. Do you trust my depth of feeling when I declare that I have a problem? And could you believe things used to be worse?

I discovered Tiny Scanner while applying to a post-grad program for copywriting. But ad school — and advertising itself — was really just a cover story, hastily erected in the wake of an embarrassing (and definitive) exit from publishing. I’d been working part-time as the assistant to an esteemed literary agent who had recently struck out on his own. It was my first post-college job and it was the epicenter of where I wanted to be: SoHo office, lattes at McNally Jackson, hobnobbing with highbrow New York. My boss was generous, kind, and unfailingly patient. He took me to book parties and encouraged me to seek out new talent.
> # Its proposition is as blunt as it is irresistible: want to scan something? Take a picture.

He also expected me to track payments, administer contracts, and follow up on licensing requests. I started in late December; by April, he was attempting to foist me onto contacts and old colleagues. He needed an accountant more than an assistant, he said. What he really needed — what anyone in the private sector needs, what a job market needs, what the march of capitalism needs — is the timely and competent execution of straightforward tasks.

We’re talking rudimentary stuff, agent ABCs. A quarterly magazine might ask permission to run a poem from one of my guy’s clients, for example. The answer was always yes; I merely had to grant it. I’d open the envelope and read the request and think that sounds like a job for 20 minutes from now. Then the next day would arrive and with it more requests. By the time I steeled myself to do something, something else beckoned. My time was linear and the papers were exponential. There were forces at work, and I just couldn’t deliver. But my boss was too nice to fire me, so he wrote me a recommendation to become something else.

My benign aversion to paperwork had metastasized into sudden career death syndrome. Obviously, I wasn’t cut out for clerical work. I reasoned that while a new profession might shield me from more material responsibilities, it couldn’t mend the gaping void of industriousness that threatened to consume my soul. That was a job for therapy, or maybe Adderall. I was confronted with a simple, nagging question: why couldn’t I handle my affairs like a normal person? What made me so special, that I would be afflicted by this ridiculous condition? My shame had propelled me to the cusp of a startling epiphany that implicated contingent spheres of privilege: maleness, whiteness, wealth, and the entitlement that supervened on them.

Right before I got around to addressing all that, I got Tiny Scanner.

Tiny Scanner has over 10 million downloads. Its proposition is as blunt as it is irresistible: want to scan something? Take a picture. It does the rest. The app enjoys a 4.6 rating on the App Store, but the true breadth of its beneficent nature is only revealed in the reviews. Besides the odd hit-and-run from disgruntled idiots, they are super-long paeans to the app’s fortitude, with titles like “Works exactly how I want” and “Time saver extraordinaire!” Most allude to the app’s superior features and supple compliance — and here it must be said that Tiny Scanner excels in ways creative and delightful, as when it intuitively snaps its scan to the borders of your page, or when it zooms in on the corners if you choose to make an adjustment, showing total humility in the face of its errors.

But more telling are the personal tidbits that accompany almost every review. Users feel compelled to recite where they were and what they were doing when they stumbled upon Tiny Scanner, as if sharing a recipe on their vegan blog. One was struggling to transcribe sheet music; one had despaired over a 45-minute detour to fax a single document. Tiny Scanner liberated them, as it liberated me.

This is not to suggest that easier scans have transformed my whole existence. My chores are semiregular and medium-stakes: some ministry needs a copy of my passport or work visa; I grant my beleaguered accountant the right to represent my interests; I send my new employer a countersigned contract. But by lowering the barriers to action, the app has stripped these errands of their menacing tedium, their distance from the immediacy of my routine. Every conceivable excuse I could conjure is exploded by Tiny Scanner’s awesome readiness-to-hand. I am made to go nowhere and do nothing except use my phone the same way I’ve used it a million times before. It’s a revelation. It’s also doomed.

Tiny Scanner is a productivity app, not a B2B solution, but its profits are premised on the idea that in the course of their private lives, enough people have to scan enough documents to warrant a one-time payment of $4.99 — the cost of the pro version. (Regular Tiny Scanner is free, but it restricts the number of pages you can scan at once. Despite this occasionally cumbersome roadblock — and the absolute bargain price of $4.99 — I remain committed to the loss-leader. My perversions are my own.) Since developer Appxy released the first iteration some seven years ago, under the slightly more ambiguous name TinyScan, this bet has paid off handsomely. The app remains at the top of searches and receives regular updates. I was an early adopter and I still marvel at its sheer utility.

But anyone can see the writing on the wall. Built to bridge the gap between two eras — analog and digital — Tiny Scanner will soon succumb to more elegant arrangements. Its limited function, which it so admirably serves, already feels outmoded. I signed the contract for this essay by clicking a field and typing my name, which Adobe then rendered as a series of neat little vectors. Within seconds I had a copy in my inbox.

These days information need never live offline, which is another way of saying it never leaves your sight. Silicon Valley has learned to build productivity into its core products: Gmail nudges me for replies; Slack pesters me with push notifications. Not even scanning is immune; Apple has added a scan function to its default Notes app. You think I’d be relieved, grateful for big tech’s supervision, but it’s all just a new generation of bullshit — more tasks to accomplish, more processes to leave me flustered and arthritic. Meanwhile, Gen Z kids are coming up behind me having spent their elementary years learning coding, not cursive. Contracts are being securitized on the blockchain and I finally feel comfortable addressing an envelope.

The world is turning too fast for me and for Tiny Scanner. But as long as it continues to do the job that I cannot, it has a place on my phone, and in my heart.

# Silicon Valley Is Not a Fad

## The region was a hub for innovation long before tech bros showed up

![Graphic: mattjeacock/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Graphic: mattjeacock/Getty Images*

In the late 2000s, at a party in the Mission District of San Francisco, I was discussing Silicon Valley with a guy who worked for a technology company. When I revealed that I lived in Mountain View, he asked me where that was.

A few years prior, I once collected guests from San Francisco International Airport and drove them south on the 101 freeway to Mountain View. The 101 is a sea of blacktop flanked by walls of concrete. “This is Silicon Valley!” I said proudly. “But where is everything?” my guests asked, confused. Silicon Valley doesn’t have the sights of San Francisco: no Golden Gate Bridge, no Palace of Fine Arts, no Presidio, usually not even a view of the bay. Silicon Valley is just one big, very spread out office park embedded in the sprawling suburbia of greater San Jose.

If you hunt for them, you might find the nondescript office complexes of companies like Intel, Google, Facebook, and Cisco Systems. In the last few years, companies have started to construct interesting buildings, like Apple Park (the doughnut), or Nvidia Endeavor, the spaceship-like, triangle-themed building that I currently work in.

Mountain View is in the northern part of Santa Clara County, in the San Francisco South Bay, right in the middle of what has historically been known as Silicon Valley. William Shockley opened Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory there in the mid-1950s. In 1957, eight employees left Shockley to start a semiconductor division of Fairchild Camera and Instrument in Sunnyvale, the city immediately south of Mountain View. This division became Fairchild Semiconductor, the company that developed the first silicon integrated circuit in 1960. Gordon E. Moore and Robert Noyce left Fairchild Semiconductor to start Intel in Mountain View in 1968. Intel is now based in Santa Clara, the city immediately south of Sunnyvale.

![I drew this map of Silicon Valley just for this article](<|image|>)*I drew this map of Silicon Valley just for this article*

Google is currently headquartered in Mountain View, but started out in 1998 in Menlo Park, which is two cities north of Mountain View. Facebook’s headquarters are in Menlo Park, and even though it was technically founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it received its first round of funding after moving to Palo Alto in 2004. Palo Alto is sandwiched between Menlo Park to its immediate north and Mountain View to its immediate south. To the west of Palo Alto is the city of Stanford, the home of Stanford University, where many founders of Silicon Valley companies studied. For example, after graduating from Stanford University with degrees in electrical engineering, Bill Hewlett and David Packard started Hewlett-Packard in a Palo Alto garage in 1938. Larry Page and Sergey Brin were PhD students at Stanford when they founded Google.

Mountain View is one in a string of cities running down the peninsula, from Redwood City, to Menlo Park, to Palo Alto, to Mountain View, to Sunnyvale, to Santa Clara, and, finally, to San Jose. Adjacent to these cities, and nestled closer to the Santa Cruz mountains, are Woodside, Stanford, Los Altos, Cupertino, Campbell, and Los Gatos. Apple was founded in Los Altos and is now headquartered in Cupertino.

So that’s where Mountain View is: in Silicon Valley, in the South Bay, which is part of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Because I am in my mid-40s, and because I first came to the Bay Area as an engineer in my early 20s, I am able to perceive a relatively large arc of progress and change here. I was an engineer long before “techies” existed. In fact, we don’t actually need new words to describe engineering, a discipline that goes back hundreds of years.

I remember the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. This was part of the web boom. As that wave of exponential growth popped over the threshold of invisibility, companies with no business plan or real technology were able to raise funding. The media grabbed hold of it, and everyone in the world thought Silicon Valley was a new thing. But it was mostly about hollow companies run by charlatans, many of which were based in San Francisco (not Silicon Valley).

When that bubble burst, there was talk of the end of Silicon Valley. Little did the world at large realize that before, during, and after the dot-com bubble, Silicon Valley did its thing: Exponential technology waves rise and break, new companies are formed, older companies die, and fortunes are made and lost.

Coming out of the dot-com bubble, some e-commerce companies survived and thrived, such as Amazon and eBay. Although Amazon was founded in Seattle and is still based there, eBay’s headquarters have always been in San Jose. Many less visible companies started and grew through the web boom, such as Cisco Systems, which, despite the fact that its name is derived from “San Francisco,” was started at Stanford University in 1984 and now has its headquarters in San Jose.

New computer networking companies were also born and thrived through the web and e-commerce wave, such as Juniper Networks, which is based in Sunnyvale. Silicon Valley companies have been at the center of the broader technological revolution since the 1930s, and the dot-com bubble was a relatively small blip in its history.

Before the web wave, there was the much longer, slower personal computer wave. Intel and Apple drove this, taking the baton from older semiconductor and computer companies. I arrived in Silicon Valley at the tail end of the PC wave. While it was still a startup, I joined Nvidia, a company that revolutionized PC computer graphics.

After the web and e-commerce wave came the app and social networking wave. I think that this technology, combined with the movie *The Social Network*, created an image of Silicon Valley as a place for fun and parties. According to that image, this was a place where you could come and make tons of money and party all night. The app and social media wave promised the confluence of the pragmatic success of technology with the human need for social interaction.

But while Facebook and Tinder may have brought people together in the real world (or not), the true nature of Silicon Valley has never been palatable to most people. At the core of Silicon Valley is engineering — the kind that involves sitting in beige cubicles staring at computer screens all day. Over the years, those screens may have become thinner and displayed more pixels, but they still feature a command-line interface spewing monochrome text conveying errors and warnings.

It’s not even necessary to try to make this more exciting. All the intrigue is inside the mind, in complex plans and systems, in the workings of intricate machines and beautiful hierarchies of abstraction. Bring your kid to work day doesn’t make sense in this context: The child only sees someone staring at a screen, lost in thought. All of the excitement is hidden in deeply nested abstract realms that can never be purchased along with a VIP bottle service.

The most social that engineering gets is sitting in meetings and co-creating block diagrams on whiteboards. I’ve witnessed armies of fun-loving, sociable types pour into Silicon Valley and San Francisco hoping to make a quick buck and snort something exhilarating, only to become disenchanted after discovering that this is the land where the geek is king. In recent years, these temporary residents would [write cynical articles about Silicon Valley](&lt;|url|&gt;) before leaving in a huff. Meanwhile, many others rode wave after wave, engaged in creating technology instead of getting caught up in the ephemeral fads. These are the people who love this place.

In the last few years there have been a lot of complaints about high rents and house prices. But the cost of living in Silicon Valley was unreasonably high even when I arrived in the late ’90s. Around that time, I remember seeing a joke newspaper clipping on the wall of a friend’s house in Palo Alto showing a shack for sale for millions of dollars. The commentary perhaps partly intended to convey to visitors that “we might live in what looks like an ordinary house, but we’re actually pretty rich.” This particular couple seemed to be compelled by the *nouveau riche* drive to telegraph their material wealth to others.

America is a melting pot of people seeking new and more prosperous lives. Silicon Valley is that archetype on steroids. Silicon Valley is richly diverse in every way, from those seeking liberation from emotional pain through polyamory to those hoping to evade death by becoming cyborgs. It’s easy to say that Silicon Valley is full of “tech bros” if that’s the cohort that you surround yourself with.

I recently read [another of the many articles complaining about Silicon Valley](&lt;|url|&gt;), written by a product manager at Google. It paints an image of a place full of people focused on hacking their corporate promotions and engaging in shallow conversations peppered with tech buzzwords. Of course there are people like that here. You can find anything you want in Silicon Valley: You can find “tech bros,” you can find countless meaningless startups making apps that do essentially nothing, and you can find venture capitalists throwing around millions of dollars with little discernment. I suspect that some VCs cannot smell bullshit simply because of the olfactory desensitization caused by their own stench.

But you can also find dedicated, savvy, smart, skilled, and well-educated people from all around the world. I have friends at work (and outside work) with whom I discuss philosophy, religion, spirituality, leadership, politics, physics, and life in general. Silicon Valley is the home of innovation. This is where all ideas and approaches are welcome, even the “stupid” ones, even the “techies” and the “tech bros,” even the apps that do nothing, and even the VCs who don’t know their ass from their elbow. It’s always been this rich mix, and it always will be.

New exponential technology waves are now rising up and preparing to crest: artificial intelligence, blockchain, virtual reality, and robotics. There are many people working earnestly on developing these technologies and, at the same time, there is the usual hype cycle. Again there is talk of Silicon Valley’s apparent resurgence. Again the media has been taking notice. Again the fun-seekers looking for a quick buck arrive in San Francisco by the planeload. The cycle starts over again, even though Silicon Valley is not the cycle itself.

Y Combinator, the iconic and sometimes controversial startup incubator, [recently announced its relocation](&lt;|url|&gt;) from Mountain View to San Francisco, reporting that, finally, “the center of gravity for new startups has clearly shifted over the past five years.” But although Y Combinator has produced some important Silicon Valley companies — such as Dropbox, Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit (all very web-centric) — in my opinion it’s also incubated a lot of nonsense. Y Combinator, like Silicon Valley itself, tends to produce great innovation with a generous pinch of bullshit.<|endoftext|>

# How Sri Lanka Shut Social Media Out of the Country

## And why such censorship efforts usually backfire

![Photo: Himanshu Bhatt/NurPhoto/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Himanshu Bhatt/NurPhoto/Getty*

Not long ago, social media giants like Twitter and Facebook were soaking up praise for playing an essential role in supporting democratic revolutions in the Middle East. But less than a decade later, these same platforms are now widely derided as hotbeds of hate speech and disinformation, so much so that even some prominent tech journalists are supporting one country’s decision to temporarily ban social media sites.

After more than 300 people were killed in a series of [coordinated bombings last weekend](&lt;|url|&gt;), the Sri Lankan government moved to do just that, starting with a temporary ban on Facebook. In a [statement](&lt;|url|&gt;), the Sri Lankan Defense Ministry proclaimed that the internet blockade would remain intact for the duration of the investigation. In a separate statement, Udaya Seneviratne, secretary to the Sri Lankan president, said access to social media services had been restricted in the wake of the attacks to counter “false news reports.”

The country is no stranger to employing such restrictions in the wake of violence. Last March, Sri Lankan authorities demanded that ISPs [block access to Facebook and the company’s other services](&lt;|url|&gt;) after members of the majority Sinhalese ethnic group launched a [series of brutal attacks](&lt;|url|&gt;) against Muslims in the city of Kandy. The country’s government has frequently criticized Facebook for doing too little to rein in disinformation and hate speech directed by Sinhalese nationalist groups against the country’s minority Muslim population.
> # There’s not much data to suggest that banning access to platforms would solve the underlying issues driving these problems.

But data from NetBlocks, a London-based digital rights group, indicates that this latest Sri Lankan ban [goes much further](&lt;|url|&gt;), targeting not only Facebook and subsidiaries like Instagram and WhatsApp, but also additional services including YouTube. NetBlocks told *OneZero* that Sri Lankan ISPs are using domain name server (DNS)–level bans to render the sites and services inaccessible.

While Facebook’s role as an amplifier for hate speech and disinformation has plagued numerous countries, [including the United States](&lt;|url|&gt;), the problem is compounded in many developing nations, where Facebook isn’t just a website, but a direct conduit to the internet itself. In many of these nations, Facebook offers a [restricted version of the internet](&lt;|url|&gt;) known as its [Free Basics](&lt;|url|&gt;) program. In partnership with local mobile providers, Free Basics provides low-income users free access to a curated collection of Facebook-approved content. Users often [conflate this service](&lt;|url|&gt;) with the internet itself, a practice that has come under fire from activists for [distorting the open internet](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [amplifying already problematic hate speech and disinformation](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Absent more elegant solutions to these problems, tech journalists like Kara Swisher [applauded the Sri Lankan government’s decision](&lt;|url|&gt;) to ban these platforms, insisting that Silicon Valley giants have become, in her words, “incapable of controlling the powerful global tools they have built.” But while it’s true that Silicon Valley giants have failed to effectively predict and police the rise of hate speech and disinformation on their platforms, there’s not much data to suggest that banning access to them solves the underlying issues driving these problems.

A [report last year by Human Rights Watch](&lt;|url|&gt;), for example, found that while South Asian governments had the highest rate of internet shutdowns in 2018, “there remains no substantive data or evidence to prove that internet shutdowns can scale down violence.” And while banning these platforms outright may feel like a productive solution, bypassing such restrictions can often be trivial for bad actors, defeating the entire purpose.

Such blockades usually rely on ISPs blocking either a website’s URL or its DNS record, but both can be circumvented with a virtual private network (VPN). Some Sri Lankans noted that while disinformation operators may have little trouble using VPNs to bypass the ban, the less tech-savvy members of the public — those who could actually benefit from access to news via social media — may be unable to get around the restrictions.


Alp Toker of NetBlocks told *OneZero* that such government-mandated blockades may actually make the underlying problems worse.

“In our experience, tracking more than 60 social media and internet shutdowns over the last four years, we’ve [observed](&lt;|url|&gt;) that far from reducing harm, restricting internet access can actually amplify disinformation,” Toker said. “Once authentic voices are gone, there’s a vacuum that’s readily filled by those who seek to spread false narratives. Troublemakers invariably have better technical capabilities, and we’ve seen them turn blackouts to their advantage almost every time a nation goes offline, through use of VPNs and social media bots. When you switch off communications, the adversary ends up owning your narrative.”

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, similarly warned that such restrictions are a slippery slope, especially for governments already inclined to censor legitimate speech.

“When governments block internet speech, they are suppressing free expression, the sharing of ideas, and ability to communicate and connect with loved ones — essential human rights,” an EFF spokesperson told *OneZero*. “Legitimate concerns about misinformation and manipulation are often misconstrued or distorted to entrench the power of established voices and stifle dissent.”
> # “When governments block internet speech, they are suppressing free expression, the sharing of ideas, and ability to communicate and connect with loved ones — essential human rights.”

None of this is to suggest that social media giants aren’t culpable for the toxic vitriol and information gamesmanship now plaguing their platforms. Shortly after last year’s riots in Sri Lanka, the [*New York Times](&lt;|url|&gt;)* noted that despite Facebook being the primary online portal for many in the country, the company had done virtually nothing to address the problem.

(In response to a question from *OneZero*, a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement, “Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this horrendous act. Teams from across Facebook have been working to support first responders and law enforcement as well as to identify and remove content which violates our standards. We are aware of the government’s statement regarding the temporary blocking of social media platforms. People rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones and we are committed to maintaining our services and helping the community and the country during this tragic time.”)

Many technologists have been quick to argue that moderating such platforms at scale is [difficult if not impossible](&lt;|url|&gt;), especially in foreign countries with complex cultures and histories — though it has become increasingly clear that, for years, many of Silicon Valley’s self-proclaimed innovation giants weren’t even really trying.

While censoring these platforms may seem like an obvious answer, in reality there are multiple overlapping issues at play, none of which have easy answers. Facebook’s [domination of local advertising](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the United States, for example, has helped erode quality local reporting, something data suggests has made the public [less informed and more divided](&lt;|url|&gt;) than ever. Similarly, its often cavalier treatment of private consumer data has led to [misuse by political operatives](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the United States and abroad, as journalist Carole Cadwalladr [argued](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a recent TED Talk.

None of the solutions will be easy. Banning these platforms may be an understandable response in the face of platform apathy, but it doesn’t address the underlying problems — problems created in part by modern internet giants with more ambition than common sense, often wielding incredible power in cultures they only fleetingly understand.<|endoftext|>

# The Ecological Problem With Octopus Farming

## Startups are building land-based octopus farms. Critics argue they’re harming the animals.

Founded in 1974, the Hawaii Ocean and Technology Park in Kailua Kona serves as a hub for some of the most exciting projects in green aquaculture and the use of seawater to generate electricity. Tucked away in one corner of the facility and marked by several large tanks pumped full of ocean water sits the Kanaloa Octopus Farm. The farm is the country’s first and only for-profit initiative working on a way to breed octopus in captivity.

“The visit was awesome,” says travel blogger Patrick Catterson, who traveled to the Kanaloa Octopus Farm during a tour in March 2019. According to Catterson, the farm offers daily tours for around $30 per person, where you can learn all about octopus as well as the company’s mission to find a sustainable way to rear them for the seafood market. At the end of the tour, he says, visitors are offered a chance to interact with the octopus under supervision.

Jake Conroy, founder of the research program, has a bachelor’s degree in marine biology from Hawaii Pacific University. He founded the Kanaloa Octopus Farm in 2015, after quitting his previous job at the Anuenue Fisheries Research Center in Honolulu. “Octopus are fascinating animals, and almost all aquariums have them — and that’s just the ornamentals,” Conroy said in an interview with the [*Hawaii Tribune-Herald](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. “I would love to be able to supply the markets with sustainable sources and hopefully move up to a scale to provide octopus for eating.”

Conroy claims they’ve had some success: The initiative crossed its first hurdle in 2016, when they managed to mate a male and female octopus in captivity, outside of their natural habitat, according to the *Tribune-Herald* article. For now, Conroy says that his team will be breeding these creatures for aquariums only. The plan, however, is to eventually scale up production and become an exclusive supplier of farmed octopus for gourmet restaurants across the region. Conroy did not respond to requests for comment.
> # “My concerns are for the individual octopus, that they are viewed as commodities, when they are, in fact, intelligent animals who have been confined to a life devoid of any meaning.”

As intelligent and fascinating as octopus tend to be, some experts challenge whether they should be farmed in the first place, says Jennifer Jacquet, an environmental studies professor at New York University who recently[ co-authored a study](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the environmental impact of octopus farms.

“My concerns are for the individual octopus under mass production, that they are viewed as mere commodities when they are, in fact, sentient, intelligent, curious animals who have been confined to a life devoid of any meaning or exploration,” she says.

Others share Jacquet’s concerns. Studies evaluating the species’ unusual intelligence have been conducted [since 1995](&lt;|url|&gt;). The most significant was a recent [study from 2015](&lt;|url|&gt;), in which scientists managed to decode the creature’s full genome sequence for the first time, opening up lines for more research into how various genes played a crucial role in the development of the octopus’ complex nervous system.

Structurally speaking, the nervous system of the octopus is completely different from that of mammals. Its brain wraps around its esophagus like a doughnut, instead of resting in the cranium like most invertebrates. Octopus brains also boast complex features like lobes and folds and a strong ability to retain visual and tactile memory. About two-thirds of its neurons, however, reside not in its brain but in its tentacles, giving the octopus the power to perform basic cognitive functions wholly independent of the brain. While mammal brains are geared toward social interaction, the brain of the octopus is designed to excel at predation: behaviors like locating and capturing prey, as well as evading predators through camouflage.

According to Conroy, octopus aquaculture has the potential to reduce the burden on wild populations, thereby cutting down on overfishing. Jacquet says she’s skeptical: Since the octopus is a carnivore, the animal has a high protein requirement that serves only to encumber the aquaculture industry if farmed on a large scale.

“We are still fishing more and more for wild fish — but the worst part is that many of the aquatic animals we farm are eating a lot of wild fish as feed,” Jacquet says. “We have to fish to feed farmed fish. We have created an aquaculture system that exacerbates overfishing, rather than alleviates it.”

Moreover, these are wild octopus that have been removed from their natural habitat in the ocean and forced to live and breed in captivity. Past research suggests this may not be a good idea. The octopus does not [handle small spaces well](&lt;|url|&gt;), and keeping them in tanks increases the risk of parasitic infection and causes them severe duress, which can later lead to immunological problems. The European Union (EU) saw fit to [introduce regulations](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2010 to safeguard research octopuses for this very reason.

In her bestselling book [*The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration Into the Wonder of Consciousness](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, Sy Montgomery, an award-winning author and naturalist, conveys her strong fascination for these creatures:
> Here is an animal with venom like a snake, a beak like a parrot, and ink like an old-fashioned pen. It can weigh as much as a man and stretch as long as a car, yet it can pour its baggy, boneless body through an opening the size of an orange. It can change color and shape. It can taste with its skin. Most fascinating of all, I had read that octopuses are smart.

Montgomery describes how studying octopuses gave her a unique perspective of empathy and consciousness. “They’re so different from us, but what held my attention and totally mesmerized me was, that despite our differences, it’s possible to have a meeting of the minds with someone like this,” she told [*National Geographic](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

Seafood startups may not share her sentiments. With the rise in demand for gourmet seafood, more and more companies across the world are investing in octopus aquaculture. [Mayab Mollusks](&lt;|url|&gt;), a small business based in Sisal, Mexico, is the first commercial octopus farm in the world. Meanwhile, [Nippon Suisan Kaisha (Nissui)](&lt;|url|&gt;), a marine resources and seafood company based in Japan, where octopus has long been popular, has promised to provide market-ready farmed octopuses by 2020.

Many of these companies claim to be working in the interest of sustainability, trying to preserve wild populations and making aquaculture more sustainable, but they lack research to back their claims. Given that the primary markets for octopus are mostly food secure, Jacquet wonders — and given how incredible these animals are — would it really be so terrible if we just didn’t eat them?<|endoftext|>

# What If an Algorithm Could Predict Your Unborn Child’s Intelligence?

## Stephen Hsu’s startup Genomic Predictions analyzes genetic data to predict the chance of diseases like diabetes and cancer — and forecast IQ

![Illustration: [Alexis Beauclair](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Alexis Beauclair](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

For years, hopeful parents pursuing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment have had the option of screening embryos for severe heritable diseases like cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and Tay-Sachs disease. These rare and often deadly conditions, known as monogenic disorders, can be easily identified through genetic screening because they arise due to a mutation on a single gene. For doctors, diagnosis is a simple positive or negative.

But the diseases that are most likely to shadow the average person’s life — cancer, heart disease, diabetes — are polygenic, meaning that they result from interactions between thousands of genetic signals. In the past, this has made these diseases — which kill millions of Americans each year — all but impossible to screen for with genetic tests.

But [Genomic Prediction](&lt;|url|&gt;), a New Jersey-based company that analyzes genetic data using machine learning, is hoping to change that. Taking advantage of the new troves of genetic sequences that have accumulated over the past decade, the company is offering what is known as polygenic risk scores, a screening process that attempts to establish the statistical probability of a person developing diseases like diabetes or hypertension throughout their life.
> # It’s easy to imagine that this new technology could be the first step in a dystopian science fiction[ scenario](&lt;|url|&gt;): designer babies.

More controversially, however, Genomic Prediction is also offering IVF patients the option of screening embryos for projected cognitive ability. While the company says that at this stage it will only inform parents about the risks of potential intellectual disability — [defined](&lt;|url|&gt;) as 25 points below the average IQ — it’s easy to imagine that this new technology could be the first step in a dystopian science fiction[ scenario](&lt;|url|&gt;): designer babies.

Genomic Prediction was co-founded in 2017 by Stephen Hsu, a professor of theoretical physics at Michigan State University. A decade ago Hsu noticed that the continually decreasing cost of genetic sequencing and genotyping was so steep and rapid that it might allow him to solve a fundamental problem that had fascinated him since childhood.

“When I first learned about evolution in biology class, I became interested in a particular mathematical, theoretical question,” Hsu told *OneZero*. “If traits are heritable, and you have access to all of a person’s DNA, how much can you predict about them?”

Starting in 2010, Hsu began carving out some time from his regular research schedule, and along with a team of colleagues, began thinking about how to build tools for predicting complex traits from DNA. They decided on a machine learning approach, training an algorithm on data comprised of genotypes (the genetic makeup of a person), and corresponding phenotypes (their physical characteristics). They believed that once trained, the algorithm would be able to predict the likelihood of a complex trait by identifying a combination of genetic signals in the DNA.

In 2017, Hsu and his collaborators[ released](&lt;|url|&gt;) a report showing that they could successfully use this approach to predict height from a genotype within roughly one inch. That same year, Hsu co-founded Genomic Prediction and quickly began using the technology to predict the risk from polygenic diseases.

Now the company offers polygenic risk scores, which assign a probability to diseases that might arise in a customer given their genetic makeup. Unlike monogenic disorders like cystic fibrosis, “we can’t just look at a person and say yes or no, you’re going to have breast cancer,” Hsu told me. “But what we can do is tell someone that they are in the 99th percentile of people who have risk for breast cancer, which might mean that they have a 50% chance of developing it in their lifetime.”

At this stage, Genomic Prediction is offering polygenic risk scores to help prospective parents using IVF — which usually involves the creation of multiple embryos — to select those embryos that increase the probability of having a healthy child. But Hsu sees polygenic screening becoming a part of routine medical checkups. “At some point in the near future, when you go for your physical, your doctor will ask you for blood to get a genotype for you,” he said. “And then the doctor will get a report from us that will inform them on how best to look after you.”

While Hsu believes that polygenic risk scores will become part of standard clinical health care within a few years, other experts have their doubts. Cecile Janssens, professor of epidemiology at Emory University who has been studying genetic prediction for over a decade, told me that she was skeptical of how much meaning Hsu assigns to the output of these algorithms. “Prediction is extremely difficult, and probabilities are hard to interpret,” she explained. “Would you not choose an embryo because it’s risk of getting breast cancer was increased from 8% to 14% or its risk of diabetes was 18% instead of 11%? Would you even know what that all means?”

Hsu acknowledges that at this stage, polygenic risk scores are most useful in assessing statistical outliers — those cases where an embryo is far more likely to develop a certain disease than other embryos — but expects significant improvement as more genomic data is collected. “For some diseases, we only have between 10,000 to 100,000 cases, but if we start to build larger and larger databases, that could cause a significant material advance in the quality of the predictor,” he explained.

More controversial is the fact that Genomic Prediction’s polygenic risk analysis includes a panel for cognitive ability. According to Catherine Bliss, a professor of sociology at the University of California San Francisco and the author of two books on genomics, predicting for cognitive ability turns on the presupposition that intelligence is a highly heritable trait, which is, to say the least, a historically[ fraught](&lt;|url|&gt;) and controversial claim.

As decades of research has shown, the science of cognitive heredity is always in flux, mostly due to the complex way intelligence[ interacts](&lt;|url|&gt;) with our social environments, including education. There are also problems with standard intelligence metrics like IQ tests, which have been shown to be culturally and racially [biased](&lt;|url|&gt;). “I don’t think predicting for cognitive capacity is a good idea until we have a better grasp on this gene-environment relationship,” Bliss told me.

Hsu has been [embroiled](&lt;|url|&gt;) in controversy concerning genetics and IQ before, due to his work for a Shenzen-based research institute, BGI, which allegedly mapped the genome of unusually intelligent people in order to try and [isolate](&lt;|url|&gt;) an intelligence gene. But he told me that at this stage, the company’s polygenic test for intelligence will only indicate which embryo is a genetic outlier in terms of cognitive impairment, which correlates to an IQ 25 points below average. “If you’re a parent going through IVF and five embryos are fine, but one of them has scored in the bottom percentile for a cognitive score, I think that you deserve the option of knowing this,” he said.

When it comes to the social implications of this technology, Hsu is more concerned about accessibility and how these technologies will exacerbate class inequality. In addition to being able to give their child a private education and “even [buy](&lt;|url|&gt;) their way into Stanford,” Hsu says, wealthy people may soon be able to[ design](&lt;|url|&gt;) their children better genes. While Hsu worries that a kind of genetic caste system looms on the near horizon, he hopes that predictive technology might also be used for socially progressive ends, or what he calls a “redistribution of genetic endowments.”

“Maybe let people from disadvantaged groups select from 20 embryos, instead of seven,” he said, which presumably raise the possibility of getting a healthy embryo that scores high on cognitive ability. “If this was done over a long period of time, maybe it would eventually catch that group up.”

Underpinning this vision is Hsu’s fundamental belief that genetics can be used to not only predict and select for traits in individuals, but to engineer positive social change. When I suggested that what he was arguing for amounted to an updated version of eugenics — the attempt to “improve” humanity scientifically through selective breeding — Hsu agreed, but distinguished between the “coercive” genetic engineering of the past and “opt-in” vision he was proposing.

“If I tell a couple that they are carriers of a disease and that there is a one in four chance that their kid is going to die a horrible death, and allow them to select the healthy embryo, is that eugenics? I guess it is,” Hsu said. “But if I give them the option to make to make a choice, and don’t coerce them, I don’t think there’s ethically anything wrong with it.”
> # “I can predict a situation where the government of Singapore approaches us and say that they want to be able to rank order embryos by intelligence… I could imagine a scenario where we say okay.”

While few would argue that selection in some circumstances is beneficial — and though it has long been the practice for prospective parents to screen for severe genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy — in the U.S., embryonic screening is largely [unregulated](&lt;|url|&gt;) and takes place in the private IVF sector. Legally there is nothing stopping Hsu from adding cosmetic traits like hair color, height, and skin tone to the polygenic screening. He could also offer parents the option to test for high IQ and heritable personality traits like a predisposition to violence.

At this stage, Genomic Prediction, a company that raised $4.5 million in private investment this January, does not offer such services. When I asked Hsu how he draws that moral line, he replied that the company tries not to get “too far out in front of American society.”

But Hsu believes that attitudes around prediction and selection will change over time, as they already have, and points out that they already [vary](&lt;|url|&gt;) between cultures. In South and East Asia, for instance, there is more cultural acceptance of the idea of selecting for embryos in order to [enhance](&lt;|url|&gt;)* *desirable characteristics like intelligence, rather than just avoid genetic diseases.

“I can predict a situation where the government of Singapore approaches us and say that they want to be able to rank order embryos by intelligence,” Hsu told me. I asked him to predict how he might respond to such a request. “I could imagine a scenario where we say okay.”

# The Political Challenge of Geoengineering

## A diplomatic breakdown exposes geopolitical fractures over a problematic fix for climate change

One reason early humans survived what the world threw at them is that the wiser of our ancestors listened to and acted on the advice of their elders. Now former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a member of a group of global leaders calling themselves [the Elders](&lt;|url|&gt;), warns that a set of new speculative climate engineering technologies could risk “[exacerbating wider threats to international peace and security](&lt;|url|&gt;)” if not governed adequately.

Commonly known as geoengineering, the technologies are being developed to directly and intentionally intervene in the climate system. Concepts include spraying reflective particles into the stratosphere to reduce incoming sunlight to cool the earth and capturing huge amounts of carbon from the air and storing it underground to directly reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. Such geoengineering methods are attracting increasing interest in climate policy circles.

Proponents argue that cutting global emissions alone may not be sufficient to limit average global warming to 1.5 or two degrees Celsius above preindustrial averages — a rough red line for scientists — and that the world must therefore explore other ways to avoid dangerous climate change. Critics worry that geoengineering could lead to serious side effects. Stratospheric particles may cool the earth but could also disrupt rainfall patterns, while carbon removal using biomass — which sucks carbon dioxide from the air — would put huge pressure on land use. (Perhaps [twice the area of India](&lt;|url|&gt;) would be needed to grow sufficient biofuel crops by 2100.) They also caution that vested interests could abuse the promise of geoengineering to further delay essential mitigation efforts.

But even if geoengineering could work on a technical level, significant [geopolitical concerns](&lt;|url|&gt;) remain. Whether countries can agree on, coordinate, and control such planet-regulating technologies could be as important as whether the technology itself actually works.

## **A possible compromise**

At the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) in Nairobi last month, we got a sneak preview of the future geopolitics of geoengineering as we followed events surrounding a [draft resolution](&lt;|url|&gt;) put forward by Switzerland.

Hopes were initially high. The Swiss proposal was modest and was backed beforehand by a diverse group of countries, from Mexico to Montenegro. It did not call for a moratorium on or even a code of conduct for geoengineering. It simply proposed an expert study of the risks and benefits of geoengineering techniques, as well as ways each might be adequately governed. As alarm calls go, it was more of a cuckoo clock than a siren. It should have been an easy first step toward avoiding the free-for-all that Ban Ki-moon has warned against.

But the negotiations collapsed almost before they had begun. Determined opposition, primarily from the United States and Saudi Arabia, killed the talks. After several days of fraught debate, the Swiss threw in the towel and withdrew the resolution.

## **What was contested?**

Opponents argued that the UNEA was the wrong venue for a study, pointing instead to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They said that the technologies were too diverse to consider together, preferring to distinguish SRM from carbon removal approaches. They claimed it was simply premature to commission a study before states and delegations had a better understanding of the technologies.

Supporters of the resolution — led by the European Union but backed by diverse countries from Africa, South America, and Polynesia — countered that the UNEA was indeed the right place. For them, the IPCC mandate is too narrow, focusing mainly on climate science as opposed to broader environmental issues, such as biodiversity and governance. Moreover, they say, the IPPC is unable to generate effective regulation. They also saw the issue as too pressing to wait for the IPCC’s [sixth assessment report (AR6](&lt;|url|&gt;)), which isn’t due until 2021 or 2022.
> # Was the failure of the resolution provoked by an ill-informed attempt to constrain the technologies, egged on by anti-geoengineering environmentalists?

The Swiss sought compromise, distinguishing different types of technology and retreating from a “study” to proposing a more modest “compilation” — a simple mapping of existing knowledge on the technologies and existing, not potential, governance regimes. But the opposition remained intransigent and eventually wielded the diplomatic ax by putting square brackets — indicating disagreement — around the entire text.

Was the failure of the resolution, as [some have implied](&lt;|url|&gt;), provoked by an ill-informed attempt to constrain the technologies, egged on by [anti-geoengineering environmentalists](&lt;|url|&gt;)?

We saw little evidence of this. The main protagonists appeared well-informed of the technologies, their potentials, as well as their pitfalls. No states called for a ban on geoengineering, but some called for a precautionary approach. Arguably, this hardened U.S. opposition to the resolution, in what appeared to be a clash of risk cultures: Should the onus be on proponents to prove their inventions are benign, or should it be on would-be regulators to prove harm?

But focusing on cultural differences risks overlooking powerful economic lobbies.

An [alternative explanation](&lt;|url|&gt;) sees the conflict as a fight by vested interests: Big fossil fuel could wish to remain free to develop geoengineering, including as a means to prolong oil and gas extraction and use.

Motivations can be tricky to discern, but the biggest fossil fuel producers around the table were also the most vociferous opponents of the resolution, consistently emphasizing the importance of not hampering carbon capture technology, whether it might be used to abate fossil fuel emissions or to draw down carbon from the atmosphere in geoengineering schemes. U.S. and Saudi protestations that the Swiss resolution would undermine the IPCC and AR6 rang fairly hollow, as both countries recently [refused to welcome](&lt;|url|&gt;) the IPCC’s last report. Also, while the AR6 is expected to run to several hundred pages, only a handful will likely address geoengineering.

## **What does this imply for governing geoengineering?**

What happened in Nairobi was a blow to any hopes that geoengineering might offer a quick fix in the face of continued foot-dragging in climate negotiations. But the failure also strengthens fears about unregulated research, development, or even deployment of some forms of geoengineering. Powerful [interests already pouring millions](&lt;|url|&gt;) into resisting a rapid transition away from fossil fuels might happily support solar geoengineering or carbon dioxide removal as an alternative to effective mitigation.

Nairobi was not the end of the road for geoengineering governance. But it must dispel any glib assumptions that geoengineering will be done only in the context of democratic global governance. Anyone contemplating geoengineering should factor in that it could well end up being unjustly imposed — and may delay rather than supplement effective climate mitigation.

# What I Learned From Watching 33 Hallmark Christmas Movies

## What I Learned From Watching 33 Hallmark Christmas Movies

### **The semi-heartwarming saga of two people and countless tales of holiday schmaltz**

![Credit: Holly Anissa Photography/Moment/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Holly Anissa Photography/Moment/Getty*

On October 27, the Hallmark Channel began its annual “Countdown to Christmas” movie series with *Christmas at Pemberly Manor*. You read that right: Since 2016, the channel’s traditional slate of original holiday movies has started before Halloween. How else could Hallmark air 37 entirely new Christmas films before the end of the year?

No, that’s not a typo. Hallmark really is releasing more than three dozen entirely new holiday movies for 2018 — and I’m going to watch all of them.

I’ve become a Hallmark original holiday movie nerd. It’s a recent development: My fandom began in the middle of October 2017, when my wife informed me we would watch all 33 of Hallmark’s 2017 Christmas films and do a podcast on them. At that point, all I knew about these movies was that they were cheesy, schmaltzy, and utterly formulaic. But I didn’t hesitate to say yes.

My wife suffers from depression, and 2017 had been an especially rough year for her. There were many reasons, including difficulties at work and the continuing fallout of the new presidential administration — not that the chemicals in her brain need “reasons,” of course. Just as she began to dig herself out, she broke her hip running in September. After the surgery in mid-October, she was effectively trapped in our apartment for weeks. Given her confinement, the ludicrous amount of movies and the time we would need to watch and podcast about them was actually a boon. (That podcast, *A Very Hallmark Christmas*, [can be found here](&lt;|url|&gt;), if you’re curious.)
> # I was right to worry in the sense that we quickly discovered all of these movies are basically the same.

While I was determined to stick it out, I was genuinely worried that the films would be so formulaic and numerous that I would get bored and need to feign excitement. I was even more worried that she would get bored and give up on the podcast entirely, which might give her more opportunities to fixate on her depression. (I should probably add that this wasn’t my first rodeo, and she has purchased tickets to my rodeo on many occasions, too.)

I was right to worry in the sense that we quickly discovered all of these movies are basically the same. They star a hetero couple, one of whom has made the cardinal sin of not loving a secular vision of Christmas to the core of his or her being. Over the course of the film, the lead relentlessly bludgeons the other with Christmas cheer until he or she gives in, and the two fall in love.

That’s basically it.

If you’re wondering where the drama comes in, well, it generally doesn’t. Occasionally there’s a brief moment where someone misunderstands a situation and thinks the other doesn’t love them, but this usually only happens around the 1-hour-45-minute mark of the 2-hour movie, and is solved 10 minutes later. That time frame includes a sizable commercial break.

Here’s what I didn’t expect: Despite all of these movies being essentially the same, they were somehow… different? Although all the movies adhered to the same formula, there was a wide range of variables that could be computed to reach the same answer. Some of these details could be plot-related, like whether the story would add the stakes of staging a small New England town’s Christmas festival, or someone would somehow end up in a gingerbread cookie–baking competition they needed help on, or, memorably, if magical Christmas ornaments were in play (please watch the movie *Magical Christmas Ornaments *for more details).
> # Watching these movies is like drinking dozens of different types of Chardonnay: They’re all the same wine, but they all have subtle differences and bouquets and flavor profiles.

There are plenty of other variables, too. There’s the chemistry between the two leads, whether the story tries to do anything unique within the formula, whether its jokes are actually funny, and whether its plot makes any sense whatsoever. A personal highlight last year was *Christmas in Angel Falls*, in which a real — but non-denominational — angel comes to Earth to help a town regain its Christmas spirit. The angel impressively neglects to mention the birth of Jesus even once, falls in love, and turns human to stay with her man, raising several million theological questions.

Watching these movies is like drinking dozens of different types of Chardonnay: They’re all the same wine, but they all have subtle differences and bouquets and flavor profiles, and after you drink too many of them you badly need to use the bathroom and may be on the verge of passing out.

But my wife and I were surprised to discover how much we enjoyed them. (Usually, anyway: of course there were a few stinkers.) After a shitty day at the hospital, or a shitty day of work, or a shitty day on planet Earth, we eventually realized how nice it was to come home and have this block on our DVR. These movies would not make us feel concern or stress, challenge us, or fail to provide a happy ending. A Hallmark holiday movie became a warm, cozy blanket for our brains to get comfy and sleepy under.

Mock them if you want, but many, many people agree with me. [More than 72 million people](&lt;|url|&gt;) watched last year’s two-month “Countdown to Christmas” event, which explains why Hallmark is churning out more of them than ever. This year’s 37 movies outnumber the 33 entries in 2017, already an increase from 25 in 2016.

You could argue that’s way too many — I would personally agree with you, having sat through an entire season’s worth of them myself — but there’s a bigger problem. The overwhelming number of films is also overwhelmingly white.

This year, only four of these 37 movies star people of color, up from virtually zero in 2017. Zero films included any LGBTQ characters last year; it remains to be seen if that will improve this year.

You don’t have to be cisgender, heterosexual, and white to enjoy the charming cheesiness of these movies, but these privileged perspectives are baked into this massive pop culture event. All I can say is my wife and I were fortunate enough to have this escape available to us at a time when we badly needed it.

My spouse and I will still try to watch all 37 movies, because we had fun last year and podcast glory awaits. And 2018 had its own share of challenges: My eyesight has deteriorated to the point where I need a series of surgeries. I’ve had one, but there are two more to go, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to see. Luckily, Hallmark films don’t require eagle-eyed vision to enjoy.
> # After watching people learn to love Christmas in these films, something happened. We purchased a Christmas tree.

There’s one last reason we’re back for more, and it shocked us the most about this project: We’ve actually never been much for Christmas. We’ve had a tree for only a handful of our 14 years of marriage, with virtually no other decorations. We often don’t even wrap our presents, which is the bane of my holiday-loving mother-in-law.

But at some point, after watching people learn to love Christmas in these films, something happened. We purchased a Christmas tree — probably owing to the several million or so advertisements for Balsam Hill artificial models we had seen. After we set it up, we decorated it with the paltry few ornaments we had managed to accrue over the years. We played Christmas music.

This year, to commemorate the project and salute the audacity of our 2018 Hallmark movie extravaganza, I put up our Christmas tree on October 27, the same day “Countdown to Christmas” kicked off. In the span of a single year, we’ve transformed from quasi-scrooges into *those* people.

Somehow these movies made a difference. We’ve actually begun celebrating the season as something more than just a chance to chip away at each other’s Amazon wishlists. These ridiculous movies are genuinely bringing us tidings of comfort and, well, *joy* might be too strong a word, but something like it. I wouldn’t necessarily call it a Christmas miracle, but it’s been a gift all the same.<|endoftext|>

# Should We — and Can We — Advertise in Space?

## Getting a billboard into orbit may be the easy part

![Illustration: [Shira Inbar](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Shira Inbar](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

When a Russian startup called StartRocket revealed its plans for orbital billboards earlier this year, it was met with both skepticism from technologists and dismay from anyone who might prefer an unadulterated view of the night sky — astronomers very much included.

StartRocket’s plan is to use an array of up to 300 tiny satellites with reflective sails to display luminous logos in low-Earth orbit, visible from Earth. Each tiny sail would unfurl to create an advertising message over a big city for six minutes at a time.

In April, the company teamed up with the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, established in 2011 in collaboration with MIT, to test the reflective material. Together they successfully launched a probe and an angular reflector with light film attached to it — dubbed a “light pixel” — into the stratosphere. StartRocket confirmed it could be seen from the Earth. “We tested [the fabric’s] properties by raising it 180 meters above the ground at sunset,” Vladilen Sitnikov, StartRocket’s CEO, said in a statement. “We fastened the reflector with ropes and directed Xenon lights at it — their light temperature is the closest to that of the su — and observed a distinct spot of light.”

The startup will now begin the development of its satellites at a cost of about $25 million. But there’s a snag: The company says it needs to attract millions of dollars in investment by October of this year for an orbital test launch. Despite this, it already has a test launch partner in the Adrenaline Rush drinks company, part of PepsiCo Russia. StartRocket’s plan is to show a peace symbol as part of its testing in 2021, followed by its first branded image — the logo of GameChangers, a campaign to dispel negative stereotypes of gamers. So far so good?

Turning our skies into a cosmic Times Square isn’t a new idea. As 600 million people watched Neil Armstrong take [one small step](&lt;|url|&gt;) onto the moon on TV in 1969, they were also bombarded with product placement from the likes of Hasselblad, Sony, and Omega in the form of high-tech gadgets the astronaut heroes used and wore. In the 1990s, Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft carried logos and even a Japanese [TV journalist](&lt;|url|&gt;) in return for publicity and money, and in 1997, the [first commercia](&lt;|url|&gt;)l was filmed aboard the Mir space station. But advertising stunts were about to get bigger.

Pizza Hut [delivered fast food ](&lt;|url|&gt;)to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2001, and in 2012, some 8 million YouTube viewers watched Felix Baumgartner plummet towards Earth from nearly 130,000 feet up for Red Bull’s infamous [Stratos space jump](&lt;|url|&gt;). In 2018, SpaceX blasted a [Tesla Roadster](&lt;|url|&gt;) into space on the maiden mission of its Falcon Heavy rocket, and NASA’s Curiosity Rover is currently printing the initials of its creators in [Morse code](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Mars, thanks to markings on its wheels.

Cosmic ads have also been proposed before, by a U.S. company called Space Marketing in 1993. It planned to launch an illuminated “[pace billboard](&lt;|url|&gt;)” into low orbit, to be easily read by captive Earthlings. The billboard would have been made from Mylar film which would, they claimed, have made it as large and bright as the moon. But they failed to raise the cash, and the project never happened.

Is StartRocket’s plan just another ambitious fantasy? Money is its first challenge; to launch these satellites into orbit by 2021 and install the display as planned, the company needs to raise more than $220 million.

The technology itself does have some precedent, however: David Spencer, director of the Space Flight Projects Laboratory at Purdue University in Indiana, led solar sail missions in a project called LightSail 1 in 2015, which demonstrated that a solar sail could be successfully deployed from [CubeSat](&lt;|url|&gt;) mini-satellites. “Similar to a pixel-based display, they ‘turn on’ the reflected sunlight from a square sail by orienting the sail relative to the sun, such that the reflected photons are directed toward Earth,” Spencer explained. However, maintaining the correct configuration of the CubeSats is very difficult, so StartRocket plans to fit each of the 10-centimeter-wide satellites with an ion thruster so they can be moved into position.

But Daniel Batcheldor, head of Florida Tech’s department of Aerospace, Physics and Space Sciences, believes there’s a bigger problem. Given its distance from Earth, the constellation would probably be as visible as the ISS is from the ground. “ISS is in low-Earth orbit and is about the size of a football field when the solar panels are included,” he said. “From the ground it can be seen by a limited number of people for a few minutes every few weeks, at night, when it’s not cloudy. StartRocket’s vision for space-based adverts is not realistic.”

“We do not allow advertising in national parks so as to protect their natural wonder,” Batcheldor added. “The same should be applied to space, in my opinion.”

StartRocket does not seem deterred. “We’ve seen the reaction to our project and a lot of people are criticizing us,” Sitnikov said in an email to *OneZero*. “As for skeptics who doubt that our project is possible to realize, we will answer them later, when our first image — the peace sign — will appear in the sky. It will happen in 2021.”

Well ahead of its launch, the company has already announced that the fee to advertise will start at $200,000, with the potential to run three ads each day. The cost per thousand visitors is between $10 and $15 and depends on weather conditions. “If it is cloudy in Moscow in November, the cost will be as low as possible,” Sitnikov said. For a global audience, these fees are arguably quite low compared to the rumored [$65 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) Red Bull spent on its Stratos stunt, but StartRocket also has to navigate some complex legalities about advertising in space.
> # “What happens when the next hypothetical cryptocurrency billionaire decides to launch his 23-story Hello Kitty rocket into orbit? What if the rocket were a 23-story giant Twinkie?”

After the first tangible threat of a space billboard in 1993, the U.S. government scrambled to put rules in place banning obtrusive space ads. Title 51 of the United States Code prohibits “advertising in outer space that is capable of being recognized by a human being on the surface of the Earth,” describing it as “obtrusive.” However, it does allow commercial advertising on vehicles and other product placement.

Steven Mirmina, a professor of space law at Georgetown University Law Center and a senior attorney at NASA, described Elon Musk’s [Tesla stunt](&lt;|url|&gt;) as “ridiculous” in a Harvard Law Review[ blog post](&lt;|url|&gt;) and took it to task for its “intentional pollution of the outer space environment.” But current space law doesn’t prohibit more of the same, he said. “What happens when the next hypothetical cryptocurrency billionaire decides to launch his 23-story Hello Kitty rocket into orbit? What if the rocket were a 23-story giant Twinkie?”

Article 1 of the [U.N. Outer Space Treaty](&lt;|url|&gt;) stipulates the freedom for exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. It also says that every nation should have access to use space accordingly, as long as they don’t cause harm to others’ activities. “Technically, if advertising from space would not cause harmful interference or violate any other norms of international customary or treaty law, it may be permissible,” explained Sara Langston, assistant professor of spaceflight operations at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida.

Astronomers and environmentalists argue that there are profound diplomatic, legal, and ethical problems with space advertising. “Clogging up orbit and spectrum usage for mere obtrusive advertisement is going to raise issues in the international community,” said Langston. “We have enough challenges with space sustainability, managing space traffic, space debris, [and] spectrum congestion space weather risks, not to mention the negative implications and harmful interference for Earth-based science and astronomy.”

StartRocket is adamant that its satellites won’t end up as space junk because they will only remain in space for one year. “After that we will bring them from orbit to the atmosphere where they will burn. All our CubeSats are remotely guided,” Sitnikov said. He added that the satellite array could also be used to share information during natural disasters when there is no phone network. “We do not fly over nature reserves, and we do not aim at telescopes of astronomers who are outside major cities.”

However, if the project edges closer to becoming reality, there are sure to be more objections that could delay its launch. Langston, for one, is still not convinced this is the beginning of a new space advertising race. “Given our current state of technology and geopolitical climate, not to mention the significant costs of launch and maintaining on-orbit activities,” she said, “I don’t think public, political, or professional opinion is currently in favor of obtrusive advertising from space.”<|endoftext|>

# Fully Automated Luxury Communism Isn’t Our Future

## A new fantasy from the far left holds that far from taking our jobs, automation could liberate us. But it’s a false hope

![Illustration: [Minet Kim](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Minet Kim](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

In Aaron Bastani’s [new book](&lt;|url|&gt;) *Fully Automated Luxury Communism: A Manifesto*, the British author argues that advances in technology have made visible a “political map” pointing to the ideas of Karl Marx and communism, and could lead to a transformation in wealth distribution and quality of life for everyone on Earth. Automation, according to Bastani, is the social revolution that Marx had long predicted.

“This is not a book about the future but about a present that goes unacknowledged,” Bastani begins. “The outline of a world immeasurably better than our own, more equal, prosperous, and creative, is there to see if only we dare to look. But insight alone is not enough. We must have the courage — for that is what is required — to argue, persuade, and build. There is a world to win.”

Immense wealth will be generated, he explains, by the “extreme supply” of valuable resources generated by new space industries such as asteroid mining. Advancements in robotics and automation on Earth will, in turn, mean that humans are largely liberated from manual work. And the new-found wealth from this space exploration and the liberation of our time will enable us all to live in luxury and abundance. All this, I’ll remind you, in a book categorized as non-fiction.
> # “It turns out that Marx’s early suspicion that the countries set to lead the revolution would be those at the cutting edge of capitalist modernity was right. Only now we know that means technology as much as politics.”

During this transition, capitalism will collapse because both automation and the “extreme supply” of resources will make all goods and services permanently cheaper. Once that happens, Bastani argues, this new system of Fully Automated Luxury Communism (FALC) will be overseen by an elected, populist, left-wing government.

Talking to *OneZero*, Bastani explained that Marx saw automation as central to his communist vision. Rather than being the threat it’s often characterized as, mechanization actually liberates workers. “It turns out that Marx’s early suspicion that the countries set to lead the revolution would be those at the cutting edge of capitalist modernity was right. Only now we know that means technology as much as politics,” says Bastani. He adds that the goal is Marx’ well-known maxim: “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.”

The FALC manifesto has captured the imagination of some in the left, especially in Britain. But how realistic is this vision?

### **Assumption one: Most jobs will be automated, and soon**

Bastani describes the creeping automation of manufacturing, retail, transport, and health care. For businesses, the incentives are higher productivity, lower costs, and, in the case of self-driving cars, safety. Avoiding the complexities of managing human beings is also attractive to some; the CEO of Chinese electronics firm Foxconn [complained](&lt;|url|&gt;) that managing 1 million employees “gave him a headache,” and three years later replaced 60,000 workers with robots at a factory in Kunshan, China.

“[Automation] is the leading edge of a transformation which will mean not only the loss of countless jobs, but entire professions,” Bastani writes. While [some academics](&lt;|url|&gt;) have asserted that creativity and idea generation will be uniquely valuable in a world of automation, Bastani is not so sure: “This may well prove the case in some areas, but surely not for a world of nearly 10 billion people” — as level UN demographers [project](&lt;|url|&gt;) the world may reach by the end of the century.

Bastani is tapping popular concern about automation taking over jobs, particularly manual labor. Yet research shows that automation is both a long way off and not necessarily displacing jobs.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that skilled manufacturing jobs currently represent 8.5% of the U.S. workforce, or 12.75 million jobs, yet [89%](&lt;|url|&gt;) of manufacturers report that they can’t find skilled applicants to fill vacant positions. This could mean 2.4 million vacant jobs by 2028, costing the manufacturing industry $454 billion.

Increasingly, manufacturing work involves managing new and advanced technologies, indicating that technology is creating new jobs rather than simply replacing them. Research by [McKinsey Digital](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that automation will eliminate very few occupations entirely over the next decade. In about 60% of jobs, about a third of the tasks involved can be automated, which means that less than 5% of jobs could be fully automated.

In addition, the [costs](&lt;|url|&gt;) of automating businesses are significant, and [prohibitive for small businesses](&lt;|url|&gt;), at least for now. A 2017 [report](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the World Economic Forum found very limited awareness of automated production technologies among small businesses, who will rely on government support and incentives to adapt. Google, meanwhile, [spent](&lt;|url|&gt;) at least $1.1 billion on its self-driving car project between 2009 and 2015, and the project still faces many [logistical](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [regulatory](&lt;|url|&gt;) hurdles before it can move beyond the test phase.

### **Assumption two: The new space industries will be economically viable**

Pricing within the capitalist structure is based on finite supply, Bastani says, so the opening up of space mining industries will dramatically expand our supply of valuable materials, pushing prices down. “The limits of the earth won’t matter anymore — because we’ll mine the sky instead,” Bastani says.

This idea — of the extreme supply of resources collapsing the value system of capitalism and liberating the workers — is central to FALC. And yet, even with achievements in robotics, automation, and commercial space exploration as foundations for its realization, we are still light-years away from reliable, affordable space mining.

There are three main challenges in space mining: cost, identification of suitable asteroids for potential mining, and the problems of extraction. Though the potential returns on investment are unknown, there is active research in this area from a range of mostly privately funded elite interests.

Planetary Resources, a privately funded asteroid mining company, says it will take [a decade](&lt;|url|&gt;) to identify which asteroids are suitable for commercial mining. Logistical challenges include setting up equipment on a moving asteroid with a low gravitational field, how to mine the resources themselves, and getting into space in the first place. And the struggling company itself was [acquired](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year by a blockchain firm.

As well as complexity, the costs will be vast. Prior to its [bankruptcy](&lt;|url|&gt;) in February, private space exploration project Mars One estimated that the cost of [sending four people to Mars](&lt;|url|&gt;) would be $6 billion, with every subsequent mission costing $4 billion. NASA itself hasn’t published estimates of a Mars trip, though two veteran space scientists have [estimated](&lt;|url|&gt;) that a technically complex traveling space station would cost at least $130 billion, translating into $230 billion for just one manned space flight.

Put simply, the cost of obtaining any minerals from asteroids will far outweigh their potential value on Earth. Profitable asteroid mining is likely to remain a technological and economic fantasy for decades, if not centuries to come. It makes FALC’s case for space resources and extreme supply speculative, at best.

### **Assumption three: We don’t want to work**

Let’s assume, however, that humans do eventually manage to unlock an unprecedented wealth of resources from asteroids, and that everyone on Earth would feel the economic benefit. With machines to replicate human work, we will be freed all manual and intellectual effort. Leaving aside, too, that many people enjoy the sociability and purpose of work, what will we all do with our newfound time and freedom?
> # If we look at the most successful technology companies today, it seems hard to imagine how a future that demands immense investment and expertise could be anything other than privately owned.

Perhaps rather oddly, Bastani describes something that sounds like the “gentlefolk of leisure” of a 19th century English novel: “Under FALC we will see more of the world than ever before, eat varieties of food we have never heard of, and lead lives equivalent — if we so wish — to those of today’s billionaires. Luxury will pervade everything as a society based on waged work becomes as much a relic of history as the feudal peasant and medieval knight.”

And yet, if we look at the most successful technology companies today — the vast, online empires that are some of the wealthiest companies ever created — it seems hard to imagine how a future that demands immense investment and expertise could be anything other than privately owned. The companies that build the automation — and asteroid mining — of the future are likely to be private empires, too. At what point do these companies give away all their wealth to the workers of the world? Unless Bastani is proposing a revolution to take it back by force?

But that’s not what he’s calling for here. FALC, he says, must be embedded within a “luxury populism” and engage with mainstream electoral politics. So populist far-left parties would propose this future, and we could vote for it. They’d propose that worker-owned businesses and cooperatives would be favored over multinationals. A “One Planet Tax” would shift wealth from richer to poorer countries. A system of [universal basic services](&lt;|url|&gt;) would offer government-funded housing, food, and health care to everyone who needed it. “You can only live your best life under FALC and nothing else, so fight for it and refuse the yoke of an economic system which belongs in the past,” says Bastani.

Bastani has been bold enough to label his book a manifesto. He’s not hiding the fact that he is laying the theoretical groundwork for a distant revolution. He offers an imaginative, alternative outcome to the inevitable disruption that technology is having on our society.

These are important issues to consider. However, FALC is clearly and simply fully-fledged communism, remarketed for the 21st century. History shows us that communism fails because of natural human hierarchies and desires, and there’s no reason to think that complex technological systems and the space-mining companies of the future should make that any different.

The FALC vision may rest on the foundations of realism, but it is so impossibly utopian and idealistic as to be whimsical. The science is far too expensive and too theoretical to ever make this a reality, certainly within our lifetimes, however enticing it might be to think of a future without work. We need to look for solutions to our global problems with the technologies we have today, and Fully Automated Luxury Communism cannot offer us anything but an illusory utopia.<|endoftext|>

# How Neurofeedback Is Revolutionizing Stress Management

## We may be able to train ourselves to control brain activity

![Credit: Alfred Pasieka/Science Photo Library/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Alfred Pasieka/Science Photo Library/Getty Images*

Fear, stress, and anxiety are some of the biggest dangers to our mental health. But like many of our unpleasant emotions, they have important functional origins; without them, we lack the motivation to flee from danger or avoid harmful behaviors.

The amygdala is a brain structure involved in emotional experiences, such as [fear and anxiety](&lt;|url|&gt;). Stressful experiences can adjust its sensitivity. For soldiers who enter military service, for example, symptoms of stress correlate with their amygdala reactivity. After their military service, their amygdala is [more responsive to medical images](&lt;|url|&gt;) than it was before their service started.

Some evidence suggests that our brain’s prefrontal cortex, an area frequently linked to [behavioral control and decision-making](&lt;|url|&gt;), regulates the level of activity in our amygdala when we are faced with unpleasant stressors. Patients with lesions in specific parts of their prefrontal cortex show stronger amygdala responses when [looking at distressing images](&lt;|url|&gt;). In a sense, their amygdalae are out of control. Other abnormalities in this control link between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala are characteristic of [patients who suffer from depression](&lt;|url|&gt;).

This raises an interesting question: Could we help people deal with stress by training them to control the activity in their amygdala when they are feeling anxious?

One neuroscience technique known as neurofeedback may provide an answer. The general objective behind the technique is to teach people to recognize signals that reflect what their brain is doing and react accordingly. Imagine a computer that shows you a ball moving to the left or right, depending on how active your left or right motor cortex is. Or a computer that rewards you with money every time it detects unconscious brain activity connected to your phobia of snakes. If the computer manages to build a positive rather than negative association to a particular stressor within your brain, it could ultimately reduce your reactions of panic when you encounter that stressor in the real world. This approach has already [shown promise in curing phobias](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # Many existing treatments for these problems require people to relive specific fears, which obviously can be a painful and difficult process.

A [study published in early 2019](&lt;|url|&gt;) tested whether neurofeedback could improve amygdala control in the brains of soldiers. The researchers recruited a total of 180 soldiers who were in the first few weeks of a stressful combat training program designed to ready them for deployment. They assigned half of that group — 90 soldiers — to a training course of amygdala neurofeedback.

This neurofeedback aimed to train their brains to better regulate amygdala activity. To achieve this, the soldiers watched an animation of a hospital waiting room with a few agitated characters shouting at a receptionist. The soldiers were told to “find the mental strategy” that would make those characters calm down. The instructions were intentionally vague, and soldiers knew little about what was going on in their brain. But if they successfully suppressed the level of activity in their amygdala, the characters on the screen would calm down.

In other words, over the course of the neurofeedback training program, these 90 soldiers watched the video, played around with their minds until the characters calmed down, and then tried to repeat the mental strategies that achieved that goal. A brain monitor behind the scenes looked for an electrical fingerprint related to the amygdala and calmed the characters whenever it detected declining activity in that fingerprint.

To know for sure that their neurofeedback was working specifically for the amygdala, the researchers assigned the remaining 90 soldiers in their sample to a control group. This group either trained with neurofeedback using an irrelevant brain signal outside the amygdala or participated in no neurofeedback whatsoever.

Soldiers completed a total of six neurofeedback sessions over four weeks at their military training base. The main question was whether the amygdala group would develop better emotion-regulation skills than the control group after training was completed.

During the neurofeedback itself, the researchers found exactly what they expected. According to the brain activity data, the soldiers in the amygdala neurofeedback group reduced their amygdala activity more than the soldiers in the control group, at least after their fourth session of training.

When the researchers removed the hospital animation and simply asked the amygdala neurofeedback soldiers to recreate the mental strategy they had picked up, the soldiers were able to successfully suppress their amygdala on demand while looking at a blank screen. In fact, they could achieve the same feat while simultaneously focusing on a separate memory task. So, even when people were under mental pressure, they could apply the strategies they learned through neurofeedback.

Going a step further, the researchers tested whether these amygdala changes would translate into better emotion control. In a behavioral test that measured how well people could [categorize emotions on faces](&lt;|url|&gt;) while being distracted by inconsistent emotional words, soldiers in the amygdala neurofeedback group were better able to prevent the distraction from interfering with their performance.

Using some additional questionnaires, the researchers also found that after amygdala neurofeedback, soldiers could more effectively identify and describe their own emotions. More specifically, compared to the control group, they showed larger reductions in scores related to a trait known as [alexithymia](&lt;|url|&gt;), which refers to a difficulty in understanding our personal emotional states.

During the neurofeedback training at the military camp, the researchers used a brain-monitoring method known as electroencephalography, primarily because the equipment is mobile and practical. However, this method could detect only an indirect electrical fingerprint for the amygdala, rather than a reliable and direct signal coming from the amygdala itself. Although [past evidence suggests a good link](&lt;|url|&gt;) between this electrical fingerprint and more spatially precise brain scans, the researchers wanted to confirm that their neurofeedback had targeted the intended brain areas.

For that reason, in an important final test, the researchers brought 30 of the amygdala neurofeedback soldiers and 30 of the control group soldiers back to an academic lab one month after the training sessions ended. The soldiers entered a functional magnetic brain-imaging scanner — a more precise method for assessing where brain activity is coming from — and ran through another neurofeedback protocol. As expected, the soldiers who had undergone amygdala neurofeedback training at their military camp were better able to reduce their amygdala activity than soldiers in the control group.

This final brain-imaging test allowed the researchers to test the interactions between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. The researchers found stronger connectivity between these two areas of the brain among the soldiers trained with amygdala neurofeedback compared to the soldiers in the control group.

So, this follow-up brain scanning, a whole month after the neurofeedback training, suggested that the program’s success may have relied on strengthening the circuit between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. But perhaps more important, it also highlighted that the training benefits lasted several weeks at the very least.

If there is one thing about neurofeedback that should excite us, it is the ability to influence the core brain systems underlying stress and anxiety without necessarily exposing people to their dreaded fears in the process. Many existing behavioral and psychological treatments for these problems require people to relive specific fears, which obviously can be a painful and difficult process.

Although it is still early days in the neurofeedback world, the research continues to expand and surprise us. As brain-imaging technology becomes more practical, more precise, and more widely available, we could all have the opportunity to use it in enhancing our ability to cope with stress. One of the biggest challenges to our emotional well-being is our tendency to impulsively overreact when we come across a new challenge. Although we cannot yet find reliable at-home neurofeedback tools to improve our resilience and self-control, we are arguably moving in that direction.

Until then, the research is a great reminder of how quickly our brains can adapt to helpful feedback and practice. We may be able to harness those qualities by creating our own feedback systems that make it immediately clear when we behave in a way we want to avoid. If we often regret feeling angry, perhaps we can invent an “alarm word” with our friends and partners that they use in snapping us out of our impulsive emotional cycles. Or perhaps, like many great athletes, we can practice rituals and habits that we associate with feeling focused and confident so we can use them when we become anxious or distracted. Superstitions may often seem bizarre and even factually absurd, but they also [seem to help us](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Of course, we should never forget the utility of uncomfortable emotions. When we are optimistic about anxiety — when we accept that it helps rather than harms our performance by focusing our attention on important goals — we [increase our chances of success](&lt;|url|&gt;). A little psychological pressure can infuse critical events in our lives with the emotional weight they deserve—but too much can debilitate us. It is in this latter case where neurofeedback could become our lifeguard.<|endoftext|>

# What if the End of Game of Thrones Is Terrible?

## What if the End of ‘Game of Thrones’ Is Terrible?

### Problems in the show’s last season bode ill for its grand finale

![Credit: HBO](<|image|>)*Credit: HBO*

The end of *Game of Thrones — *the TV show at least* — *is finally upon us. After eight seasons and 67 episodes, it’s rather daunting to realize we’re finally going to see the long-awaited battle for the fate of Westeros, where the only guarantee is that some of our favorite characters will be dying. But frankly, I have a bigger worry about this final season: What if it’s terrible?

This is not just a counterintuitive take — my concerns are very, very real. I am not happy about the possibility of *Thrones*’s flubbing its landing after years of excellence. And this isn’t about the possibility that the epic conclusion will be disappointing because that’s a given. There’s simply too much anticipation, which has made our expectations impossible to fulfill. I’ve [made my peace](&lt;|url|&gt;) with that, and you should, too.

I’m certainly not going to pretend *Thrones* has been flawless so far. (Rewatch Daenerys’ interminable dragon-napping storyline in season two or anything that ever happened in Dorne.) But the last season, way back in 2017, had more issues than any season before it, and there were many moments that were flat-out bad — often in ways the show hadn’t evidenced before. And that worries me about what’s to come.

So much in season seven felt rushed. Characters were often forced to speed through exposition, and as a result, scenes lacked time to breathe. Long-awaited reunions — the Stark children coming together, Cersei and Tyrion Lannister meeting again, and Jorah returning to Daenerys — felt perfunctory and clipped off when they should have been decadently satisfying. Time and space stopped mattering altogether as characters practically teleported across the continent of Westeros in order to keep the plot moving at a breakneck speed, the most infamous example being Daenerys flying from Dragonstone to beyond the Wall to rescue Jon Snow and his posse in about four to six hours.

These problems are bummers because they mess with two of the show’s biggest strengths — the raw, emotional moments between characters we’ve come to love (or hate), and the fundamental realism that has made *Game of Thrones* so unlike other fantasy series.

There was simply too much cheap drama. Remember the awesome battle between Daenerys’ forces and the Lannister wagon train and her utterly absurd decision to land her wounded dragon in the middle of an active battlefield solely so she could briefly be in danger of getting killed by a charging Jaime? Or how that episode ended with Jaime in full armor falling 30 feet into a lake that had suddenly appeared right next to him — yet he was inexplicably fine when the next episode began? Or how, in that otherwise epic fight between Jon Snow’s posse and the legion of the White Walkers, there was not one but two deus ex machina? (First Daenerys flew in to rescue everyone, and then, after Jon Snow inexplicably stayed behind, his somewhat undead uncle Benjen appeared out of nowhere to save his butt.)
> # That’s what worries me the most, that nagging sense that the writers, the actors, the producers, and everyone else are more worried in getting the show done rather than getting these final crucial episodes right.

You might not have noticed these flaws as you were watching — season seven still boasted the series’ characteristically amazing action scenes. Who has time to keep track of plot logic when a dragon is sinking into the ice or a million stuntmen are [being set on fire](&lt;|url|&gt;)?

But despite the problems in pace and believability, there was nothing worse in season seven than the storyline between Arya and Sansa. It requires quite the description to truly appreciate its awfulness, so please bear with me, but keep in mind this begins the episode immediately after the two reunite and connect emotionally despite being completely different people who have led utterly different lives.

And then Arya immediately starts criticizing Sansa for wanting to rule Winterfell, which she’s currently doing in newly crowned King in the North Jon Snow’s stead while he’s off making broody eyes at Daenerys. Okay, Arya? It’s not a crime for Sansa to want to have some political power, especially after all she’s been through. Also, Jon specifically left her in charge, and when Bran arrived, Sansa tried to give control of Winterfell to him as the last legitimate male heir of Ned Stark, even though he had become a creepy bird-man. Lastly, Sansa is actually much, much better at ruling than Jon anyway, something she proves by keeping the northern bannermen in line. Honestly, Sansa should have been in charge the entire time.

But Arya makes it clear she thinks Sansa is plotting to overthrow Jon, something Sansa has never given even the slightest indication of wanting to do. Arya even threatens to use her weird assassin powers and outright murder her sister. It all makes zero sense — as does the scheming Littlefinger bringing out an old letter Sansa wrote in season one under duress from Cersei where she asked her brother Robb to bend the knee to King Joffrey. Sansa is terrified that the northern lords will discover this letter in which she has supposedly committed treason — even though she wrote it in season one when she was 15, after her father had been imprisoned, and before she knew how villainous the Lannisters really were. Who in the seven kingdoms would be stupid enough to blame her for that? Arya, apparently.

The Sansa-Arya split was clearly created so the characters could continue to have a storyline while the rest of the focus was on Jon and Daenerys, the war against the White Walkers, and the machinations in King’s Landing. Even if season seven was a complete rush, this was terrible writing — arguably the worst in the entire series. An entire storyline this bad seems less like an accident and more like the writers couldn’t be bothered to think of something better.

And that’s what worries me the most, that nagging sense that the writers, the actors, the producers, and everyone else are more worried — or perhaps even more interested — in getting the show done rather than getting these final crucial episodes right.

There’s no chance that *Game of Thrones’* final season will be completely disappointing. If nothing else, I’m certain we can trust that the makers of the show have saved their most awesome spectacles for the end. There’s going to be plenty to like, and, besides, there’s going to be immense satisfaction in simply watching this epic fantasy story reach its conclusion after all these years.

But, man, it’s going to be a huge bummer if the show’s final season has as many flaws as its previous one. I hope that won’t be the case, but we’ll find out soon enough — the last six episodes begin airing Sunday, April 14 — and we’ll finally see who wins, who dies, and who just stopped giving a damn.<|endoftext|>

# The Anxiety of Nerd FOMO

## The Anxiety of Nerd FOMO

### **This golden age of nerd pop culture can be an exquisite torture for actual nerds**

![Credit: Soloma_Poppystyle/iStock/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Soloma_Poppystyle/iStock/Getty*

It’s very likely first among first world problems, but there’s just too much good entertainment out there. It’s an actual dilemma, especially for geeks. Because even though we’re living in a golden age of nerd entertainment, the likes of which we never could have dreamed about as kids and teens, all that beautiful content is *stressing us out*.

Even if you’re just an average consumer of entertainment, you might feel like it’s impossible to check out everything you might be interested in — to watch every popular movie and great TV show, hear every hit album, read every critically acclaimed book and comic, play every lauded video game. You’re right — it is straight-up impossible. The only way to navigate this plethora of art is to become increasingly picky about how you spend your time and what you spend your time on.

Nerds don’t have more hours in the day than regular people, of course, but we often don’t have the luxury of being selective. Nerds are completists by nature, whether we want to collect the entire run of a comic book or all the action figures in a certain toy line or make sure to see every *Star Wars* product.
> # With so many new series, so many movies, so many sequels and reboots and revivals, it is extremely rare that there’s an actual end, which means almost nothing* *can be completed anymore.

And nerds are never satisfied with a single subject. They’re likely to be completists for multiple genres — science fiction, fantasy, superheroes, and a few assorted other things, to cite the example of one geek who also happens to be me. Or rather, I’ve *tried* to be a completist of many, many things, but with so many new series, so many movies, so many sequels and reboots and revivals, it is extremely rare that there’s an actual end, which means almost nothing* can* be completed anymore.

Yes, I could theoretically try to be pickier, to winnow down the entertainment I consume to the subjects I enjoy most, but that’s not how being a nerd works. You don’t stop being a fan of something because you’re running out of time or because you don’t have enough money to purchase all your favorite stuff. You might be forced to become choosier by sheer necessity; I’ve certainly had to drop TV shows and comics and stop playing video games almost entirely over the past few years.

But I still have countless shows and books and more squatting at the top of my pop culture to-do list, a list that has been growing for months: the most recent seasons of Syfy’s *12 Monkeys* and Amazon’s *The Man in the High Castle*, plus several shows on the DC Universe streaming services. I also need to watch *Star Trek: Discovery* and the critical sci-fi darling *The Expanse*, neither of which I’ve even had a chance to begin. I remain a bit anxious that I don’t know what’s happening in the *Supergirl* TV series and the main *Batman* and *Avengers* comic books, and I feel pangs of anxiety knowing there’s a mountain of great video games that I don’t have time to play. Meanwhile, still more new items are added to my list of things I *need* to experience, even as I struggle to keep my head above the crashing waves of the modern nerd renaissance.

The acronym FOMO — fear of missing out — is primarily used to mean a feeling that other people are doing cool things without you, that you’re missing something fun because you’re stuck at home watching, say, *Star Trek: Discovery*. It’s different for nerds, because there doesn’t need to be another person involved. We’re not worried that someone else is enjoying *Star Trek* and we’re not. We’re afraid of missing out on the content, or rather, the consumption of the content. We’re afraid of not watching or reading or playing all the wonderful stuff getting released nowadays — and that’s so much stuff.

If you think this is weird, you have a valid objection. It doesn’t make a lot of sense, and it’s even more senseless when you realize many nerds can still feel the panicked need to consume even if they don’t particularly care about the content. Chances are you know somebody who watches some show they hate, maybe because they loved it once, or maybe because they’ve seen so much that they feel compelled to keep going even if they’re not enjoying themselves. Now add the idea that nerds can still desperately crave to see something they actively hate, and you’re beginning to see our plight.
> # For nerds, it’s rarely about enjoyment; it’s about consumption and compulsion.

If you have ever talked to a *Star Trek* fan, or a *Star Wars* fan, or any reader of a comic book, they will gladly tell you which elements of their *objet d’affection* they hate, and they will tell you in such detail and with such vehemence that it seems impossible that they actually like it at all. Sometimes nerds may even hate the majority of the property they love, but that doesn’t actually matter. I can’t tell you how many *Star Trek* fans I’ve known who have complete disdain for one or more entire TV series in the canon and yet have watched every single episode of even the shows they despise the most.

For nerds, it’s rarely about enjoyment; again, it’s about consumption and compulsion. Say there’s a *Trek* fan who hates the old *Deep Space Nine* and the *Enterprise* TV series with a passion. This has exactly zero bearing on whether or not they watched those shows. Of course they watched them — *every single episode*. Not because they liked them, obviously, but because of the completionism that drives fans to spend their time unhappily watching a show they honestly believe is a travesty to the franchise they love. After all, if you’re a true *Star Trek* fan, the idea of not watching *Deep Space Nine*, even if you loathe it to the core of your being, is absurd. Fans watch, period. (And then they bitch about it endlessly online to their fellow fans.)

While I have and am still watching and reading things I do not care for out of completionism — and sometimes inertia — I suspect the underlying driver is one that many nerds of my generation have. We know what it was like before this golden age, when it was a cause for major celebration when anything even tangentially nerdy broke through into mainstream media. The 1989 *Batman* movie was a cultural touchstone, but I remember being nearly as excited for 1996’s *The Phantom* movie, starring Billy Zane—even though it was based on a character in a comic strip from the 1940s that I’d never read and didn’t particularly care to—just because it was a movie based on a comic. The movie was terrible, and I knew it would be. But I was waiting in the theater to see it, just as I did for a dozen other equally awful geek movies of the ’80s and ’90s — simply because it was nerdy.

Back then, nerds were desperate. In 2000, when *X-Men* kicked off the modern superhero movie craze, we were overjoyed. When *Arrow* premiered in 2012, proving to Hollywood that people craved nerdy TV shows as much as they did movies, we nerds watched. And then we watched the spinoffs: *The Flash*, *Supergirl*, and others. And then Marvel got into the fray with *Agent Carter *and* Agents of SHIELD* and then moved to Netflix with *Daredevil *and* Jessica Jones*, then to Hulu with *Runaways* and *Legion* on FX, and then people started grabbing whatever comics they could find to make TV shows like *The Walking Dead *and* Preacher*, and now Disney is going to have a streaming service with so many *Star Wars* shows and Marvel movie spinoff series, and so many more are already in the works—well, you get the idea. It’s daunting to even consider.

When the avalanche was a mere snowball, I consumed all of these things because I was just excited that they existed. Even if some of the shows were bad — and many definitely were — they were made for me and my ilk. That was all the reason I needed. Now I watch as much as I can, and I tell myself I’m totally going to get around to that massive pile of *Supergirl* and *The Gifted *and* Cloak and Dagger* episodes that has been hanging out on my DVR for nearly a year. My heart knows better.

Nerds can’t force themselves to stop being fans of something, so, unfortunately, much like many of the actual problems facing the world, there’s no easy solution. Unless, I suppose, the mass public gets tired of superheroes and science fiction and the like and Hollywood turns away from nerd entertainment. Then we nerds would finally have a chance to catch up on everything we’ve been missing. And when we’re finally done, we could finally get back to complaining about how there’s nothing for us to see anymore.<|endoftext|>

# A Grown Man’s Love Letter to She-Ra

## A Grown Man’s Love Letter to She-Ra

### A celebration of the groundbreaking ’80s cartoon before it returns to TV

![Credit: *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power via *Netflix](<|image|>)*Credit: *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power via *Netflix*

Growing up, I had a friend, a real good guy. We used to hang out all the time, before school and after, and I remember all the crazy adventures we used to go on, although I tended to just be a spectator. One day, after we’d been pals for years, he casually mentioned that he had a sister. I was flabbergasted! He’d never mentioned her before or given any indication she existed. The next day, he brought her over, and I fell immediately in love.

That friend’s name was He-Man, and his sister was She-Ra.

Let me assure you: This is not going to be a tale of a grown man having the hots for an animated character. I was only eight when She-Ra debuted in “[The Secret of the Sword](&lt;|url|&gt;),” a special five-episode *He-Man and the Masters of the Universe* cartoon event in 1985, and then, as now, my affection went far deeper than mere beauty. The reason I loved She-Ra and why I am so excited for Netflix’s [*She-Ra and the Princesses of Power *reboot series](&lt;|url|&gt;) (premiering November 13) is because of everything she represented and the way her existence expanded my reality.

That’s an admittedly heavy load to put on a character created by toymaker Mattel and animation studio Filmation as a naked cash grab to see if they can adapt their blockbuster *He-Man* franchise to capture a female audience. Certainly, the character and the animated series is a clone of *He-Man and Masters of the Universe*, down to the way Adora raises aloft her magic sword and says, “For the honor of Grayskull!” to turn into She-Ra, just as her brother Prince Adam bellows, “By the power of Grayskull!” to turn into He-Man. The toys are different in that She-Ra action figures have hair to brush and various outfits to wear. But overall, the blueprint is the same.

This is why I and other boys my age watched the *She-Ra* cartoon as religiously as *He-Man*, despite it ostensibly being for girls, which would otherwise have been taboo in the rigidly gender-divided world of ’80s children’s entertainment. Just as He-Man fought the evil Skeletor and his minions on the planet of Eternia, so did She-Ra fight the evil Hordak and his Horde on the planet of Etheria. Just as He-Man’s pals, the Masters of the Universe, all had one defining characteristic/power/gimmick (Stratos could fly, Ram-Man rammed things, Fisto had a big metal fist, etc.), so did She-Ra’s Princesses of Power, including Mermista, Castaspella, and Netossa (I’ll let you guess those).

By using He-Man as its template and targeting a female audience, She-Ra bridged that gap. Both were action-fantasy series; the only difference is that in one, the heroes kicking evil’s collective ass were female. In a world of what were known as “girly” shows, like *Rainbow Brite *and* My Little Pony*, where characters were designed to emphasize doll-like cuteness and stories were about as complex as a Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper, She-Ra looked like she came out of *Conan the Barbarian*, even if she also solved more conflicts with friendship and love than with her sword.
> # She-Ra unknowingly lived a life of loss, was raised to inflict evil on innocent people, and then still had to attempt to overcome an overwhelming foe.

The fact that She-Ra was introduced through the *He-Man and the Masters of the Universe* cartoon made it a seamless transition, and Mattel very cannily put *She-Ra*’s villains in the *Masters of the Universe* toy line, meaning that if boys wanted to see those cool characters in action, we’d need to be watching *She-Ra* anyway. Plus, sometimes there would be other crossovers between the two shows, and He-Man would stop by Etheria to help his sister out. *He-Man *and* She-Ra* were my first introduction to the idea of a shared universe of storytelling, and it blew my little-kid mind.

What made She-Ra different — and much more fascinating than He-Man, even to me then — was that her story was much more tragic. If you don’t remember (and why would you?), Adora was Adam’s twin brother, born to the king and queen of Eternia in standard fantasy procedure. But she was kidnapped as a baby by Hordak, taken to Etheria, and raised to be evil. When she’s introduced in “The Secret of the Sword,” She-Ra is a straight-up bad guy, helping lead the occupying force that had conquered the planet and never suspecting anything wrong about her life. It’s only when He-Man brings She-Ra her predestined magic sword that she realizes her true identity and joins the rebellion to defeat Hordak.

There’s a lot of darkness in this origin story that is, of course, glossed over in the lighthearted cartoon, but it sits there in the cracks, waiting for a child’s subconscious mind to slowly process. Being stolen from her parents is a tragedy for all involved—for She-Ra and the parents who surely grieved her loss even through the present day, even if they never told Adam about her existence. And once she’s on the side of good, she joins the losing team. The Horde ruled the planet, and only a small, admittedly *Star Wars*-esque hope remains for the few who fight.

Of course, there were other popular stories about small rebellions taking on evil empires at the time, but those didn’t resonate with me the way She-Ra’s story did. I think it’s because of the contrast between She-Ra and He-Man. He-Man grew up with loving parents, Eternia was free, and all He-Man had to do was stop Skeletor’s hare-brained schemes to maintain a happy status quo. In comparison, She-Ra unknowingly lived a life of loss, was raised to inflict evil on innocent people, and then still had to attempt to overcome an overwhelming foe. And she was the *girl*!

I sincerely doubt there was a concerted decision by Filmation to have the female hero face much bigger problems than her male counterpart, just like I doubt the show was aiming to present a group of powerful, capable women as a lesson in gender equality to young boys, but both happened anyway. I thought I was just watching a He-Man spin-off, but instead I was internalizing a message that women could be as strong as men. The expected cliché would be that the female character’s power was intelligence, while the male character’s power would be brute strength. She-Ra was, in fact, smarter than He-Man, constantly finding clever ways to solve problems beyond punching something very hard. But when strength was needed, [She-Ra could carry around an entire lake](&lt;|url|&gt;) just as well as He-Man could.

With 30-plus years of hindsight, I think we can safely say that *She-Ra* did not end sexism forever, but it was a wonderful anomaly that I increasingly appreciate as I get older. That’s why I love it and is why I’m so excited about the new Netflix series (in addition to the fact that it’s made by Noelle Stevenson, the Eisner-winning creator of *Nimona*, and Dreamworks Animation, makers of the excellent and also wonderfully inclusive *Voltron* reboot). I love the idea of a new generation of kids watching She-Ra and her friends fight for freedom, goodness, and, of course, the honor of Grayskull. Interestingly enough, in *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power*, Adora finds her sword and discovers the truth on her own; He-Man is no longer involved in her transformation into the most powerful woman in the universe.

And that’s okay. She-Ra never really needed his help anyway.<|endoftext|>

# Your IoT Devices Can Be Hacked. Here’s What We Should Do About It.

## Your IoT Devices Can Be Hacked. Here’s What We Should Do About It.

### *The connected home needs a good antivirus solution*

![Source: ZDNet](<|image|>)*Source: ZDNet*

Where there is the internet, there is malware. As we start to bring connected lightbulbs, washing machines, and refrigerators into our homes, that relationship could be more dangerous than ever.

Last week, the [Silex malware](&lt;|url|&gt;) gave us a fresh glimpse into what it means for our “internet of things” (IoT) devices to become the target of a major attack, rendering them completely useless. Silex invisibly wipes the firmware on affected devices, not unlike what we saw with the [BrickerBot attack](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2017 or the Mirai botnet, which produced [record-setting denial-of-service attacks](&lt;|url|&gt;) as hundreds of thousands of connected webcams, routers, DVRs, and other devices became infected. While this may not seem like a huge deal to you now, the IoT market is [large and growing](&lt;|url|&gt;); in the future, as we come to rely on internet-connected devices for everything from our [heat](&lt;|url|&gt;) to our [showers](&lt;|url|&gt;), an attack like this could be ruinous to millions of households around the world.

We’re accustomed to our computers occasionally being infected with malware, which we can usually clean up with some antivirus software. But what do you do if the virus is in your smart lightbulbs? Or your smart thermostat? We don’t really think of these devices as being “computers,” but they use operating systems just like your iPhone or PC.

Right now, there aren’t many options for consumers like you and me. It’s time to ask why.

## **Lazy manufacturers**

Silex exploits devices running the open source Linux operating system, which the [majority](&lt;|url|&gt;) of IoT devices use. Many IoT manufacturers don’t build their own operating systems, because doing so would be expensive and time-consuming. Linux is free. It’s a no-brainer, right?

Well, not quite. The cost of “free” means manufacturers aren’t necessarily on top of their software, because they didn’t need to develop it themselves. It’s an easy solution that facilitates [seven pages](&lt;|url|&gt;) of “smart lightbulbs” on Amazon, many of which are from companies you’ve never heard of. Some manufacturers may not have the experience or money to configure Linux — or any of the associated software — correctly. Nor do they want to maintain their products long-term through regular software updates. Sometimes, they simply can’t update their hardware remotely due to poor software implementation, leaving thousands of devices vulnerable to attack.
> # Every day there’s a new connected category coming online, from fridges to stove knobs, and every device is yet another potential attack vector.

Because these devices obscure the operating system away from the user — they generally don’t have screens or keyboards, after all — it’s hard to inspect what’s going on, let alone take matters into your own hands. And while a massive company like Apple or Microsoft has a natural incentive to provide operating system updates to millions of computers around the world, it may be less clear to Generic LED Wi-Fi Lightbulb Factory why they should maintain and update the software in their particular version of Linux, assuming they even have the staff to support it in the first place.

As more of these devices come into our homes, [whether we like it or not](&lt;|url|&gt;), how will we keep tabs on their behavior? It’s time for the IoT to get an old-fashioned antivirus scanner, a firewall, or at least some way to track what’s going on behind the scenes.

I’ve always wondered: Are my lights spying on me for the manufacturer, infected with a virus, or are they innocent helpers, simply doing what they’re told? I have no idea what my smart TV sends back to Samsung, nor do I really understand what Philips Hue knows about me. I’m certainly not sure if either of these devices is secure to begin with.

## **What can we do?**

Symantec, an antivirus juggernaut, developed a physical router called the [Norton Core](&lt;|url|&gt;) that tried to solve this problem.

The router monitored connected devices and alerted users about problems or suspicious activity — but the company [discontinued](&lt;|url|&gt;) it after just months on the market due to lack of demand. (Consumers were apparently uninterested in paying a monthly subscription on top of the hardware purchase.)

The Norton Core was a good idea, too early to the market. This problem is still relatively new, and it only affects a small subset of people who have connected several devices in their homes to the internet. Even then, so few major exploits have happened — thus far — that it’s hard to justify an additional cost to protect against threats.

[Eero](&lt;|url|&gt;), the Wi-Fi startup that was acquired by Amazon in 2018, [offers basic features](&lt;|url|&gt;) that help detect suspicious activity from smart devices and even promises that it can help prevent them from joining botnets — like the one that used [millions of hacked cameras to take down websites](&lt;|url|&gt;) — but it stops short of auditing the device’s traffic or checking its vulnerability to malware.

One piece of software gives me hope, however. It’s called the [Princeton IoT Inspector](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. *It’s a free, open-source tool made by Princeton researchers that helps reveal which devices are the most “talkative” on your network: There are graphs showing whether or not a device uses encryption, contacts tracking servers, and more. It almost feels like flipping a light on in a dark room.

You can’t get alerts about suspicious activity yet, but the tool does* *help you understand if something might be amiss behind the scenes. Before this tool, you had to rely on Samsung’s word that it wasn’t tracking your every move with its TVs — but now you can actually check.

The problem, unfortunately, is that most people aren’t going to be able to use this tool because it requires expert-level networking knowledge to set up. Many don’t know that they should care in the first place. It should be dead-easy to keep an eye on our devices and ensure they’re secure, but to get there, security features need to be built into things we’re already using.

The Google Wifi router, for example, would be the perfect place to help surface suspicious activity. It’s already in [millions of homes around the world](&lt;|url|&gt;), because it’s so simple to set up and manage through a smartphone app. Adding IoT monitoring would make security accessible to people without adding an extra device or installing extra software.

Whatever the case, it’s clear that we’ll need something better soon. Every day there’s a new connected category coming online, from [fridges](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [stove knobs](&lt;|url|&gt;), and every device represents yet another potential attack vector for malware. In many sectors, it’s becoming hard to avoid the connected option — good luck getting a TV that doesn’t connect to the internet these days — making the problem all the more dire.

The only way forward is taking control of our home networks and getting more powerful tools to help us see inside what’s happening with our devices. The question, still, is who will step up to the plate and help fix the problem.<|endoftext|>

# Why the ‘Weird Internet’ of the GeoCities Era Had to Die

## Why the ‘Weird Internet’ of the GeoCities Era Had to Die

### Simple and boring rules the day — for a pretty good reason. But there are still tools out there for the experimenters.

![Credit: Teresita Chavarria/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Teresita Chavarria/Getty Images*

Ask any web developer how they first got interested in coding, and they’ll probably tell you something about hacking HTML and CSS together to build an Angelfire page, a GeoCities website, or a killer Myspace profile.

Not so long ago, websites would commonly allow users to add their own stylesheets (CSS) to make their pages look and behave exactly how they wanted. They felt way more personal than, say, your Facebook profile, which looks exactly the same as everyone else’s.

My own story in tech starts here: My earliest memories of web development were trying to get a custom font and an animated mouse cursor to show up when you visited my profile on Myspace.

![Credit: [Sherv.net](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Credit: [Sherv.net](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

I remember how thrilling it was when it worked — not just for me, but anyone that visited. CSS let me express myself fully in, well, Myspace. For many developers, figuring out how to do something cool on their Myspace page or building [a GeoCities site full of animated “under construction” GIFs](&lt;|url|&gt;) was the genesis of their tech careers.

The internet was weirder back then — full of quirky ideas, personal pages, custom blogs, and far more viable platforms to build on than we have on the streamlined web of today. I still run a personal blog on a custom website I built, but every year it feels a bit stranger, and a little rarer. Many people default to Facebook Pages or cookie-cutter Squarespace designs, if they have their own website at all.

In the last two decades, custom stylesheets have become a dying breed. There’s a trend away from customization toward the mega-platforms where most people cluster, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The largest, most popular websites are a one-size-fits-all experience, and the idea of allowing people to add custom code would be considered both risky and too complex.

Sure, you can* *still build your own website, but why bother when you can just write up a post in the iPhone’s Notes app, take a screenshot, and share it on Instagram?

But when we lose the weird internet, we don’t just lose a space where people could tinker and make things for themselves. We seem to have lost the curiosity that inspired that weirdness in the first place.
> # The internet became boring, because it was the only way to make it work for everyone.

## Make it simple, stupid

The internet was so weird and wonderful in the early 2000s because it was easy to remix. You could take a peek under the hood of a site to see what its code looks like — how the creators wired it up — then build on it for yourself.

Technically, this is still true today. Right-click this page, choose “View Page Source,” and you’ll see the code your browser uses to create what you’re reading right now. But there’s no need for most people to do so: Again, social networks have rendered this obsolete for most people. We don’t really live on a web that encourages us to explore; we live on platforms that support us.

As millions of people rapidly came online in the 2000s, websites suddenly needed to serve far more people than ever before, across multiple types of devices. Customization makes it difficult to fill that need: You might make the perfect site for desktop browsers, only to have it look like nonsense on a mobile phone.

[Facebook arrived in 2004](&lt;|url|&gt;), well [before Myspace officially died](&lt;|url|&gt;), and I remember that it was ridiculed for having no custom CSS, let alone user-customizable themes of any kind. The social network was just that big, blue navigation bar, your profile picture, and… that was it.

Many of those who had lovingly handcrafted their Myspace with custom HTML to change their fonts, and add animated GIFs and custom cursors, balked at the idea of everyone’s profile looking the same. What’s amazing, however, is that this wasn’t originally intentional, as Julia Angwin describes in her book [*Stealing Myspace](&lt;|url|&gt;).* Myspace coder Toan Nguyen “forgot to block Web markup language in user submissions. His mistake allowed users to build colorful backgrounds and load them onto their Myspaces.”

In the marketplace, it didn’t matter: Facebook won and Myspace slid into irrelevance.

The debut of the iPhone and arrival of other smartphones is another key factor in all of this. Native apps don’t allow customization with style sheets, nor do they allow people to see the code underneath and figure it out for themselves. It just works — no need to fuss with anything approaching individual personality.

Sure, the App Store spurred a new wave of ideas, beautiful interfaces, and services that hadn’t been possible before, but apps are defined by one commonality: Users are generally stuck with whatever the app developer designed for them.

Meanwhile, almost every website that still has customization features is gradually removing them. Reddit, for example, still allows customization in its communities, [but the company announced two years ago](&lt;|url|&gt;) that it would deprecate CSS support. “Giving users a blank canvas has led to many wonderful developments on Reddit,” CEO Steve Huffman wrote to the site’s moderators in 2017, but “CSS causes us to move slow.” He cited mobile support as a key factor in the decision.

## Growing up

Indeed, customization is a huge pain in the ass to maintain. If you run a site like Facebook and allow custom CSS, it’s impossible to plan for all the ways that shipping a new update might break people’s custom code.

If you simplify a user interface down to a series of blocks, however, and make them as focused on a single task as possible, it becomes much easier to maintain, update, and scale them. The fewer options or variations from that single style, the better, which is the playbook modern designers tend to follow. Simplicity also* *means these sites are more accessible, particularly to people with disabilities who might rely on a screen reader or other assistive devices online.

Security practices have come a long way, too. Allowing users to upload random code and execute it on your server seems outright insane today because it would pose deep security risks. Websites today generally run a series of “sanitizing” scripts over the text you type into simple forms to make sure you’re not trying to inject code that could exploit the site to steal data or break it entirely.

One other problem with the old, weird internet? It was often just plain broken for people, or the barrier to entry was too high — customization is great for the select few who care about coding, but tricky Angelfire and GeoCities interfaces might also have limited the number of people who could actually make websites. As technology companies became giants and it became necessary to serve millions of people, homogenous design became a crucial part of allowing more people to use and develop online services.


That’s why it sometimes feels like every app and website looks the same, no matter where you go. There are plenty of memes about how basic and boring the internet has become, after initially feeling like an infinite, wonderful canvas anyone could play with. But the internet became boring because it was the only way to make it work for everyone.

## Can we get it back?

The only real option in 2019 of customizing anything is to build a website of your own. But the barrier to entry can feel impossibly high, or pointless, when you can make an Instagram profile in just a few seconds.

Building something yourself leads to intimidating choices: Which CMS should I use? What JavaScript framework is right for me, React or Vue? How do I install those? What’s a CSS compiler, and why do I need one? You’d be forgiven for giving up and signing up for Behance.

The age of poking at a piece of code, figuring it out, and hacking a working site together in Frontpage or Dreamweaver feels distant, but there’s some hope for a weird, creative internet today. One example of this is [Glitch](&lt;|url|&gt;), a tool that touts itself as the “friendly community where everyone builds the web.”

The platform is designed to help people experiment again, and dramatically lower the barrier to entry. Want to build a page that emulates a magic eight ball? [Go nuts!](&lt;|url|&gt;) How about a tool that lets you start a drawing and have an A.I. finish it off? [Yup.](&lt;|url|&gt;)

By making it easy to get inspired by others, remix the code, and build something yourself — without having to fuss with overly complicated script — Glitch has carved out a space for itself where that old internet feeling is thriving.

If websites aren’t going to allow us to customize them, perhaps spaces like Glitch become the playgrounds that encourage internet creativity instead. Other tools like Webflow make the process of building a website a drag-and-drop experience, and the emergence of markup languages like [MDX](&lt;|url|&gt;) are encouraging developers to mash up code and prose like it’s 1999.

The weird internet thrived because an entire generation of developers and designers learned to remix things, look under the hood, and experiment for themselves. Without that culture, will the future developers growing up today ever feel empowered to experiment?

The internet made it possible to build something out of thin air without millions of dollars in funding. It’s important we don’t forget that, because it’s the best way to learn and evolve.

Tools like Glitch are a chance to change the trend away from monolithic platforms, back to a simpler time, where if you wanted a button that [spewed out confetti on your blog](&lt;|url|&gt;), you could have it — if you just figured out to build it.<|endoftext|>

# 8 Reasons Why Apple Won’t Buy Netflix

## 8 Reasons Why Apple Won’t Buy Netflix

### *It has the cash, and Netflix has the audience. But the idea is still rotten.*

![Photo by [freestocks.org](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [freestocks.org](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Did you catch the latest episode of *Analysts Say the Craziest Stuff*? It’s a one-off where JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee [spins a fantastic tale](&lt;|url|&gt;) about how Apple could buy Netflix to instantly become a content leader.

The premise is based on Chatterjee’s belief that Netflix’s existing leadership position in engagement and original content could vault Apple to the top of the streaming heap.

It’s a compelling idea at first blush, and in fairness to Chatterjee, it’s just conjecture — there isn’t even the whiff of a legit rumor here. Still, there’s no reason to believe it would happen anytime soon. Here are eight reasons why.

### **Episode 1: *The Young and the Restless***

The streaming industry is experiencing [unprecedented growth](&lt;|url|&gt;), with many new players entering the field. Apple, which is developing its own streaming content, is entering crowded turf with a significantly lower spend than Netflix ([$1 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) versus [$8 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;)), but it’s simply too early for such a major consolidation.

A look at the early days of the film industry offers some perspective. At the turn of the 20th century, there were more than a [dozen tiny film studios](&lt;|url|&gt;) cranking out shorts. [Charlie Chaplin](&lt;|url|&gt;) famously hopped from one to another until he finally started his own studio, [United Artists](&lt;|url|&gt;). The consolidation of the film industry didn’t get going in earnest [until the mid-1930s](&lt;|url|&gt;), and then continued over [the next few decades](&lt;|url|&gt;), partially in response to [antitrust cases](&lt;|url|&gt;) that prevented studios from owning theaters. If they couldn’t own the whole distribution channel, studios figured they may as well gobble up smaller companies that were struggling anyway.

### **Episode 2: *A New Toy***

With a handful of home-grown shows (*Planet of the Apps*, *Carpool Karaoke*), Apple’s just getting started in the original content game. It has well over a [dozen scripted projects in production](&lt;|url|&gt;) and is finally starting to [buy up original films](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Buying Netflix would give Apple a ready-made production arm but little understanding of how it all works. At the very least, Apple would demand a much deeper understanding of Netflix’s metrics before a purchase, and not everyone [believes the few numbers](&lt;|url|&gt;) Netflix has released so far. Apple would probably like to learn more through its own streaming efforts first — and whatever it has gleaned from *Carpool Karaoke* definitely isn’t enough.

### **Episode 3: *The Prude***

Apple’s plan for original content revolves around family-friendly fare. It has reportedly already [axed one completed series](&lt;|url|&gt;) over concerns about racy content. Though Apple has no problem hosting more adult fare produced by other studios in its iTunes movie library, it probably wouldn’t slap its brand on something like *Orange Is the New Black*, which included its share of explicit sex scenes, or even Netflix’s occasionally ultraviolent *Daredevil*.

### **Episode 4: *The Price Is Too Damn High***

Apple has been steadily working toward a cash-neutral position for more than a year, [shedding over $100 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the process. That leaves Apple with [$130 billion in cash](&lt;|url|&gt;) based on its last earnings report. Yes, Apple would like to unload it, and yes, acquiring other companies is a perfect way to do it. But Apple might have to spend all that money and more to acquire Netflix. Spending all that cash in one place, or even a significant portion of it, simply isn’t very Apple-like.
> # There is zero indication that Netflix wants anyone, let alone Apple, to acquire it.

### **Episode 5: *Too Big for My Tastes***

Aside from the $3 billion Beats acquisition, which gave Apple the trifecta of hardware, a subscription service, and access to major artists through music moguls Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, Apple doesn’t trade in giant, big-name-brand companies. In general, Apple likes to quietly acquire smaller firms for [high-value tech integration](&lt;|url|&gt;). Apple rarely acknowledges the transaction until well after the fact. A monumental Netflix acquisition doesn’t fit its profile.

### **Episode 6: *Just Say No***

There is zero indication that Netflix wants anyone, let alone Apple, to acquire it. Though Netflix CEO Reed Hastings [was busy selling off shares](&lt;|url|&gt;) just a couple years ago, which could be construed as a sign that Hastings had concerns about future company performance, he was really just cashing in on the company’s skyrocketing share price.

Netflix’s incredible viewership numbers (something it [only recently started sharing](&lt;|url|&gt;)) and its near industry-leading number of [Oscar nominations](&lt;|url|&gt;) make it even less likely that the company is hunting for a new parent.

### **Episode 7: *Too Close***

With Netflix on Apple TV hardware, the two companies already have a manufacturer/partner relationship. Apple buying up Netflix could set off some antitrust alarm bells, as Apple would own everything from content creation to distribution to hardware. Granted, Amazon gets away with it through Amazon Studios, but that grew organically out of Amazon Prime Video. On the other hand, if Apple does make a move on Netflix, the entire industry might find itself under new scrutiny.

### **Episode 8: *The Price of Eyeballs***

If Apple buys Netflix, it’s not getting some monster studio like Warner Brothers, Sony’s Columbia Pictures, or 21st Century Fox. Netflix isn’t a traditional studio: It’s a producer and distributor, working with or contracting independent studios and filmmakers to produce original content for the streaming service. What Apple would be getting for all those billions of dollars is ultimately a subscriber base of 139 million people. That’s a lot of people, but the value to Apple is questionable.

I finished the series binge in an afternoon and came away convinced: Chatterjee’s little tale won’t be winning any awards, but *8 Reasons Why Apple Won’t Buy Netflix*? It’s Oscar-worthy.<|endoftext|>

# How Tech Helped Create a New Erectile Dysfunction Crisis

## How Tech Helped Create a New Erectile Dysfunction Crisis

### Startups are exploiting the market Viagra created, but experts are wary

![Photo: BSIP/UIG/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: BSIP/UIG/Getty*

In 1998, Pfizer [hired ](&lt;|url|&gt;)Bob Dole to be a spokesperson for Viagra. The former senator and presidential candidate epitomized the target audience for the new erectile dysfunction (ED) medication: A 75-year-old prostate cancer survivor, Dole’s erectile struggles were brought on by advanced age and ill health. In [a commercial for Pfizer](&lt;|url|&gt;), he notes that conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and prostate surgery can also result in erectile issues, solidifying the public image of ED as a problem primarily faced by the elderly and the infirm.

But lately, that long-standing image of erectile dysfunction is starting to change. According to the website for [SKYN Arise](&lt;|url|&gt;), a brand-new telemedicine website backed by the condom brand Lifestyles, “40% of men experience erectile dysfunction symptoms by age 40.” [Hims](&lt;|url|&gt;), one of the best-known names in ED telemedicine, has made similar claims about the rates of erectile woes among young people; a third site, Roman, [pegs the ED rate among the under-40 set at 26%](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s a stark change from the era of Bob Dole — and in conjunction with sensational headlines about [sex recessions](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [porn-induced erectile dysfunction](&lt;|url|&gt;), these marketing claims can make it seem like we’re experiencing an epidemic of young men with malfunctioning dicks.

The truth, however, is a bit more complicated than that. For starters, the ED these new startups are talking about is a little bit different from the condition Bob Dole raised awareness about back in the 1990s. “ED is a spectrum disorder,” says Erika Jensen, founder and CEO of [Giddy](&lt;|url|&gt;), the company behind an eponymous new wearable device that advertises itself as a non-prescription alternative to medications like Viagra and Cialis. A horseshoe-shaped piece of plastic, Giddy is basically a modified cock ring: It strategically applies pressure to the penis with the goal of enhancing blood flow, while leaving the urethra unencumbered.

As Jensen sees it, the ED we associate with men like Bob Dole is just one end of the spectrum. In younger men, the condition looks a little different. Those erectile disappointments that are often attributed to stress, exhaustion, or alcohol? Jensen sees them as a low-level form of ED — a definition that sites like Hims, Roman, and SKYN Arise seem perfectly happy to endorse.
> # “It’s the reverse of abstinence: It is 100%, all the time, your penis must work, and if it doesn’t, it’s broken.”

Sexual health professionals aren’t necessarily excited about this expanding notion of what is, and isn’t, ED. David Ley, a clinical psychologist and sex therapist who routinely works with men who are unhappy with their erections, dislikes the way words like “disorder” and “dysfunction” are now used to describe a wide range of erectile function. “It’s the reverse of abstinence: It is 100%, all the time, your penis must work, and if it doesn’t, it’s broken,” says Ley, who feels that this language can pathologize what is, ultimately, normal penis functioning.

It’s not hard to see why companies that sell pills might be eager to embrace it, too. As telemedicine platforms have become more robust, and generic alternatives to Viagra have enabled providers to offer relatively cheap medications, a lucrative business opportunity has opened up. It’s now possible to easily provide ED medications to men who are too ashamed to talk to their primary care physicians about their sexual issues, or anxious about picking up Viagra at their local pharmacy. And it’s far more profitable to promote an expanded definition of ED and capitalize on the insecurities of young men who assume they should be able to get an erection on command — especially if you can get those young men to commit to a monthly subscription package for the rest of their lives.

But there are quite a few problems with this business plan, at least on the consumer side. ED medications are “a quick Band-Aid that may actually get in the way of helping individuals and couples address more systemic issues,” says Ley. Men whose erectile difficulties are due to anxiety or relationship issues may be able to “fix” their lack of erection by popping a pill — but the underlying problems will remain unresolved. In some cases, relying on medication to get an erection can even create a cycle of dependence, increasing the anxiety that users feel and making it even harder for them to perform sexually without chemical assistance. And then, of course, there are serious side effects that come with overuse of these medications, including the potential for permanently losing erectile function.
> # It’s far more profitable to promote an expanded definition of ED and capitalize on the insecurities of young men who assume they should be able to get an erection on command.

Giddy, at least, is trying to offer an alternative to the medication route, using this broad definition of ED to spark a conversation about what healthy sexuality looks like, rather than further stigmatizing flaccid penises and presenting medication as the only reasonable option. When customers purchase a Giddy ring, they’re also given access to a 30-day regimen designed by a team of sexual health professionals, including ED specialist Dr. Chris Kyle and certified sexologist Shan Boodram. During the course of those 30 days, customers are given a comprehensive understanding of the many mental and physical factors that can contribute to ED, and they’re guided through an exercise program that can help improve their stamina and ability to get and maintain an erection.

They’re also encouraged to think about their sexuality more expansively, developing an understanding of sex and intimacy that encompasses more than just an erect penis and penetrative sex. It’s an ED treatment that rarely seems to enter the mainstream conversation but is highly endorsed by sex therapists. (Ley notes that his work with men who are struggling with erections often begins with the line, “Welcome to the world of sex that doesn’t involve your erection.”)

There’s no question that sexual performance is a sensitive and uncomfortable topic for many of us, and that reducing the stigma around something like ED is an important part of creating a healthy conversation around sex and sexuality. But a conversation that pathologizes a routine and normal part of having a penis, or that positions a medication with potentially dangerous side effects as the sole solution to a disappointing erection, is one that sets a dangerous precedent. Our sexual wellness products need to be defined by our actual sexual health needs. And those needs, along with the idea of healthy sexuality, shouldn’t be shaped by companies out to make a quick buck.<|endoftext|>

# The Personal Newsletter Fad Needs to End

## I know it feels nice to write about you. But really, it’s just another bloody thing to read.

![Illustration: [César Pelizer](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [César Pelizer](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

If 2018 was the year of the personal newsletter, it would explain why 2019 is the year of inboxes crammed with newsletters we just don’t have time to read and can’t bring ourselves to unsubscribe to. Sure, 2018 arguably perpetrated worse crimes against human sanity — children trolled for not wanting to be shot at school, families separated at the border, wildfires soundtracked by further denial of the climate emergency — but still, I’m reserving a small space for newsletter resentment. Here’s why.

### **I now feel guilty for not doing a newsletter**

Many writers I admire started knocking politely on the door of my inbox last year, offering monthly or even weekly updates on their lives, reading habits, and travel jaunts. I started wondering, *Am I supposed to be doing a newsletter? Am I even a writer without one? *(Spoiler: yes.)* Am I supposed to be “building my brand” in this same way, creating weekly or monthly hype around myself as a walking, talking product?*

I abandoned the idea quickly. I don’t want to work on marketing material for anyone, especially myself. I’m already [cancanning for preorders](&lt;|url|&gt;) on a book that’s not even finished yet. The idea of adding more marketing to the general product “ME” makes me want to take a nap.

### **No one needs more shit to read**

Perhaps we’re good on the stuff-to-read front? Is anyone thirsty for reading material these days? I have subscriptions to various news outlets, which I have to read because if an alien landed and said, “What the hell is going on here?” journalists are the people who would be expected to provide some semblance of an answer.

I’ve been surgically glued to Twitter for a decade, another literary magazine I subscribed to in a fit of fanciness just landed on the doormat, and let’s not even talk about the to-be-read Jenga pile of books by my bed. Surely you’re in the same boat? I cannot picture sending out a personal newsletter and getting the response, “FINALLY, something to read! Thank God. I’ve been humming the ABCs just to stay current.”
> # I already update people on my life via Twitter. If you follow me, you already have an excellent idea of what I’m doing, writing, reading, thinking, and the [ridiculous stuff my husband says](&lt;|url|&gt;).

### **Sorry guys, but it feels a bit vain**

Obviously I would never describe the average journalist’s ego as, well, itty-bitty. Our job is basically: “Hello, I’m going to talk at you for 800 to 1,500 words now, and though you can leave a response, it will be in a tiny box, a long way below my massive chunk of chat, and I may or may not even see it, byeeee.”

But a big ego doesn’t necessarily equal high self-esteem, and I’m pretty sure that unless you already love me, the news that I was awarded a writing residency is boring — or worse, inspires a kind of envy I’m entirely uninterested in spreading: that nagging concern, *Why haven’t I done a writing residency? Am I even a writer without one? *(Spoiler: yes.)

I already update people on my life via Twitter. If you follow me, you already have an excellent idea of what I’m doing, writing, reading, thinking, and the [ridiculous stuff my husband says](&lt;|url|&gt;). You are already getting daily updates (half-hourly if I’m angry on a train). To add to that by also showing up in people’s inboxes with 30 tweets worth of stuff about me, me, me — that takes a level of self-confidence that, frankly, brings me right back to envy.

### **It’s making money for someone else with my hard work. Again.**

I suspect the personal newsletter has caught on among writers because something about it feels like Work. Maybe I’m not writing an article, or pitching ideas, or editing my book, or coming up with the next one before my agent has to bug me for it — but by telling the LinkedIn contacts I’ve presumptuously subscribed to my newsletter that I read a great *New Yorker* article, I am* *building my brand.

Today I saw a T-shirt for sale sporting the words “Never off-duty.” It’s the T-shirt of our times. In an [essay for Buzzfeed](&lt;|url|&gt;), Anne Helen Petersen wrote, “Why am I burned out? Because I’ve internalized the idea that I should be working all the time.” Being busy has become so glorified, particularly in a generation for whom working for free was normalized early, that we’re fish in a barrel for some startup who wants to make money off us sending newsletters. I sit here debating the merits of sliding into your inbox as if I’m any more than a user figure to show their shareholders.

Almost a decade into my career, I am basically an unpaid vanity intern for MailChimp.

So if 2018 was the year of the personal newsletter, and 2019 is the year of our inboxes being crammed, maybe 2020 can be the year we quietly abandon the trend, safe in the knowledge we are still writers without it.<|endoftext|>

# Meet the People With the AOL Email Addresses

## It’s not just Mike Pence and your grandma — a lot of people still use AOL and EarthLink, and pay for the privilege

![Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty*

“A lot of people don’t even realize AOL is still a thing,” says Catherine Russell, a 32-year-old production manager based in Washington, D.C. She still uses the original AOL email address she created when she was 12 — a mere 20 years ago.

Russell was eventually shamed into creating a Gmail account. She was working on the set of an indie film in 2006 when a crew member mocked her for using AOL. “He made some disparaging remark about that being archaic,” she says. “After that I got a Gmail account to use for job applications and professional communications.”

At its peak around 2000, AOL boasted more than [23 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) subscribers across the U.S., while its competitor EarthLink had around [3 million](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. *Most paid around [$20 per month](&lt;|url|&gt;) for email and dial-up. While a few companies deployed free email services in the late 1990s, it wasn’t until 2004 that Google launched free email with what was then an unfathomable one GB of online storage. It offered a radical alternative for users who’d constantly had to delete messages in overflowing inboxes. Two years later, AOL [offered its own free version](&lt;|url|&gt;) of email supported by advertising — but it was too little, too late. By 2012, Gmail had 425 million active users, while AOL’s[ subscriber base had dwindled to 3.5 million](&lt;|url|&gt;).

But despite the rise of broadband and free email, both AOL and EarthLink have somehow managed to survive. It’s difficult to get up-to-date figures, since the two entities are now subsidiaries and barely register as a blip on their parent companies’ balance sheets. Neither company would disclose its current number of monthly subscribers, but as of 2014, more than [2.1 million people still used AOL dial-up](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # “The only real downside of having an AOL address now is the snickering from millennials who routinely assume that Grandpa is too dumb to use Gmail.”

John Levine, a consultant and the author of *Internet for Dummies*, pointed to AOL’s [2014 annual filing](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the last year it broke out email separately — which reported $600 million revenue from its email services in 2014 and said it expected a $50 million decline each year. Based on that estimation, the company would still have made $400 million from email and dial-up in 2018. He said that even before Verizon acquired it in 2015, AOL provided the SEC “no clarity at all [about] how many were using the dial-up service and how many just didn’t realize they could get their account for free.”

So who are these monthly [subscribers](&lt;|url|&gt;)? And how many of those who signed up 20 years ago simply don’t realize they are [paying ](&lt;|url|&gt;)actual money for a service they could find for free elsewhere?

Many people were embarrassed to talk about how they’ve ended up paying for an email service they aren’t using. Julia, who asked to omit her last name to protect her mother’s privacy, says the family used AOL in the 1990s, but switched to Comcast in 2003 when they moved to a new home. It wasn’t until 2018 that Julia’s mom noticed the payments to AOL on her bank statement. “My mom doesn’t use auto-payments for anything normally,” says Julia. “She writes checks and keeps track of everything through her checkbook, so it was flying under her radar.”

The revelation was troubling for Julia’s mother, who told her daughter it made her feel worthless and incompetent: “She was really upset with the idea that she wouldn’t be able to make it in the world without a more tech-savvy young person looking out for her and fixing her mistakes.”

In many ways, AOL and its competitors were precursors to the subscription economy now embraced by everyone from Apple to *Medium*, the website you’re now reading. Sharad Mohan, CEO of the fitness software startup Trainerize, has spent most of his career working in the tech sector. He says that while companies like AOL have a legal right to continue charging customers signed up for their services, it’s nonetheless unethical. “What they’re doing right now is kind of keeping it as a cash cow,” says Mohan.“There’s really no cost for them to keep that part of the business up and running. But we’re subscribing to so many things that cost between $5 and $50 a month. Even myself, I don’t check every single transaction every single month. The onus is on companies to take some responsibility for being transparent.”

AOL’s current owner, Verizon Media, did not respond to *OneZero*’s requests for comment.

Yet there are those who have actively chosen to continue paying for their old legacy email accounts — however baffling it may be to the rest of the world. Sean Chandler was a middle schooler when he set up his family’s AOL account in the mid-90s. More than two decades later, he discovered that his mom, Jane, was still paying $7 per month for AOL email — and not because she is clueless about technology. “She’s aware she’s been paying for it for 20 years while not really using it. She’s aware that her children are kind of confused by this,” he says. “I just don’t know why she’s still using it.”

For her part, Jane Chandler says she uses her work email for personal correspondence and the AOL email as a junk account. “It’s pure laziness,” she says. “I’d be smart to get a free account. One of these days I will get my act together and probably move over, but I haven’t yet.”

Nick Garrison, a 37-year-old working in public relations for a tech company, pays for ad-free Yahoo email. “At some point I started paying $20 per year so that my sent mail would not have ads tacked at the bottom,” he said. “I continue to pay this ridiculous fee nearly 20 years later because I do not want to get rid of my Yahoo account… Many of my friends and contacts continue to email my Yahoo address and I feel oddly attached to it.” Contacts aren’t the only reason people hold on to old email addresses — keeping the archive of old emails is also a factor.
> # “I’ve always been pretty particular in my tastes, and this is one I feel super strongly about.”

Security is also a motivation for some; paid-for email services like ProtonMail, Hushmail, Tutanota, and Mailfence all offer encryption. Growth consultant Stafford Palmier left Gmail after learning that Google scanned users’ emails to provide targeted advertising and [gave third parties access](&lt;|url|&gt;) to messages. “This made me and many others gravely concerned, and so we were willing to give up personalization and integration for privacy and security,” she says.

There are even some diehard fans of AOL. Administrative assistant Anna Johnson chooses to pay for AOL’s desktop email service because she prefers it to alternatives like Gmail, which she has a particular antipathy toward. “I’m a proud (barely) millennial AOL user who only slightly less proudly pays for it,” says Johnson, who created her screen name in 1999 when she was 17. “I’ve always been pretty particular in my tastes, and this is one I feel super strongly about. I love, love, love the AOL desktop program.” She does, however, let other people assume she’s using the free version. “It’s hard to try to explain,” she concedes.

Mike Rubin, a retired attorney who has worked at Apple and a semiconductor company, wants to challenge the trope of AOL users as technology fumblers. “I continue to use AOL in part because it reminds me that I was an early Internet user,” he says. “I joined AOL in the late ’80s.”

Rubin insists that AOL has been reliable over the years and works just as well as Gmail. “The only real downside of having an AOL address now is the snickering from millennials who routinely assume that Grandpa is too dumb to use Gmail,” says Rubin, who uses AOL’s free version. “I love telling the younger folks that I was running CP/M OS and applications on modified Atari computers when I first got my AOL address, at a time when they were still crapping their diapers.”<|endoftext|>

# Does the Apple Watch Make You Healthier?

## Medical ethicists worry that the burgeoning ability to monitor health data at home will widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots

![Photo by [rawpixel](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [rawpixel](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Beth Stamps, a home health nurse in Fayetteville, North Carolina, was visiting a patient on January 10 when her heart began pounding. “It felt like my heart was pumping twice as fast, as if I was running a marathon,” she says. “I was terrified.”

Stamps looked at her Apple Watch, which can track a user’s heart rate. It alerted her that her heart was beating 177 times a minute, nearly double a [normal resting heart rate](&lt;|url|&gt;). An app on the watch warned her to contact a doctor. Stamps called 911 and was raced to the emergency room, where she says she was treated for supraventricular tachycardia, an abnormally fast heart rhythm. “Ever since then, I’ve made sure to check my heart rate on the watch every day,” she says.

Stamps’ experience could become increasingly common as more people are able to track changes in their bodies without the help of a medical professional. The Apple Watch 4, released in 2018, includes an ECG feature for monitoring abnormal heart rhythm. It’s just one of a growing number of smart devices that allow people to monitor their health at home. The connected medical device market, which includes gadgets that monitor health through wireless sensors and mobile apps, is expected to show “significant growth,” according to a [2019 study](&lt;|url|&gt;).

The health companies behind some of these gadgets are preparing devices that will be able to do much more than basic heart rate readings. An Israeli company called Health.io recently received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a test that allows people at risk of kidney disease — like those with heart disease or diabetes — to use their smartphones to test their urine for kidney damage. The testing kit uses disposable strips in conjunction with a smartphone camera to read and interpret results.

Another device is the [Butterfly iQ](&lt;|url|&gt;), which is billed as the first handheld whole-body ultrasound system. The product has FDA approval and will soon be marketed to physicians as a way to monitor people with chronic conditions, like a child with cystic fibrosis who needs regular ultrasound scans. The company is also testing the Butterfly iQ for consumer use without physician oversight, though the FDA hasn’t yet given approval.

While home health gadgets may potentially save lives, they come with high price tags and concerns about privacy and accuracy. The Apple Watch 4, for example, starts at about $400, plus the price of an iPhone and phone plan. The Butterfly iQ is expected to cost just under $2,000. Some observers warn that the increase in pricey home medical technologies could widen an already yawning health gap between the rich and the poor.

“Inequity is a big issue,” says Arthur L. Caplan, PhD, founding director of the Division of Medical Ethics at the NYU School of Medicine. “Not everyone will have access to the technology, and if it’s expensive, maybe the prices will come down, but there is no reason to think they will. The rich and the middle class will be monitored, and the poor will not.”
> # “What if the richest 10 percent end up going to the doctor before other people?”

Craig Konnoth, a professor at the University of Colorado who studies law and medicine, says wealthier people could even end up healthier than the general public if they get treated for medical conditions sooner than they otherwise would. “What if the richest 10 percent end up going to the doctor before other people?” he says. The wealthiest one-fifth of Americans received 43 percent [more health care](&lt;|url|&gt;) than other Americans in 2012.

There is also the question of accuracy. “We don’t have standards set up for them,” Caplan says. “It’s one thing that my Fitbit is off if I’m walking, but it’s another thing if it’s a device that’s monitoring critical health information. We need to know how precise and accurate these gadgets must be in order to be cleared as medical devices and not just as recreational or amusing things that are optional.”

Suzanne Steinbaum, DO, director of women’s cardiovascular prevention, health, and wellness at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, says she’s already seen several patients who sought medical care for previously undiagnosed heart problems thanks to an alert by an Apple Watch or a similar device. “In general, I think these are a great idea,” she says.

Like many experts, however, Steinbaum cautions that there are downsides to self-monitoring gadgets. Even if the information gathered by home monitoring devices is accurate, it’s not always necessary. Steinbaum recalls one woman who was rushed to her care based on Apple Watch results. “I looked at [the watch] and was able to tell her that it was a normal rhythm,” Steinbaum says.

“We need to bridge the gap between patient data and physicians in order to use the information in a way that patients can understand and not complicate the conversation or cause anxiety when they think they have a disease that’s not really there,” she says.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The company’s website [includes a disclaimer](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the Apple Watch cannot detect some medical conditions, including heart attacks.

Taking biometric readings out of the doctor’s office inevitably puts the onus on untrained people to know what to do when they’re alerted to an abnormality. Unsurprisingly, they often don’t know what to make of abnormalities, and this can lead to false alarms and undue concern. “We are in the infancy of understanding what the utility of these devices is when we take them out of the hospital,” says Joseph Kvedar, MD, vice president for connected health at Partners HealthCare in Boston. “It’s a very exciting and growing field, but the technologies are variable in their accuracy and in their usability.”
> # “It’s one thing that my Fitbit is off if I’m walking, but it’s another thing if it’s a device that’s monitoring critical health information.”

Even if people don’t want to buy health monitors or can’t afford them, they may still be given incentives to use them. Some employers and health insurers, such as [Medica and UnitedHealthcare](&lt;|url|&gt;), are providing financial benefits to people who track their movement using health monitoring devices like the Fitbit and the Apple Watch.

That might seem like a gift, but rewarding people for using health monitors raises ethical issues, says Kayte Spector-Bagdady, a professor and medical ethicist at the University of Michigan. “There’s always a debate between incentivizing behavior and penalizing misbehavior,” she says. “It’s one thing if [companies] are going to charge you 10 percent more if you don’t wear your Fitbit. If the single mom feels she can’t afford health insurance if she doesn’t wear her Fitbit, then that’s extraordinarily coercive, and I think that should be protected against.”

As the *Washington Post* [reported](&lt;|url|&gt;) in February, some people’s wearable data can be sent straight to their bosses. Employees at Regal Plastics in Texas wear digital fitness trackers to increase employee exercise levels, the *Post* reports. The trackers measure daily movements and send that information via Regal Plastics’ UnitedHealth Group insurance account to an app on their manager’s phone.

As more consumers adopt home medical monitoring devices, they will be generating more health data, just as the omnipresence of smartphones has generated data about what we’re doing and where we’re going — data that tech firms have eagerly tapped. If we’re worried about private companies monetizing data about our internet usage, the growing availability of personal health information harvested by monitoring devices is even more alarming. People who use health tracking gadgets may not read privacy agreements that govern what information they are sharing, says Konnoth, who argues that there should be more transparency about exactly what kind of data the devices are collecting. Even people who share their data from health monitoring devices only with their doctor may be giving out more information than they realize. “It’s essential that patients know how their data is being used,” he says.

In the future, if information from health gadgets is beamed directly to health providers, it may be impossible for users to avoid sharing personal information about their health and behaviors with their physicians — whether they want to or not. “It opens up whole new world of getting nagged by doctors,” Caplan says. In a worst-case scenario, doctors could decide to drop patients who they see are not following their instructions, he says. “They might say, ‘I can see from your record you are noncompliant.’”

For Stamps, at least, any privacy and cost concerns about her Apple Watch are outweighed by her gratitude that the device was there when she needed it. “It’s expensive but absolutely worth it,” she says. “You are talking about something that could potentially save your life.”<|endoftext|>

# Why You Need to ‘KonMari’ Your Nerd Life

## Why You Need to ‘KonMari’ Your Nerd Life

### *Pare down your *Star Wars *and *Batman *collections — and free yourself from obsession*

![Photo: Don Emmert/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Don Emmert/Getty Images*

Even if your news feeds are limited to Marvel superhero news and *Star Wars* movies, chances are you’ve heard the name [Marie Kondo](&lt;|url|&gt;). She’s the famous organization expert whose “KonMari” philosophy is simple but profound: Get rid of everything you own that doesn’t bring you joy. This is a lesson many nerds need to learn, because few people have more stuff — or need more help learning how to get rid of it.

This is where I come in.

Being a fan of something can mean obsession, and that [obsession frequently takes the form of collecting](&lt;|url|&gt;). It certainly has for me. It’s a way to physically demonstrate our fandom of something, and it can take many forms. You may want every comic that stars a favorite character, every action figure from a certain toy line, every piece of ancillary media tied into a major motion picture franchise. And the more things you love (and the more you love these things) the more space it all takes up — not just in your home, but in your life, too.

Yes, there’s a genuine high when you finally get your hands on an item you’ve long been searching for, whether it’s a hard-to-find action figure, a long-forgotten comic book, whatever. There’s also a feeling of satisfaction when you complete your collection — a pride in the time and effort (and money) you’ve spent to successfully achieve a goal. This is happiness, but it is momentary and finite. Because after that, you just have a house full of *Star Wars* toys you don’t know what to do with.

Eventually, you may have more than you can display. Maybe it’s an extra box of old video games in the closet, or perhaps you have so many comics strewn across your house you can’t find your car keys, the bills you need to pay, or the cat. I’ve even seen some people pay for storage units specifically to house the merchandise they buy.
> # Collections can almost never be completed. You’ll purchase another edition of Luke Skywalker in X-Wing Pilot Gear every few years.

What enjoyment do these hidden things bring you? None. You don’t see them — you can’t see them. You may believe that you’ll drag out that old video game console or rewatch that old *Farscape: The Complete TV Series* box set, but if you’ve got it in some form of storage, that means it’s less important to you than everything you have out. And if you decide to get nostalgic, you will inevitably choose to rewatch/replay/re-whatever the things you haven’t hidden away. Get rid of the rest.

If you cringe at the idea of getting rid of anything, well, 1) this is exactly why you need to KonMari yourself, but 2) there’s an insidious truth most collectors refuse to acknowledge: Collections can almost never be completed. Are you a collector of Hasbro’s *Star Wars* action figures? They’re going to be making them for decades more, and you’ll purchase another edition of Luke Skywalker in X-Wing pilot gear every few years. Been buying *Batman* comics since you were a kid? DC Comics will be publishing them long after you’re dead. Even if you tend to stick to media whose stories have finite endings, you’re always going to find a new series of some kind to obsess over and purchase.

The idea that collections cannot be completed may sound harsh, but it can actually be quite freeing. I mean, if you’ll never be truly finished, if your task is impossible, then why force yourself to collect everything? A (frequently expensive) weight has been lifted off of your shoulders! You no longer need to buy every toy or comic or whatever for the sake of the collection. You can be selective, and buy what you will actually enjoy.

Unfortunately, that can be a very tough thing for a collector to figure out, not only because of the confusion between the momentary thrill of acquiring something and genuine, ongoing enjoyment, but because it’s far too easy to prioritize the collection over the self. You might assume everything that increases the collection makes you happy, but that’s not at all necessarily true.
> # Try to imagine the point of having, say,* Captain America* issues #373–378, where Cap gets addicted to meth

Say you own the last 40 years of every single issue of *Captain America* comics. You do not love every *Captain America* comic equally, of course. There are some storylines you really love, and some you think are garbage. But to you, the comics are not individual stories: They’re a single entity. You love Captain America, so you collect his comics, and that means you often knowingly buy terrible issues of *Captain America*. It’s not about quality, and it’s not about buying what you enjoy — it’s about the quantity and the collection.

Try to imagine the point of having, say, *Captain America* issues #373–378, where [Cap gets addicted to meth](&lt;|url|&gt;). What’s the point of keeping them? You’re never going to read that story again, nor should you. These comics are garbage. Honestly, they might even diminish your love of the character, in a way. Wouldn’t the gestalt value of *Captain America* comics improve slightly if that storyline had never happened? In terms of your own fandom, you can make it come true!

This is Kondo’s philosophy at its simplest: Figure out what brings you joy. Just because you’re a collector of something doesn’t mean you have to collect everything. There’s no law that says you must have a complete set. Likewise, just because something’s part of your collection doesn’t mean you actually enjoy it. You’re not less of a fan if you purge the stuff you think is crap.

I don’t expect this to be easy. If you’re a collector, the idea of getting rid of anything feels ridiculous, and the more a fan you are of something, the more you’re going to be compelled to keep anything that has the logo on it. It’s like owning the worst parts of the franchise is a merit badge to prove just how big a fan you are, and how much affection you have for whatever you’re collecting. But that’s not affection, that’s allegiance. What you love are the parts that bring you joy, and that’s what you need to keep. Everything else is just taking up space.<|endoftext|>

# There’s Nothing New at CES 2019

## There’s Nothing New at CES 2019

### *Welcome to the off year*

![All photos: Lance Ulanoff.](<|image|>)*All photos: Lance Ulanoff.*

There’s a question I always ask vendors at CES, the sprawling tech expo now underway in Las Vegas: Is this new?

Increasingly, the answer is no. The product has been shipping, in some form or other, for a few months or even years. I’ve long ago given up any hope of spotting a unicorn here — the life-changing product everyone will be talking about. The big companies are now focused on introducing initiatives and projects that will help define future products instead of actual products themselves.
> # CES 2019 is like an entertaining Broadway musical that lacks a hit song.

Still, I can usually count on smaller discoveries — a handful of products that everyone agrees were the most important introductions of the week. But even that consensus is hard to find this year. CES 2019 is like an entertaining Broadway musical that lacks a hit song. I can’t think of a single gadget anyone has talked about for more than a few hours before moving onto the next thing.

![](<|image|>)

What we have here is CES in an off year. In Intel’s “[tick-tock](&lt;|url|&gt;)” development model, this would be known as a tock year. A bigger year, a “tick,” introduces fundamental processor changes while the “tock” year sees only the implementation of those changes.

For example, there’s that insane and adorable [stuffed cat’s tail, Qoobo](&lt;|url|&gt;). After years of development, it’s finally shipping. But [it’s not new](&lt;|url|&gt;)!

There’s a new [smart lock](&lt;|url|&gt;). And [there’s another](&lt;|url|&gt;). And [another](&lt;|url|&gt;). When I found the fingerprint-activated BenjiLock at one event, the inventor explained he sold his [two-year-old idea](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [Hampton Products](&lt;|url|&gt;) (after surviving [*Shark Tank](&lt;|url|&gt;)*). They’ve made the lock smaller, sleeker, and reliable, but it’s not new.

Did you hear about LG’s incredible rollable TV? Yes. [Last year](&lt;|url|&gt;). The [packaging is prettier](&lt;|url|&gt;), but it’s not new. Nor are the 8K TVs: They’re just bigger. Samsung has [MicroLED](&lt;|url|&gt;) for fully configurable displays, just like it [did last year](&lt;|url|&gt;).

![](<|image|>)

There’s a fake doll with a baby monitor wrapped around its toe, staring at it through a camera eye or sneakily sliding under its crib-sized mattress. Creepy? Maybe. Familiar? Definitely.

I was briefly excited about [an iPhone case that contains a drone](&lt;|url|&gt;) before someone informed me that an earlier, bulkier version was [around last year](&lt;|url|&gt;). Not new.

That robot folds laundry! Yeah, [it was here last year](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [the year before](&lt;|url|&gt;).

What about Google? Nothing that it’s showing off is new. The company is trying to add the “OK Google” voice command to everything, but it’s playing catch up to Amazon. Alexa really is everywhere, from big cars to tiny clocks.

![](<|image|>)

I saw a lot of interesting robots, but even my favorite, [Kiki from Zoetic AI](&lt;|url|&gt;), is really a better version of the old [Jibo](&lt;|url|&gt;). And those creepy [flex-face robots](&lt;|url|&gt;) reminded me of something I saw almost [a decade ago](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Even all the car tech — smart cars, all-screen dashboards, augmented reality in the windshield — is a synthesis of everything that’s come before it. I’ll grant that [a walking car is new](&lt;|url|&gt;), but it’s also ridiculous.

The peaks and valleys of innovation I enjoyed at previous CES events have flattened into a general hum of “more.” Thanks to easier access to 3D printing and prototyping services in China, there are more ODMs (original device manufacturers) than ever, but they all seem to be focusing on the same things. There are now [many masks](&lt;|url|&gt;) for your faces to calm snoring, sleep trouble, and [even dry eye](&lt;|url|&gt;). There are wearable bands to help you calm down and devices to help you breathe.

But there are no category-defining product innovations like the digital camera, the VCR, the MP3 player, the self-driving car, or the robot vacuum. New products are derivative of what’s come before. The innovations are largely on the software side, with traditional consumer electronics leveraging better silicon and sensors for more artificial intelligence and machine learning.

It’s an issue that’s writ large across the entire tech industry, where innovation more often now is measured on a nanoscale, and breakthroughs are usually hidden behind a flat screen.

Disappointment aside, CES still plays an important role in the technology ecosystem. Products that return year after year to showcase updates are inching their way closer to consumer availability. They can’t do so without the energy of the retailer who might hope to one day stock their shelves with a visionary product or the wordsmithing of a tech journalist who can’t wait to share their discovery with a wider audience.

But that support doesn’t guarantee that any of these products will make it. Those entrepreneurs will go back to the drawing board to cook up their next big ideas, ones that I hope are ready in time for CES 2020.<|endoftext|>

# The Future of Alzheimer’s Treatment May Be Enlisting the Immune System

## A new theory for Alzheimer’s disease is emerging, and at least one company is taking advantage of the new thinking with drugs in human trials

![Illustration by [Alexis Beauclair](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration by [Alexis Beauclair](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

The mood among the more than 3,000 researchers who gathered in Lisbon, Portugal, at the end of March for the 14th International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases was downbeat. Just a few days earlier, Biogen, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company, and Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai Co had jointly announced the shuttering of two major trials of their Alzheimer’s drug aducanumab. The announcement marked yet another failure in the decades-long effort to find a drug to halt the devastating course of the terminal, memory-robbing disease.

“There was a sort of pall over the meeting,” says Ron Petersen, director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in Rochester, Minnesota. Many speakers prefaced their remarks with a reference to the news. But, Petersen adds, “It’s going to encourage the field to broaden the potential therapeutic targets we have for the disease.”

Scientists in academic and corporate labs are already pursuing a host of new approaches that they hope will offer pathways out of the Alzheimer’s doldrums. One idea gaining traction takes a page from the oncology playbook, where drugs that enlist the power of the immune system to attack tumors are transforming cancer treatment and drug discovery.

Alector, a Silicon Valley startup founded six years ago, already has two Alzheimer’s drugs in early human studies designed to strengthen the ability of the brain’s immune system to fight the disease. One of the drugs targets a gene called TREM2 and the other a gene known as SIGLEC3; certain mutations in these genes can contribute to conditions that allow Alzheimer’s to develop. In May, Alector treated its first person with Alzheimer’s with its drug targeting TREM2, and has begun human testing for the drug that targets SIGLEC3 as well.

“If the immune system in the brain is not operating normally, the nerve cells cannot function normally,” says Arnon Rosenthal, a neuroscientist and co-founder and CEO of Alector. “Eventually they degenerate and die. This is what leads to the disease.”

That view stands in contrast to the beta amyloid hypothesis that has dominated — and, some say, constrained — Alzheimer’s research for a quarter century. The hypothesis holds that the disease is caused by misfolded proteins that result in the accumulation of amyloid plaque in the brain that kills nerve cells and leads to dementia.

A new way to combat Alzheimer’s disease is even more daunting. One major hurdle is the track record of failure itself, which hobbles the ability of researchers to even design the right study. “We really haven’t figured out how to do a [successful] Alzheimer’s clinical trial,” says Philip L. De Jager, chief of neuroimmunology at Columbia University in New York. “Until we do, it’s hard to know how to conduct these trials effectively.”

There is no assurance that Alector’s approach will break the losing streak. “It’s exciting that this company has decided to invest in these clinical trials,” De Jager says, “but we really don’t know when and how the immune system is involved in the disease.”

The need could not be more urgent. The devastating effect of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases on the afflicted and their families is undeniable — and growing. The Alzheimer’s Association says 5.8 million Americans are currently living with the disease.

Pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly, Roche, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Merck, in addition to Biogen, are among the companies that have invested billions in the hypothesis, testing drugs designed to clear out the plaque from the brain. Biogen’s aducanumab, like some other drugs before it, succeeded in reducing the plaque burden, but, like all others before it, still failed to halt the progression of the disease. “We need to challenge this approach,” says Alector’s Rosenthal.

Emerging research over the last several years suggests an alternative route, with some scientists arguing that Alzheimer’s is not caused directly by the buildup of plaque in the brain, but rather that the disease may be triggered by a viral infection. New research in mice from Stockholm University and Karolinska Institute in Sweden published May 27 in the journal *Nature Communications* suggests that pathogens such as the herpes simplex virus can trigger development of amyloid plaque in the brain.

The task of building consensus around an alternative cause for Alzheimer’s is one thing. Finding a new way to combat Alzheimer’s disease is even more daunting. In just six years, the number of people 65 and over with the disease is expected to jump 27% to 7.1 million. Without effective new treatments, the association says more than 13 million people will be living with the disease by 2050, with annual associated health care costs topping $1 trillion. Globally, the cost of treating the disease already exceeds $1 trillion, according to Alzheimer’s Disease International, with nearly 10 million new patients diagnosed each year.

“If we don’t fix this, we’re not going to fix Medicare,” says Mayo’s Petersen.

The prevailing amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer’s is based in part on the discovery among patients with a familial form of Alzheimer’s that a person with certain rare mutations in any of three genes is almost certain to develop the disease. The genes are linked to the production or accumulation of beta amyloid. The finding emerged from studying a few hundred families afflicted with the disease worldwide, the Alzheimer’s Association says. But those genes may not be major drivers of the disease — estimates are that only about 1% of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s have even one of the mutations.

In 2013, Rosenthal and his colleagues looked at the results of genome-wide association studies involving tens of thousands of people with non-inherited cases of Alzheimer’s, the kind that includes the vast majority of people who develop the disease. When they compared their genetics with those of people without Alzheimer’s, it turned out that mutations in 30 to 40 genes affected a person’s risk for the disease.

Surprisingly, Rosenthal says, even though Alzheimer’s is primarily a disease of nerve cell degeneration, most of the genes the analysis identified were expressed not in nerve cells but in the brain’s immune system cells known as microglia. That, combined with research advances showing that the brain’s immune system plays multiple roles in the health and maintenance of nerve cells and neuronal connections, pointed to the immune system as a target for treating dementia. Alector and its emerging pipeline of drug candidates was founded on that premise.

“What was clear from the human genetics is that insufficient activity of the immune system is allowing the disease to develop,” Rosenthal says. “It’s like a car — the accelerator is broken, not the brakes. The immune system is not going fast enough.”

The slowing down is a function of aging, as Alector describes it. Plaque buildup is one consequence. A sharp reduction in nerve cell connections, decreased blood flow to the brain resulting in reduced levels of oxygen and glucose, and a gradual degrading of the myelin sheath that protects nerve cells are among other factors that are part of the downward spiral to dementia. Other types of cells that normally produce nutrients for the brain begin releasing toxins instead.

These “insults on the nerve cells” would normally be contained, repaired, or mitigated if the brain’s immune system were healthy, Rosenthal says. The company likens the at-risk brain to a city under a crime wave. “You need the microglia cells to be the police force,” says Robert Paul, Alector’s chief medical officer. “If the microglia can no longer handle this kind of damage, that is when the neurons are dying.”

Last month Alector treated its first Alzheimer’s patient with its drug that targets TREM2, a receptor on microglia that is a “damage sensor,” says Sabah Oney, Alector’s chief business officer. The idea is that by activating this receptor, the drug will trigger an increase in the number of microglia and direct them to areas of damage for repair — essentially restoring normal function to the brain’s immune system. The company has also begun initial human testing of its drug that targets the SIGLEC3 receptor, which in a normal brain acts as a brake to keep the immune system under control. The drug is designed to release the brake and enable the immune system to act against Alzheimer’s-related injury.

The company expects initial data from these early studies by the end of this year, Oney says, and will be looking for evidence that the drugs can get into the brains of Alzheimer’s patients and hit their targets. The pharmaceutical company AbbVie, which was an early venture investor in Alector, has upped its investment and is co-developing the Alzheimer treatments with the company. Alector, which went public in February, is developing the drug for frontotemporal dementia on its own.

“Instead of trying to remove the pathological proteins, we are recruiting the immune system to treat the disease for us,” Rosenthal says. “Basically, we are resetting the aging immune cells back to a younger era when the cells are still fully functional and can counteract the disease.”

Alector is hardly alone in seeking new targets for Alzheimer’s. Cortexyme, a South San Francisco-based company, just launched a late-stage study for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s, testing a drug the company is developing that’s intended to block inflammation and neurodegeneration that it says is caused by a pathogen associated with gum disease.

More broadly, the [Dementia Discovery Fund](&lt;|url|&gt;), which launched more than three years ago with the backing of the British government, has invested in 11 new companies pursuing novel approaches to neurodegenerative diseases. The fund, which is based in London and Boston, has raised $318 million from investors including seven pharmaceutical companies, the AARP, and Bill Gates. Its mandate is to identify promising new scientific ideas for dementia “but not to invest in amyloid,” says Tetsu Maruyama, chief scientific adviser to the fund. “We felt it was the other areas that need resources.”

Alector was the fund’s first investment in January 2016. The investors see the company’s strategy as “a clear, compelling simple idea,” Maruyama says, based on strong genetics and with parallels to the success of the immuno-oncology approach to treating cancer.
> # “The immune system is an important component of Alzheimer’s disease, as we’re beginning to appreciate”

“For dementia [efforts] to become more successful, we have to borrow from other areas where progress has been made,” Maruyama says.

Will it work? Rosenthal, a former Genentech scientist and co-founder of two other companies, has a strong track record in drug development: He’s an inventor of two drugs — one for migraines and one for cancer — that are on the market, as well as a non-opioid pain medicine that Pfizer and Eli Lilly have in late-stage development. (He’s also an inventor on an anti-amyloid drug that Pfizer acquired more than a decade ago but shelved in 2011.)

But previous results don’t guarantee future success, and it’s way too early to know whether the new strategy will be effective. “The immune system is an important component of Alzheimer’s disease, as we’re beginning to appreciate,” says Columbia’s De Jager. “We’re still very early in understanding it [in] this context.” He says there are many other important disease pathways that need to be pursued as well. Even anti-amyloid drugs might eventually work — just not in the way they’ve been tested so far.

“It will be similar to cancer,” De Jager says. “There’s not going to be any single drug that will cure the disease. It will be multiple different drugs at different times that will be required to take care of it.”<|endoftext|>

# Where Do Our Sex Dolls Go After We Die?

## Companions in life, sex dolls can become embarrassing detritus when we die

![Illustration: [Mikyung Lee](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Mikyung Lee](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

“Davecat,” a 46-year-old data entry specialist, lives alone in his 600-square-foot apartment outside Detroit, Michigan, but he’s by no means lonely. He has his “wife” of 18 years: Sidore, a RealDoll he lovingly calls his “Missus.” Blood doesn’t flow through her veins, and she can’t eat the eel sushi Davecat purchases them for dinner, but you wouldn’t know it by the way Davecat jokes with her, touches her milky-white shoulder, and plays with her shoulder-length purple hair.

“I’ve always thought of human-shaped things… things like mannequins and, in particular, dolls, as having lives of their own,” Davecat told me via Skype, with Sidore beside him. “I believe they have their own ‘soul.’ I view them as people.”

For someone who may live in a fantasy, Davecat is exceptionally self-aware. (Like other sex-doll owners I spoke with, he requested I use his online identity to preserve anonymity.) He cracks jokes from Sidore’s Twitter account about being a “Synthetik,” describing her grabbing a glass of water in the middle of the night only to realize she can’t drink. He’s also acutely mindful of the fact that he, unlike Sidore, is going to die one day, which is why he’s already devised a meticulous plan for what happens to her when he does.

Davecat would like his body to be cremated, with the ashes stored in a bag and placed into Sidore’s hollow head. “She’s always on my mind in life; I’ll always be on her mind in death,” he says. Then, his best friend will move Sidore into her home where she’ll sit indefinitely in a glass case holding a plaque that reads, “How terrible it is to love something that death can touch.” She’ll wear a mofuku, a traditional Japanese mourning kimono, as well as the necklace he gave her when he first brought her home nearly two decades ago.
> # Davecat would like his body to be cremated, with the ashes stored in a bag and placed into Sidore’s hollow head.

This plan is subject to change, as Davecat is hoping to gift Sidore with a robotic body for their 20th anniversary, in which case her once-empty head would be filled with hardware. Should this happen, he’ll likely have his remains pressed into a diamond that she’ll wear around her neck and close to the place her heart would be, were she human.

As for Davecat’s other three dolls, they’ll go off to live with other “iDollators,” an affectionate term for people who, like Davecat, love and collect dolls. One recipient will be Davecat’s good friend artist Amber Hawk Swanson, who became famous for purchasing and “marrying” a life-size doll [made in her likeness](&lt;|url|&gt;) named Amber Doll. “It’s a close-knit community where we can take care of each other should anything happen,” Davecat says.

Life-size sex dolls are slowly making their way into popular culture: In Houston, Texas, a sex doll company called [KinkySdollS](&lt;|url|&gt;) recently attempted to open the first [sex-robot “brothel](&lt;|url|&gt;)” in the United States, where curious customers could test and rent a variety of models before purchasing. Texan lawmakers pushed back on the proposal, though such brothels already exist in Toronto, [Paris](&lt;|url|&gt;), [Moscow](&lt;|url|&gt;), [Germany](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [other European cities](&lt;|url|&gt;). A company called Realbotix is now combining programmable A.I. with sex robots, promising users they can “be the first to never be lonely again.”

Yet, there’s one issue sex-doll owners have yet to fully resolve: what to do with their synthetic companions after they’ve died.

For the most part, options are limited. I reached out to funeral homes all across the country, and not one said they would consider hosting a funeral service for a life-size doll, no matter the price. “I’m an old-school, traditional funeral director,” one man, who asked to remain anonymous, said. “Money does not excite me.” New Orleans-based Charbonnet Funeral Home, which made national news in 2014 for [posing embalmed corpses](&lt;|url|&gt;) in lifelike scenarios during wakes, said it would also reject requests for sex-doll burials.
> # I reached out to funeral homes all across the country, and not one said they would consider hosting a funeral service for a life-size doll, no matter the price.

One option is to do nothing, thus leaving the doll behind for unsuspecting next of kin. Will and trust attorney Mario Correa advises against this and suggests owners treat their dolls like any other tangible personal property or family heirloom, such as jewelry or fine china. “Let’s say you fail to specify someone. Then [the doll] goes into what’s called a residuary estate, and it will go to whoever is the remainder beneficiary,” he says. “By not being clear about certain properties, especially a special asset in a family, that could create problems.” Those issues include, but are not limited to, confusion, embarrassment, and family infighting.

The inheritor of a doll may want to resell it (after all, the dolls can retail for upward of $8,000), but hawking one is more complicated than you might assume. On the marketplace site at the Doll Forum, an online space for doll enthusiasts, sellers have to disclose information such as when and where the doll was purchased, what its body specifications are, if it’s had any repairs or has any damage, and of course, if the previous owner had sex with it. Unless someone wrote out all these details and included them in the will, it’d be nearly impossible for someone unfamiliar with the doll to sort out.

Though most doll museums are unlikely to accept sex dolls, iDollators might have better luck donating to sex museums, which sometimes display doll exhibits. A representative for the Muse Foundation, a private foundation affiliated with the [Museum of Sex](&lt;|url|&gt;) in New York City, tells me Muse is always willing to consider donations, though the decision to accept them is, ultimately, “entirely up to the foundation’s discretion.”

Some companies, such as Chinese company Doll Sweet Dolls, accept used dolls for recycling or resale. The problem, a representative for the company says, is that the international shipping costs are quite pricey. They haven’t received a single shipment from the United States for recycling or resale to date.
> # “If you sent it to a recycling facility, it would just end up in a landfill.”

Recycling stateside is just as complicated. “Things that are made out of four different materials are difficult or impossible to recycle,” says Robert Reed, the public relations manager for San Francisco-based recycling facility Recology. While most hard plastics, metals, and even some silicones are eligible for recycling, Chris Fu at Eco USA, a silicone recycling facility, says that the average consumer doesn’t have enough knowledge about the materials used to make dolls and robots to know how to sort them in the first place.

“If you sent it to a recycling facility, it would just end up in a landfill,” Fu says.

With few formal options, most sex-doll owners are falling back on their communities to help them plan for after their death. A New Jersey-based iDollator, who goes by the sobriquet TJ Foxx, has had to confront death more than he’d like. His (human) wife, who has battled various health conditions throughout their marriage, has been dealing with complications from past cancer treatments and is often in and out of the hospital. To cope, both emotionally and sexually, Foxx purchased his first doll, a fiery brunette with piercing green eyes and bold eyebrows called Tasha, whom he refers to as his “silicone soulmate.”

“This isn’t really a toy, a sex toy,” he says. “This is something a lot more than that… She’s crazy about me, and I’m crazy about her.”

Like Davecat, Foxx has given Tasha and his three other dolls thought-out personalities. Tasha, for example, is a self-proclaimed “fashionista” who blogs about clothes and occasionally models. “I’d say she’s all the best qualities of me, my wife, and maybe some girlfriends I had,” he says. “And just over the years, people I’ve known that are close to me, the things that make me happy about them, they’re all in there.”

She embodies the good Foxx searches for during his darkest times and, though she could never truly replace his wife, he said he’d depend on Tasha if his wife died. “Right now, Tasha is kind of a security blanket,” he says. “She’s there to keep me company. All I have to do is have her there sitting next to me.”

His wife supports his interest, only asking that he doesn’t disclose the dolls’ existence to their two grown children—an easy trade-off for all the benefits Foxx receives, he says. But hiding his dolls from his kids wouldn’t be possible if he and his wife didn’t have a concrete plan in case one, or both, of them die. “We’ve had enough close calls where my wife is very practical,” he says.

He’s listed the dolls in his estate, along with the phone numbers of some of his closest friends, who are also iDollators he met in online doll forums and at doll conventions. In case of death, those confidants will come to the house, clear everything out before the kids might stumble across them, and “make sure the girls are well-cared for.”

Foxx, as well as many others in the doll community, are often willing to open their homes and serve as the designated caregivers for their friends’ dolls. But taking in a doll isn’t a responsibility they take lightly.
> # “Dying, in so many ways, is about losing control.”

In Arizona, a woman who goes by the moniker Hollywu lives with her “placebo partner,” Rari, a bubbly doll whose Twitter feed is filled with empowering messages. Hollywu first got Rari in 2016 after seeing [Marwencol](&lt;|url|&gt;), a documentary about a man named Mark Hogancamp who coped with the aftermath of a traumatic physical assault by creating his own 1:6-scale world using dolls. As someone with bipolar disorder, decades of suicidal ideation, and social anxiety, Hollywu says she was inspired to follow Hogancamp’s lead and create a synthetic reality of her own, a decision she feels improved her happiness and health.

“[Rari] just added a totally different dimension to my life… She’s really helped me in a lot of ways,” Hollywu says. “To be able to wake up next to her, come home to her, it’s been great… There’s an old saying, ‘Be with somebody who makes you a better person.’ I think that can apply to synthetic or organic.”

Now, she and Rari have synthetic children that they “raise” alongside their two doll roommates, Akiko and Sadako, who also have synthetic kids of their own. In total, Hollywu estimates she has 15 babies and four or five toddlers living under her roof.

Hollywu says she’d never leave Rari behind without a strategic plan in place. Though they haven’t met in person, she says Foxx, whom she first interacted with through the doll forum, is “like family” and is the one person she trusts whole-heartedly with caring for Rari. “He would take good care of her,” she says.

Still, Hollywu acknowledges that collecting upward of 20 dolls from someone can be a daunting commitment, especially for Foxx, who currently keeps his stored in the basement. “I don’t want somebody to have to feel like, ‘You’re dead, and now I have to hold onto all your stuff.’ That’s not cool,” she says, adding that she’d trust Foxx to find good homes for the babies and, if necessary, Akiko and Sadako.

Inevitably, the designated caregivers will die too. When that day comes, the iDollators I spoke with hope their dolls will be passed on to people with similar outlooks. That is to say, people who view dolls as more than just sex toys.

Crossing off logistical tasks, like drafting a will, is a good start. But when it comes to dying, end-of-life specialist Michelle Acciavatti says it’s also imperative that iDollators make peace with letting go. Acciavatti—who helps guide people through all aspects of the death process, from providing counseling to planning at-home or green burials through her company [Ending Well](&lt;|url|&gt;) in Vermont—says she’d happily work with someone who’s worried about leaving behind a synthetic lover. “They are valid relationships, and their attachments shouldn’t be treated any differently,” she says.

Acciavatti says a majority of her clients fear abandoning their spouses, children, or even objects like houses. Sex dolls are no different. “Dying, in so many ways, is about losing control,” she says. “So, part of what I try to do, and I hope that I do well, is help people make peace with the fact that there are things they can’t control anymore. What they can control is who they are to themselves.”

Davecat, Foxx, and Hollywu hope stigmas against human-Synthetik relationships will dissipate as A.I. and robots become more prevalent. And there’s a chance that, eventually, there will be more formally accepted ways of retiring them when we pass. In the meantime, though, it’s up to each owner to develop a plan for their own doll. Or not. One Redditor says that while he, too, enjoys the company of his silicone lover, he’s not going to lose sleep worrying about what becomes of her when he dies. “When you are dead,” he says, “you don’t care what happens to your doll.”<|endoftext|>

# Captain Marvel Isn’t Marvel’s Answer to Wonder Woman… Yet

## Captain Marvel Isn’t Marvel’s Answer to Wonder Woman… Yet

### The studio’s first solo female superhero has a lot more riding on her shoulders than ticket sales

![Image: Marvel Studios/Disney](<|image|>)*Image: Marvel Studios/Disney*

Last week I saw the debut of the trailer for *Captain Marvel*, Marvel Studio’s long-awaited film that will (for the first time!) plant a female superhero firmly in the spotlight. Although the movie was developed in 2013, it was the resounding success of 2016’s *Wonder Woman* — released by DC, Marvel’s chief competitor — that finally spurred the studio to give a superhero franchise to a nondude.

But let’s be clear: *Captain Marvel* is no *Wonder Woman*… for now, at least.

The trailer was probably the first time most people had even heard of the character Marvel Studios is trying to make its premier female superhero. But Marvel Comics has also been trying to make Carol Danvers its equivalent to Wonder Woman on and off [since 1977](&lt;|url|&gt;). Marvel has always been missing a distinctive female superhero on par with its best-known (and most marketable) characters, like Spider-Man, Captain America, and the Hulk. For most of Marvel’s existence, the majority of its most famous female superheroes were parts of a team (think Fantastic Four’s Invisible Woman or X-Men’s Storm).

Or, to put it succinctly: Marvel has had a hell of a time making a female character with the cultural cachet needed to, theoretically, star in her own blockbuster superhero movie.

To fully understand why Marvel has given Captain Marvel that blockbuster superhero movie, we need to examine the comics’ history with Carol Danvers. (I promise, this the most streamlined bio of the character written by a nerd you will read between now and the movie’s premiere.) When Carol [first appeared in 1966](&lt;|url|&gt;), she played a supporting role — basically the love interest — for Marvel’s *original* Captain Marvel, [an alien named Mar-Vell](&lt;|url|&gt;) who came to scout Earth but decided to protect it instead. Even then, Carol was unique among Marvel’s other female characters, including its heroes. When she made her first appearance, she was already a decorated U.S. Air Force officer and a former CIA agent and was currently the (youngest-ever) head of NASA security. Unfortunately, Carol was injured by an alien weapon and disappeared from Mar-Vell’s life and comic books in 1969.

![The cover of Ms. Marvel #1 (January 1977)](<|image|>)*The cover of Ms. Marvel #1 (January 1977)*

Carol reappeared in 1977 to make her heroic debut as [*Ms.* Marvel](&lt;|url|&gt;), after it turned out that the alien device had given her all of Mar-Vell’s alien powers, including super strength, flight, and energy bolts that shot from her hands. Although her superhero name was clearly a feminine derivative of the male Captain Marvel, à la Supergirl or She-Hulk, it was also a feminist statement of sorts. *Ms. Marvel* #1* *was published not long after [women’s rights supporters championed the honorific](&lt;|url|&gt;), particularly after Gloria Steinem and Dorothy Pitman Hughes premiered the first regular issue of *Ms. *magazine in 1972. Two other things are worth pointing out: 1) In *Ms. Marvel*, Carol had a new day job as editor of the feminist *Woman* magazine; 2) the first issue of *Ms.* [featured Wonder Woman on the cover](&lt;|url|&gt;), proclaiming the superhero as a feminist icon.

Marvel was hoping its new hero would attract young women and girls as comic readers, as *Ms. Marvel* #1 writer Gerry Conway said in [an interview with *Polygon](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. It was a concerted attempt to tap into the audience DC Comics had with Wonder Woman, but Ms. Marvel never caught on, and her comic lasted only a couple of years. Marvel gave her a second push in the mid-2000s, but it wasn’t until writer Kelly Sue DeConnick got hold of Carol in 2012 that the character claimed the name Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell was long dead) and was presented as one of Marvel Comics’ most important characters. She’s been dubbed “Earth’s Mightiest Hero” in the comics ever since, putting her above Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, the Hulk, and many, many more.

*Captain Marvel* #1 was published in 2012, and Marvel Studios [began development](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the movie in 2013. Clearly, the new Captain Marvel was someone the studio wanted to bring to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as its first major female superhero—although the script certainly wasn’t completed until after *Wonder Woman* premiered in 2016 and kicked serious box-office ass, but make of that what you will.

As I’ve said, Captain Marvel is no Wonder Woman, but it would be injudicious to say that *Captain Marvel* won’t be as successful as the *Wonder Woman* movie just because the latter character is a longtime pop-culture icon. After all, the terrifyingly efficient film factory that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe cares not for “experience.” No one beyond *very* few comics fans had heard of the Guardians of the Galaxy before their movie premiered, and now they headline one of Marvel’s top franchises. Marvel Studios makes superheroes into stars, and let me assure you, Captain Marvel has a lot more going for her than Ant-Man or Doctor Strange. Plus, it’s been well proven that audiences are hungry to see heroes who aren’t white dudes. Carol Danvers and her movie will almost certainly do just fine.

But even having her own a massive movie success won’t make her Marvel’s *Wonder Woman*. After all, Wonder Woman is the premier female superhero and has been since 1941. She’s starred in three-quarters of a century’s worth of comics. She had a three-season, primetime TV series in the 1970s. She was a symbol of the women’s rights movement. Captain Marvel’s got none of that. When her movie premieres next spring, the character will have existed in her current form for only seven years.

Marvel, however, has always specialized in making its heroes human, even when they were bitten by a radioactive spider or hit by a gamma bomb, or, impressively, even if they were a Norse god. Marvel’s best superheroes have feelings and flaws and hopes and fears, and Carol is no exception. She’s brave but sometimes headstrong, she’s caring but sometimes loses sight of the greater good, and she’s always pushing herself to be better—although occasionally she pushes herself too far. Captain Marvel is no icon, but she’s someone people can understand and be inspired by.

After that, the only thing Captain Marvel needs is time. Her movie is the perfect start, and it’ll help even more when she shows up in *Avengers 4*. It’s what happens next that I’m concerned about. The way Marvel Studios has dragged its heels on Carol’s film and only recently, [begrudgingly announced the *Black Widow* movie](&lt;|url|&gt;), makes me worry that she might not get the same solo franchise options as her male counterparts and will fade into the background for occasional guest appearances.

Captain Marvel can’t inspire anybody if she disappears after a movie or two. She needs to stick around long enough that people know Carol Danvers is the most badass woman in the Marvel Universe by her own right. She needs to be outstanding enough, long enough, that she’s as utterly inseparable from the pantheon of Marvel superheroes as Iron Man, Spider-Man, Black Panther, Captain America, and the rest — not just for right now, but for years to come.<|endoftext|>

# Why ‘Venom’ Is the Best Kind of Box Office Poison

## Why ‘Venom’ Is the Best Kind of Box Office Poison

### **How Sony turned a Spider-Man movie without Spider-Man into an unlikely success**

![Photo: Sony Pictures Entertainment](<|image|>)*Photo: Sony Pictures Entertainment*

On the list of clues suggesting we’ve all fallen into an alternate timeline where the entire world has gone wrong, the fact that a movie about a Spider-Man villain where Spider-Man is literally never once mentioned just made $200 million this weekend should be near the bottom. It’s not awful—it’s just not supposed to happen. But it definitely did.

There is no reason that *Venom*, a very odd superhero film, should have just had the [most lucrative October movie opening ever](&lt;|url|&gt;). There are, however, many reasons it shouldn’t have — first and foremost being the aforementioned lack of Spider-Man. Venom’s entire character has been defined by the MIA hero. The “symbiote,” as the black alien sludge is called, [first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1984](&lt;|url|&gt;) as a snazzy new black costume created by an alien machine. (Long story.) Eventually, Spidey discovered that Venom was an evil parasite and managed to free himself from it. The symbiote quickly bonded with Spider-Man-hating disgraced journalist Eddie Brock (played by Tom Hardy in the film), and the two bonded, figuratively and literally, over their hate of Spider-Man. This is why Venom looks so much like Spidey, right down to the white spider emblem on his chest — a cosmetic choice notably missing in the movie. Only five years after his 1988 debut, Venom became so popular that he [turned into an anti-hero](&lt;|url|&gt;) (think Wolverine, but with more biting off bad guys’ heads) and the star of a few solo comics. On paper, a solo Venom movie is not the craziest idea, which is why Sony’s [been trying to make one forever](&lt;|url|&gt;).

While its lack of a Spider-hero wasn’t a big deal for audiences, it’s also weird that Venom is as big a success as it is, since it’s actually pretty dumb. I offer no insult if you enjoyed it, because you’re obviously in good — and huge — company. However, critics have panned the film, and I can assure you that they were correct to do so. It takes a staggering amount of time before the title character appears fully onscreen. Tom Hardy’s accent is an attention-siphoning enigma. And the movie has more holes than plot; my favorite is how the bad guys send 100 men in black sedans to open fire on Eddie as they chase his motorcycle through the busiest streets in San Francisco, and then *also* send drones that can shoot rockets, and then destroy dozens of cars in front of hundreds of witnesses in their attempt to murder Eddie. Then, after they finally catch him, they decide to walk him deep into the woods to execute him where no one can see.

There’s a good amount of action in the film but practically no stakes. There are no anguished realizations or hard choices. I suppose we’re supposed to care about Eddie getting back together with his ex-fiancée Anne (Michelle Williams) early in the film, but their relationship is so cartoonishly shallow that even the film doesn’t seem to care about its success or failure. Heads are bitten off and eaten with mild, momentary discomfort. The world needs to be saved, but from a vague threat that we never see and that never comes particularly close to happening.

Of course, things like “plot” and “drama” only matter when you’re not having enough fun to ignore them, and *Venom* certainly has its moments. There are the action scenes, which are entertainingly violent. The movie also makes the effective choice of making doofuses out of Eddie Brock and the alien parasite attached to him. Eddie screws up his entire life within the film’s first few minutes and later spends a great deal of time as merely Venom’s bewildered passenger. Meanwhile, Venom is much more interested in looking cool and being Eddie’s bro than doing anything evil. (I believe this is the first movie ever where an alien parasite does a front-end wheelie on a motorcycle.) Even the occasional bad-guy meals veer much closer to comedy than horror; likewise, Eddie and Venom also veer closer to being a straight-up hero than an anti-hero, and there’s something lovable about these two losers becoming intergalactic BFFs.

*Venom* is a simple film, but after the past decade of superhero movies, it also feels like a relief. Its simplicity is what makes it enticing. It’s like *Guardians of the Galaxy*, but without the burden of lugging a giant, shared cinematic universe along with it. There aren’t a million characters to keep track of, like *Avengers: Infinity War*. It’s *Deadpool* without trying so damned hard to be extreme, clever, or loaded with in-jokes. There’s nothing you need to know to watch *Venom*, there’s nothing else you need to have seen, and, honestly, you don’t even need to worry about its relationship to Spider-Man, since it technically does not exist. The movie is not obligated to anything but itself… for now.

Because of course — *of course* — Sony has slated *Venom* to be the start of its Spider-Man Cinematic Universe in Which Spider-Man’s Involvement Is Completely in Question. As silly as that name sounds, Sony’s official name for all the Spider-side stories, [revealed back in August](&lt;|url|&gt;), is even clunkier: “Sony’s Universe of Marvel Characters.” I have no idea how this will work, given that the one thing that binds all of the Sony-owned Marvel characters is that they’re all supporting characters of Spider-Man. There’s chatter of Tom Holland eventually making an appearance —* Venom* director Ruben Fleischer said that a Venom/Spidey tussle may come “[at some point down the line](&lt;|url|&gt;)” — which indicates that there are zero immediate plans to bring in the guy all these characters actually know.

Without Spider-Man, what’s the point of pretending these movies take place in a shared universe? How many of these characters can actually headline a film? Who will give a shit if Venom meets Black Cat, the distant second place of sexy cat-themed thieves in comics, or Silver Sable, a mercenary who wouldn’t make a Top 200 list of Marvel’s best-loved characters? (Sony is currently planning movies about [each of these characters](&lt;|url|&gt;).)

In fact, *Venom* might lose its best quality if Sony wants to make it the center of this Spider-free galaxy. Forcing the square peg that is *Venom* into Spider-Man’s round hole will not go well for either peg or hole, and what would be the point? What’s the endgame of “Sony’s Universe of Marvel Characters”? Is there a reason these supporting characters need to stop by the movies of other supporting Spidey characters, other than to prove to people that, yes, this is very technically a shared universe? Will Tom Holland’s Peter Parker ever even show up in one of these films? And if he does, how the hell will he work with a goofball Venom and whatever else Sony has in store for “Sony’s Universe of Marvel Characters”?!

To be fair, in the match of wits between Sony Motion Pictures Entertainment and Rob Bricken, Sony is currently undefeated at 1–0. I thought *Venom* was not going to do well because of how isolated it was from the rest of superhero entertainment, when instead I think that became its biggest strength. So maybe Sony knows exactly what it’s doing and has a meticulously plotted Spider-Manless universe, and the moviegoing people of the world have been dying for a Silver Sable movie without realizing it (and without having heard of the character).

But I suspect the studio should let *Venom* be *Venom*. And when thinking about the inevitable sequel, I was surprised to realize I wouldn’t want Spider-Man to stop by, because he just wouldn’t fit into the frivolous, lighthearted first film. Hopefully *Venom*’s success will spur Sony — or Warner Bros., or, hell, even Marvel — to make more films this fun. I don’t even think doofuses are required. But best keep the headless corpses, just in case.<|endoftext|>

# On Using Tech While Poor

## The sheer mental stress of poverty utterly changes our relationship to technology

![Photo: John Bogna](<|image|>)*Photo: John Bogna*

At a family get-together one year, an older relative asked me what had been the most exciting Christmas present of my life. My first thought was the PlayStation console one of my mom’s boyfriends got me when I was little. I remember finally feeling like one of the other kids, the “normal” kids who seemed to get nice things at every holiday.

I’m on the older end of the millennial spectrum, and while a lot of us are assumed to be digitally savvy, I wasn’t until later in life. I bought my first smartphone with Christmas money after I graduated college, and I’ve had it for five years now. I was slow to adopt social media, and only joined Instagram when I started pursuing photography about a year after I bought my phone. I avoided using the new gadgets, or apps, my friends did because I didn’t see the point. I’ve had the same laptop since 2009; I paid for it with my student loans, loans I haven’t even started paying off yet.

My parents divorced when I was four, and doing without was common in the two households where I grew up. My mom worked at a bank, my dad as a general contractor, and neither of them made much money. (Later, I’d find out there was another culprit behind our perpetually tight resources: alcohol. But that’s another article entirely.) There was little room in the budget for luxuries like the internet.

At my mom’s place, where I lived until I was 16, we’d use something until it broke, then use it some more, patching it together with Band-Aids and workarounds. She wouldn’t spend on anything, even when it made sense. My dad’s spending depended on how much work he had.
> # Research has shown that just being poor puts people in a state of chronic stress and impedes their ability to make decisions.

By the time I had to pay for my own stuff, I’d internalized their flawed behaviors around money, often paralyzed into inaction whenever I had a few dollars extra to spend on anything beyond necessities. I saved what I could when I got my first job, but there never seemed to be enough. I didn’t understand how to invest in things that would help me get ahead, or how to decide what was worth spending money on. Money — or lack of it — came to define my life, including the technology I had access to and how I used it.

Research has shown that just being poor puts people in a state of chronic stress and impedes their ability to make decisions. A study published in the journal *Science* found that the difference between economically stable people and people in poverty amounted to around [13 IQ points](&lt;|url|&gt;) — equivalent to the average difference in cognitive capacity between chronic alcoholics and normally functioning adults.

The study had a series of people, rich and poor, solve simple cognitive tests after being asked to think about a $150 repair and one that would cost $1,500. Affluent subjects performed the same regardless of the cost, but those without a lot of money did worse after being asked what they would do if confronted with a $1,500 problem. Chronic economic stress reduces people’s mental bandwidth to such a degree that just thinking about an expensive repair impeded their decision making.

Less than a year out of college, I suffered a serious injury to my back and was laid off from my job. Bills drained the savings and retirement money accrued through six years of work, and $77 every two weeks from the Employment Development Department didn’t help that much, especially in California. Eventually I got some minimum wage work but it threw me into years of economic limbo, living on a teenage budget with adult expenses and chronic pain in a bad home environment. I made just enough to get by but not enough to get out. Staying sane and keeping my bills paid became my top priority. I managed to work on writing projects where I could, but anything more was outside my bandwidth.

My connection to the internet via that old laptop probably saved me during my darkest moments. It let me publish my writing when I could eke out the time and energy, helped me understand my depression and anxiety through videos and essays by other people dealing with it, and opened up a vast library of music. It gave me tools I could use, and it provided an escape. It let me know what was out there beyond the rails of my commute, my job, and my bedroom, even if I couldn’t get my hands on it yet.

A friend of mine, who’s come through some rough times financially and personally in the past few years, told me that at one point she made $7,000 in an entire year. During that time, she found herself escaping into social media, using the web to apply for jobs, and chronically tracking her mounting expenses via her banking app.

“I used my phone more than ever during that time, both as a tool and a release,” she told me. “I spent a lot of time looking for ‘quick fixes’ to being that broke… I downloaded some apps to try to make extra money, like [Wag](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Rover](&lt;|url|&gt;). I was constantly looking at my banking app, checking every penny that went out since I had so little money.”

She was also able to find support by posting on an anonymous Twitter account, until she earned the stable job she has now. The happier she got, she says, the less time was spent on social media. “I don’t believe money buys happiness,” she said, “But being able to afford life does relieve a lot of stress and makes it easier to pursue happiness.”
> # People resist new technology because it threatens their established norms. I think that’s one reason I resisted technology for so long; my norm was the bare minimum.

The journalist [Rebecca Renner](&lt;|url|&gt;) grew up in Daytona Beach, Florida, and though there wasn’t much money, she was surrounded by engineers working on the space program and a father skilled at computer repair.

“I grew up with computer parts strewn around my house,” said Renner. “People would give my dad broken computers they didn’t want anymore, and he would fix them like it was no big deal. At one point, we had maybe five or six fully functioning computers he built at home, but we didn’t necessarily have food on the table every night. That’s how I learned to make do with whatever tech I can afford. I can basically gut a computer and make it do what I need it to do. I’m not sure where I would be as a writer without that skill.”

Harvard professor Calestous Juma said that people [resist new technology](&lt;|url|&gt;) because it threatens their established norms. I think that’s one reason I resisted technology for so long; my norm was the bare minimum. I thought I didn’t need it, that I’d gotten by with less so far and I’d just keep doing it. I might’ve also been afraid of being sucked into the void, burning hours on YouTube or Instagram, or rabbit-holing through pointless blogs instead of doing something that might’ve helped change my circumstances. I kept it all at arm’s length and as a result, it was harder to see the good in tech.

When I wanted to upgrade, I couldn’t afford the necessary hardware or software. I was terrified that any money I spent on a new computer or a camera would be money I wouldn’t have when I popped a tire or needed new brakes or just didn’t make enough to pay my bills that month.

Today, I live with family in Houston, Texas. Moving here broke the cycle of minimum wage work, helped reduce my expenses, and let me devote more time to writing. Technology is, in essence, helping me write the next chapter of my life. I’ve met and talked with some truly interesting people here through Instagram and Facebook, and I work as a remote freelancer, relying on my computer to pay my bills. It’s not a place I would’ve imagined myself in even a couple of years ago.

At the end of 2018, I invested in my freelance photography business with a refurbished iMac, my first big electronics purchase made entirely with my own money. It’s a 2013 model, but a 27-inch screen means I don’t have to lean forward and squint to make out the photo I’m working on, and compared to my laptop, it processes like the wind.

I’m not completely on the other side of this yet. I still struggle financially, so dropping that much cash on a new computer made my stomach clench. But I’m coming to understand the broken pattern of thinking that gives rise to fear, and that investments toward a long-term goal made intentionally aren’t wasteful spending. Because I’ve managed to save a little money, I finally have a little room to breathe. My job now is to make that space bigger.<|endoftext|>

# If Bats Perish, Where Does That Leave Us?

## Scientists scramble as a fatal fungus finally reaches a major bat sanctuary

![Credit: Purestock/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Purestock/Getty Images*

Everyone is worried about the bats. There are so many species with so many characteristics, and yet one disease is killing so many of them. It’s called white-nose syndrome, so named because it leads to the appearance of a white fungus — *Pseudogymnoascus destructans (PD)* — around a bat’s little nostrils. North American bats are dying in droves — so many, in fact, that scientists don’t have an exact number. In 2012, an estimated 6.7 million bats had died from white-nose syndrome. It’s undoubtedly much worse than that now.

Across the country, scientists decontaminate their gear in an attempt to keep it from spreading. In the winter, when the bats hibernate, these researchers sneak into their caves and stretch long, sterilized swabs — highly technical Q-tips — up toward their soft bodies. Gently, they rub the swabs on the bats’ faces and wings as the animals sleep. Then, the scientists take the swabs back to the lab for a genetic analysis, and if they’re religious, they pray.

They’ve carried out this grim ritual in Texas since 2012. For a few years, as the disease spread from New York down the Eastern Seaboard and eventually westward, the Texas bats were safe. But in 2017, a test finally came back positive in the Texas panhandle. Since then, the fungus everyone fears has jumped around. What was six infected counties in 2017 became 10 in 2018. The number now sits at 21.

Nonprofit [Bat Conservation International](&lt;|url|&gt;) now reports that early signs of the fungus have been detected at Bracken Cave near San Antonio, the largest bat colony in the world and home to some 20 million Mexican free-tailed bats.

“It is one of the most major conservation crises in North America,” says Winifred Frick, the chief scientist for Bat Conservation International. “I usually just emphasize ‘millions,’ as that is about the level of precision we have and is impressive even if imprecise,” Frick says. Scientists have not released a new estimate of American bats lost since 2012.
> # “Worst-case scenario is that we’re in a Typhoid Mary situation.”

The spread to Texas in particular is concerning because it’s a pivotal location where bats from Eastern North America and Western North America meet. “The Southeast has the highest species richness of bats,” she says. “We’re quite concerned about the kind of impact [white-nose syndrome’s] presence in Texas could have.”

The news of PD fungus reaching Bracken Cave is concerning mainly because Texas has the highest diversity of bats of any state. Thirty-three of the 47 North American bat species live in Texas, and Bracken Cave is a home for Mexican free-tailed bats, which do not hibernate. But they do travel as far south as Chile and far north in Canada. What is already an epidemic could be heightened by the fungus’s presence here. The bats could pick up PD in Bracken and spread it elsewhere.

“Worst-case scenario is that we’re in a Typhoid Mary situation,” says Jonah Evans, mammalogist for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

White-nose syndrome is killing bats at a rate that’s so monumental it is hard to overstate. There are 47 species of bats in the United States and Canada. Currently, 12 species have been identified with symptoms of white-nose syndrome. Six more have tested positive for the fungus.

Some states, [scientists estimate](&lt;|url|&gt;), have lost 70 to 90% of their bat populations. Even that number is hard to comprehend, so Frick uses an anecdote to illustrate the seriousness of this problem. She visited an infected bat colony in Arkansas a few years ago. One thousand cave myotis bats hibernated there. At the end of the winter, only seven were still alive.
> # White-nose syndrome kills like a coward. It comes in the cold, in the dark, during the long sleep.

There’s a lot we still don’t know about the disease. Many bats in Europe and Eurasia have this fungus on their body yet unaffected. North American bats aren’t so fortunate. The first case of white-nose in the United States was identified in New York back in 2007, but no one knows the precise point of introduction. “Presumably it got here through some means of human consumer travel,” Frick says. “There aren’t any bats that move from Asia or Europe to North America, so it had to be globalization and moving pathogens around.”

White-nose syndrome kills like a coward. It comes in the cold, in the dark, during the long sleep. Scientists know the disease is spread bat to bat, and that it persists in the environment. They know bats that migrate — and not all winter bats do — are safer from the disease. They know that the fungus disrupts the hibernating bats’ physiology, waking them up too frequently from their hibernation, when there’s still too little food. And so they starve to death.

Part of the issue, ironically, is that bats are unusually long-lived, while being slow to reproduce. A little brown bat can live almost 40 years, and female bats only give birth to one baby a year. “Multiple human generations will pass before bats return to their former populations,” says Evans. “And that’s if we find a cure right now.”

[Scientists are working on solutions,](&lt;|url|&gt;) but they don’t have one yet. “There’s a lot of attention toward both trying to reduce the spread and/or give bats that are undergoing mortality the best chance of survival,” says Frick. Scientists are experimenting with fungicides and vaccines and ways to increase foraging. It’s a tricky problem, though. Caves, where many bats hibernate, are delicate ecosystems. They’re home to other endangered species, which means that scientists must maintain a delicate touch as they explore solutions to white-nose syndrome. You can’t just walk in there, spray a fungicide, and call it a day.

“Cave ecosystems tend to be these very precarious food webs,” Evans says. “You’re in a cave. There’s no sunlight. Whatever thing wanders into the cave and dies becomes the food.”

Scientists can’t predict how a fungicide would disrupt these systems. Researchers have discovered that the fungus behind white-nose syndrome is sensitive to ultraviolet light, perhaps paving a path toward a solution — [though it’s yet unclear how it could be used to treat large populations of bats](&lt;|url|&gt;).

White-nose syndrome cannot infect humans and has no immediate effect on our lives. But scientists don’t know how great the effect will be if we lose dozens of species of bats, or even just one species. One bat can eat 1,000 mosquitos in an hour. The loss of bat populations will definitely lead to an increase in insect populations, and the chain reaction effect of that growth could be monumental. [More pesticides](&lt;|url|&gt;), for example, would have to be used to prevent crop failure. And there’s no telling how mosquito-carried diseases like Zika could spread without bats to regulate the population.

“Bats do provide an invaluable impact on our ecosystem,” says Frick. “But even without that, there is loss to the planet when we lose a substantial number of individuals.”
> # “It has taken millions and millions of years to have the species richness in bats that we have now.”

Of course, the loss of bats in America is just one more example of a massive loss of biodiversity in the world. [A recent report by the United Nations](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that we’ve lost huge portions of animal and plant life over the past century, with 1 million more extinctions to come by 2050, barring major action.

“From a long-term view, a geologic view, it has taken millions and millions of years to have the species richness in bats that we have now,” Evans says. “Imagine all of the different kinds of wildflowers we have in the state of Texas.”

I do. I remember the bluebonnets and the Indian paintbrushes and the brown-eyed Susans and the fields of verbena and pink evening primrose I grew up with. I remember the sides of the highways brightly colored with wildflowers every May. “Now imagine,” Evans says, “that the amazing diversity of wildflowers is whittled down to only dandelions. That’s what this is.”<|endoftext|>

# Exclusive&#58; The Vietnamese Cellphone Company That Tried to Smuggle Missile Parts — and the Spies…

## An inside look at “Team Telecom,” the little-known U.S. national security unit charged with protecting America’s telecommunications resources

![Photo: Hoang Dinh Nam/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Hoang Dinh Nam/Getty Images*

A secretive U.S. national security unit dedicated to protecting America’s telecommunications infrastructure foiled an attempt by Vietnam’s leading cellphone company to smuggle cruise missile parts, *OneZero* can reveal.

Team Telecom is made up of representatives from Homeland Security, the Department of Justice (including the FBI), as well as the Department of Defense, and reviews foreign investments in U.S. communications assets for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

A previously unreported 2016 investigation into VTA Telecom, a subsidiary of Vietnam’s state-owned phone company [Viettel](&lt;|url|&gt;), uncovered efforts to procure and illegally export missile engines and guidance equipment. A Viettel executive, Huy Quang Bui, quietly pled guilty to the charges, served a short sentence in federal prison, and was deported to Vietnam.

The revelation that an Asian wireless operator was actively purchasing military hardware comes at a tough time for foreign technology companies hoping to operate in the U.S. In May, the FCC [denied](&lt;|url|&gt;) a license for China Mobile USA to operate in the U.S. following Team Telecom’s recommendation that the move would “raise substantial and serious national security and law enforcement risks.”

That same month, President Donald Trump signed an [executive order](&lt;|url|&gt;) giving the federal government the power to block U.S. companies from buying foreign telecom equipment that could pose a risk to national security. This move was aimed squarely at the Chinese networking giant Huawei amid concerns over cybersecurity and surveillance.

Huy Quang Bui is not your stereotypical international arms smuggler. According to court documents, he was a diligent student growing up in the countryside outside Hanoi in the 1990s. His father was a teacher and the keeper of a local temple, while his mother worked in a Russian garment factory to put Bui through college.

When he graduated in 2007 with degrees in English and economics, Bui went to work at Viettel, the largest telecoms company in Vietnam. He was soon posted internationally, working on broadband for agriculture, health, and education projects in Cambodia and Haiti.

In early 2013, Viettel assigned Bui to Florida to promote the sale of telephone minutes to the Haitian and Peruvian diaspora by forming a local business, the VTA Telecom Corporation. The company’s stated aim was to sell international calling cards, and ultimately to develop a Viettel phone network within the U.S.

The first step was for Bui to apply to the FCC for permission to provide phone services between the U.S, and Cambodia, Cameroon, Haiti, Laos, Mozambique, Peru, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. VTA’s application noted that it was 100% owned by Viettel, which is in turn “a 100% state-owned enterprise, under the management of the government.”
> # Viettel was interested in much more than just American subscribers. It wanted American weapons.

However, it did not inform the FCC that Viettel’s Vietnamese name, Tập đoàn Công nghiệp Viễn thông Quân đội, translates to “Military Telecommunications Industry Group,” and that the company is actually wholly owned and operated by Vietnam’s Ministry of Defense.

In reality, Viettel was interested in much more than just American subscribers. It wanted American weapons.

The FCC is responsible for licensing all telecoms services in the U.S. and must consider the public interest — including national security risks — when doing so. Without in-house expertise to assess those risks, the FCC defers to the executive branch, represented by Team Telecom.

Team Telecom was shown VTA’s application in July 2013. In August, it asked the FCC to put the application on hold while it was reviewed for national security, law enforcement, and public safety issues. This was nothing unusual.

Team Telecom’s assessments typically start with a long list of questions seeking to discover whether an applicant has connections to foreign governments, how significant those links might be, and whether the proposed telecom systems would be subject to outside surveillance or control.
> # Bui’s court case provides a rare glimpse into how U.S. national security agencies take down a rogue technology company.

Team Telecom’s investigations can take months or even years in the case of a complex, multinational enterprise like China Mobile. And while Team Telecom is working, the application is stalled at the FCC — a process that FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly once described as “[an inextricable black hole](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

Bui’s court case provides a rare glimpse into how U.S. national security agencies take down a rogue technology company. It is unclear from court documents which federal agency carried out the investigation into VTA Telecom, but it was probably sparked by Bui’s increasingly suspicious behavior during 2015.

Although he was meant to be focusing on calling cards, Bui was also regularly asked by his superiors in Vietnam to procure various items for Viettel. Early that summer, Bui began negotiations for a sophisticated motion sensor used in commercial aircraft and satellites, but also in bombs, missiles, and torpedoes. Bui first advised the Connecticut-based manufacturer that the item would be used in California, then later admitted it would be sent to Vietnam.

In June 2015, he approached a Florida company about buying 10 video tracking systems. This time, there was no ambiguity about their intended use — the trackers were designated “significant military equipment” under U.S. International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), and thus subject to strict export controls. The U.S. government believes these trackers were ultimately exported without the necessary licenses.

Then in August, Bui attempted to purchase mechanical components for a missile from a third company. When the supplier told him the device was also ITAR-controlled, Bui responded that he did not have time to get an export license, and requested that his and VTA’s name be removed from all paperwork in the deal.

It is possible that one or more of these companies tipped off one of Team Telecom’s parent agencies because, by early 2016, a fully-fledged sting operation was underway.

Sandia Technical Supply LLC was supposedly a small defense equipment supplier based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, managed by one Robert Martinez. In fact, Sandia was nothing more than a [Delaware-registered shell company](&lt;|url|&gt;), incorporated anonymously in 2014. Sandia’s physical address is a downtown UPS store, its logo is lifted from clip art, and “Martinez” was an undercover federal agent. (Martinez does have a profile on [LinkedIn](&lt;|url|&gt;), a platform known to be used in [espionage operations](&lt;|url|&gt;).)
> # Bui had progressed from selling telephone cards to shopping for engines made for the U.S. military’s premier anti-ship cruise missile, the Harpoon.

Despite its paper-thin cover, Sandia Technical Supply fooled Bui. In a March 2016 email to Martinez discussing some kind of explosive bolt, Bui casually added: “We also have other requirement on turbines jet engine with spec as follow: turbojet Teledyne J402-CA-400. Major application: Harpoon.”

Bui had progressed from selling telephone cards to shopping for engines made for the U.S. military’s premier anti-ship cruise missile, the Harpoon.

Over the next few weeks, Martinez and Bui exchanged numerous emails. Several times, Martinez warned Bui that the Harpoon engines were controlled military parts and that he would need an export license from the State Department — a near-impossibility given America’s long-standing embargo on selling arms to Vietnam.

Then Martinez dangled the bait. “We recommend doing this legally,” he wrote to Bui, “but if you don’t want to wait for all of that, we can deliver, but you must understand [that] our commission and shipping will be higher.”

In May, Bui traveled to a Teledyne facility in Ohio with representatives of Sandia to see the J402 in person and made a $20,000 down payment. VTA ultimately ordered 11 engines and accessories for a total of $1.2 million.

Martinez supplied Bui with an End User Certificate, supposedly to smooth shipment to Vietnam. Bui wrote in it that the engines were destined for “unmanned aerial vehicles for the surveillance system in remote and tough area.” But that was just the official line. In a separate email, Bui told Martinez that Viettel would need expert help to adapt the J402 for use as a “type of Harpoon missile.”

On October 25, 2016, Bui was [indicted in New Mexico District Court](&lt;|url|&gt;) on two counts of trying to export defense equipment from the U.S. without the required licenses. He was arrested the next week in California. This is normal procedure in federal white collar crime prosecutions.

At his sentencing hearing nearly a year later, Bui told the court: “My actions have stemmed from my desire… to work in the United States, and [so] my child would have a better environment and more opportunities in the future. I had tried to take a shortcut, to complete my task short, fast and least expensive.”

Bui’s offenses could have earned him 20 years in prison, but the government agreed to a plea deal of just a year and a day. “We must balance the interests of what kind of things might be discussed in a trial that we don’t want discussed, quite frankly,” a prosecutor told the judge. “Methods of detection of these types of crimes are pretty closely-held secrets in the United States.”

After serving his sentence, Bui was removed back to Vietnam, to rejoin his wife and child.

Since the case, VTA has given up any pretense of being just a phone company. In September 2017, VTA employed a firm of Washington lawyers to lobby for them. In a [filing required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act](&lt;|url|&gt;), the lawyers wrote that they would “meet with Members of Congress… as well as the Departments of State, Commerce, and Defense, to advocate on VTA/Viettel’s behalf on matters pertaining to Vietnamese defense and national security.”

VTA told *OneZero* that it “regrets the acts committed by its former employee, Mr Huy Bui, related to export controls,” and that it has cooperated fully with the U.S, government’s investigations. The company says it has replaced all the personnel involved in the matter, and implemented new export compliance policies and procedures “to remedy past actions and ensure future compliance with U.S. laws and regulations.”

Nearly six years after VTA’s initial filing, and with the president of its U.S. subsidiary having been convicted of arms smuggling, the FCC has still not decided whether Viettel is a fit applicant for a U.S. telecommunications license.

Neither the FCC nor the Team Telecom agencies responded to requests for comment.

Ironically, if Bui and Viettel had played by the rules, they probably would have been enjoying their cruise missile engines in Vietnam by now. Less than two weeks after Bui made his illegal down payment, then-President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. was lifting its arms embargo against Vietnam.

Eighteen months later, about the time Bui was being released from prison, President Trump went further. In [remarks before meeting Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phuc](&lt;|url|&gt;) in Hanoi, he said, “We would like you to buy your equipment from the United States… The missiles are in a category that nobody even comes close…. We make the greatest missiles in the world.”<|endoftext|>

# The Best Reason for Your City to Ban Facial Recognition

## The technology isn’t ready. Society isn’t ready. And the law isn’t ready.

![Photo: fanjianhua/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: fanjianhua/Getty*

This week, San Francisco became the first major U.S. city to bar itself from using facial recognition systems. The city’s Board of Supervisors voted 8–1 on Tuesday to prohibit the police and other public agencies — though not private companies — from using the emerging technology in any form as part of a larger bill to regulate broader surveillance efforts.

Some cheered the move as a victory for privacy and civil liberties. Some criticized it as a blow to law enforcement and public safety. And cynics dismissed it as an empty gesture, given that San Francisco wasn’t using facial recognition technology in the first place.
> # We’re not prepared as a society to ensure that facial recognition will be used responsibly and without discriminatory effects.

But you don’t have to be a hippie or a Luddite to see the logic in a ban like San Francisco’s. It makes sense even if the effect is nil in the short term, and even if you think facial recognition could be a valuable tool in the long term. The logic is simple: We’re not ready for it.

We’re not prepared as a society to ensure that facial recognition will be used responsibly and without discriminatory effects. We’re not prepared as individuals for a world in which we can be automatically tracked and identified wherever we go without our knowledge or consent.

Even if we were ready, the technology itself isn’t: Experts both inside and outside the technology industry acknowledge that the artificial intelligence underlying facial recognition systems [still struggles with accuracy](&lt;|url|&gt;), particularly when it comes to identifying the faces of people of color — which is to say, the people who are most likely to be affected by it. In a test last year by the ACLU, Amazon’s facial recognition software falsely matched the faces of [28 members of U.S. Congress](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the mug shots of people who had been arrested. The mismatches disproportionately affected representatives of color.

Perhaps most important, our governments and law enforcement agencies are not prepared to guard against abuses of the technology or the data it produces, to ensure it is kept confidential, or to constrain its use to the appropriate situations. That was the clear takeaway from a [pair](&lt;|url|&gt;) of new [reports](&lt;|url|&gt;) from Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology, published on Thursday.

One report documents how two major U.S. cities, Chicago and Detroit, have [quietly set up systems](&lt;|url|&gt;) capable of monitoring people’s faces using cameras around the city and matching them to a mugshot database. Neither city government has been transparent about exactly how or where it’s using the system, which makes proper oversight impossible. And there are hints that Detroit’s system in particular may be violating people’s civil rights — for example, by targeting churches, clinics, and community centers for surveillance.

The second Georgetown report details how local law enforcement agencies are [playing fast and loose](&lt;|url|&gt;) with facial recognition systems, again without rules or oversight. When the New York Police Department can’t find a match for an actual photo of a suspect, it has been known to turn instead to photos of celebrities who resemble the suspect and find matches for the celebrity’s face. For instance, police used a photo of Woody Harrelson to find a match for the mug shot of a petty larceny suspect who had been described as resembling the famous actor. In other instances, they’ve used digitally altered images or even hand-drawn sketches to find matches for suspects. Many of the companies selling their facial recognition systems to cities boast that they can work with forensic sketches, even though studies have shown that the results tend to be wildly inaccurate.
> # The ability to passively surveil huge numbers of people, around the clock, all across a city, explodes the norms that privacy laws took for granted.

None of this is to say that facial recognition can’t be a valuable tool for law enforcement, whether in deterring crime, catching people who commit crimes, or even helping to establish a suspect’s innocence. We’ve already seen its value in at least one high-profile case: The technology was used to [help police identify the man](&lt;|url|&gt;) who allegedly killed five journalists in a June 2018 mass shooting in Annapolis, Maryland. It’s possible to imagine a future in which facial recognition is employed judiciously, with proper legal oversight, and society both understands and broadly accepts the privacy trade-offs.

But that future is not here yet. And it won’t come until we’ve modernized privacy laws to catch up with the technology. We have a system of legal protections and case law designed to deal with police search and seizure in a world where surveillance means staking out an individual’s house, following their car, or wiretapping their phone — albeit a system that relies in part on nebulous concepts like “reasonable expectation of privacy.” But the ability to passively surveil huge numbers of people, around the clock, all across a city, [explodes the norms](&lt;|url|&gt;) that those laws took for granted.

You can see that disconnect at work [in a video](&lt;|url|&gt;) the BBC published this week showing a police test of a facial recognition system in London. The test led to three arrests in a single day. But it also led to a confrontation when one presumably innocent man [shielded](&lt;|url|&gt;) his face from the camera — and police responded by grabbing him, pulling him aside, and taking his picture. He told reporters they also fined him 90 British pounds, or about $115.

Does facial recognition mean that people have to go around in public with their faces covered if they don’t want to be tracked by police? Does it mean they no longer have the right to do so? The authorities in the video justified accosting the man on the basis that his desire to avoid facial recognition made him suspicious, effectively providing them with probable cause. What might that mean for people who cover their faces for religious reasons?

Two years ago, when it issued its last report on facial recognition, Georgetown’s Center on Privacy and Technology recommended “common-sense regulation” of the technology at the state level to guard against abuses. But the center changed its stance in the new report: Since 2016, the world has seen such a “dramatic range of abuse and bias” that the report now recommends that local, state, and federal governments place a moratorium on the technology. And any cities that ban it outright are “amply justified,” the report adds. In the* New York Times* on Thursday, [Farhad Manjoo agreed](&lt;|url|&gt;).

So do I.

Banning facial recognition for law enforcement won’t stop the technology from progressing. Private companies will continue to develop it, and no doubt some will put it to dubious or even nefarious uses of their own. That’s a separate problem that requires its own set of solutions, but it is not an argument for governments to plow ahead.

Facial recognition surveillance may be the future. But in the present, it’s out of control — literally. And it needs to be stopped before the phrase “reasonable expectation of privacy” loses all meaning.<|endoftext|>

# How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Doctors More Human

## In a new book, a prominent cardiologist argues that A.I. could fix our broken health system — if we get it right

![Credit: Menno van Dijk/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Menno van Dijk/Getty Images*

Technology has helped cardiologist Eric Topol save lives. While on an airplane several years ago, a flight attendant asked if there was a doctor on board—a man was suffering from chest pain at 30,000 feet. Topol was able to obtain an electrocardiogram from the man by using a heart activity–reading gadget that attached to his smartphone, made by the medical device company AliveCor.

“It turned out to be a big anterior heart attack I could see right on my smartphone,” says Topol, director and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego. “I had to tell the folks to land the plane. He wound up doing pretty well.”

Although Topol used his smartphone to conduct the ECG, it wasn’t an algorithm that led to the man’s diagnosis; it was Topol’s years of knowledge as a cardiologist. The technology could complete the test, but without Topol to interpret the results, it would have been useless. “It was me, the human algorithm,” he says.
> # “It’s vital that this time we get it right, because we’ll likely never have another opportunity like this, and we’ve got to seize it.”

But in late 2017 — just six years after the in-flight medical emergency — the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an algorithm developed by AliveCor for the Apple Watch that no human can match. Thanks to the algorithm embedded in the watch’s band, the watch can continuously monitor your heartbeat for signs of atrial fibrillation, a common disorder that carries a high risk of stroke. It learns your heart rate at rest and when you’re active; if it detects an apparent abnormality, the watch alerts you to put your thumb on the watchband to record an ECG. (Apple has since developed a similar algorithm that is a feature in the most recent version of its watch, Apple Watch 4.)

The technological transition of the ECG from a test that requires a doctor’s interpretation to one that can be done on a wearer’s wrist is just one example Topol cites in his new book, [*Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. Topol spoke to *OneZero* about *Deep Medicine *and the many ways A.I. offers an opportunity to fix a broken health care system and how it could change the medical experience for better or for worse.

*The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.*

### **OneZero: How do you define artificial intelligence as it applies to medicine?**

**Eric Topol:** We now have the capability to know the medical essence of a person. We never had the ability to do that until now. We didn’t have all these layers of data, whether it’s from your wearable sensors for your physiology, high-resolution scans, your genome, your gut microbiome, all your data from your traditional medical records. But it’s too overwhelming to make sense of it. We need help. The whole idea now is that with artificial intelligence, we can take all this data and do so much with it. This is a remarkably exciting time for health care.

### **You begin ‘*Deep Medicine’* by describing “shallow medicine.” What is that?**

The problem is that we have very little time with patients. Looking at it both from the doctor and the patient side, the whole relationship has been eroding steadily throughout the 40 years since I graduated from medical school. It’s not just the time, though that’s a big part of it. It’s also all the mistakes. It’s the inability to have all of a person’s data, the inability to keep up with all the medical literature.

Another dimension is the burnout. It’s estimated that 50 percent of clinicians, not just doctors, are in this state of burnout because medicine has lost its way. This sets up a vicious cycle, because people who burn out have double or more risk of making medical errors. But I believe the biggest problem here is the combination of a lack of deep understanding of each human being and a lack of the deep empathy that is necessary to build a trusting and caring patient-doctor relationship. Those are the two fundamental issues. If we can fix those — which I think we can with deep learning and A.I. — then we can get back on track.

### **Computational technology doesn’t have a pulse. How can it be enlisted to bring the humanity back into medicine?**

Well, that’s certainly the whole paradox. Up until now, technology has taken us south in terms of our humanity. Electronic health records have broken the backs of clinicians and made them into data clerks. So why would anyone in their right mind think that we could have a rescue through technology? I went into this whole multiyear book project without this notion, but I became acutely aware that this is our best shot ever. That’s because we’ve never had a technology that could actually give us the gift of time. A.I. would markedly augment human performance, doctor performance, clinician performance, and at the same time empower consumers and patients to take charge of their health.
> # “The deterioration of the doctor-patient relationship is so fundamental to what ails us.”

### **Sounds a little too good to be true.**

There’s one big caveat, and that is it can make things worse. The administrators, the bean counters, say, “See more patients, read more scans, read more slides.” That could get worse if you’re more productive with machine support. “Oh, you read 50 scans a day? Well, good, now you can read 400.” We can’t let that happen, and that’s going to take unprecedented activism in the medical community. It’s vital that this time we get it right, because we’ll likely never have another opportunity like this, and we’ve got to seize it.

### **Doctors are notoriously slow to adopt new technology. What will it take for them to trust and use A.I. with their patients?**

The only sure-fire way we can get A.I. broadly implemented is through rigorous research that provides unequivocal proof of benefit for patients. It’s early in the A.I. medical era, so naturally there is a real paucity of peer-reviewed, prospective trials with independent replication of outcome improvement. In fact, there isn’t even one that fulfills all that now. Most of what we have so far is retrospective “in silico” work from large data sets that has yet to be taken to real-world medical practice. There can’t be any exceptionalism for a strong evidence basis required for A.I. to change health care. Many will argue that the bar should even be higher because of the potential harm for algorithms to be rapidly applied to patients at scale.

### **What is the risk of harm from a renegade algorithm?**

It’s small, but we live in a world with pervasive hacking. Beyond that, we’re all familiar with the occurrence of software glitches. We need to be mindful of this possibility, albeit small or remote. Time will tell, but it’s certainly one of the things I’m worried about.

### **Some doctors worry A.I. will make them obsolete. Will medicine be taken over by robots?**

Well, this is a silly notion that we’re not going to need doctors, that people are just going to get treated by algorithms. That’s absurd. Machines don’t have judgment; they don’t have context. They have an insatiable hunger for data, whereas people have early satiety with data. So we want to basically offload this analytical side. But you don’t want to entrust a machine to make a major decision about a diagnosis, a treatment, or a surgery without human oversight.

### **In the book, you also cite data security and other concerns around the technology.**

We can have algorithms that go off the track. They get hacked. They have glitches in them that are unforeseen. They don’t perform like they’re supposed to. These algorithms that are going to be central as we go forward, they’ve got to have a backup. So I strongly refute the notion that we’re going to have a lack of need for clinicians.

### **Given your career as a cardiologist, how do you see A.I. affecting the treatment of heart disease?**

In cardiology, there’s so much room for this. The first thing is keyboard liberation: no screen and no keyboard in the patient encounter. It’s actually a real human bonding experience, intimate, with trust and presence. That’s step one. Second, tests like the cardiogram or echocardiogram would be machine-read — and not like the pathetically error-laden machine-read electrocardiograms we’ve had since the 1980s. But with deep learning, it’s not just about fixing up the error problem. We’re going to learn all these things that we didn’t know before.

With deep learning, the machines can see what we could never see, because you feed in a million Mayo Clinic electrocardiograms linked to the “ground truths,” the actual details of what the patients had, and all of a sudden it’s ridiculously intelligent.

The other big thing in cardiology is patients generating their own data. Rather than send people for a lab test or a one-off blood pressure reading during an office visit, we just tell them to use their smartwatch, or we send them a sensor bandage to monitor their heart rate or manage their glucose. So people are much more engaged and have data that’s being processed through algorithms in their real world, and they work with it.

### **You have a provocative chapter on diet as another important consumer A.I. application. How could A.I. change our view of what we should eat?**

We’ve had these food pyramids and national guidelines on what you should eat, never based on any real science but on the simplistic notion that the same diet is right for all people. That was really stupid. The food diaries and the way people have done these studies all these years are so inaccurate.

Now, with A.I., we’re starting to figure out the individualized diet. Machine learning, for instance, can help predict a person’s unique glycemic response to their diet. Or it can integrate what a person eats with data about the time they eat, their level of physical activity, and their medications, lab tests, genome sequence, and gut microbiome. It’s just beginning — we don’t have all the data in. But the nutrition science world will be upended, because it was not really science—it was kind of a stab in the dark.

### **What’s the main point you hope readers of the book come away with?**

When I ask a group of people, “Have you been roughed up by health care in the U.S. today?” hardly anybody says no. We’ve got to stop that roughing up. We’ve got to use the future to bring back the past and get to the point where we have time and reflection and the human bond. The deterioration of the doctor-patient relationship is so fundamental to what ails us. I’m trying to be optimistic. I know full well this is going to take a while. This is as powerful a technology that we’ll likely see for fixing what ails health care in our lifetime.<|endoftext|>

# The Hidden History of How the Government Kick-Started Silicon Valley

## Margaret O’Mara, author of The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America, explains why it’s time to move past the tech sector’s creator myths

![Photo: Chesnot/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Chesnot/Getty*

Margaret O’Mara remembers working as a staff member at the Clinton White House in the early 1990s when she watched in amazement as a colleague in the Department of Health and Human Services sent an email to his son at college. It was the first time she’d seen someone send an electronic message, and it was “very uncommon, especially in D.C. political circles,” she tells *OneZero*.

Now a tech historian at the University of Washington — she began her academic career at Stanford in 2002, first as a fellow and then teaching — O’Mara dedicates her time to studying the intersection of tech and U.S. politics, and looking at the internet through a historical lens. Her latest book, [*The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, re-examines the self-serving genesis tales around tech’s biggest breakthroughs, dispelling the myth that entrepreneurs alone are responsible for the great tech innovations of our time. In this wide-ranging work, O’Mara delves into the history of the Valley, from the 1930s when David Packard built the foundation for what became Hewlett-Packard (HP), to our modern, always-connected society, exploring the important figures, policies, and global events that changed the course of tech history.

*OneZero* spoke with O’Mara to discuss how Silicon Valley was born and why she thinks big tech companies like Facebook should be treated like the Standard Oil monopoly of the 1920s.

*This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.*

### ***OneZero*: Figures like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg are considered practically superhuman for their impact on the tech landscape. But your book lays out how government investment has been instrumental in driving tech innovation. So why do these founder myths persist?**

**Margaret O’Mara: **It’s kind of the quintessential American story, right? The story of rugged individualism, the rebels and the revolutionaries who overthrew a monarch and started a whole new country. The “pull yourself up by your own bootstraps” tale that has been celebrated throughout American history. We love heroes — both in Hollywood and in real life.

So in Silicon Valley, or the tech industry more broadly, you have these genius individuals who do extraordinary things. But these breakthroughs are made possible by a larger cast of thousands around them, by broader social structures, and by other things that America, writ large, makes possible — whether it be public policies or public education.
> # No one was sitting behind a desk in Washington saying, “Oh, this is how we’re going to build a tech industry.” But that is what happened.

The government often becomes a catalyst in ways that are perhaps not consciously intended. And that is part of the magic. Dwight Eisenhower never declared, “I shall build a science city in Northern California.” Yet the military spending and space program spending that started under Eisenhower was the launching pad for Silicon Valley’s rocket.

### **How did federal contracts create those building blocks? How is Fairchild Semiconductor, an early, transformative Silicon Valley company that built semiconductors and circuits, an example of the collaboration between government and industry?**

In the 1960s, the space race creates this opportunity for, and this demand for, smaller and smaller things. So the military and nonmilitary work are closely intertwined.

Federal contracts were Fairchild Semiconductor’s bread and butter. The integrated circuit was developed at Fairchild by Bob Noyce and others which proved to be an extraordinary advance in transistor technology — the beginning of the microprocessor that would eventually become a computer on chip miniaturization. It was an extraordinary device, but there was no commercial market for it. Then the Apollo program becomes a customer, and when NASA orders up a whole slew of those chips, that drives down the price. Then you were able to scale it up and make it something that can be a commercial product.

No one was sitting behind a desk in Washington saying, “Oh, this is how we’re going to build a tech industry.” But that is what happened.

### **Why did the Santa Clara Valley become come the country’s tech hub, rather than Boston, where you have Harvard, MIT, and a plethora of researchers? What was special about California — and, specifically, this area?**

For the first few decades after World War II, Silicon Valley was always trying to compete and catch up to Boston. And while people like to talk about how they were rivals, the power of both places came from a symbiotic relationship. You had people bouncing back and forth. You have people educated at MIT coming out west. It’s really not until the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of the mini-computer industry that Boston falls off the map.

The Valley was isolated — which initially made it difficult to get people to move there. And so the people who did move there were these kind of young, scrappy people who might not have had the family connections or the wealth that would have gotten them a job at a Fortune 500 company. That might have made them more willing to come out west and try something new.

East coast companies, like IBM, opened outposts in the Valley in the 1950s, and the reason they’re coming is Stanford. Stanford is now mentioned in the same breath as Harvard, right? But Stanford and Harvard are radically different institutions in conception and design. Harvard was created to educate 17th century clergymen. It’s a liberal arts school that has grown to be a major research institution. Even MIT is the product of a certain time and place. But Stanford is a product of the 19th century, founded by a railroad baron and his wife with an explicitly pragmatic purpose: to put useful things into the world.

Also, Stanford created industry affiliate programs for people to work at local electronics companies and get their graduate degrees on the side for free, making it very appealing to the young smart guys who didn’t have a lot of money. They also did something none of their peers were doing: building entire engineering programs oriented towards the cutting edge of industries. Look at semiconductors. Dean of Engineering, Fred Terman dispatched a newly-hired assistant professor named Jim Gibbons to the newly-opened Shockley Semiconductor company — that’s Silicon Valley’s very first chipmaker, founded by a Nobel prizewinning inventor of the transistor. His job there was to figure out how they built the things so he can come back to Stanford and set up an entire lab and program that trains people in semiconductor technology. No other university is doing that.

### **The “Big Five”** — **Apple, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft** — **have a combined valuation of over $3 trillion. As a historian, what do you think of the size and scale of these companies? And what is the role of government in regulating them?**

The growth of the Big Five, and the significance of these large companies on so many aspects of global life, makes understanding this history all the more important. If we understand the origins of these companies and the business communities that they come from, we get a better sense of how and why they’re doing what they’re doing. Not only why they’ve been so successful, but where their blind spots might lie. A couple of decades ago, they didn’t exist. And now they’re having to reckon with the fact that they aren’t just disrupting the markets they set out to disrupt, but they’re disrupting so many other things.

When the rules of the road for the internet economy were being laid out in Washington, D.C. in the 1990s, tech advocates would say, “We need to make sure that this internet economy doesn’t get squashed by the big, bad business of big media companies and cable companies.”
> # The industry made a convincing argument that they would self-regulate free speech.

When the Communications Decency Act, section 230, was written, which holds that these social media platforms are not responsible for what happens on them, Google was still a couple of years away from being incorporated. No one was thinking about the political conversation about, say, pornography on the internet. And the industry made a convincing argument that they would self-regulate — that it would be wrong to contain speech.

There was legitimate worry that the big companies that controlled speech, or controlled communication, would find some way to somehow squash what Mitch Kapor (co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the creator of web browser, Firefox) memorably called the “Jeffersonian Internet” [[in a 1993 *Wired* article](&lt;|url|&gt;)]. We’re not Jeffersonian anymore. Not even Hamiltonian — it’s bigger than that.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the Progressive Era in the 1920s. There was a similar, dizzying degree of change — new industries had grown very large, and there was great anxiety about the immense power of companies like Standard Oil, and the lack of consumer choice that came along with it.

We’re at another moment like that. This is the great dilemma of 2019 Silicon Valley: How do you harness the dynamism? Even though the mood is kind of sour right now, there are a lot of good things coming out to the Valley. I’m talking to you on my iPhone, aka supercomputer. It’s kind of amazing. How do we keep that, but recognize that we’re in a different place?<|endoftext|>

# Why One Arctic Fox Took the Longest Migration in the Species’ History

## The effects of climate change can be tracked in a single animal’s record-breaking journey

![Credit: Education Images/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Education Images/Getty Images*

Twenty-seven hundred miles — 2,743, to be exact — is how far one arctic fox traveled over sea ice and glaciers last year during a 76-day polar marathon. The fox’s journey began on the island of Spitsbergen, off the coast of Norway in the Svalbard archipelago, and ended on Ellesmere Island in Canada’s remote Nunavut Territory, a full continent away.

The migration was among the longest ever recorded for an arctic fox. The farthest northern point reached by the juvenile female was on the sea ice off Greenland at more than 87 degrees north, not far from the North Pole.

Researchers from the Norwegian Polar Institute and the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research studied the fox’s movements via satellite tracking; they captured her in Spitsbergen and placed a small transmitter on the fox which then transmitted daily location every three hours. The young fox, who lived on the coast and weighed a little over 4 pounds when weighed by researchers, started the trip in her blue fur pelage on March 26, 2018, and averaged about 28.5 miles a day. While on Greenland’s ice sheet, she more than tripled her time, averaging about 96 miles a day, the fastest movement rate ever recorded for the species.

Arctic foxes are an impressive species. In the barren tundra, they’re known as [secret gardeners](&lt;|url|&gt;) because during long winters they spend so much time in their dens — where they bring back kills that decompose, creating what’s essentially fertilizer, turning their mound-like homes into splashes of color in an otherwise drab landscape. Their long-distance roaming has been known since the days of early polar explorers like Fridtjof Nansen, who observed fresh fox tracks far offshore on the sea ice during his 1885 North Pole expedition aboard the* Fram*. “Why do they leave the coasts?” Nansen wrote in his journals, as confused by the animal’s behavior as modern biologists. And why do they travel so far from land on the ice, he wondered. “That is what puzzles me most. Can they have gone astray?”
> # “It’s exciting because it opens our eyes to how connected these different populations are. It’s amazing.”

Modern biologists say no. “This was not just a fox that sat on a piece of ice and floated over to Canada,” says Helle V. Goldman, chief editor of [*Polar Research](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, the journal that published the research June 25.

“It’s exciting because it opens our eyes to how connected these different populations are,” says Goldman. “It’s amazing.”

Eva Fuglei and Arnaud Tarroux, the study’s co-authors, suggest this animal’s travel is food-driven, with the sea ice serving as a platform linking distant populations. Being a very versatile predator — foxes are able to make a living off a wide variety of prey — means options. But even the most open-minded foodie is a prisoner of the menu, and when nothing’s on it, they hit the road.

Foxes aren’t good swimmers. Their puffy coats offer insulation, but only if they’re dry. So when they sojourn onto the sea ice, which they often do, they’re usually following polar bears on their seal hunts. Since bears prefer the fatty blubber of seals, they often leave the rest of the protein-rich flesh, which makes for a hearty meal for a hungry fox. Some stops on this fox’s itinerary, such as extended stays on the ice, suggest that seals may very well have been on the menu, which means ice bears would have been the *chefs de cuisine*.

The new findings, which support previous research that shows the species’ very wide-ranging travel, also suggest that there’s likely a healthy amount of gene flow among foxes throughout their circumpolar distribution. But since long-distance migration and gene flow between regions of the Arctic depend on the swiftly dwindling sea ice, some fox populations will become geographically and genetically isolated.

While this won’t necessarily mean the end of the species, as there are other island-bound populations of foxes which seem to be doing well, the long-term consequences of isolation in places like Svalbard, where this fox originated, remain unknown. Climate change isn’t a one-direction narrative. A [major glacier in Greenland was recently found to be growing](&lt;|url|&gt;), not shrinking — and some mammals, like [baleen whales in the Bering Sea, are doing well](&lt;|url|&gt;) since the melt unlocks food formerly locked in the ice.

James Roth, an associate professor in the biology science department at the University of Manitoba, thinks this movement is both climate-related — and not. “This is where sea ice and climate plays a role,” he says. “If as predicted, and winter sea ice disappears in the fairly near future, then some of the fox populations are going to be cut off from one another and we may not see these types of migrations again because it’s not possible to walk that far.”

In 2010, an arctic fox was found to travel a similar distance, but not nearly as quickly. It took that fox over five and a half months to make the trip, while this fox did it in four months, making the newbie a record holder in terms of movement rate and speed. These new findings are also the first time an arctic fox has been documented on a cross-continental migration.

Roth, who has been studying arctic foxes in and around Hudson Bay since 1994, agrees with the co-authors that this behavior has as much to do with food availability as anything else. But the climate question and its implications are where things really get interesting. It’s not that a warming climate exactly made the fox leave home, but a warming climate does impact how other species reproduce, and [even whether foxes remain monogamous](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Without a steady prey supply, foxes do not pair for life because they can’t rely on food sources, an interaction which sends them on their way — another complicated consequence of climate change. But the biggest effect, Roth suggests, is what happens down the line, since the biggest consequence of a changing climate for arctic foxes may come from other foxes.

As the tundra changes and the tree line moves farther north with a warming climate, so do* *red foxes, which are bigger and more aggressive than their northern cousins. There are no red foxes on Svalbard, but across the rest of their range—from Northern Canada to Russia—they often displace native arctic foxes, taking their dens and killing them in a bid for territory and prey.

“How are arctic foxes going to do in the long run in relation to climate change if they have to compete with a similar species that has a similar size?” says Roth. “That’s one of so many questions related to climate that we just don’t know. But we will soon, and research like this, and tagging more foxes, will help give us answers.”<|endoftext|>

# News Needs to Meet Its Audiences Where They Are

## Faced with avoidant consumers, media companies must experiment with different technological formats

![Credit: John Lamb/DigitalVision/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: John Lamb/DigitalVision/Getty*

The Reuters Institute released its annual [Digital News Report](&lt;|url|&gt;) last week, and among its many findings a couple jump out.

One is that when it comes to news, more people are putting their heads in the sand. Almost one third (32%) of the world’s population avoids the news, up 3% from 2017, the report found. In the U.S. that figure is higher at 41%, up from 38% in 2017. As the [American Press Institute and Nieman Lab](&lt;|url|&gt;) have pointed out, there are a lot of reasons behind this news avoidance problem, but the leading cause for Americans (at 57%) seems to be: “It can have a negative effect on my mood.”

Secondly, the report found that given concerns about misinformation, more people are turning to trusted brands. And more people — especially the younger cohort — are also turning to podcasts for news because they find podcasts “deal with serious issues in an engaging way.” Interestingly, millennials between the ages of 25 and 34 say they are turning to podcasts because they “learn something” (52%) or “to keep updated” (54%). Those numbers are higher for the 45+ crowd (at 54% and 55%, respectively). Podcasts are more diverse and less stuffy, respondents told Reuters — offering “a diverse range of news ideas and thoughts from vastly different people, not your traditional people who look and act a certain way.”

All of which begs the question: Can news organizations recoup defectors and broaden audiences by changing their tune?

Efforts to do so are underway. [Tortoise](&lt;|url|&gt;) avoids breaking news. The London-based organization is carving a niche for readers who want to “slow down and wise up.” Problem-solving is at the *Guardian*’s mainstay at [The Upside,](&lt;|url|&gt;) as it is at the [Solutions Journalism Network](&lt;|url|&gt;), a not-for-profit that says it works to “legitimize and spread the practice of ‘solutions journalism’ defined as ‘rigorous, unbiased reporting about credible responses to social problems.’” The Solutions Network says it has collaborated with *The Miami Herald, Mississippi Today*, and Chicago’s public radio station WBEZ in addition to news outlets in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Montana, and Connecticut. Its members website [“The Hub”](&lt;|url|&gt;) functions as a toolkit of best practices for journalists to explore topics likely to strengthen democracy, health, and education. And it’s growing: Members are up from 1,075 to 3,415 in 2018, according to its most recent [annual report](&lt;|url|&gt;), as are followers on social media.

At *The New York Times*, it is Anna Dubenko’s job to strategically amplify *Times* journalism beyond the newspaper’s app and website. In a “Personal Tech” column [published this week](&lt;|url|&gt;), she described her efforts to track how readers consume news and spend their time online. As Dubenko explores how to make *Times* journalism work on platforms like Apple News, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Pocket, she [told](&lt;|url|&gt;) the *Times*: “I try to put myself in readers’ shoes to figure out how to make our stories match what they’re looking for.”

Some [media outlets](&lt;|url|&gt;) are taking a lighter approach. In an effort to better connect with their communities, they are putting funny news quips on [TikTok](&lt;|url|&gt;), a destination for short-form mobile videos popular with the younger crowd.

Others are experimenting with unexpected corners of the Internet. For a while now, I’ve observed students in my Stanford classes turn to “gamification” as a design solution to the many engagement and distribution challenges facing the news industry. It’s a model that inspired Phoebe Connelly, deputy director of video at *The Washington Post*, to team up with the live-streaming gaming platform Twitch. The experiment — a [*Post* Twitch channel](&lt;|url|&gt;)– has turned out to be a successful, if unlikely, collaboration.

With an enviable audience of over 100 monthly users between the ages of 13 and 24 spending on average 90 minutes a day on the platform, Twitch seemed to the *Post* like a good audience to get. At the same time, Cody Conners, Twitch’s Senior Manager for Content Acquisition, [told a class of Stanford students](&lt;|url|&gt;) last fall that Twitch had wanted to explore different verticals that might resonate with the platform’s audience, one that, he said, has varied interests like music and art. “I’m a big political and news fiend. I like to stay up-to-date with everything,” Conners told the class. “I had a hunch that we could put news adjacent to games and that could be powerful and meaningful on the platform.”

It turns out that a lot of the 90 minutes Twitch players spend on the platform is spent chatting. “Twitch is an experiential platform,” Conners said. “It’s like your favorite bar.”

It took some time for the collaboration to kick off but the two organizations (which are corporate step-siblings of a sort — Twitch is owned by Amazon and *The Washington Post *by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos) launched a politics channel in time to live-stream Mark Zuckerberg’s hearings on Capitol Hill earlier this year. Even for the most die-hard news junkie, a Congressional hearing can be a slog. But chat — moderated and kept civil by *The Post *— exploded.

The challenge for all news organizations is figuring out the right content to share with an “off-brand” audience. Identifying a popular platform or distribution channel doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a good fit. News organizations can’t just shove one brand into another. But Connelly — who adds that the *Post *is on [TikTok](&lt;|url|&gt;) too — argues that “finding new audiences by looking off platform and understanding how those audiences expect to receive news is what every media organization needs to be doing.”

Given the size of the news avoidance problem, more media organizations, like the trusted brands that Reuters found to be gaining traction, need to take stock. If they can change their tune and tone — “to deal with serious issues in an engaging way” — news organizations may be able to recoup some of the defectors Reuters identified and potentially gain revenue as well.

# If Congress Won’t Regulate A.I., States and Cities Will

## As the technology explodes, a growing movement of local legislation is setting the groundwork for A.I. regulation in the U.S.

It wasn’t hard to ban facial recognition in Somerville, Massachusetts.

In June, the city of 81,000 outside Boston became the second in the United States to ban public agencies from using the facial recognition technology. It’s part of a sweeping movement from local and state legislatures looking to regulate artificial intelligence.

“Once you kind of just raise the issue with people, they’re very quick to understand. This is not the kind of community that we want to be in Somerville,” says Ben Ewen-Campen, councilor for Somerville’s Ward 3 and sponsor of the city’s facial recognition ban. “In terms of pushback, there was essentially none.”

The [boom](&lt;|url|&gt;) of artificial intelligence in the last decade has meant that tools like facial recognition have shifted from sci-fi fodder to reality. “[Deepfakes](&lt;|url|&gt;)” make it relatively simple to create doctored video, while algorithms are being [used in the courthouse](&lt;|url|&gt;) to predict whether an offender might commit future crimes. So far, these tools have proliferated with little oversight. But lawmakers are starting to realize that A.I. is already having an enormous impact on society, one that will only grow in the years to come — and they’re coming to believe that the best way to mitigate potential harms is to enact legislation.

At the state level, Virginia and California have both passed A.I.-related laws, spanning from protections against deepfakes to policing how bots behave when talking to humans online. At the same time, cities across the country are exploring their own A.I. regulations. Like Somerville, some are going so far as to ban the use of facial recognition by public agencies; Oakland banned it on July 16, and San Francisco did so back in May.
> # “Cities don’t really have a choice but to put the brakes on this.”

Congress, though, has yet to even meaningfully discuss federal legislation on A.I., and will face a confusing patchwork of state and local legislation if it doesn’t take a stance on how it will act towards the technology. “Facial recognition really jumped out to me as something that’s unique in the power that it puts in the hands of the local government, and the degree to which it is being rolled out with no kind of oversight, no regulations, no transparency,” says Ewen-Campen. “In the absence of any state or federal oversight, I think cities don’t really have a choice but to put the brakes on this.”

State legislatures are also realizing that while A.I. technologies seem universal, they can have very specific impacts on local economies. In Vermont, legislators and private citizens have formed an Artificial Intelligence Task Force that studies the impacts A.I. could have on the state’s vital agricultural economy.

“In Vermont we suffer from a shortage of labor, particularly in the agricultural space,” says Mark Combs, chief technology officer (CTO) for the Vermont Agency of Digital Services and member of the task force. “So how can robotics and automation combat the labor shortage? How can it improve yields and reduce environmental impact?”

Combs said that in addition to more than a year’s worth of meetings, the task force has also been going on a listening tour through the state, to educate communities and get feedback on what people are worried about in the A.I. space. Concerns vary by geography. In areas with a higher concentration of tech startups, the conversation centered around business opportunities, especially around the field of smart agriculture, where the state hopes to become a leader, while in the more rural communities, people were concerned about how A.I. could “run amok,” as Combs put it.

He says that there is a place for the state government in regulating A.I., but the task force doesn’t yet have a concrete idea of what that should be. For starters, that might mean endorsing a clear, non-technical code of ethics for the development of A.I. in Vermont.

Regulation can have even more impact in states where A.I. is being most actively developed and deployed — like California. The Golden State has also been proactive in legislating the effects of artificial intelligence. Last year the state legislature passed a law requiring automated communication bots to identify themselves as bots rather than pretending to be human users.

The law, which went into effect this month, came after Google demonstrated a feature in 2018 called [Duplex](&lt;|url|&gt;) that was able to call a local business and converse with a person using a completely artificial voice. The idea was to create a kind of digital assistant that could help people complete tasks like making restaurant reservations, but which mimicked the human voice, down to “ums” and pauses to think. Google says it has since changed the way that its bot interacts with people over the phone, but companies looking to build customer service bots or bots that take on certain human jobs now either need to disclose their artificial nature or lose business in California. And since California is the epicenter of the industry’s A.I. boom — not to mention the most populous state in the country — simply ignoring it isn’t an option for tech companies.

Rashida Richardson, policy director of the nonprofit [AI Now](&lt;|url|&gt;)[ Institute at NYU](&lt;|url|&gt;), which researches the societal impacts of A.I., says states and local governments are pushing federal legislators to move faster on potential laws and guidelines. State and local laws can be a pain for tech companies — Sony, for example, [can’t sell](&lt;|url|&gt;) its robot dog Aibo in Illinois because of the state’s strict biometric privacy law which [requires](&lt;|url|&gt;) affirmative consent from people before analyzing their photos for facial recognition. Just as automakers would prefer a single standard for gas mileage or tailpipe pollution, unified legislation could limit the possibility of tech companies having to cater to 50 different sets of regulations in the United States. That would make it easier for tech companies to operate in the country, something that legislators — even as they move to regulate the industry — [desperately want](&lt;|url|&gt;) as the global A.I. race heats up.

“Advocates have learned that nothing is happening federally, or if it does, it’s very slow and often reactionary.” Richardson says. “So the best way to force legislating up is by forcing the conversation from a local level.”
> # In the more rural communities, people were concerned about how A.I. could “run amok,” as Combs put it.

But so far there has been little momentum in Congress for national rules. This April, a pair of bills called the [Algorithmic Accountability Act](&lt;|url|&gt;) were introduced to both houses of Congress. The legislation would force companies making more than $50 million in revenue per year to audit the bias of their algorithms for discrimination. New York’s congresswoman Yvette Clarke also introduced a bill in June that would regulate [deepfakes](&lt;|url|&gt;). None of these bills have moved forward yet.

“One thing that the federal government and this administration gets a bit of a bad rap on is a lack of activity on A.I. policy,” says Jack Clark, policy director at A.I. research firm [OpenAI](&lt;|url|&gt;). “But I think that used to be truer than it is now.”

While it’s not as visible as acts of Congress, Clark says that President Trump’s Office of Science and Technology Policy is coordinating A.I. efforts among federal agencies. In June, the office released an [update](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the office’s A.I. research and development plan*,* which recommended continuing A.I. investments in organizations like the National Science Foundation, DARPA, and the National Institutes of Health.

“The notion of coordinating among agencies is a stupefyingly boring and un-dramatic thing to do, but it’s inherently very useful, and having someone decide to do that is itself a good thing,” Clark says. “It’s worth giving credit where credit’s due, basically.”

State and local legislators are aware that they’re a part of a larger movement to address how A.I. is changing the country. Marcus Simon, a Virginia state delegate who sponsored the amendment to extend Virginia’s revenge porn law to deepfakes, says that creating this kind of state and local approach can help legislations figure out how A.I. needs to be regulated at the federal level.

He likens A.I. to the advent of the car. At first, there weren’t any traffic laws, because horses didn’t need any speed restrictions or stop signs. The result was [fatalities](&lt;|url|&gt;) and chaos as inexperienced car drivers navigated crowded city streets. So is A.I. such a transformative technology that new laws, like traffic ordinances, need to be created? Or should existing laws be altered to cover the impacts of A.I.?

“I do believe that state legislatures are good laboratories and proving grounds for new legal regimes,” says Simon. “People in Maryland, and DC, and California, and New York will start looking at what we’ve done to see whether we’ve had success or not.”

# An Open Letter to Uber&#58; We Need to Do Right By Our Drivers

## Signed by an employee of Uber

![Credit: Thomas Trutschel/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Thomas Trutschel/Getty Images*

*The authenticity of the following anonymous op-ed has been verified by Medium’s editorial staff.*

I am an Uber employee and I support the drivers’ strikes.

The strikes called on Monday by Rideshare Drivers United (RDU) in Southern California and Gig Workers Rising in San Francisco are a sign of the deep frustration many ride-share drivers feel — and which, amid ongoing conversations with colleagues, it is clear many internal Uber employees share — about the treatment of those workers that provide the services at the core of our business.

As an employee at the world’s leading ride-share company, I see firsthand not only the often meager earnings of our drivers, but also the exploitative labor practices imposed on a systemically disempowered workforce. I, therefore, stand with the striking drivers in calling for the implementation of RDU’s [Drivers’ Bill of Rights](&lt;|url|&gt;). While ride-share executives continue to receive vast remuneration packages, and internal employees look forward to an IPO windfall at both Uber and Lyft, my sympathetic colleagues and I will not remain silent as drivers are squeezed in order to shore up initial offerings to investors.

Our drivers are the backbone of the platform. Without them — as these courageous strikes have demonstrated — our business would come to a standstill. For this reason, we will not stand by as those that work at the heart of our business are attacked and exploited. We demand that all of our drivers are fairly remunerated, that they gain greater transparency about how their earnings are calculated, that they are guaranteed greater protections, and that their collective voice is heard in the boardroom.

As tech workers, we share more in common with the drivers that support the platform than the company executives that spend millions ensuring that ride-share companies, and others in the so-called gig economy, can continue to bend the law and exploit workers. We, therefore, reject the two-tiered division of labor that denies drivers the basic workers’ rights afforded to internal employees and call for the full implementation of the Dynamex decision in California.

We call on all tech workers to support the actions of ride-share drivers in their mission for fair pay, dignity, and respect and we demand the immediate reversal of the pay cut imposed on drivers in Los Angeles and Orange Counties.<|endoftext|>

# You’re Paying Into a Broken System Whenever You Buy Something on iOS

## You’re Paying Into a Broken System Whenever You Buy Something on iOS

### Apple’s unfair, monopolistic policies on its App Store hurt developers and consumers alike. But there’s a better way.

![](<|image|>)

Someone always pays the price for convenience. When you pay for something using the iOS App Store or Google Play on Android, developers may actually be the ones shouldering the burden, thanks to unfair policies around payments.

For example, Apple takes a 30% cut of anything sold through its App Store — be it an app download or a microtransaction within *Candy Crush* — which means a smaller profit for developers than they might get in an open app market. It’s the basis of a [long-running lawsuit](&lt;|url|&gt;) against Apple alleging a monopoly, [one that the Supreme Court](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [European Commission ](&lt;|url|&gt;)have proven sympathetic to, but the problem exists elsewhere in the industry. Tinder earlier this month [launched a new default payment system](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Android asking users to type their credit card information into the dating app rather than simply tapping into the default Google Play option that similarly supplies the search giant with a 30% cut of the app’s revenue.

Tinder joins a growing contingent of developers, big and small, that are removing App Store payments from their apps to protest what amount to convenience fees. Tinder, Netflix, Spotify, and *Fortnite*-maker Epic Games have all implemented similar workarounds on Android — but on iOS, Apple bans any alternative payment methods, leaving developers stuck paying 30% if they want their products distributed to iPhone and iPad users.

Apple also [expressly forbids](&lt;|url|&gt;) apps to mention alternative ways to pay, such as on the web. (“Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase,” the policy states.) In protest, Netflix and Spotify recently [removed](&lt;|url|&gt;) the ability to subscribe to their services via Apple’s App Store entirely — no more revenue-sharing with Apple — leaving customers at a dead end. Tinder still accepts payments on iOS, but it may only be a matter of time until it takes a similar step.
> # This is a textbook case of abuse of power, and so far, Apple’s gotten away with it.

Previously, developers worked around Apple’s policy by raising the prices of subscriptions by 30% on iOS to offset the price of subscribers joining on their mobile devices. Services like TunnelBear, a popular VPN service, still do this, but they aren’t allowed to mention that their services are available for less money elsewhere — if they do so, they risk being removed from the App Store.

On no other platform would we accept a scenario where the owner of that platform dictated not only the tools developers can use, but restricted the ways they talk about their products and pricing. We would call it unfair, monopolistic, and overbearing. But on our smartphones, it’s just a fact of life.

It’s time to reboot the system.

## Apple’s rules — or bust

Here’s the thing: If you’re a developer for iOS or macOS and want to charge customers money, the Apple-provided payment tools, which demand a 30% cut, are the only ones you’re allowed to use. It’s not even a discussion.

You’d assume that if Netflix or Spotify weren’t happy with the cut, they could just direct potential customers to their web browsers to pay for the service, but as I’ve mentioned, Apple outright forbids this in the App Store rules. Developers aren’t allowed to link to a site where users might find a way to pay, and can’t provide a sign-up link or even a simple URL, either. This leads to absurd situations like that of the Kindle app on iPad, where Amazon can’t even link to the Kindle store, and users must figure out on their own that they should visit it on the web to make purchases.

Generally, if you’re building a subscription service like Netflix or Slack, you’ll need to use a “payment provider” to facilitate the complexity that comes with accepting payments. There are many different companies to choose from, like Adyen, Stripe, and PayPal, and all of them integrate within your app to process payments on your behalf.

For each card processed, a developer will pay an average processing fee of around 2% to 3%, and they get much more control over how the payment process appears to the user. When building for the App Store, however, Apple forbids developers from using their existing providers — forcing them to route payments via Apple’s own tools and to pay that 30% cut.

It’s true that [Apple will reduce its cut to 15%](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the case of subscribers who stick around beyond the first year, but that’s cold comfort. Take Netflix, for example: It will compete on razor-thin margins with Apple’s forthcoming TV service, so the pricing structure presents a big disadvantage, as Apple can price its own services much lower given it’s not paying the same fees.

It’d be one thing if Apple passively provided a platform, but it directly competes with many of the apps on its own App Store. In the music space, which already lives on razor-thin margins, Apple is able to charge customers 30% less for Apple Music than Spotify, because it doesn’t need to pay its own fees. Spotify is either forced to pay artists less or lose money to compete at the same price point, which gives Apple an unfair advantage.

This is a textbook case of abuse of power, and so far, Apple’s gotten away with it.

## The solution

Developers should be able to build their own payment solutions in a similar way to those on Android, where an approved pop-over allows them to show their official payment gateway on the web.

That choice would enable real competition, and Apple’s payment tools would suddenly start competing for customers like on any other platform in history. Apple should be forced to compete on merit — if Apple’s payment solution is the best, developers will use it without being forced to.
> # Apple should charge developers for the bandwidth or other services they use, just like any other cloud platform.

Is any of this status quo justifiable? Apple fans are quick to point out that their 30% fee is fair because the company needs to somehow offset its costs for providing the App Store to developers, which helps them both reach audiences and distribute their apps for free at a massive scale. Apple also regulates the App Store, blocking developers whose apps are fraudulent or even dangerous. It’s a walled garden, and Apple mans the walls.

But this setup ignores how other industries have solved this problem: by offering choice. Cloud-hosting platforms charge their users for the bandwidth they consume, how much processor power they use, or the size of their servers. A simple solution here: If a developer decides to use their own payment tools to avoid the 30% fee, Apple should charge developers for the bandwidth or other services they use, just like any other cloud platform.

Or if that’s too complex, there’s a much simpler solution: Apple should not be allowed to arbitrarily restrict developers from mentioning they can pay on their own websites, particularly in categories it directly competes in. Keep the 30% cut and mandatory payment tools, but give developers a choice in the matter where they can send users to a website — or at least even mention its existence — to get the service for less money.

I reached out to Apple and asked for comment on all of this, but a representative did not immediately respond. In May, [Apple rolled out a new website](&lt;|url|&gt;) to respond to criticisms of its App Store model — with security and quality being the chief justifications.

“We take responsibility for ensuring that apps are held to a high standard for privacy, security, and content because nothing is more important than maintaining the trust of our users,”[ the site says](&lt;|url|&gt;).

All of this feels so ridiculous to write out, because the system is so obviously broken. In no other industry has this level of control ever been allowed to exist — Microsoft spent a decade [fighting an antitrust suit](&lt;|url|&gt;) over the fact that Internet Explorer was set as the default web-browsing service on Windows, ultimately settling for billions of dollars and a painful “browser choice” screen.

Apple, meanwhile, only allows app payments from a single source (its own), provides the exclusive payment tooling, and gouges developers while enforcing blatantly unfair rules over how they present their own services. If there were ever a prime case for breaking up a company, and forcing Apple to make the App Store an independent entity, this is it.

Until now, regulators have turned a blind eye, but recent news suggests that might change as the FTC begins to take a closer look at monopolies in the tech sector. Unless we all make noise about it, nothing will change — and everyone’s wallets will be worse off for it.<|endoftext|>

# Twitter Admits It Was Hiding Some People’s Tweets by Mistake — Again

## A popular Satan parody account was among those unfairly affected by a feature that critics have called ‘shadow banning’

![Photo: Anamika Samanta/EyeEm/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Anamika Samanta/EyeEm/Getty Images*

Twitter is giving the devil his due.

After a [*OneZero* article about a Satan parody account](&lt;|url|&gt;) whose owner felt his tweets were being unfairly hidden from public view, the company acknowledged late last week that a feature intended to limit trolls had been mistakenly affecting some legitimate accounts, including his. Twitter would not say how many other users were inadvertently caught up by its algorithm, which limits the public visibility of certain accounts based on their behavior and other signals, even if they haven’t broken the platform’s rules.

“Upon further investigation, we realize some of these systems were impacting people using Twitter in a healthy way and so we adjusted them,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement. “Thank you for surfacing this to us, we’re always working to improve.” The owner of the Satan account, a 26-year-old British man named Michael, confirmed to me that his account had been restored to good standing and has been rapidly gaining followers since then.

The snafu highlights how Twitter’s efforts to automate troll-fighting can quietly go awry, with little recourse for those affected. And it isn’t the first time.

Twitter has been besieged for years by spam bots, porn bots, and human users who use the site to spew hate or harass people. Its human content moderators have proven unable to stem this tide of ugliness, so last year it tried something new: an [automated filtering system](&lt;|url|&gt;). The goal of the system — which Twitter has never given a formal name — is to make the site feel friendlier and healthier by downgrading accounts that show signs of obnoxious or spammy behavior. It can downgrade them in different ways, such as burying their replies behind a warning at the bottom of threads, or preventing them from showing up in search results by default. Their followers can still see their tweets, but they become largely invisible to the average user. (When it launched, I dubbed it [“Twitter purgatory,”](&lt;|url|&gt;) a term that Twitter PR didn’t appreciate.)

Notably, Twitter doesn’t notify users affected by the system, and it won’t disclose its inner workings. That became a problem just weeks after its launch, when *Vice* reported that some prominent conservatives, including several Republican members of Congress, were [not showing up in the platform’s search suggestions](&lt;|url|&gt;). Twitter quickly [fixed the issue](&lt;|url|&gt;), but not before the report sparked an outcry and even [Congressional hearings](&lt;|url|&gt;), in which Twitter was accused by conservatives of political bias — a charge it has repeatedly denied.

*Vice* called the practice [“shadow banning,”](&lt;|url|&gt;) and the term has stuck among Twitter’s conservative critics, even though it’s slightly misleading: The users affected don’t become invisible; they just become harder to find.

Last month, a series of direct messages from the popular Satan parody account (Twitter handle [@s8n](&lt;|url|&gt;), 887,000 followers and counting) prompted me to look into [why the company’s systems appeared to be hiding him](&lt;|url|&gt;) from replies and search results. The account’s owner, Michael, was desperate, having spent weeks trying, without success, to contact anyone at Twitter who could tell him what was going on or why. Without commenting directly on his account, Twitter implied to me, at the time, that Satan had been limited because he was linked to other accounts that violated the platform’s rules — an accusation that Michael denied.

But it appears that story eventually prompted Twitter to take a closer look at how the feature was affecting certain accounts, including his. Two weeks after it was published, I got another direct message from Michael: “I have some good news, I’m pretty sure my account has been fixed.” A quick check confirmed that Satan once again showed up in public search results, and that his replies to other people’s tweets were no longer hidden behind a warning message at the bottom of the thread.
> # The recurrence of a problem similar to the one that sparked the “shadow banning” outcry suggests that the company’s opaque filtering algorithm has a penchant for overreaching.

Twitter confirmed to me last week that there had been a mistake. Specifically, the company said it found that too many accounts were being flagged by an aspect of the software that looks for potential links to other spammy or abusive accounts. That is, accounts that hadn’t actually broken Twitter’s rules themselves could still find themselves filtered from public view through a kind of guilt by association. It seems that some of those links to other, more problematic accounts turned out to be rather tenuous, prompting Twitter to adjust the system.

Twitter said that it believes that the platform’s systems are working properly now, but that it continues to monitor them.

Still, the recurrence of a problem similar to the one that sparked the “shadow banning” outcry suggests that the company’s opaque filtering algorithm has a penchant for overreaching. And the lack of transparency means that such missteps can go unnoticed and unaddressed even as those affected cry out for help or an explanation. In both instances, Twitter fixed the system only after the problems were reported in the media, which happened only because they involved high-profile accounts.

At least one other popular parody account, a [cat-centric account called @catsu](&lt;|url|&gt;) with close to 900,000 followers, told me it believes it, too, has been unfairly affected by the search-suggestions filter. “I don’t think it’s particularly fair to hide my page from people searching,” the account’s owner told me via direct message. “I mean, I literally just post cats!”

The owner of another, smaller account, @TweetOfSpirit, told me they too had been limited for reasons they didn’t understand. Both said they were still being affected, as far as they could tell. Twitter could not immediately comment on either one.

Michael, meanwhile, told me his Satan account had stagnated for months due to the filtering, but has taken off since returning to Twitter’s good graces. It has gained some 40,000 followers since the *OneZero* story was published on May 3. The additional engagement allowed [Satan to help a friend](&lt;|url|&gt;) reach a [$6,000 GoFundMe goal](&lt;|url|&gt;) to pay for a life-saving blood transfusion for her cat.

While Satan told me he appreciated Twitter getting the issue sorted out, he added that it was “a shame it took five months and an article to fix things.” At the risk of playing the devil’s advocate, I agree.<|endoftext|>

# Trump’s New Facebook Lawsuit Is a Trojan Horse

## A former attorney at Facebook explains

![Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images*

Imagine crafting an ad only for white people. Maybe you narrow down the targeting to a certain location and slice out certain ages for good measure. That might make sense if you’re trying to sell a cream-colored foundation in your Manhattan boutique, but you’d be ill-advised to try it for advertising housing or jobs — because it’s against the law.

And yet, in 2016, [a *ProPublica* report](&lt;|url|&gt;) detailed the ability to use an “ethnic affinity” option in Facebook’s self-service ad tool, allowing businesses to micro-target advertisements based on a variety of immutable demographic categories. A real estate company could use this tool to show ads for available properties only to certain races or gender.

That’s illegal according to [the 1968 Fair Housing Act](&lt;|url|&gt;), which clearly prohibits “the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.” At the time of *ProPublica*’s initial investigation, Facebook said it would update its ad-targeting product but hadn’t as of November 2017, when *ProPublica *published [a follow-up article](&lt;|url|&gt;). Then, in 2018, the [ACLU filed a complaint](&lt;|url|&gt;) with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that Facebook allowed gender-based discrimination for businesses advertising employment opportunities.

It finally seemed that the controversies related to ad targeting would come to a close earlier this month, when [the social network announced a settlement](&lt;|url|&gt;) with various civil rights groups, the state of Washington, and other regulators. Facebook definitely declared it would no longer allow advertisers to target specific users by age, gender, or zip code in ads for housing, jobs, or credit.

But last Thursday, the Ben Carson–helmed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) [filed suit against Facebook](&lt;|url|&gt;), alleging housing discrimination. As HUD Secretary Carson [said in a statement](&lt;|url|&gt;), “Facebook is discriminating against people based upon who they are and where they live.” He noted that the ad targeting amounted to a more advanced and surreptitious version of redlining — the practice of denying people access to vital services chiefly because of their race or ethnicity.

“Using a computer to limit a person’s housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone’s face,” Carson said.

This lawsuit, and the timing, raise two key questions: When is it the responsibility of a platform to make sure a user can’t exploit its tool for nefarious or illegal purposes? And since when does the Trump administration care deeply about discriminatory practices and subversion of the rights of minorities?

## **Publisher vs. platform: The classic problem**

The first question is complicated. Facebook has seen itself as a conduit to “[connecting the world](&lt;|url|&gt;).” While the company facilitates the creation and spread of content, it is not itself a content creator. Simply put, Facebook’s party line is that it’s a platform, [not a publisher or a media company](&lt;|url|&gt;). But where is that line drawn, and by whom? A key distinction can be found in the definitions of the words, and any good lawyer will tell you that words matter.

A platform, per the *Merriam-Webster Dictionary*, is “[a place or opportunity for public discussion](&lt;|url|&gt;).” It’s a forum and a means to communicate and share ideas, but a platform doesn’t create discussion topics, censor them, or hold any responsibility for the veracity of the information shared. A [publisher](&lt;|url|&gt;), however, is “a person or corporation who is engaged in publishing,” benefitting from the “commercial production and issuance of literature, information, musical scores or sometimes recordings, or art.”
> # While the HUD lawsuit seems altruistic, it may be a Trojan horse that seeks to open the door to greater regulation that treats platforms as publishers.

Comparing the two definitions, you can easily see why Facebook would rather be thought of as a platform. If Facebook is seen as only the tool used to communicate, it is no different than any other communication tool — in this world, Facebook’s ad tool is something like a pen. No one sues Bic for the contents of a letter its users write, nor is the company subject to scrutiny and regulation from the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Indecency Act specifically holds that platforms cannot be held liable for the content on their services. If Facebook were considered a publisher, it would be responsible for fact-checking all the content distributed on its suite of apps, which it doesn’t fully control. Yes, Facebook has the ability to take down offensive content, but it doesn’t produce or issue it initially. It’s just a distribution channel.

If we classify Facebook as a platform, its main responsibilities and liabilities are to create tools that cannot be manipulated to circumvent someone’s civil liberties or deny them equal access and opportunity to housing, employment, or financial services and to release only products that are thoroughly tested and shown to not have significant negative impact on already marginalized groups. For example, it should not support voter suppression or curate job opportunities for a select and privileged few instead of all. Facebook’s mistakes generally seem to be the result of emphasizing speed and not identifying or thinking through consequences for users in general — and minorities in particular. It must ensure that all voices are at the table when creating and testing products.

## **Why does the Trump administration care?**

As for the Trump administration’s sudden defense of civil rights of marginalized groups, a key issue for Facebook in its dispute with HUD is the agency’s insistence on unfettered access to user data. [In a statement](&lt;|url|&gt;) following news of the lawsuit, Facebook said, “While we were eager to find a solution, HUD insisted on access to sensitive information — like user data — without adequate safeguards. We’re disappointed by today’s developments, but we’ll continue working with civil rights experts on these issues.”
> # It is curious that HUD decided to go after Facebook only after the company wouldn’t allow HUD access to user data without proper safeguards.

Facebook’s hesitation isn’t unfounded. Considering this administration has run roughshod over the civil liberties of underrepresented groups — from [Muslim bans](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [separation of children at the border](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [banning transgender individuals from military service](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [defunding key educational initiatives](&lt;|url|&gt;) — it is easy to look askance at its supposed effort to enforce civil liberties and not undermine them. A quick survey of recent DOJ and administration prosecutions reveals a theme: targeting perceived liberal rivals from Silicon Valley and Hollywood with the college admissions scam; charging Michael Avenatti, a vocal Trump opponent for wire fraud and extortion, and now Facebook, which previously withstood [accusations](&lt;|url|&gt;) of anti-conservative bias. Prosecutorial discretion can be a powerful political tool, particularly in the hands of those who show a liking for [intimidating their adversaries](&lt;|url|&gt;).

While housing discrimination is a true problem, particularly as gentrification and the affordable housing crisis continue, it is curious that HUD decided to go after Facebook only after the company wouldn’t allow HUD access to user data without proper safeguards, especially after accusations of conservative bias against the platform. It is fair to ask what data was requested, how HUD sought to use it, and to what end.

Facebook may be liable for restitution, but it is also heartening to know the company would rather fight than give unrestricted access to user data to an administration that isn’t big on transparency or playing by the rules. Facebook acknowledges that trade-off and its resolution in standing firm, stating, “We’re disappointed by today’s developments, but we’ll continue working with civil rights experts on these issues,” demonstrating that the company’s ethical instincts are in the right place.

While the HUD lawsuit seems altruistic, it may be a Trojan horse that seeks to open the door to greater regulation that treats platforms as publishers. Of course, only time—and perhaps another election—will tell.

# Why VPNs Are Suddenly Everywhere, and How to Pick the Best One

## Why VPNs Are Suddenly Everywhere, and How to Pick the Best One

### *Is a ‘private’ internet connection really worth it?*

![Credit: Colin Anderson Productions pty ltd/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Colin Anderson Productions pty ltd/Getty Images*

If you’ve listened to a podcast lately, you might have noticed that the ads for Stamps.com and internet-order mattresses have been superseded by endless advertisements for virtual private networks (VPNs), all explaining how important it is to get a secure connection of your own.

VPN companies promise to help protect you, but how can you know which of the many available services are trustworthy? And why the heck do you suddenly need one?

First, the reason there are so many ads is that running a VPN can be a highly profitable business. All it takes is setting up a bunch of servers, in different locations, which are shared across hundreds of users and cost a few hundred dollars to operate. Then just sit back and watch the subscription fees roll in.

But doing a VPN right isn’t so easy.

Some quick background: You might already be familiar with a VPN if you’ve worked in a corporate job. A company’s VPN will usually allow you to remotely connect to the tools you use for your job as if you were sitting in your seat at the office.

Think of connecting to a VPN like teleporting from one internet connection to another. When I’m on a VPN, instead of connecting to *Medium.com* as Owen in Amsterdam, it looks like I’m Owen from New York or Owen from Toronto. A VPN makes it appear, to anyone who’s observing, that you’re accessing the internet from another computer, not the one in front of you.

Plenty of prying eyes can monitor what you do online, from the internet service provider (ISP) you’re paying to take you online, like Comcast, to the cafe Wi-Fi you’re leeching from — and it’s hard to be sure that any of those parties can be trusted. With a VPN, the internet provider or Wi-Fi company can’t tell where the traffic is from or where it’s headed. To them, it just looks like a blob of anonymous data, headed off to a server.

Paid VPN services offer features like the ability to route your traffic through a network in the country of your choosing, which is handy if you really want to watch HBO and it’s not available in your country. (Though note that content providers like Hulu will sometimes block VPN servers; quality VPN providers will refresh their offerings to help you avoid this.) Some services offer more on top, such as blocking ads before they load, or further anonymizing you.
> # Some VPNs pose as a way to get a secure connection, but actually log everything you do for marketing purposes.

Here’s the thing: It’s 2019 and there are fresh privacy scandals all the time. Handing over access to your raw, unfiltered traffic is one of the best ways for [advertisers and bad actors to learn almost everything about you.](&lt;|url|&gt;) And that leads to an important question to ask yourself before you pick a VPN service: “Is this company actually helping my data be more secure, or am I exposing myself to someone else monitoring me instead?”

As with everything online, there are plenty of scams masquerading as legitimate services. Some VPNs pose as a way to get a secure connection, but actually log everything you do for marketing purposes. And because VPN providers can see the traffic you send through their services, some may monitor your traffic and sell your browsing history to advertisers, in secret, to make more money. This is common among cheap or free services.

Facebook, for example, [operated a VPN service called “Onavo” that was basically a virus](&lt;|url|&gt;). The social giant reportedly used it to suck up data about teens and use that information to clone or acquire its rivals. [According to *BuzzFeed](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, monitoring Onavo traffic helped Facebook measure WhatsApp’s popularity, and led to its ultimate acquisition in 2014 for $19 billion. (In response to these reports, the company [said](&lt;|url|&gt;), “Market research helps companies build better products for people. We are shifting our focus to reward-based market research which means we’re going to end the Onavo program.”)

If you’re using a VPN that’s monitoring you, it’s probably not worth it in the first place. Cough up the money for a legit service. Here are the most important factors to check:

1. Who owns the VPN service, and is it the only product they offer? If it isn’t immediately apparent who’s running the service, that’s a red flag.

1. Where are the VPN service’s servers hosted? This is an important question, because you’ll probably want options for connecting to specific countries.

1. Does the VPN service log any data, and for how long? A paid VPN service that cares about privacy should log as little information as possible, so that you aren’t exposed retroactively should they suffer a security breach in the future. Setting this up correctly is quite difficult, so the company should have a clear policy about what it logs, why it does so, and for how long.

1. What country is the VPN service founded in? Is that country a part of the Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, or 14 Eyes spying agreements, where countries — led by U.S. authorities — [work together to collect data on internet users](<|url|>) in secret?

1. Is this VPN service using modern encryption technology that will actually hide your traffic? This might include things like [SSH tunnels](<|url|>), which mask your habits.

These are only basic questions, but as with all internet-connected things, your own choices about security will fall on a spectrum. My tolerance for risk is likely to be different from yours: I’m worried about angry readers or a rogue nation-state who might be annoyed about what I write and want to retaliate, so I’m willing to go through a lot of research and hassle to protect myself.

If you’re worried about getting HBO outside of the U.S., or entering your banking password on free Wi-Fi — and you should be worried — that means a different set of risks. You should think about who you’re trying to protect yourself against, and what risks are acceptable in exchange for convenience — a VPN that’s ultra-secure but impossible to use may not be what you’re looking for.

Meanwhile, Googling “the best VPN” won’t cut it, because most of the top results are actually a list of affiliate links, which gives the writer a cut if you sign up after clicking.

But there are independent services that collect worthwhile information and help you sort through it without affiliate links.

[That One Privacy Site](&lt;|url|&gt;), for example, provides a detailed collection of VPN services around the world and measures their record on an incredible amount of metrics, while explaining [why you should care about each](&lt;|url|&gt;). A quick scan of the list for the service you’re considering will help you understand what they’re actually protecting you against — or where you might be exposing yourself to unacceptable risk.

If that’s still a bit too much work for you, the next best resource is the [*Wirecutter*’s ultimate guide](&lt;|url|&gt;), which is backed by the *New York Times*, and touts extensive research with thousands of data points, focusing on the best balance of privacy and security.

## Just give me a recommendation already!

I wasn’t going to leave you hanging! I’ve read many reviews, checked the data, and decided for myself already — so here are my top picks if you just want a decent VPN service. These aren’t affiliate links, and neither I nor *OneZero *will financially benefit from your choice.

**Best all-round: [NordVPN](&lt;|url|&gt;)
**It’s consistently one of the best-reviewed VPN services. It’s based outside of U.S. jurisdiction in Panama, it hosts its own servers, uses proper encryption technology, doesn’t track user activity — and, crucially, it’s not a nightmare to use.

Out of all the VPN services I’ve used, NordVPN has a good balance of handy features — including the ability to block ads while you’re connected — and a serious amount of servers to connect through, with multiple available in each available country.

The company’s fees are a little higher than average, at $11.95 per month, but they get cheaper the longer you commit — it’s about $6.99 per month if you pay for three years up-front.

**Easiest to use: [IVPN](&lt;|url|&gt;)
**For most people, a VPN is a tool that should be easy to use and then forgotten about. IVPN, which is also recommended by *Wirecutter*, fits the bill. It’s simple to use regardless of platform, and it gets the job done.

While it doesn’t tick every box in terms of the balance between privacy and security, it covers many of the ones that count while balancing transparency in a way I haven’t seen with other services. [It’s public about its ethics](&lt;|url|&gt;), who works there, and how it handles your data.

IVPN is a bit costly at $15 per month, or $5.83 with an annual commitment, but again, you get what you pay for.

**Create your own VPN
**If you know your way around computers and don’t want to trust some random company, I’m with you — sometimes it’s important to roll your own.

The good news is that it’s become really easy to generate your own ultra-cheap VPN in a few clicks, thanks to a project from Google’s parent company, Alphabet, [called Outline](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s intended to help protect journalists, but it’s free to use and ultra-simple to set up.

With Outline, you’ll have control of the VPN server that your traffic is sent through, but that means you’ll need to set it up, as well. You can do this for just $5 per month on a service like DigitalOcean, and Outline provides a one-line copy-and-paste tool to get set up.

It’s incredibly powerful to control your own server, because you know where the data will end up. But that comes at a cost: You need to keep it up to date, and you won’t have the freedom to switch countries on the fly, as you would with something like NordVPN. But sometimes the tradeoff is worth it — and at $5 per month, it’s a great option for those who have the time and skills to set it up.

## Privacy is hard work

Getting a VPN doesn’t need to be difficult, but advertisements that imply they’ll help magically fix privacy concerns are misleading at best, so I find myself suspicious of any VPN company with enough money to spend on splashy podcast ads.

You absolutely should get a VPN for yourself, even if it’s just for occasional use, but it’s important to know what’s going on behind the scenes. It can seem like a hassle, but VPNs are an incredibly useful tool for avoiding censorship, tracking, or just getting around country restrictions when you need to.

All it takes to make a better informed choice is a little bit of research. You’re doing yourself a favor, and it won’t come back to bite you later.<|endoftext|>

# NASA’s Marsquake Recording Joins the Soundtrack of the Cosmos

## NASA’s Marsquake Recording Joins the Soundtrack of the Cosmos

### Space is far from silent, and we can learn a lot if we know how to listen

![Photo: NASA/JPL-Caltech](<|image|>)*Photo: NASA/JPL-Caltech*

Like many other planets in the solar system, Mars was once very geologically active. It had massive volcanoes and rivers and lakes of water. It may also have experienced internal quakes — marsquakes.

When NASA’s InSight lander touched base on Mars in November 2018, the spacecraft brought with it a suite of instruments to study the interior of the planet. One of these instruments is an extremely sensitive and custom-made seismometer called SEIS, which is used on Mars to detect any marsquakes taking place deep in the planet’s interior. Last week, NASA announced that the InSight team caught the first marsquake ever detected. The agency also [released audio of the marsquake](&lt;|url|&gt;) along with the announcement, following common practice for seismologists studying quakes here on Earth.


“Turning seismic signals into sound is just a different way of appreciating the seismic waveforms,” says Mark Panning, a seismologist on the InSight team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “Basically it comes down to speeding up the signals we’re already recording into the audible frequency range.”
> # We might imagine space as largely silent, but historically, recordings from space have led to valuable insights about the cosmos.

While this first marsquake was too small to tell scientists much about the internal workings of the planet, the hope is that future recordings will help scientists break down the nuances in the movements. And the more often they detect active quakes, the more they’ll learn about what exactly is happening inside Mars.

We might imagine space as largely silent — the place where no one can hear you scream — but historically, recordings from space have led to valuable insights about the cosmos. These eerie soundtracks are held in a [mini online NASA library ](&lt;|url|&gt;)called — really — Spooky Sounds from Across the Solar System. One of the most famous is [a clip from the Voyager spacecraft](&lt;|url|&gt;). This is the sound of the plasma (hot ionized gases) detected by Voyager’s plasma instrument. As Voyager traveled far beyond Neptune and into the interstellar medium, the changes registered by its plasma instrument were relayed back to Earth. By converting the radio signal into an audible frequency, humans can hear what that environment is like for Voyager.

While we tend to think the black void between planetary objects is empty, it isn’t — not fully. “Plasmas streaming away from the sun pervade interplanetary space,” says Ali Sulaiman, a science team member for the Cassini mission to Saturn. “Like air or water, plasmas are capable of supporting waves which carry information over large distances in space. We convert the data of such observations to the audible range to emphasize that interplanetary space is far from ‘nothingness.’”

The aim, says Sulaiman, is to bring the public “as close as possible to what it would be like if they were able to perceive such phenomena.”

During the 13 years the Cassini spacecraft was in orbit around Saturn, it collected massive amounts of radio and scientific data. One surprising finding was the sound of the electromagnetic waves moving between Saturn and its icy moon Enceladus. Scientists knew that these two bodies interacted, but by collecting the magnetic field data and converting it to sound, they realized that Saturn was actually responding to Enceladus via magnetic field lines.

When NASA’s Juno spacecraft entered Jupiter’s magnetosphere, it collected [sound information](&lt;|url|&gt;) from its environment. Even [stranger](&lt;|url|&gt;) was the encounter of NASA’s Galileo spacecraft with Jupiter’s famous icy moon, Ganymede. It’s Jupiter’s largest moon and also the largest moon in the solar system. Because Ganymede is so massive, it has its own environment and magnetic field, and as a result, caused changes in Galileo’s instruments during the first flyby. When those changes [were converted to audio](&lt;|url|&gt;), it famously sounded like a horror movie soundtrack. Those sounds also told scientists a lot about the environment of Ganymede, including its magnetic fields and solar winds.

The sound waves InSight will collect going forward will reveal critical information about the Martian environment. “Our whole mission is to record ground motions,” says Panning. “By converting them into audible frequencies, we get a different perspective.” We are used to photos and even video teaching us about space, but the sounds of the cosmos can no longer be denied their place in the library of useful information.<|endoftext|>

# Virtual Reality Is Helping Kids Cope With Pain

## Hospitals are leaning on the distracting power of immersive technology

![Illustration: [Joseph Melhuish](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Joseph Melhuish](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

A pod of friendly dolphins approaches a shipwreck. Sea turtles and tropical fish swim together. A hulking but gentle whale glides overhead. In this calming ocean ecosystem, there isn’t a shark in sight.

This is the world kids are immersed in when they slip on a virtual reality headset designed by [KindVR](&lt;|url|&gt;), a Bay Area–based virtual reality company. Using a controller, they can explore sunken ruins, blow colorful bubbles, or simply watch and wait for sea creatures to approach them while soothing music plays in the background. Kids are using the sets to endure severe pain and uncomfortable medical procedures.

Virtual reality has been used in pain management for years, mostly to distract victims of severe burns from agonizing dressing changes. But as the cost of virtual reality headsets has gotten dramatically cheaper — some now retail for as little as $40 — more hospitals can afford to try out the technology to help the young pain patients who need it most. Medical centers like UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin are using virtual reality experiences, like the ones developed by KindVR, to alleviate stress and anxiety during pain episodes and medical procedures. The goal is to make the experience of pain less traumatic for young patients and, in doing so, reduce the need for opioids among children.

Virtual reality is thought to help patients manage pain by giving them something else to focus on as they undergo an invasive test or uncomfortable treatment. Previous studies have shown that distraction — like watching cartoons and listening to music — can help [manage pain](&lt;|url|&gt;) in children and adolescents, especially for procedures involving needles.
> # What we think is going on is that virtual reality is so immersive that it is filling up your brain with lots of different sensory signals.

Researchers think virtual reality is especially effective because the experience is so much more immersive than other mediums, like listening to music or watching TV. “I think of it as a bandwidth issue,” says Simon Robertson, KindVR’s founder and lead virtual reality developer. “Your brain has to process the experience of pain, and if we’re able to flood the brain’s senses in a comfortable way, it takes that attention away from pain.”

KindVR’s virtual reality therapies are currently being used in more than 20 pediatric hospitals in the United States and Canada, and Robertson has designed five different virtual reality experiences specifically for children, each for different uses. One program is a guided meditation experience to help children manage chronic pain and stress by teaching them deep-breathing exercises. Another program, KindVR Aqua, is used for treating acute pain — that is, pain that comes on suddenly and lasts for a short period of time. Unlike traditional video games, these virtual experiences have no scary images, time limits, or objectives. Instead, the software is meant to minimize sudden movements and help kids relax.

KindVR charges roughly $3,000 per system for the company’s subscription service which includes the “clinically validated software, hardware, infection control system, and on-site training for hospital staff,” says Robertson.

Another of KindVR’s designs is different from the relaxation experiences in that it introduces children to a virtual MRI machine so they know what to expect ahead of the procedure. The hope is that when it comes time for an MRI, which involves lying still for an hour, kids won’t be as anxious to go into the machine. Many people feel claustrophobic in such a confined space, and the experience may be especially scary for children. Movement can blur MRI images and make them unusable. Doctors currently use sedation when children can’t stay still and MRI images are necessary, but many parents have concerns about the use of these medications.

Clinicians at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital are using the KindVR Aqua program to help children with sickle cell disease, which leads to frequently recurring pain episodes. Sickle cell, which affects about 100,000 people in the United States, is a genetic disorder that causes a person’s red blood cells to be misshapen. In a healthy person, disc-shaped red blood cells move freely through the circulatory system, carrying oxygen to the body. But in a person with sickle cell, the red blood cells become hard and sticky and form a crescent-moon shape. These sickled cells can’t move as easily as normal red blood cells and instead get stuck in vessels, clogging blood flow and causing intense pain, among other serious complications that can be fatal.

These pain episodes can last for hours, days, or weeks at a time. Mild pain can be managed with heating pads, warm baths, gentle massages, and extra fluids. But for severe pain that lasts days or longer, doctors often turn to prescription opioids like morphine, methadone, and fentanyl, even for very young children. As a result, says Latika Puri, a hematologist at St. Jude’s, “They get exposed at a very early age, and then, by the time they’re in adulthood, they are very tolerant to opioids.”

Puri and her colleagues are studying whether virtual reality therapy can help mitigate pain for these patients. They’re enrolling more than 70 children with sickle cell, half of whom will get standard pain management, which includes opioids, while the other half will get the standard pain management plus 15-minute sessions of KindVR’s virtual reality therapy. The researchers want to assess whether virtual reality can reduce pain intensity and, in doing so, reduce the amount of opioid painkillers that patients need.

Though virtual reality won’t completely replace painkillers, it can help make hospital stays and medical procedures less traumatic for the youngest patients. That’s important beyond reducing suffering — children with recurrent or chronic pain [can develop](&lt;|url|&gt;) long-term psychological problems, like anxiety and depression.

Researchers at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital were the first to use virtual reality for pediatric sickle cell patients in a small feasibility [study](&lt;|url|&gt;) published in October. They tested whether it was practical to use virtual reality with these children, many of whom are prone to nausea. Patients were given a 15-minute virtual reality session with the KindVR Aqua program in addition to pain medication after being hospitalized during a pain episode. They filled out a survey on simulator sickness before and after the virtual reality therapy. The results showed that children did not have any negative side effects.

“The feedback from patients has been almost universally positive,” says Anne Marsh, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital. “Patients love it and ask for it when they come back into the hospital.” Marsh believes that in the future, virtual reality headsets might even be prescribed to certain high-risk patients at home as a way to prevent hospital admissions.

“What we think is going on is that virtual reality is so immersive that it is filling up your brain with lots of different sensory signals,” says Sara Williams, a pediatric pain pathologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, where investigators have begun to use virtual reality for children undergoing surgery. “You feel like you’re in the environment,” she says.

Robertson has also customized the Aqua program for pediatric patients who need subcutaneous ports — flexible IV lines that go completely inside the body, usually the chest. The software is designed so that fish, dolphins, whales, and other creatures the wearer is interested in appear above eye level and straight ahead. This encourages kids to look up but not around them, which helps medical staff more easily carry out the delicate procedure.

Though virtual reality alone won’t solve the opioid epidemic, it may help cut down on opioid prescriptions for some types of pain and make children going through the discomfort and fear of a hospital stay feel better in the moment. “I’ve watched it really unlock them and transform who they are,” Robertson says. There’s nothing virtual about that.<|endoftext|>

# A Global Call to Ban the Creation of Gene-Edited Babies

## Stung by a rogue scientist’s actions, experts want a moratorium on using CRISPR for germline editing

Last November, Chinese scientist He Jiankui shocked the world when he revealed that he had used the gene-editing tool CRISPR to modify human embryos during in vitro fertilization, resulting in the birth of twin girls with edited genomes. It was the first known time CRISPR had been used in this way.

Now, scientists and ethicists from seven countries are calling for a worldwide moratorium that would temporarily ban the editing of human eggs, sperm, or embryos — known as germline editing — with the purpose of making genetically-modified children.

[The proposal](&lt;|url|&gt;), which appears March 13 in the major scientific journal *Nature*, endorses “an initial period of fixed duration during which no clinical uses of germline editing whatsoever should be allowed.” The authors suggest that five years might be appropriate. After that, any nation could choose whether to permit specific applications of gene-editing on viable embryos intended to cause a pregnancy. Countries would then be able to approve applications that meet certain conditions, including giving public notice of the planned experiment to make sure there is what the authors term a “broad societal consensus” about the appropriateness of the experiment.

“The governance framework we are calling for will place major speed bumps in front of the most adventurous plans to reengineer the human species,” write the authors, which include two of CRISPR’s inventors, Feng Zhang, of the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, and Emmanuelle Charpentier, director of the Max Planck Institute of Infection Biology in Berlin. (Another one of CRISPR’s inventors, Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, has condemned He’s actions but isn’t one of the signatories on the proposed moratorium, though she [called](&lt;|url|&gt;) for a pause on such work back in 2015.)
> # “Now is the time to pull out the regulatory equivalent of a taser.”

The proposal asks governments to make a voluntary pledge, rather than a formal treaty that would be legally binding if broken. The authors say this approach would be more transparent and less rigid than a treaty. Separately, the World Health Organization has formed an[ expert advisory committee](&lt;|url|&gt;) that will make governance recommendations on human genome editing. The first committee meeting is scheduled for March 18 and 19 at the UN agency’s headquarters in Geneva.

The National Institutes of Health, the single biggest funder of biomedical research worldwide, said it supports the proposed ban. “Until nations can commit to international guiding principles to help determine whether and under what conditions such research should ever proceed, NIH strongly agrees that an international moratorium should be put into effect immediately,” NIH Director Francis Collins said in a statement.

In an [accompanying editorial](&lt;|url|&gt;), the *Nature* staff says a global framework for approving germline editing trials could look something like the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, an independent body in the U.K. that regulates IVF clinics and human embryo research. Researchers wanting to conduct germline editing trials would apply for permission to such an organization before being able to carry out their work.

“I think the moratorium is essential,” Fyodor Urnov, a gene editing pioneer and deputy director at the Altius Institute of Biomedical Sciences in Seattle, tells *OneZero*. “Now is the time to pull out the regulatory equivalent of a taser.”

The proposed moratorium would not apply to germline editing for research uses — cases in which edited embryos are created and studied in a lab and not transferred to a person’s uterus. A few such studies in China and the U.S. have already been carried out.

About 30 countries, including the U.S., [already have legislation in place](&lt;|url|&gt;) that directly or indirectly prohibits gene-edited babies. A provision passed by the U.S. Congress in December 2015 prohibits the Food and Drug Administration from even considering human studies in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to cause a pregnancy. The amendment has been renewed every year since.

Germline editing is so contentious because any changes made in eggs, sperm, or embryos can be passed on for generations. That sets it apart from somatic gene editing for diseases, which only changes cells in the person it’s designed to treat — changes that can’t be passed onto the next generation. A handful of human clinical trials for somatic gene editing are already underway in the U.S., China and Europe. Ethicists have argued that patients undergoing somatic gene editing can provide informed consent for treatment, whereas babies born with edited genomes cannot.

He’s experiment was further decried by scientists because he had tweaked a gene called* CCR5*, not to cure or treat disease in utero in the resulting babies, but to make the twins resistant to HIV. It’s established that some people of northern European descent have genetic mutations in the *CCR5* gene that make them naturally immune to HIV infection.

But even germline editing to cure a disease in an embryo is hotly debated by ethicists, in part because [preimplantation genetic testing](&lt;|url|&gt;) is already in use. The technology identifies genetic mutations in embryos, allowing prospective parents to choose unaffected ones to use in IVF. The authors of the* Nature* commentary point out that sperm and egg donors can be used as an alternative if parents know they’re a carrier of a genetic disease. Adoption, too, is an option.

The idea of a moratorium on germline editing isn’t new. Similar calls were made after the first International Summit on Human Genome Editing in 2015 and after a [2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) released by the by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The study said germline editing would be ethically defensible in certain situations, such as when both parents have a serious genetic disease and embryo editing is the last option for having biological children.

Not every expert is in favor of a global ban. In an article published earlier this month in the [*New England Journal of Medicine](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, R. Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin who’s serving on the WHO panel, argued against such a moratorium, saying what’s needed is a “road map for responsible translational research.”

“As has been seen in the rise of businesses selling unproven, often illegal stem cell ‘therapies’ for everything from neurologic disease to stiff knees, top-down regulation has its limitations and cannot completely control the rogues,” Charo writes. “Regulating rogues may well take more than a central agency that grants or denies permission for the sale or use of a product or technique.”<|endoftext|>

# A Year in Space Changed an Astronaut’s Genes

## A Year in Space Changed an Astronaut’s Genes

### A new study of astronaut twins — one who spent a record time in orbit, the other who stayed on Earth — offers a clearer understanding of how space travel affects the human body

![Photo: Bill Ingalls/NASA/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Bill Ingalls/NASA/Getty*

In 2015, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly journeyed to the International Space Station (ISS), where he spent a year orbiting Earth. It was the longest single stretch of time any American had spent in space and gave scientists an opportunity to study how the body changes while in orbit. Even better, Scott Kelly has a twin brother, Mark Kelly, also an astronaut, who served as a scientific control on Earth, allowing researchers to precisely compare the two.

This was the most complex and in-depth study of human spaceflight to date. The average time any astronaut spends on the ISS typically maxes out at six months. In the months leading up to Scott Kelly’s yearlong flight, NASA scientists collected urine, fecal, and blood samples from both brothers. Scott also collected a cache of samples during his year in space. Once he returned, the medical analysis continued.

After years of analysis, more data is emerging to illuminate how Scott’s year in space changed his body. A new paper published in the journal *Science* reveals changes that occurred in Scott’s genes. Some were expected, while others were a surprise.

“The Twins Study is the most comprehensive view of the response of the human body to spaceflight ever conducted,” said Susan Bailey, one of the study’s authors and director of cancer biology at Colorado State University, over email.

We take for granted how safe it is to live on Earth. The planet’s atmosphere provides us with breathable air. Its magnetic field acts as a shield against the bulk of solar radiation and galactic cosmic rays. When a person leaves Earth’s protective boundary, almost all bets are off.

The microgravity environment of space allows our organs to shift around, which affects the way our heart muscles pump blood through the body. As a result, heart disease is a major risk for astronauts, and many are diagnosed with cardiovascular disease after returning to Earth. Other space explorers have developed irreversible eye damage because the muscles in their eyes changed with lower gravity, requiring them to use stronger glasses prescriptions in orbit and once they return to Earth.
> # All the data collected from the Twin Study is useful as the United States sets its sights toward long-duration spaceflight.

The new paper looks closely at the genetic changes that were previously noted among the Kelly brothers. Exposure to radiation in space can cause breaks in the strands of our DNA and jostle around chromosomes, causing them to swap places. This can force some genes to express themselves and others to stop expressing. These changes can increase the chances of cancer and other diseases. Approximately 7% of the genetic changes Scott Kelly experienced in space remained once he returned to Earth.

One change that particularly interested Bailey was Scott Kelly’s telomere data. Telomeres are structures at the end of our chromosomes that are considered biomarkers of aging. As we get older, our telomeres shorten. This is what researchers expected to see happen in Scott.

But instead of getting shorter, Scott’s telomeres unexpectedly grew. “We went into the study proposing that the unique stresses (nutritional, physical, psychological) and extreme environmental exposures (microgravity, space radiation) experienced by astronauts on long-duration missions would surely accelerate telomere shortening and thus increase the risk of aging and age-associated disease states like cardiovascular disease and cancer,” Bailey says. “What we observed were longer telomeres during spaceflight — exactly the opposite of what we thought.”

Once Scott Kelly returned to Earth, his telomeres quickly shortened and returned to preflight baseline levels. “However, he did have many more short telomeres after spaceflight than he did before,” Bailey says. “Our challenge now is to figure out the why and how of such dramatic shifts in telomere-length dynamics specifically associated with spaceflight.”

All the data collected from the Twin Study is useful as the United States sets its sights toward long-duration spaceflight. However, the study’s sample size is so small that far more data needs to be collected. We need more astronauts to spend longer than a year in space to really understand the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human body.

NASA has stated its goals of building the next iteration of the ISS, called the Lunar Gateway, with the ultimate goal of returning to the moon. To do that — and to venture farther — we have to understand what’s safe for the astronauts we send into space. What level of risk would they be exposed to, and what would they be willing to undergo? After all, exploration doesn’t stop at the moon. NASA also wants to go to Mars, and that long journey — at least two years round-trip — will require a deeper understanding of the risks of human spaceflight.<|endoftext|>

# Closing Wikipedia’s Gender Gap

## An interview with Wikipedia editor Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight

![Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight. Credit: VGrigas via Wikimedia/[CC BY-SA 3.0](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight. Credit: VGrigas via Wikimedia/[CC BY-SA 3.0](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

By now, it’s second nature. When you come across an unfamiliar name, you search for it online. Google’s algorithm typically includes the relevant Wikipedia pages near the top of its search results. But what happens when that person doesn’t have a Wikipedia entry? How does that change your perception of their importance?

For Wikipedia editors like Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight, this issue of online visibility — or lack thereof — is closely tied to the number of biographical articles about women on Wikipedia. Back in 2014, Stephenson-Goodknight co-founded the [Women in Red](&lt;|url|&gt;) movement with a mission to improve the encyclopedia’s coverage of women’s biographies, works by women, and women’s issues. For her efforts, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales presented Stephenson-Goodknight with the 2016 award for Co-Wikipedian of the Year.

As we near the end of Women’s History Month, it’s worth reflecting how Stephenson-Goodknight and her colleagues have affected the content and the culture of the [fifth most visited website in the world](&lt;|url|&gt;).

I had the pleasure of speaking with Stephenson-Goodknight by phone. This interview has been edited and condensed.

### **How did you get started editing Wikipedia?**

**Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight:** On June 4, 2007, I was in San Francisco, working out of my son Sean’s apartment. I was telecommuting that day instead of being in my office. In the afternoon, I took a break and was searching for things on Wikipedia. I tried to find an article regarding Book League of America, a publisher whose books I collect. But I couldn’t find it. At first, I thought that maybe I misspelled it or the capitalization was wrong, but none of these seemed to be the problem. I thought to myself, “Wow, there’s no article on this subject. How is that possible?”

Here it was, 2007, and I thought there was an article about everything on Wikipedia. Then I remembered that Sean had edited Wikipedia while he was in the Peace Corps. I thought, “If Sean can figure this out, I bet I can, too.” So, I created a username and started the article on [Book League of America](&lt;|url|&gt;), and it still exists today.

### **Once you started editing Wikipedia as a hobby, how long did it take before you were hooked?**

I would say that pretty much I was hooked immediately… like I created seven articles that first month. I made my 500th edit within two and half months, including starting the article [Arctic Shrinkage](&lt;|url|&gt;) (renamed [Climate Change in the Arctic](&lt;|url|&gt;)), which is by far the most heavily edited and controversial article I ever created. Now it’s 2019, and I’ve made more than 150,000 edits and contributed to more than 1,300 articles featured in the “Did You Know…” section of Wikipedia’s [main page](&lt;|url|&gt;). One of my all-time favorite articles would probably be [Deolinda Rodrigues Francisco de Almeida](&lt;|url|&gt;), a writer from Angola who corresponded with Martin Luther King Jr.

### **What is a “red link,” and what’s the connection with the gender gap on Wikipedia?**

On Wikipedia, a red link is a hyperlink to an article that does not currently exist. Back in 2014, I met with a group of experienced Wikipedia editors in Washington, D.C., where they challenged us to take action on ideas we had not yet pursued. One idea I had was a WikiProject dedicated to women writers who were “red links,” who did not yet have articles, and I started that project. We now have more than 33,000 articles within our scope: women writers and their works.
> # “When women were excluded from a profession, we can’t make up for that today.”

In the following year, I was approached by [Roger Bamkin](&lt;|url|&gt;), a professor in Britain. He suggested that we collaborate on a conference presentation regarding the content gender gap — how few of Wikipedia’s biographies are about women. Our presentation in July 2015 in Mexico City evolved into WikiProject Women in Red, named after Wikipedia’s “red links,” which are the missing articles.

To our surprise, the idea really took off, and people began writing more articles about women. We use a bot to collect and post our metrics. Five years ago, only about 15 percent of the English-language Wikipedia biographies were about women. Now the number is closer to 17.74 percent. And the project is now active in 13 different language versions, not just English.

### **That’s substantial progress, but the gap nevertheless seems to be quite pronounced. What are the historical drivers of the gender gap?**

There are multiple different parts to this. First, if women were not able to participate in various professions until a certain period of time, there is no article to write. Five hundred years ago, there were almost no women politicians, so there won’t be articles about women politicians from that period, and the same applies to military officers or positions of leadership in various religions. When women were excluded from a profession, we can’t make up for that today.

But when there were* *women poets, musicians, educators, scientists, and activists in the historical record, they should be included in Wikipedia. This is knowledge equity. The issue is that once women become involved in various occupations, they often received less coverage in written publications than their male counterparts. For example, in STEM occupations, when women and men worked side by side with each other for years, there can be an issue of who was credited for what was accomplished: “He who writes the history books wins.”

### **Gender bias on Wikipedia received [media attention last year](&lt;|url|&gt;) when Donna Strickland won the Nobel Prize for Physics and — at the time of her award — did not have a Wikipedia page. Would you say she should have had a Wikipedia entry earlier?**

Absolutely. And it wasn’t for lack of trying. Someone created a Wikipedia page for Donna Strickland before she won the Nobel Prize, but the volunteers in the [Articles for Creation](&lt;|url|&gt;) community decided that it did not meet the [notability](&lt;|url|&gt;) requirements to become an article on Wikipedia, because it lacked a sufficient number of third-party references. So, the article did not get published until after she received her Nobel.

### **What do you see as the future for Wikipedia?**

I would say that we are still in our infancy, and that’s because I take a very long view for the Wikimedia movement. I don’t think in terms of five years, 15 years, 55 years. I think in terms of 155 years, 555 years.

### **Could you expand on that? What is your 555-year vision for Wikipedia?**

A long time ago, I read Isaac Asimov’s [*Foundation* science-fiction series](&lt;|url|&gt;), in which the character Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian. Hari crunched large data sets in order to predict far into the future. Using these probabilities, he predicted that humanity was doomed and that there would be tens of thousands of years of chaos. But if he made certain changes, then those dark ages would last only a thousand years.

One of the things Hari did to reduce the period of chaos was develop a planet in a distant galaxy that was populated by scientists and their families to work on the [*Encyclopedia Galactica](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, which would be the sum of all human knowledge.

I see this as a sort of parallel universe, so much so that I used to say at conferences that I’m wearing an invisible bracelet that said “WWHSD?,” which stood for “What Would Hari Seldon Do?” Eventually, my co-Wikipedian of the year, [Emily Temple-Wood](&lt;|url|&gt;), gave me an actual bracelet with those letters, so my bracelet is no longer invisible.

### **How does this type of long-term thinking apply to the issue of gender equity specifically?**

It connects to both our vision and our strategy. Once [Wikidata](&lt;|url|&gt;) became part of our lives, I could see a parallel — large data sets can be a source for good for mankind. When we think about gender equity, I believe it’s a matter of *when* we will see a more equitable encyclopedia. And I’m not just talking about English-language Wikipedia… there are 300 other language versions. I am pretty sure that we will not be there in 15 years, but maybe in 55 years, and certainly 555 years from now I project that there will be gender equity — not necessarily in the sense that 50 percent of the biographies will be about women, but we will feel we will have met a standard of equity. That presents a question: If we will be there in 555 years for sure, what can we do now to shorten the time span? What can we do now versus postponing change for another point in time?

### **I suppose the future-state incarnation of Wikipedia might even be called ‘*Encyclopedia Galactica*.’ Could you describe a day in the life of Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight?**

I edit Wikipedia in the morning, or I edit it at night. It’s like anytime you have a passion for something—you just make the time. I’ve been a visiting scholar for Northeastern University’s Women Writers Project since March 2017, so mostly I concentrate on creating articles within that scope, pre-20th-century women writers and their works. I do a lot of coordination tasks for Women in Red, and there are endless tasks and meetings associated with my membership in various organizations or committee work.

I have a great family and eclectic friends, and I enjoy spending time with them. I love traveling, and I do a lot of that. I live a half-mile down a gravel road in the Sierra Nevada foothills, so nature is right outside my door. There’s a group of Canadian geese who live in my neighborhood six months each year, and I am so happy when I see them on my walks. What else? Every September, my husband and I participate in the Marching Presidents and First Ladies procession in our town’s Constitution Day Parade. I portray Helen Taft.

### **You spend a lot of time doing volunteer work for Wikipedia. Are there any perks?**

First of all, it doesn’t have to be a lot of work. We are all volunteers, so you do as much or as little as you want. No deadlines. No clocking in. No pressure. I’m retired from my career in the health care industry. Now that I’m in my sixties, with grown sons and some grandkids, I think I’m setting a good example that you can still do cool things — meaningful things — later in life, and sometimes you even get recognition for it. But truly, I don’t do it for that reason. I edit Wikipedia because it makes me happy to do so. Go figure.

In 2016, Women in Red and I were shortlisted for the GEM-TECH award by the ITU/United Nations Women. There were more than 300 entries for that award, so being in the top five really made me proud. In May 2018, I was knighted by the Republic of Serbia, in part because of my work on Wikipedia, and partly because I’ve promoted the memory of my grandfather, a Serbian patriot of bygone times. I suspected there would be a sword involved when I was knighted, but instead someone read a paragraph about accomplishments, and then the press took a lot of photos of us with the foreign minister. It was an awesome experience and such an honor. But no sword!

### **And that’s why you’re now *Dame *Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight. I expect some readers would be interested in hearing how they might become more involved with Wikipedia or Women in Red.**

Start anywhere. Many articles on Wikipedia, especially the shorter ones, could use a bit of improvement. Add a sentence, fix the punctuation, upload a photo. Within the scope of Women in Red — women’s biographies, women’s works, women’s issues—we’ve created more than [300 lists](&lt;|url|&gt;) of missing articles. You could do some research on one of these women and try writing an article! There are many in-person [edit-a-thon](&lt;|url|&gt;) events where you can actually meet other editors, and you might like that instead of editing Wikipedia from your home computer.

Once you start, I hope you stick with it. If you have a negative experience, please don’t give up! There are communities on Wikipedia that can show you the ropes and help you out. We were all new once. I would say it’s worth it if you persevere.<|endoftext|>

# Instagram’s New Anti-Bullying Nudges Could Actually Work

## Simple but effective, according to experts

![Photo by [S O C I A L . C U T](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [S O C I A L . C U T](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Among the flood of Facebook news last week — from a [major visual overhaul](&lt;|url|&gt;) to merging [the company’s messenger apps](&lt;|url|&gt;) — a tiny nugget slipped through: Instagram has a plan to combat cyberbullying. And it involves politely asking everyone to just stop.

In a brief segment of the company’s [F8 keynote last Tuesday](&lt;|url|&gt;), Instagram announced that it’s testing several new features to help combat bullying online. Some give power to users directly, like an Away Mode to temporarily leave Instagram if you’re going through a hard time, or tools that let you limit another user who’s being hostile toward you, without blocking them entirely.

Most notably, Instagram is also testing a more proactive tool with comment “nudges.” This feature will use machine learning to detect when a user is about to make a comment that’s aggressive or hostile, then lightly warn them not to do so. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Instagram clarified that “the notification doesn’t impede posting and no additional taps are needed, but our intention is that it will encourage people to pause and reflect on a potentially hurtful comment before posting it.”

Surely, it can’t be that easy to prevent online bullying. Right?

At first blush, it seems that politely asking someone to behave online would be as effective as telling the tide not to come in. Yet according to Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the [Cyberbullying Research Center](&lt;|url|&gt;) and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University, it might be a more effective tool than we think.

“We all usually try to do the things that are socially desirable… We want to put our best foot forward, we want to appear likable, to others in general,” Hinduja says. “So if the app itself is messaging you and conveying, ‘This isn’t really in line with our standards or the type of kind community we’re trying to create’… Maybe they’ll second-guess that decision and erase that comment, or maybe soften it.”
> # “Our intention is that it will encourage people to pause and reflect on a potentially hurtful comment before posting it.”

It’s the machine learning-powered digital equivalent of the “[Bro! Not cool](&lt;|url|&gt;)” moment from [Gillette’s famous ad](&lt;|url|&gt;). When communicating face-to-face, people tend to have an instinctive sense of what’s socially acceptable and will adhere to it, even if they think to say something aggressive or mean. Instagram’s nudges could serve a similar function as social pressure without being as directly confrontational as a block or ban might be.

If this were Instagram’s only anti-bullying tool, it probably wouldn’t be very effective. But as J. Nathan Matias, associate research scholar at Princeton’s Center for Information Technology Policy, points out, this is just the first step. “It’s important to remember that this isn’t Instagram’s only line of moderation. So, if people are posting hurtful, harmful comments, and the rest of the infrastructure is working, that helps.”

Those other lines of moderation already use the same machine learning technology. In 2017, Instagram started employing machine learning to identify offensive or bullying comments. According to Instagram, examples include “you are ugly 💩,” “fat kid,” or “[all men are trash](&lt;|url|&gt;).” These comments are hidden from anyone with the filter on, and it’s on by default. Unless you turn the filter off in your settings, if someone leaves a particularly hurtful comment, it might never be seen by anyone except the person who wrote it.

Right now, users might not even be aware when their comments are flagged and hidden. The nudge feature would actively let people know when they’re being rude or hurtful, perhaps with unintended side effects. “Sometimes when you create a metric for something,” explains Matias, “and you hope that revealing that metric to people will cause them to reduce that behavior, it can sometimes turn into a game.” Right now, Instagram gets notified if an account repeatedly trips the filter, and users can also report or block offending accounts.

As with any machine learning system, there’s also the risk of coding biases into the system itself. “Companies are constrained by the kinds of training data sets that they have. We’ve already seen in other scientific studies how biases in the underlying data can lead to cultural, racial, and gender discrimination in [how these algorithms behave](&lt;|url|&gt;),” Matias explains. “You could easily imagine situations where an algorithm might unequally apply its warnings to one side or another side in a very sensitive conflict.”

*OneZero* asked Instagram if its existing filters have had any measurable impact on bullying, but the company declined to share specific numbers. Instead, a representative simply said, “A.I. has allowed us to find and remove significantly more bullying.”

While this sounds positive, Matias believes that Instagram shouldn’t be the only one gauging the conclusions of its research. “I think it’s also imperative that we expect companies to release those results, and also allow independent researchers to evaluate the social impact of what they’re doing now.”

Of course, comments are only one type of bullying. It can also take the form of images — another area [Instagram wants to use machine learning to address](&lt;|url|&gt;) — or sharing someone’s content without their permission.

Still, there’s a very real chance that a subtle nudge, alongside more severe punishments like blocks or bans, could convince some people on the platform to be kinder to each other. Every little bit helps.<|endoftext|>

# Stan Lee’s Other Legacy

## Stan Lee’s Other Legacy

### **The comic book legend’s work didn’t just shape pop culture. It changed lives, too.**

![Photo by Vince Bucci/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo by Vince Bucci/Getty*

When Stan Lee passed away Monday, the world lost a pop culture titan — a man who revolutionized his medium, but whose personal life [turned to tragedy](&lt;|url|&gt;) even as the comics and characters he created turned into billion-dollar franchises. There are [plenty](&lt;|url|&gt;) of [wonderful pieces](&lt;|url|&gt;) [this week](&lt;|url|&gt;) covering Lee’s entire life and career, and how, for a few years in the 1960s, he was a creative genius — a man arguably as ground-breaking and brilliant and important to comics as the Beatles were to music. But his importance stretches far beyond that. For countless people over the last half-century — myself included — Lee’s legacy is personal.

To truly understand Lee’s influence, you have to understand his work, and in output alone, it’s astonishing. I mean, *my god. *From 1960 through 1969, he created (with luminary artists like Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko): Spider-Man, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Black Panther, the Avengers, The X-Men, Guardians of the Galaxy’s Groot, The Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Black Widow, Ant-Man, Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, S.H.I.E.L.D., The Inhumans, and many, many more, including these characters’ equally varied, often-just-as-popular villains, and their rich supporting casts. This is incredible, as is the variety of characters Lee helped originate; there wasn’t as much diversity, although Black Panther was the first mainstream black superhero, and a major star in the Avengers comics. These heroes were hits among the young comic book audience of the 1960s; more impressively, their popularity has endured for decades, persevering until superheroes came to [conquer the entertainment world](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Part of Lee’s genius was in humanizing his superheroes. Prior to the debut of “Fantastic Four #1” in 1961, most superheroes, like Batman and Superman, were in a state of arrested development, trapped as noble, perfect, super-powered paragons, so unremoved from reality that they lived in made up cities like Metropolis and Gotham. But Lee’s heroes lived in the real world (almost always New York City, specifically), and they had problems — real problems, not just evil villains to defeat. Peter Parker fought evil as Spider-Man, but as himself, he was a nerd bullied at school, who also had to care for his elderly aunt. Captain America was a man eternally out of step with the modern world, his family and loved ones left in the past. The X-Men protected a world that hated and feared them for their mutations.
> # This universe existed in Stan Lee’s head, and the fates of all its inhabitants were in his hands.

These superheroes had their own flaws, like actual people: They could make mistakes, act like jerks, and even be defeated — but that meant they could also develop. They were affected by their experiences, and could learn from their failures. They also had their own mission, code, and personalities, and since they lived together in the same universe, even heroes and villains from different comics could encounter each other (usually on the streets of New York City). Relationships between these characters developed and grew, and there was no guarantee they would get along just because they were good guys. What one hero did could affect everyone.

This universe existed in Stan Lee’s head, and the fates of all its inhabitants were in his hands. He wrote and masterminded dozens of narratives simultaneously across Marvel’s many comics, weaving them together and careening them off of each other, essentially telling one giant story that has never stopped being told.

In a very real way, every page of Marvel Comics in its 58-year history is Lee’s, and every cartoon, TV show, and billion-dollar movie they spawned succeeds in part because of what Lee created in the 1960s, but his influence stretches further than that. Once DC Comics recognized it needed to step up its game to match its new, much more enticing competition, Lee’s influence could be felt on those comics, too — as well as many of the cartoons, TV shows, and movies that grew from them. Hell, practically any superhero entertainment after 1968 has Lee’s DNA in it somewhere, however distant. But here, I’m speaking only of stories told, content produced, and money made; this doesn’t account for the amount of joy his work, and the works he inspired, brought to multiple generations of kids, as well as adults.

But to me, Lee’s legacy is even bigger than this.

When I was just beginning my professional nerd career, I worked at a publisher called Wizard Entertainment, whose main publication was *Wizard*, a magazine devoted to primarily superhero comics, targeted to the older 20- and 30-somethings who had never stopped loving them as they grew up. It was extremely popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, so much so that the publisher created *ToyFare*, which was basically the same magazine except for fans of the nascent world of adult-target toys and collectibles. I was hired to write for the latter in 2001.

This logic chain is very indirect, but I believe it to be true: Without Lee’s work in the 1960s there is no telling what the comics industry, and the various industries it affected, would be at the turn of the millennium, which means there’s no telling what modern fandom would be like, either. Without those fans, with that level of passion, there would likely be no *ToyFare.* Without *ToyFare*, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to have this career, or been inspired to take a chance on becoming a writer in the first place. Without *Wizard* magazine, there would be no *ToyFare*. And without the massive popularity of superhero comics in the 1980s, that kept its young readers reading into their adulthoods, there would almost certainly be no *Wizard*. And those beloved 1980s comics grew directly out of Lee’s groundbreaking in the 1960s. Without Stan Lee, I genuinely don’t know what career I might have right now, which means I don’t know what or where my life would be right now, either.

I know for certain that I wouldn’t have become lifelong friends with the wonderful co-workers I met there, many of whom became shapers of the comic book industry themselves. My friend Chris Ward, who wrote for *Wizard *and is now a writer, DJ, and bon vivant, pointed this out in an email sent to all of us who have stayed in touch, and he was absolutely right. And while we met in very special, specific circumstances, we are hardly alone.

Nerds and geeks are defined by their passions, whether it be for a character or a comic or a show or whatever. Nowadays, when the divisiveness of these fans can seem almost deafening, it can be hard to remember that fandoms bring more people together more than they tear apart. Wherever two people meet — be it a comic book shop, a convention, a school playground during recess, a website, a niche magazine publisher, or anywhere — they can bond over their shared love of Spider-Man or *Star Wars* or *Game of Thrones*, and so on.

Stan Lee’s work shaped pop culture, but it also affected people’s lives. It started relationships. It built friendships. It inspired people’s careers, including my own.

Spider-Man, X-Men, Iron Man, and the other characters Lee created will likely be a major pillar in the world of entertainment until the apocalypse (and probably a while after that, if we’re being honest). I hope we’ll always need superheroes to fly through the skies, punch bad guys, and web-sling throughout New York City. That’s the Stan Lee I’ll remember, and the one I am, and will always be, grateful for.<|endoftext|>

# Tumblr’s Vital Queer Community Is Disintegrating

## Tumblr’s Vital Queer Community Is Disintegrating

### *Besides a still rampant porn bot problem, adult content on Tumblr is pretty much gone*

At the turn of the millennium, I was a young adult just beginning to understand my own queer identity: who I was attracted to, what I wanted from relationships, how I understood myself as a queer person. As a college student in New York City, I was surrounded by resources that promised access to this knowledge — campus queer groups, dance parties, the bar scene — but none of them quite met my needs. I was shy and nightlife-averse.

So I went to the internet. An avid LiveJournal user, I connected with other queers, gaining a deeper sense of what it might mean to be queer through their stories. (The vibe was well documented in [a comic from *The Nib](&lt;|url|&gt;)* called “LiveJournal Made Me Gay.”). LiveJournal ultimately connected me to the now-defunct queer message board Strap-On.org, where users gathered to gossip, chat, and engage in the kinds of discussions about identity that wouldn’t enter the mainstream discourse for another decade or so.

As the years went by and the internet shifted and changed, sites like LiveJournal and Strap-On.org fell out of favor, hemorrhaging their audiences to newer (and more profitable) social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. But parts of the internet remained a place where queers could find a community, with one major hub in particular: Tumblr.
> # “I couldn’t scroll two feet without tripping over queer content, and it was glorious.”

Recently, Tumblr has become more corporate and [restrictive in its content policies](&lt;|url|&gt;), which feel particularly hostile to the platform’s vibrant queer community. As Pride Month wraps up, I wanted to take a look at the role Tumblr played in fostering many young queers on their journey to self-realization — and what we might lose as Tumblr’s queer community disintegrates.

“Queer Tumblr,” as it came to be known across the internet, represented a specific kind of discourse. It fostered a hypersensitive, extremely woke conversation focused on one-upmanship and proving one’s queer cred through an embrace of an expansive (and not particularly mainstream) understanding of identity. The specific setup of Tumblr — the intuitive and easy-to-use interface, the capability to post long-form posts alongside pictures and quick thoughts and the site’s historically lax content policies — made it easy for many queer people to open up about their experiences and identities.

Of course, not everyone who found a queer community on Tumblr initially joined in search of one. When I put out a call on Twitter for stories about how Tumblr helped people explore and understand their queer journey, many of the people who responded explained that were first drawn to the site by fandom communities (and, in one case, Taylor Swift). But once they were on the site, queer content seemed to be omnipresent in a way it simply wasn’t on the mainstream internet.

For those who got their start in Tumblr’s fandom communities, there was slash fic — a type of fan fiction where fictional characters are paired off into couples, often queer, that reach beyond canon — which served as a gateway to the other corners of queer Tumblr. “In hindsight, we were probably mostly gay 13-year-olds using fandom as a proxy for our own queerness,” says Dizzy*, a 22-year-old from New York.

Others found their interest piqued when LGBTQ-positive posts were reblogged into their timelines. “A lot of Tumblr was quite harshly segmented by interests, but queerness was a topic that could be found in any of these communities to bring them together,” says Harri, a 19-year-old from southeast England. “Someone might be on Tumblr for musicals, and someone else might be on there for anime, but both would reblog the same post about Pride flags, for example. It was a community that seemed to be found everywhere and anywhere.”

Those actively seeking queer content didn’t have to look hard. “I couldn’t scroll two feet without tripping over queer content, and it was glorious,” says Remy, a Wisconsin-based 24-year-old who joined Tumblr as a teenager desperate to find queer representation beyond what they’d lived with growing up in a conservative small town.

And once people got plugged into Tumblr’s queer scene, they were exposed to an expansive landscape of possibility, one where gays and lesbians and bisexuals existed alongside asexuals and pansexuals and demisexuals and nonbinary people.

“Tumblr taught me pansexuality, queerdom, fluidity — the idea of just being able to be more than a binary, and that life is greater than what can be defined in a marketable acronym,” says JR, a 29-year-old who lives in the U.K.

For some, the discovery led to a greater appreciation of the vast diversity of human sexual experience; for others, it led to a wholesale rethinking of their own identities. “About 95% of my understanding of my own identity as a transgender lesbian comes from Tumblr,” says Jill, a 27-year-old from France.
> # “Over the last few years I’ve watched as the general tone of the site shifted from true solidarity and pride to angry, gatekeepy infighting.”

Above all, the community felt supportive, inclusive, and kind. “It felt kind of like a secret club or a close-knit community,” says a Las Vegas-based 26-year-old who asked to remain totally anonymous. “Somewhere we were able to be whoever we wanted without our judgemental peers and family members there to bring us down.”

But it seems that the heyday of queer Tumblr has come to an end. For some, it’s a decline that’s been a long time coming. The openness and easy navigability of Tumblr that enabled so many young queers to stumble on community has also made the platform susceptible to cruelty and harassment. “Over the last few years I’ve watched as the general tone of the site shifted from true solidarity and pride to angry, gatekeepy infighting,” says Remy. Several people I spoke with cited trans-exclusionary radical feminists (commonly known as [TERFs](&lt;|url|&gt;)) as a particularly corrosive force that splintered the community and led to the harassment of more marginalized members of the queer community. “They preyed on the queer community,” says Carmen, a 26-year-old from the Midwest.

Others saw Tumblr’s [decision to ban all adult content from the platform late last year](&lt;|url|&gt;) as a death knell for the platform. During its heyday, Tumblr had some of the loosest content restrictions of any social media site, freely allowing users to publish adult content. And because it was free and easy to use, Tumblr became a way for people with minimal resources to share their erotic art — something a number of queer artists and performers took advantage of. More than just a source of titillation, Tumblr’s porn section was a place for queer people to express their sexuality in bold and uncompromising terms, a place to be visibly queer in the most literal and explicit possible sense. Now, those indie creators are gone; their vibrant addition to the online queer space replaced with porn bots that persistently flout Tumblr’s adult content ban. Without those voices, queer Tumblr isn’t quite the same thing.

“The community thrived because of adult content,” says Carmen. “And besides a still rampant porn bot problem, adult content on Tumblr is pretty much gone.”

But the end of queer Tumblr is hardly the end of queer life online. As long as there has been an internet, queer people have used it to find each other. Whatever comes next may not be quite the same as what Tumblr was, but it will still be a way to help queer people, and queer youth find one another — and themselves.

**Many of the people I spoke with asked me to use just their first name, or an online handle, to protect their privacy.*<|endoftext|>

# Science, Society, and So-Called Socialist Plants

## Lawmakers who see science as a challenge to their authority seek to cripple it. The consequences could be devastating.

Some societal changes are sudden, while others creep up more slowly. On the surface, the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) recent decision to allow the agricultural industry to keep using chlorpyrifos* *— a controversial pesticide linked to [neurological problems in children ](&lt;|url|&gt;)— doesn’t seem shocking. After all, the story of big chemical companies locked in battle with environmental scientists is one as old as modern America. But if you look closer, you might see the signs of a much larger shift.

The battle over chlorpyrifos was won with a new tactic. Instead of attacking individual studies, like tobacco companies battling cancer research in the 1970s, the supporters of chlorpyrifos were helped by politicians who quietly reset the rules of science.

The seeds of this change were planted more than a year ago when Trump’s EPA proposed a far-reaching [transparency policy](&lt;|url|&gt;). Under the agency’s new guidelines, scientists must publish the raw, non-anonymized data used in their research. The catch is that in long-term human studies, this raw data includes the medical history of hundreds of people — details that scientists have previously promised to keep private. If you’re a medical researcher, you face a grim choice: Violate your privacy promises, and you’ll run into strict [federal privacy laws](&lt;|url|&gt;). But keep these details anonymous, and the EPA will ignore your research completely.

In the case of chlorpyrifos, the new transparency guidelines eliminated large, peer-reviewed studies by [Columbia University](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Berkeley](&lt;|url|&gt;) from consideration. Smaller experiments on animals in controlled laboratory environments, like the ones chemical companies use to show the safety of their products, were unaffected. And just like that, the EPA’s consensus reversed, shifting from an inability[ to conclude](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the risk from the use of chlorpyrifos meets the safety standard in 2015 to “the objections [to its use] are [not supported](&lt;|url|&gt;) by valid, complete, and reliable evidence” this year.

The word “complete” betrays the game — it’s not the science that changed. The shift was in the rules we use to allow science into the political conversation.
> # The goal is to dilute science until it becomes another voice shouting in the crowd — a voice you can choose to disregard even in the face of environmental calamity.

The chlorpyrifos decision isn’t an isolated case. In fact, political policy is full of places where science collides with our culture and our comfort. But increasingly, the argument isn’t being fought on scientific grounds (with competing studies) or on policy grounds (with cost-benefit assessments). Instead, politicians choose to avoid the argument entirely and instead attack the opponent. The goal is not to pick scientific winners and losers in every fight, but to dilute science until it becomes another voice shouting in the crowd — a voice you can choose to disregard even in the face of environmental calamity.

The decision to allow chlorpyrifos has the potential to affect thousands of children and dozens of species, but it’s a relatively small detail in the big picture of political science interference. The EPA transparency rule threatens to overturn almost all settled science on air and water pollution, clearing the way to introduce more banned pesticides and reduce restrictions on pollution ranging from car tailpipes to power plant smokestacks. And the transparency rule is itself just one part of the science-obscuring initiatives transforming public policy. Other rules [restrict](&lt;|url|&gt;) what sort of scientists can serve on advisory panels, [limit](&lt;|url|&gt;) the scope of their conclusions, or hide difficult realities by [banning](&lt;|url|&gt;) problem words.

Consider another example. The EPA recently [expanded the use](&lt;|url|&gt;) of sulfoxaflor, a formerly banned pesticide that is highly toxic to threatened bee colonies. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture [suspended](&lt;|url|&gt;) data collection for its annual Honey Bee Colonies report. The department claimed the decision was due to budget cuts, but it had the side effect of ensuring that there would be no future numbers to challenge the change. Once again, it wasn’t an argument against science, but a strategy to marginalize science — a way to contain its ability to influence policy.

History shows that when we marginalize mainstream science, we court disaster. Nazi attempts to purify their science from Jewish influence drove away many of their most brilliant minds, ensuring they’d lose the race to the atomic bomb. Ideological purity tests triggered famine in China and the Soviet Union.

Perhaps the best-known case is that of Trofim Lysenko, who led the Soviet effort to “revolutionize” agricultural science. Lysenko promoted new techniques before researchers could study them, denounced genetic science, and led a campaign to fire more than 3,000 mainstream biologists, whom he [denounced](&lt;|url|&gt;) as “fly-lovers and people haters.”

The result was that Lysenko was free to shape Soviet agricultural policy to his own whim, using the language of science without being challenged by actual scientific study. His ideas thrived for years, not because they were successful, but because they pleased politicians. For example, Lysenko imbued plants with the spirit of socialism, arguing that they were not killed by drought but had died by [sacrificing themselves](&lt;|url|&gt;) to protect the lives of their plant comrades. He overturned settled science on genes, asserting that wheat plants [could be trained](&lt;|url|&gt;) to produce rye seeds, which aligned with communist ideas about the power of nurture over nature. And he claimed that members of the same species do not compete, directing workers to plant their seeds too close together. These unchecked ideas helped to fuel a [famine that killed millions](&lt;|url|&gt;).

The era of great famines is over in industrialized nations. Or is it? When the U.S. Secretary of State [describes](&lt;|url|&gt;) the rapidly warming world as a land of “opportunity and abundance,” one just might hear the echo of Lysenko’s politician-pleasing claims.

For at least a generation, our society has operated under an unspoken agreement. Science provides the tech we use, the medicine we need, and the gadgets we love. In return, it mostly stays out of our way. Today, this grand bargain is strained and failing. Science is increasingly banging up against our politics, our desires, and the comfortable cocoon of modern life. How we react will likely shape the future we live in. So far, we’ve reacted — by pushing back hard.<|endoftext|>

# A Tribute to the Lost Spacecrafts of 2018

## The Long Goodbye

### How NASA’s Deep Space Network said goodbye to three planet-hunting missions

![Photo by AI SEIB/AFP/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo by AI SEIB/AFP/Getty Images*

On December 24, 1963, William Pickering, the director of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, signed a letter officially creating the Deep Space Network (DSN). The NASA network is a series of large radio antennas that serve as the communication and navigation hub for all robotic spacecrafts that travel in deep space (anything from the moon and beyond).

In the 55 years since its initiation, the DSN has expanded and is now made up of three stations around the world: Goldstone, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia. Each station is home to one 70-meter antenna and three or four 34-meter antennas. These radio dishes are how NASA tracks and communicates with all of its robotic missions in space. (You can watch humans on Earth [talking to spacecrafts in deep space](&lt;|url|&gt;) at DSN Now.)

This year, the DSN witnessed several missions achieve impressive feats, including the most recent landing of the spacecraft InSight on Mars, where it will probe beneath the planet’s surface to learn more about Mars’ formation. The DSN also experienced three major spacecraft losses this year, and while those spacecrafts’ discoveries will be mined for years to come, their departures can feel grief-inducing for followers.

In 2018, an unexpectedly timed global dust storm enveloped the entirety of Mars, severing NASA’s connection to the solar-powered Opportunity Rover. “Once the storm abated, we started the process of trying to regain contact, and so far, not a peep or a beep,” says Glen Nagle, the outreach lead at the Canberra Deep Space Communication Center, who has worked at the DSN for 17 years. “We all feel for this rover. The anguish comes in empathy for the people whose careers are built around that rover.”

In 2004, Opportunity landed on Mars with its twin rover named Spirit. The rovers explored different regions of the planet and operated well beyond their planned 90-day missions. Opportunity, more formally known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover-B), spent the past 14 years on the planet. During that time, it discovered evidence of Mars’ history, including small mineral spheres that NASA calls “blueberries,” which are likely leftovers from the planet’s watery past.
> # “Once the storm abated, we started the process of trying to regain contact, and so far, not a peep or a beep.”

While there remains hope that Opportunity will call home again one day, NASA also lost two missions this year that won’t be recovered. The Kepler spacecraft, launched in March 2009, was an all-star for exoplanet discovery. Its mission was to discover planets outside our solar system, and it found more than 2,000 exoplanets orbiting around other stars. When Kepler began sending data back to the DSN, the news of new exoplanets was enough to knock you out of your seat. Thanks to Kepler, we now know that most stars have planets encircling them. Since there are hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy alone, this discovery has fundamentally changed the world’s view of the universe. Of course, it also raises questions about the likelihood of life existing beyond our solar system.

Kepler operated for nine years before it ran out of fuel on October 30. Richard Stephenson, a longtime DSN operator at the Canberra station, was one of the operators who sent the command to shut down the spacecraft’s communications. “You can easily superimpose human feeling onto the spacecraft you support,” he says. “This is due mainly to the interface with the mission [team] itself. You pick up on their excitement, concerns, or sadness through the voices you hear. When the ‘goodnight’ command was sent to the Kepler spacecraft, I confirmed with the [team] when I saw the spacecraft transmitter switch off for the last time. You could hear their sadness, and I couldn’t help but feel sad as well.”


Also this year, the DSN lost contact with the Dawn mission, a space probe launched by NASA in September 2007 that is in orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres. Dawn was sent on a mission to look into the “dawn” of the solar system. It was the first spacecraft to orbit two planetary bodies, first visiting the asteroid Vesta in 2011 before arriving at Ceres in 2015. Vesta is one of the oldest asteroids ever discovered and is believed to be a time capsule of the early solar system. And while Ceres is a dwarf planet that resides in the asteroid belt, scientists believe it formed much farther out and later migrated in. After 11 successful years, Dawn also ran out of fuel. One day, it stopped calling home. “You feel sorry for the people who have endowed so much of their life in it,” Stephenson says. “For them, a chapter has just finished.”

Even with the loss of Kepler and Dawn and the silence from Opportunity, the DSN remains constantly busy. After all, it was the only network of dishes powerful enough to communicate with the stranded Apollo 13 astronauts, and it’s still the only way for spacecrafts that travel beyond the moon to talk to Earth. Suzy Dodd, director of the Interplanetary Network Directorate at JPL that manages the DSN, leads NASA’s ongoing Voyager mission. Twin intrepid spacecrafts were launched from Earth in 1977 on a mission to explore every single outer planet: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. “The connection between Voyager and the DSN is beautiful,” Dodd says. “It takes a lot of antennas to talk to Voyager, because it’s so far away, basically about four times as far as Neptune to us. Voyager 1’s signal is over 20 hours one way. You need a lot of antennas just to get a very faint signal.”

While DSN workers and space enthusiasts alike mourn the loss of the acclaimed missions, the sorrow must be short-lived. After all, there are new missions ahead for the DSN, including InSight, the newly minted Mars inhabitant. Scientists don’t know what Mars looks like under the surface, how large its core is, and what the planet is made of. InSight will spend two years trying to fill these gaps. According to Dodd, it’s a busy time of year for the DSN. On New Year’s Day, NASA’s New Horizons probe — which in 2015 became the first spacecraft to observe Pluto — is scheduled to fly past the distant kuiper belt object called MU 69, an expanse of ancient icy rock. DSN operators will ring in the new year at work.

“We kick off straightaway with getting to capture for the world the first data and close-up images of the most distant object yet to be directly explored by a spacecraft,” says Glen Nagle at Canberra. “That beats fireworks any day.”<|endoftext|>

# Beyond the Dark Forest Theory of the Internet

## Re-learning how to be yourself online

![Photo: Artur Debat/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Artur Debat/Getty Images*

*This is a two-part post. [Click here for part one](&lt;|url|&gt;).*

## Prequel to the Dark Forest

Two weeks ago I wrote about [the dark forest theory of the internet](&lt;|url|&gt;). I used the dark forest theory to explain why we’re afraid to be public online, and what could be lost as a result.

I first connected the dark forest theory with the internet when I had a strange realization earlier this year: that I knew how to be myself in real life, but I didn’t know how to be myself online.

In “real life” I’m a reasonably self-confident, 40-year-old human. If we sat next to each other on a plane we’d have a good-to-memorable conversation.

But on the internet, I feel like a teenager struggling to find their identity. I’m all awkward exclamation points and weird over-explanations. I’m often too self-conscious to be interesting or real.

When I used the internet as an actual adolescent in the 1990s and as a young adult in the 2000s, this wasn’t the case. I blogged every day. Message boards were how I learned to test theories and debate ideas. These communities were small enough that people knew each other but big enough that there was a diversity of opinion and conversation. You could vehemently disagree with someone about politics in one thread while agreeing just as passionately with that same person in a debate about movie sequels in another.

I had no problem being myself online then. But now it feels different.

A lot of this difference is on me. I’m older. I have more at stake. But it’s not just me that changed. The internet did too. The internet went from a venue for low stakes experimentation to the place with some of the highest stakes of all. With the rise of online bullying, [shaming](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [swatting](&lt;|url|&gt;), the internet became emotionally, reputationally, and physically dangerous. It became the dark forest. Our digital breadcrumbs became evidence that could and would be used against us. To keep safe we exercised our right to stay silent and moved underground.
> # When it comes to showing our true selves online, many of us are more like black domains than we care to admit.

In *The Three Body Problem* series, author Liu Cixin presents a solution for the dark forest threat: a “black domain.” This device slows the speed of light to create a cloak of invisibility around a planet or galaxy. A black domain stops everything from getting in or out. It’s security through cosmic self-imprisonment.

Dark forests like email lists and Slack groups are more forgiving than Liu’s black domains. They’re off-grid, but they aren’t that off-grid. Today’s black domain equivalents might be things like [putting phones in freezers](&lt;|url|&gt;), [Mastodon](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [crypto cold storage](&lt;|url|&gt;). Not many of us are that hardcore with our digital habits yet. But when it comes to showing our true selves online, many of us are more like black domains than we care to admit.

## Beyond the Dark Forest

When I realized I didn’t know how to be myself online, my first thought was: Who cares? It doesn’t matter. It’s just the internet.

But the more I thought about it, the more I began to think that it did matter. There’s tremendous value in coming into yourself as a person. Why wouldn’t that be true online, too? Recognizing that my online self was lacking, I decided to learn how to be myself on the internet.

I started with a simple exercise. For one week, I would tweet twice a day. (Normally I tweet about once a month.) I wouldn’t try to impress or be cool. I would be real and share whatever was actually on my mind.

Once in the morning and once at night, I tweeted. I wrote about child-rearing, grocery shopping, politics, books, and basketball. The results were more trivial than revolutionary, and that was the point. I wasn’t trying to stand out. I was getting practice reps at being me. The regular schedule lowered my anxiety and helped dial in my voice.

The next step in my digital self-acceptance was to try sharing my dark forest self with the larger internet. After sending [my last email](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the dark forest, I [posted it here on Medium](&lt;|url|&gt;), which isn’t something I normally do. I didn’t expect a response, but I was nervous nonetheless. And then, out of nowhere, the piece blew up. In the last two weeks, more than 130,000 people from around the world read it.

The dark forest theory struck a chord. And it’s no wonder: many of us struggle to be ourselves online. We’re wary of showing who we are outside our private channels. But at the same time, we recognize that there are trade-offs to our isolation. Our dark forests can become black domains, with little connection to or influence on the outside world.
> # The internet went from a venue for low stakes experimentation to the place with some of the highest stakes of all.

What’s the in-between? That’s what my experiments have been trying to find. That process is ongoing, but my more-complicated-in-practice-than-theory answer is to strive to be your true self in every context and vow to be present wherever you are. We can’t lurk in the dark forests and expect anything to change for the better. To improve and positively contribute to the communities and cultures we’re a part of, we have to actively engage. [As I wrote last time](&lt;|url|&gt;), what kind of bowling alley it is depends on who goes there.

Sometimes I question the merits of the project. Is this a waste of time? Why not just delete my accounts and stay in my dark forests forever?

It’s tempting, I admit. But whenever I go down that path, I think about Russia’s disinformation campaign that began before the 2016 election, and that continues to this day.

Russia’s GRU directed their agents to pose as Americans using fake social media accounts, and to use those accounts to flood Twitter and Facebook with politically and racially divisive messages. These sleeper accounts didn’t (and don’t) just post propaganda, however. In between their attempts to inflame, they posted about cooking, sports, and other everyday mundanities. They used the trivial to build rapport and trust with their followers, to make the fake accounts seem more real, and to normalize the extreme ideas they were posting.

Here I was retreating from the web because I thought my online presence was unimportant and inconsequential. Meanwhile, a foreign power was using its resources to pretend to be someone like me to try to influence someone like me. What kind of influence does that mean I really have? What kind of influence does that mean each of us has? And who fills that vacuum if we fail to fill it ourselves?

I don’t like the possibilities that come up when I try to answer that question. And so rather than retreat into my black domain, here I am: re-learning how to be myself on the internet instead.

# Forget ‘Dumbo’&#58; It’s Time for Disney to Remake ‘Fantasia’

## Forget ‘Dumbo’: It’s Time for Disney to Remake ‘Fantasia’

### *The only Disney classic that could really use a modern update*

This weekend, Disney’s *Dumbo* soars into theaters — because he’s a flying elephant, get it? — marking the latest in the studio’s efforts to move all of its 2D, hand-animated classics into the world of 3D through the use of live-action Hollywood talent and copious amounts of CGI.

That’s all well and good, but as usual the company has picked the wrong movie to remake. Because the only Disney film that truly deserves this big-budget modernization is *Fantasia*.

To be clear, I am not one of those guys who’s upset that Disney is ruining its classic films by remaking them for today’s audiences. Movie blockbusters have been consumed by CGI for years, and it’s what most kids today recognize as film quality. Of course they’d rather see a 3D animated flying elephant around a virtual 3D set with live actors inserted into it instead of a 2D elephant flying around a hand-painted background. Your beloved childhood memories aren’t lost by Disney putting real actors and modern SFX in *Dumbo, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin*, or any of its other animated classics.

But the modernization effort doesn’t add much, either, other than to Disney’s bottom line. Simply replacing the animated characters with CGI versions and adding in known celebrities didn’t make Emma Watson’s 2017 *Beauty and the Beast* movie better than the animated original 1991 *Beauty and the Beast*; nor, likely, will live actors and modern SFX make the upcoming new versions of *Aladdin *and* The Lion King* — both of which are also coming out later this year — an improvement over their predecessors.

However, there is a classic Disney film that’s just screaming to be remade using today’s technology. A film that could be objectively improved with live-action actors (especially motion-caption actors) and today’s incredible CGI wizardry. A film with a story that which wouldn’t be diminished by adding new visuals, because the story itself is pure visual.

That film is, of course, *Fantasia*, Walt Disney’s beautiful, groundbreaking 1940 opus that married the studio’s lush animation to famous works of classical music. *Fantasia* was only Disney Pictures’ third feature film, coming out after 1937’s *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves* and 1940’s *Pinocchio*. It’s astonishing now to think that Disney would put out something so risky and so ambitious at that young point in the company’s history. Making a movie out of a collection of classical music pieces — plenty of them unknown to mass audiences — and then setting them to often abstract animated sequences, such as dinosaurs in combat, fairies putting dew on a forest, and a massive demon summoning his minions? With only one segment starring a recognizable Disney character, Mickey Mouse as the sorcerer’s apprentice? That is significantly bolder filmmaking than bringing out, say, *Cars 3*.

It’s also what makes *Fantasia* so perfect for modernization. The film has no script. It tells its stories entirely through the music and its visuals. And visual animation has come a long, long way since 1940.

Envision the frenzy of the rogue, water-carrying brooms that Mickey Mouse accidentally summons in “[The Sorcerer’s Apprentice](&lt;|url|&gt;)*”* if it were animated by Pixar. Think about the psychedelic visuals of the planet of Pandora in *Avatar* applied to the flying fairies, swirling flowers, and dancing fish of “The Nutcracker Suite.” Imagine the swirling cosmos fading into the rise and fall of the dinosaurs in “Rite of Spring” as animated by Industrial Light & Magic, with their experience on *Star Wars* and the *Jurassic World* movies. Or put Andy Serkis in another mo-cap suit as the massive demon Chernabog in *Fantasia*’s epic finale, “[Night on Bald Mountain](&lt;|url|&gt;).” (Chances of Serkis also playing a live-action version of “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” wizard Yen Sid: Pretty high.)

I’m not knocking the lovely, classic cel animation of the original *Fantasia*, and we all know better technology does not always equal a better product, especially when it comes to art. (Case in point: The listless sequel *Fantasia 2000*, which had improved technology, but whose lackluster segments never approached the creativity and energy of the original.) But because *Fantasia* tells its stories solely through its visuals, which were revolutionary at the time, it has diminished over the years, as even hand-drawn animation evolved. Without character performances to anchor them, *Fantasia* tends to feel less timeless than, say, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves*, even though that came out earlier.

But this means that there’s a real benefit to remaking *Fantasia* beyond simply getting it into theaters again. The expansiveness of three dimensions — the versatility of the camera alone — would add so much dynamism to what we could see on screen. Imagine any of the segments of *Fantasia* given the style and vivacity as *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*. That’s an incredible proposition, and one I hate to think Disney might overlook.

[The *Los Angeles Times](&lt;|url|&gt;)* reported that Walt Disney himself said of his film, “*Fantasia* is timeless. It may run 10, 20, or 30 years. It may run after I’m gone… I can never build another *Fantasia*. I can improve. I can elaborate. That’s all.” He wasn’t wrong. So call me when Disney finally gets around to announcing its remake of *Fantasia* — because I’ll be standing by.<|endoftext|>

# A Superstar’s Stellar Fireworks Show

## Eta Carinae exploded long ago and may have already exploded again. The Hubble Space Telescope gets the most detailed look yet.

![Eta Carinae in all its glory. Image:

Astronomers love Eta Carinae, a relatively nearby superstar that exploded nearly two centuries ago, and has since offered humans a ringside seat to a spectacular cosmic display. Now the Hubble Space Telescope has captured the highest-resolution image of the system ever captured, colored in red, white and blue and released just in time for — well, you guessed it.

The explosion of Eta Carinae, about 7,500 light-years away from Earth, was first noticed in 1838. By 1844 it had become the second-brightest star in the night sky, so luminous that seafarers came to rely on it for navigation. It has since faded, but beginning in 1990 Hubble and other space telescopes began to reveal a series of intricacies in the ever-expanding clouds of gas and dust that billow out in two directions.

Last year, researchers [determined](&lt;|url|&gt;) the material from the explosion zooms out at greater than 20 million miles per hour — fast enough to travel from Earth to Pluto in a handful of days.

Eta Carinae, first noted by Edmund Halley in 1677, is a two-star system (the second star was [discovered](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2005). The larger star is massive, unstable, and nearing its death. Scientists believe that it will eventually explode even more violently and collapse into a neutron star or a black hole.

Exactly why Eta Carinae exploded before, and why it didn’t collapse, is a mystery. One idea is that there were three stars — packing the combined heft of 150 suns — and [one was devoured](&lt;|url|&gt;), an event that would surely trigger a violent eruption.

Here’s why all this is being scrutinized so closely: The main star is thought to be using up its fuel quickly, and could be [poised to blow even more spectacularly](&lt;|url|&gt;). “We know it’s close to the end of its life,” astronomer Armin Rest of the Space Telescope Science Institute [said](&lt;|url|&gt;) back in 2012. “It could explode in a thousand years, or it could happen tomorrow.”

In fact, it may already have done so. Because the system is 7,500 years away, the new photo shows events from 7,500 years ago — that’s how long it has taken light from Eta Carinae to reach Earth. If it exploded again 7,400 years ago, we’ll find out in a century.

Here’s an overview of the system:


If Eta Carinae has an undramatic name, the resulting dumbbell-shaped clouds it created received just the opposite. Scientists call it the Homunculus Nebula. The material smashes into stuff previously ejected by the star, warming it up and causing chemicals to glow. The new image was made by recording ultraviolet light. Technicians take Hubble’s data, captured in grayscale, and colorize it. In this image, blue represents warm, glowing magnesium gas, and the red is nitrogen.

The image does not offer any breakthrough discoveries, but it could help scientists better understand how the explosion began, and thus what might come next (and what could happen with other stars).

“We’ve discovered a large amount of warm gas that was ejected in the Great Eruption but hasn’t yet collided with the other material surrounding Eta Carinae,” lead investigator of the Hubble program, Nathan Smith at the University of Arizona’s Steward Observatory, said on July 1. “Most of the emission is located where we expected to find an empty cavity. This extra material is fast, and it ‘ups the ante’ in terms of the total energy of an already powerful stellar blast.”

The blue streaks at the lower left of the image are light rays from the star streaming out through the dusty bubbles.

Eta Carinae is nothing like our sun, but it’s a reminder of how explosive stars can be. As one example that hits closer to home, scientists recently studied several distant sun-like stars and found superflares that they say the sun is also capable of producing — [events that would cripple technology](&lt;|url|&gt;) and possibly even humanity.

NASA has a long history of using “celestial fireworks” to describe cosmic explosions and their aftermaths. Here are a few blasts from the past:

1. Ultraviolet radiation and violent stellar winds blew out a cavity in the gas and dust enveloping the star cluster, NGC 3603. NASA released the image last year.

2. This glittering display of young stars was released for Hubble’s 25th anniversary, in 2015. From NASA: “The giant star cluster is about 2 million years old and contains some of our galaxy’s hottest, brightest and most massive stars. Some of its heftiest stars unleash torrents of ultraviolet light and hurricane-force winds of charged particles etching into the enveloping hydrogen gas cloud.”

3. NGC 6946 is actually called the Fireworks Galaxy. No fewer than eight exploding stars, called supernovas, have been recorded coming from this galaxy in the past century. This image, released in 2017, reveals X-ray along with visible-light emissions.

4. The Helix Nebula begs a 4th of July soundtrack as it explodes not overhead, but WAY overhead, as in 659 light-years distant. The image shows “a dying star unraveling into space,” according to NASA.

# Our Robocall Nightmare May Be Coming to an End

## Our Robocall Nightmare May Be Coming to an End

### *Phone spam is out of control, but relief is in sight*

![Photo: H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty*

My phone vibrates and I glance at the screen, noting the call’s “917” area code — the same as my own number. “New York City,” I note. “Might be important.”

It’s not. It almost never is anymore.

The call is from a fake credit card company urging me to talk about lowering my interest rates. I grip the phone tightly and consider throwing it against a wall.

Later that day, my landline rings. Again, it’s a New York City number, and my caller ID lists it as “Apple, Inc.” Having [dealt with fake Apple support](&lt;|url|&gt;) before, I ignore it. But “Apple, Inc.” is persistent, eventually calling five times in one day. Finally, I pick up and inform them I’ll be contacting the FBI.

They back off — for now.

Later that day, I decide to call that number back. It resolves to the actual Queens, New York- based Apple Center, which has pre-recorded a message that says, “Apple is aware that some customers are receiving unsolicited calls claiming to be from this Apple center.” It recommends not giving out any information and tries to steer affected customers to support.

Spam, robo, and spoof calls, especially those that masquerade as calls from your local area code, reached crisis proportions on landlines almost two years ago. Now, according to some estimates, the same is about to happen to our mobile phones. [A 2018 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) conducted by First Orion, a scam protection provider, predicts “44.6 percent of calls to mobile phones will be scam calls in 2019.”

What First Orion described sounds to me like an epidemic, and one that needs some sort of immediate vaccine. A one-shot solution doesn’t exist, but hope does lie, as it so often does, in new technology.

It turns out that both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) have enforcement oversight for this problem, with each having jurisdiction over certain industries. It’s like a gentleman’s agreement: The FCC can bring actions in industries where the FTC does not have jurisdiction, like airlines and banks. While the FCC has specific anti-spoofing rules and can bring cases that specifically target spoofing, the FTC’s robocall cases respond to the simple fact that the calls were placed. The FTC also brings cases against companies that use robocalls to commit fraud, and, of course, it enforces the Do Not Call Registry.
> # “We average 400,000 to 500,000 complaints a month. It’s far and away the top complaint category we get.”

I attempted to contact the FCC regarding its anti-spam and spoof-calling work via phone and email but have yet to receive a response. The FTC responded almost immediately.

While FTC officials couldn’t confirm First Orion’s spam call findings, their own numbers don’t exactly dispute the disturbing trend. “At the FTC, the data we see on unwanted calls and abusive and fraudulent calls comes from consumer complaints,” Ian Barlow, the FTC’s “Do Not Call” program manager, told me. “We average 400,000 to 500,000 complaints a month. It’s far and away the top complaint category we get.”

Though the National Do Not Call Registry was launched in 2003, it predates affordable voice-over IP products that make robocalls and phone number spoofing mobile-app-level easy. (Think [VICIDial](&lt;|url|&gt;), an open-source standby for telemarketers.)

According to Verizon, spammers and robocallers use “community spoofing” to “mimic the first six digits of your phone number and then randomly generate the last four to get you to think someone local is calling you.”

The scammers know that when you see a local number on caller ID — another technology that’s been weaponized against us — you’re more likely to pick up. “A lot of the fraudulent and abusive [spoofers] use a different caller ID number with every call now, so [you] can’t detect, ‘this is the call number I should detect and block,’” said Barlow.

Plus, finding local numbers to seed millions more spoofed calls is easy.

“The database they’re using can come from any number of sources,” a Verizon spokesperson explained. “Just Google your own phone number for instance and you can see where it’s listed.”

In my house, the number of spam calls outnumber real calls five-to-one. My current favorite are the Chinese calls, where I hear a single English phrase followed by a minute of Mandarin. ([These scams](&lt;|url|&gt;) apparently target the growing Chinese population in the U.S.) In some cases, I’ve stayed on the line long enough to hit whatever key I need to get added to the spammer’s own “do not call” list. This turns out to be a rookie mistake.

“In some cases, they do work, but we recommended hanging up as soon as you know it’s not a call you want to work with,” Barlow said. That’s because, no surprise, most scammers don’t actually keep lists of people not to call. Hitting a button is simply proof you exist, and it puts you on a sucker list of sorts, guaranteeing you’ll get more calls.

As soon as I started investigating the nuisance call epidemic, I stumbled on STIR (Secure Telephony Identity Revisited)/SHAKEN (Secure Handling of Asserted information using toKENs), a framework of call-handling and authentication technologies that could be used by all mobile and landline telecom providers (and VoIP companies) to verify that the number you see on caller ID is the actual origin number.

STIR/SHAKEN grew out of a partnership between the FCC and telecom partners. It uses public key cryptography and digital certificates from trusted authorities to verify that the local number you see is legit.

If the telecom industry was run by the FCC or FTC, or if there was a single telephone company (like the [old “Ma Bell” days](&lt;|url|&gt;)), it would be easy to flip a switch to make STIR/SHAKEN a reality.

That’s not our world. I’m on Verizon and my neighbor’s on Sprint. Your friend is on T-Mobile or [Google Fi](&lt;|url|&gt;). Normally getting a whole industry to support such an initiative would be next to impossible.

But after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s [call to action](&lt;|url|&gt;) late last year on STIR/SHAKEN (around the time we learned that consumers received over [5 billion robo calls in a single month](&lt;|url|&gt;)) nearly 14 providers quickly fell into line. Even though these companies will need to work together to make SHAKEN/STIR work, they’re positioning it as a competitive advantage.

“We were first to announce readiness for STIR/SHAKEN in November 2018 and first to deploy it on our network earlier this month (before Verizon Wireless),” said a T-Mobile spokesperson via email.

T-Mobile calls its deployment “Caller Verified.” The company already blocks scam calls by checking numbers against a global database of known scammers. Knowing how often scam callers change numbers, I question the effectiveness of this solution. However, the FTC told me T-Mobile does an excellent job blocking these calls.

Verizon launched a series of spam and call blocking tools last year, and, starting next month, it will offer those tools to all Verizon smartphone customers for free. Landline customers get Verizon’s Spam Alerts service, also for free. Verizon told the FCC last year that it “expects that a large portion, possibly a substantial majority, of Verizon voice call traffic to be signed in 2019.”

It will take some time for all telecoms to fully implement the framework, but the process will certainly accelerate this year. Sprint and AT&T have also committed to implementing and deploying STIR/SHAKEN in 2019. By 2020 or 2021, problem solved, right?

“I’m hopeful. I don’t want to sound naive,” said Barlow, “[It’s] not some kind of panacea.”

Meanwhile, as we wait for more free spam- and spoof-call blocking solutions, there are a few steps you can take today to protect yourself. Barlow had this advice:

## **Register**

He still believes consumers should register with the National Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov. It will not block all those calls, but for the legitimate businesses that do comply with the rules, it will ensure they do not call you.

## **Hang up**

As I noted above, my interactions with some of these scamming bastards might make me feel good, but anything I say or do on the line with them is simply a validation that my number is real. “The more you stay on, the more it looks like you’re interested,” said Barlow. As soon as you realize it’s not a legit call, hang up.

## **Report**

Barlow recommends reporting these calls [to the FTC](&lt;|url|&gt;) and, I would guess, [the FCC, as well](&lt;|url|&gt;).

## **Local apps**

Barlow said there are a number of call-blocking apps you can download from the App Store, like Call Blocker and Hiya. Obviously, you can use your phone’s native software to block individual numbers, though, in our robocalling world, that seems like a near pointless solution.

Consumers might also find some relief on the the [CTIA’s How to Stop Robocalls](&lt;|url|&gt;) page, which features tips and a list of 550 mitigation apps.

Barlow also told me the FTC pursues many robocaller cases and has helped collect judgments totaling $1.5 billion. They also get court orders that essentially shut the spammers down.

Even though the FTC and FCC do not pursue these cases together, they do coordinate anti-spam and spoofing efforts through both informal and quarterly calls. As Barlow explained this I wondered, just for a moment: Do they pause and stare at the caller ID on the screen before picking up? I know I would.

# How Crypto Could Bring Tax Evasion to the Masses

## Loopholes in lending laws are allowing cryptocurrency users to escape taxes — and the government can’t keep up

![Photo by [Viktor Forgacs](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Viktor Forgacs](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Wealthy families and merchants first conjured up the idea of offshore banking in 19th century Europe, seeking a place to store funds away from tax-hungry governments in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars. Since then, it’s been a race to the bottom. Over the course of the last two centuries, deregulation and lenient financial laws have allowed the rich to tread the fine line between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion.

But blockchain, which first emerged as a concept in 2008, is now offering ordinary people the same possibilities. Using cryptocurrency, anyone with a little technical know-how can open what is effectively the equivalent of an offshore bank account — albeit offshore in cyberspace.

On the genesis block — the first block ever mined on the bitcoin blockchain — an ominous message was inscribed: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”* *The words foreshadowed the development of an asset that would provide an alternative to centralized banks. For a time afterwards, bitcoin became the de facto darknet currency, at least until traders realized that because every transaction on the open blockchain is tied to a public address, meaning that the cryptocurrency is actually far less suitable for illicit transactions than the briefcases full of anonymous paper currency favored by gangsters.

A cluster of competing coins that offered enhanced privacy features came to market in 2014, including Monero and Verge; Zcash launched in 2016**.** These blockchain-based currencies were not only decentralized, but effectively invisible, leaving no trace of transactions. To many of their supporters, these anonymous currencies were seen as an antidote to the kind of surveillance capitalism developing in China.

In this version of the future, platforms like WeChat, or eventually [Facebook](&lt;|url|&gt;), might have a direct window into your financial data, tracked spending habits can be used as marketing data, and the privilege of being able to pay for things could be revoked in much the same way that social media dissidents can be deplatformed and canceled overnight.

Dystopian futures aside, privacy coins already offer immediate benefits in the present, and can help prevent businesses accepting cryptocurrency from unwittingly committing an offense by exposing customer financial details to advertisers, criminals, or jealous ex-partners.
> # Using cryptocurrency, anyone with a little technical know-how can open what is effectively the equivalent of an offshore bank account — albeit offshore in cyberspace.

“[Nonprofits](&lt;|url|&gt;) accept donations in Zcash a lot,” says Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, an American computer security specialist and Zcash’s creator and CEO. “One reason for that is that donors often prefer privacy when donating. Another is that if a business wanted to use a blockchain or cryptocurrency, either way, for business transactions, they would require privacy. It wouldn’t be acceptable legally or in business considerations to broadcast their transactions to the world.”

But while privacy coins might offer an alternative to surveillance capitalism, they also allow funds to be concealed for more nefarious causes. Crypto enthusiasts are increasingly learning how best to hide assets from divorcing spouses, debt collectors — and the taxman.

## **A series of horrible boating accidents**

Anyone venturing on to Crypto Twitter in late 2017 could be forgiven for concluding that cryptocurrency fans share a common interest in water sports. When Monero founder Riccardo Spagni [tweeted](&lt;|url|&gt;) that he had lost all of his cryptocurrency in a “series of horrible boating accidents,” a meme was born — and one that gradually spread as other crypto stars claimed to have lost funds in similarly spurious events.

And who can dispute it? Losing the complex codes that control digital assets is easy to do, and according to blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis, around [4 million bitcoins](&lt;|url|&gt;) have been accidentally sent into the black hole since the cryptocurrency’s inception. While these “[hodlers](&lt;|url|&gt;)” are still figuring out how secure digital assets prone to theft and loss, governments are creating regulations to try and prevent misuse. But in their haste, they have left open a loophole that allows bold investors to avoid tax — completely legally.

According to the IRS, both crypto-to-crypto transactions and crypto-to-cash transactions are taxable events — an unwelcome expense for many traders and investors. Not only are long-term hodlers subject to the same tax rules that govern property, like furniture or collectible coins, but short-term traders must pay tax each time that a virtual asset is swapped for another.

During the bear market of 2018, when bitcoin fell almost 80%, this cost became too much for many to consider, and fueled the growth of a new part of the crypto ecosystem: lending.

Instead of selling cryptocurrency and creating a taxable event, these investors turned to a rapidly growing breed of crypto lenders, placing their bitcoin, or Ethereum, under their custody, and using it as collateral to buy even more cryptocurrency or borrow cash. The idea is not new, but until now, this way of lending against assets has only been available to those with significant holdings. Unfettered by regulations, crypto lenders are able to offer instant loans from only $500, significantly lowering the barrier to borrowers willing to take the risk.

## **Untamed territories**

Exactly how long this wild west of finance can last is unclear. The IRS hasn’t yet addressed crypto lending, and while global regulators might have been willing to turn a blind eye to offshore bank accounts, privacy coins are attracting a more proactive approach.

Cryptocurrency-friendly Japan — which pushed ahead with regulation that made bitcoin legal tender in 2017 — has taken a hard-line stance. Authorities there are pressuring exchanges to pull privacy focused-coins, and actively pursuing tax evaders who have failed to declare at least [10 billion yen](&lt;|url|&gt;) (more than $90 million) in crypto income over the last few years.

Regulators elsewhere are gathering forces. Speaking at the G20 communique in 2018, U.S. treasury secretary [Steven Mnuchin](&lt;|url|&gt;) called for anonymous financial transactions to be stopped, urging the world’s largest economies to come together to prevent privacy coins from becoming the next “Swiss bank account.*”* Since then, tax authorities have banded together to pursue borderless cryptocurrencies, with five of the world’s biggest economies joining forces under the [J5](&lt;|url|&gt;) banner to investigate this method of tax evasion.

But while regulators scramble to find a solution, the technology races ahead. To close the gap, authorities are now building relationships with exchanges and forensic firms that can offer a deeper glimpse into the crypto ecosystem.
> # Crypto enthusiasts are increasingly learning how best to hide assets from divorcing spouses, debt collectors — and the taxman.

Coinbase, which is widely regarded as the first entry point for crypto newbies, surrendered details of [13,000 customers](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the IRS last year for the pursuit of unpaid taxes. But even if bitcoin is bought on the exchange, it can be “tumbled” through third-party services to sever the link between buyer and seller, and then cashed out in jurisdictions with lax anti-money laundering rules, or used to buy privacy coins that are harder to trace.

Coins with optional privacy can be tracked, says Dave Jevans, the CEO of the blockchain detective firm CipherTrace, but those where “privacy features are on by default” are “much more difficult.” For anyone that can crack the code and trace these coins, the bounty is expected to be high. Desperate to find a cure, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has already published a [pre-solicitation document](&lt;|url|&gt;) calling for technology that can follow the trails left by privacy coins like Monero and Zcash.

But even as the authorities whack down the mallet, the mole is sure to pop up in another hole. And the next generation of privacy coins — built on a protocol named “Mimblewimble*” *after* *the “tongue-tying curse” in the *Harry Potter *books — are already promising faster transactions, even higher levels of privacy, and immunity from the scaling problems that have slowed down bitcoin’s progress.

The fight over privacy then, might have only just begun. According to some — like controversial security engineer turned crypto advocate John McAfee — the outcome is already assured. After claiming in January that he hasn’t filed taxes for [eight years](&lt;|url|&gt;), the fugitive [tweeted](&lt;|url|&gt;) from his yacht hideout that “my Crypto goals drive the IRS mad. Privacy coins will obsolete income taxes.”<|endoftext|>

# The End of App Stores Is Rapidly Approaching

## The End of App Stores Is Rapidly Approaching

### *Progressive web apps may soon free you from Google Play and the iOS App Store*

It’s time to blow up the walled garden that keeps you locked into the products Apple and Google allow into their app stores. A new generation of Progressive Web Applications (PWAs), now taking root on desktop computers, may soon make the jump to your smartphone, changing how you download apps — and where they come from — forever.

An update in recent preview versions of Google Chrome, [which enjoys 63% of the browser market share worldwide](&lt;|url|&gt;), hints at the potential here. Users can now install apps from sites simply by clicking a button that materializes in the URL bar, giving near-instant access to powerful, web-based versions of services like Spotify — no more app stores or finicky download pages.

These install buttons are a magic peek at the future of app development. If you navigate to a PWA, [such as Spotify’s web player](&lt;|url|&gt;), you’ll see a desktop-style experience and a new option to install the app, so long as you’re using a browser that supports the feature.

Once you’ve installed it, the app will open in its own independent window outside of the browser, create desktop shortcuts, and offer a full feature set — like the ability to use your computer’s media keys to skip tracks or pause music — as if it were a “real,” native app.

Upcoming improvements will allow these apps to do even more. [Hidden options in Chrome](&lt;|url|&gt;) allow PWAs to launch themselves whenever relevant links are accessed — [Twitter’s PWA](&lt;|url|&gt;) becomes almost as good as a desktop app with this option enabled, auto-redirecting tweet URLs to the right place.

PWAs might look like normal websites on the surface, but they’re backed by a new breed of technology that allows them to act much more like traditional apps, with off-line support, push notifications, keyboard shortcuts, and even the ability to be installed on your desktop or home screen.

![](<|image|>)

These developments matter to the companies building the apps you use every day. Many of them are using web technologies behind the scenes to save time and money, and reduce development complexity — dramatically lowering the amount of time it takes to ship features to every operating system.

Popular apps like Slack, Spotify, Twitter, Visual Studio Code, and WhatsApp already use web technology to build their desktop versions, because it allows them to use a single set of code to run everywhere. [A tool called Electron](&lt;|url|&gt;) allows apps to be written using web-based programming languages while integrating them as if they’re a part of your operating system, supporting push notifications and off-line access.

Building an app for any operating system is an expensive, time-consuming challenge, which makes web development the obvious choice to both reduce costs and reach as many people as possible. PWAs remove the need for Electron, allowing apps to natively integrate into your operating system, with Chrome as a common base.
> # Most people are living under an app store duopoly.

Things are a bit different for PWAs on mobile. Centralized app stores operated by Google and Apple are generally the only way to download apps to your phone. Yes, Google technically allows the “sideloading” of apps on Android, so you can download and run programs from third-party vendors, but the function is disabled by default and more annoying to use with each Android update. Most people are living under an app store duopoly.

![](<|image|>)

PWAs could technically work on mobile devices, and they’d likely take up fewer resources than traditional apps. Despite the benefits, only one of the two main players seems particularly interested in opening its doors to them. Google has invested in integrating Android and PWAs for years, allowing users to install them, receive push notifications, and even use them when off-line. I added a PWA to my own app, [Write Together](&lt;|url|&gt;): It took just a few hours to implement at a basic level, and it now allows Android users to install the app locally, increasing retention and adding features like off-line support.

But Apple has dragged its heels on properly implementing many of the web standards that would allow PWAs to function correctly on mobile devices. The company remains silent about its plans, but it’s easy to assume it’s because these features would compete with one of its main revenue sources and likely encourage people to download fewer actual apps.

That said, both Google and Apple have incentives to encourage “native” code for their respective platforms: Locking app developers into Google Play or the iOS App Store allows these companies to reap a cut of app sales and retain control over what’s allowed on their platforms. An app like Metadata+, which was designed to track U.S. drone strikes around the world and [repeatedly blocked by Apple](&lt;|url|&gt;), could theoretically live as a PWA on iOS. Yes, this would also mean “deplatformed” services like [Infowars](&lt;|url|&gt;) could live on in app form, but they’d at least miss out on the huge distribution potential an official app store guarantees.
> # Web technology already ate desktop apps alive, and the instant install button in Chrome and Edge will finish the job.

In any event, the PWA movement is already gaining real momentum with major players. [Look under the hood](&lt;|url|&gt;) and you’ll see that Facebook’s redesign, which launched at its F8 conference, is a PWA. And it demonstrates just how powerful the technology can be for improving the user experience.

The refreshed Facebook, which is rolling out to users now, feels more like an app than a website, setting the stage for a desktop version that’s unleashed from the browser for the first time. [Twitter’s new website is a PWA as well](&lt;|url|&gt;). It grew out of an overhaul of the mobile website and eventually became the default.

The data backs up why PWAs are becoming more popular with app developers: Tinder [said that](&lt;|url|&gt;) its PWA helped reduce loading times from 11 seconds to four, and shrank its service by 90% compared to the native Android app. [AliExpress increased](&lt;|url|&gt;) conversions by 104% with its PWA and saw a 74% increase in time spent on the service.

Microsoft already announced in late 2018 that it would allow developers to list PWA-based apps directly in its Windows Store, which would make them available for installation on millions of computers around the world. Now, it’s [planning to index any it finds on the open web](&lt;|url|&gt;) and automatically add them to the store as well — and [Google is widely expected to do the same](&lt;|url|&gt;) with the Play Store by the end of 2019.

Safari on iOS remains a problem for PWAs in the short term — but [the narrative is already shifting](&lt;|url|&gt;) as Apple has started to quietly implement some parts of the standard, even as it disables key features, [like support for using the iPhone’s camera in a PWA or offering push notifications](&lt;|url|&gt;).

If Apple continues to block Progressive Web Apps, their ability to gain wider traction will be in doubt. But doing so carries risks for Apple: [Similar practices in the past have attracted antitrust investigations and massive fines](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Web technology already ate desktop apps alive, and the instant install button in Chrome and Edge will finish the job. Millions of people around the world are already spending the majority of their days in browsers, so it makes sense that the web should become the platform for apps. It’s a welcome shift away from closed ecosystems, back toward an open web, where anyone can build an app, publish it, and let millions install it in seconds.<|endoftext|>

# Facebook’s Poker Bot Shows How A.I. Can Adapt to Liars

## In a new study with significant real-world implications, a poker bot crushed human pros at six-player, no-limit Texas Hold ’em

![Illustration: [Jess Ebsworth](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Jess Ebsworth](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Sometimes, poker is all about the bluff. Make the table believe you have a full house when you really have a low pair, and it can pay off big time. Read your opponents — a grimace here, a smirk there — and bet accordingly.

It’s not a skill you’d think computers would be particularly good at. But new [research published in *Science](&lt;|url|&gt;)* today shows that A.I. can learn to respond to fibs without needing to even see anyone else at the table, and outwit the best human poker players. It’s a development that may have implications far beyond the casino.

A poker-playing bot called Pluribus recently crushed a dozen top poker professionals at six-player, no-limit Texas Hold ’em over a 12-day marathon of 10,000 poker hands. Pluribus was created by Noam Brown, an A.I. researcher who now works at Facebook, and Tuomas Sandholm, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. (The two co-authored the paper in *Science*.)

If each chip in the experiment were worth a dollar, Pluribus would have made $1,000 an hour against the pros, according to Facebook, which published its own [blog post](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the research. (That haul greatly exceeds what experienced pros could expect, even playing at a table that included some amateurs.) Brown conducted most of his poker research while earning his master’s and PhD at Carnegie Mellon from 2012 to 2019, but he’s worked at Facebook for the last nine months and [joined the company full-time in June](&lt;|url|&gt;) — part of a wave of A.I. academics being [hoovered up](&lt;|url|&gt;) by tech companies.
> # “I think this is really going to be essential for developing A.I.s that are deployed in the real world.”

Cleaning up at the poker table isn’t the ultimate goal of Brown and Sandholm’s research, though. The game is really a simulator for how an algorithm could master a situation with multiple deceptive adversaries that hide information and are each trying to pressure the other to quit. A.I. can already calculate probability far better and far faster than any human being. But poker is as much about coping with how humans lie as it is about reading the cards, which is exactly why it’s a useful game for A.I. to learn.

“I think this is really going to be essential for developing A.I.s that are deployed in the real world,” Brown told *OneZero*, ”because most real-world, strategic interactions involve multiple agents, or involve hidden information.”

This isn’t Brown’s first time bringing an A.I. to the poker table. While working toward his PhD at Carnegie Mellon in 2017 under Sandholm’s tutelage, he debuted Libratus, an earlier poker-playing bot, which handily defeated human professionals in no-limit Texas Hold ’em games played one-on-one.

The new bot, Pluribus, doesn’t adapt to other players at the table — it won’t try to understand how John and Jane play the game differently. It doesn’t have a tell — a sign that they might be bluffing or in fact actually have a good hand — and it only bluffs when it’s calculated that it’s a sound strategy, statistically speaking.

“People have this notion that bluffing is this very human thing where you’re looking at the other person and the other person’s eyes, and trying to read their soul, and trying to tell if they’re going to fold or if they’re bluffing right now,” Brown told *OneZero*. “That’s not really what it’s about. It’s really a mathematical thing. Bluffing is all about balancing betting with good hands with betting with bad hands, so that you’re unpredictable to your opponents.”

While most games that A.I. has mastered so far — like Go and chess — can be endlessly complex, what they have in common is that all the information about the state of the game and the players is visible for everyone. Poker differs because you don’t know what your opponents have in their hands. It’s as if your opponent’s king and queen could be placed anywhere on the chessboard and be made invisible. Since you don’t know what your opponents know, you can’t easily predict how they’re going to act, or why they’re making certain decisions.

A.I. typically thrives when it not only has all the information necessary, but has seen a certain situation before. Google’s self-driving cars can operate because Google has thoroughly mapped the locations they’re driving in. Image recognition software like Facebook’s photo-tagging A.I. learns how to tell dogs and cats apart by looking at millions of images of each animal.

But poker is a game of edge cases and hidden information — rare situations that are statistically improbable, all lined up in a row. Any of the five other players at the table could have nearly any combination of cards at the beginning of the hand, and each player can bet nearly any amount of money. There are so many combinations of potential bets that Brown and Sandholm had to make tweaks to reduce the complexity of the game the bot can perceive. For example, they “bucketed” similar bets, like $200 and $201, to make the bot more efficient.

The way the Pluribus was trained, however, was much like many other game-playing A.I. It played against itself millions of times, making moves completely randomly at first, until it slowly figured out which moves would result in positive outcomes. It does this by tracking what the researchers term “regret,” meaning it traces other potential outcomes in a hand and comes up with a score of how much it “regrets” not taking another specific action. These regret scores are additive, so the more the algorithm doesn’t take the right action, the more it regrets it. These regret scores are then used to take the action it “regretted” not taking more often in future games.

Facebook gives an example of a training hand where the bot has two jacks. The opponent checks, so it checks. Then the opponent bets. The bot calls, or matches, and it turns out the opponent has two kings. The bot loses. After the hand, the bot simulates what would have happened in variations of the same hand.

Replaying the hand, if the bot had raised the bet instead of matching it, the opponent would have folded. The bot would have won. It “regrets” not taking this action, raising the regret score, which means in a similar situation it will raise more in the future.


When the bot is actually playing the game, it uses a series of other mechanics to balance its style of play. That includes considering how it would act if it had every other potential variation of a hand.

This is all useful for A.I. well beyond the poker table, because people in the real world can and do lie, just like they do at cards. They can behave irrationally. They can make mistakes. Imagine a near future with self-driving cars on the road. Google’s car might approach an intersection, where it stops to let a human driver through. That human driver could start, then accidentally spill coffee on their lap and come to a sudden stop to frantically wipe it up. Distracted, they start driving again before realizing — whoops — they’re in an intersection, so they suddenly brake again. That’s a lot of mixed signals for the A.I. behind the self-driving car: It’s like a bluff.

In this instant, Google’s car now has to operate in a situation where it can’t trust another driver on the road. It doesn’t know what’s happening in the person’s car — why it stopped, when it will go again, whether it will stop and go again in the future — but it has to take some action. The same problems could arise when the self-driving car is going around blind turns, or in heavy rain — both situations that would degrade the information from which it can draw.
> # An algorithm that doesn’t accept everything it sees as truth might be helpful.

A similar example could be drawn with Facebook’s own News Feed, where the company’s myriad bots trawl user content to tag, categorize, translate, and prioritize it. You can imagine how it might be useful for a content moderation bot to make better decisions with limited information if a user is trying to bypass anti-spam filters or upload banned images, for example. A moderation bot might also have to contend with other bots on the platform that are trying to post problematic content.

“If you’re deploying an A.I. system in the real world, it’s interacting with other A.I.s or humans,” Brown said. “There might be situations where [another] A.I. might be trying to behave in a deceptive way or dishonest way. And the A.I. has to be able to cope with that if it’s going to be effective.”

When the ability to distinguish between truth and lies is a fundamental enough issue to [bring tech executives to Capitol Hill](&lt;|url|&gt;), an algorithm that doesn’t accept everything it sees as truth might be helpful.

Of course, this isn’t a solution to fake news or a promise of a new day at Facebook. But it might be a tool the company could use in the complex, never-ending war to understand and manage the unprecedented amount of information its users generate.

With this tool tested to the limits in poker, Brown will now move on to other problems that can be solved by game theory inspired algorithms. “I think this is really the final major challenge in poker A.I.,” he said. “We don’t plan to work on poker going forward. I think we’re really focused on generalizing beyond.”<|endoftext|>

# How 1989’s ‘Batman’ Defined the Superhero Movie Experience

## How 1989’s ‘Batman’ Defined the Superhero Movie Experience

### *On its 30th anniversary, much less has changed than you’d think*

![Credit: Sunset Boulevard/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Sunset Boulevard/Getty Images*

Last week, actor Robert Pattinson became the latest square-jawed actor to [win the role of Batman](&lt;|url|&gt;). Predictably, a bevy of nerds freaked out. Much the same happened just over 30 years ago when it was announced that Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in Tim Burton’s film. The more things change, huh?

Actually, it turns out more things have stayed the same since *Batman* premiered in 1989. It broke ground for superhero movies in a lot of ways, much of which today’s Marvel and DC blockbusters still tread. But what’s most surprising is how little people’s feelings and expectations about these movies has changed over the past three decades.

The internet’s loud teeth-gnashing over Pattison’s casting — apparently just because he starred in the *Twilight* franchise, even though he also [isn’t particularly fond of them](&lt;|url|&gt;) — is no different than when people complained about the announcement Ben Affleck would don Batman’s cowl in 2013, or both George Clooney and Val Kilmer in the ’90s. (Much of Marvel’s casting has had the exact same problem; it’s hard to fathom now, but [there were even complaints](&lt;|url|&gt;) when Robert Downey Jr. was cast as Iron Man back in 2006, too.) The only difference is that without the internet, the formal complaints were mostly confined to genre movie magazines like *Starlog* and *Fangoria*.
> # We wanted the Dark Knight, not Mr. Mom in spandex.

I know because I was there — and complaining with them. I was extremely irritated that director Tim Burton was going to create another Batman as campy as Adam West’s version in the 1960s TV series. I mean, why else would he cast Michael Keaton for the role? Keaton was a comedic actor who’d just starred in Burton’s *Beetlejuice* as the darkly wacky title character. I, like most of the nerds, had been hoping to finally see a live-action movie that took the superhero seriously, like his comics of the ‘80s — especially Alan Moore’s *The Killing Joke* and Frank Miller’s *The Dark Knight Returns*. We wanted *The Dark Knight*, not *Mr. Mom* in spandex.

Nerds were so upset about it that in 1988, they sent 50,000 angry letters — the Change.org petition of its time — to Warner Bros. protesting Keaton’s casting. As a result, producer Jon Abrams was concerned enough that he hurried to put a trailer into theaters for the Christmas movie season. [If you watch it](&lt;|url|&gt;), it is very clearly a rush job; it’s literally just a highlight reel of quick snippets of the film, with no voiceover, no music, and nothing unifying about it — something no studio should have dreamed of releasing. But it worked because it showed nerds what Burton was doing, and how we hadn’t needed to worry at all.

These are two major issues that affect superhero movies to this day: The kneejerk, negative reaction of fans to the film (or some aspect of it) and the studio’s desperate desire to satiate them. While the former was perhaps inevitable, the latter established a troubling precedent. It legitimized fans’ anger in a way modern superhero movies are still paying for. Nowadays, that often results in superhero movies that are more concerned with pleasing nerds than telling a compelling story, as if merely seeing a fan-favorite character or classic comic storyline in live-action is enough. (Looking at you, *Thor: The Dark World, Venom*, the second *Spider-Man* and *Fantastic Four* reboots, etc.) At least back then, the response to the Bat-lash was more about quelling fans’ fears than toadying up to them.

And boy, not only did that weird compilation of random footage quell fans’ fears, but it got everyone excited to see the movie, nerd and non-nerd alike. I remember the movie’s hype taking up a shocking amount of my attention for months before its release, but it wasn’t just me. There were [dozens of news stories](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the gargantuan hype for the film (usually accompanied by somewhat perplexed explanations about how this wasn’t going to be the campy Batman of the ‘60s). The promotion of the movie was legendary: In the months before and after the film’s June release, it’s estimated that over [$500 million of Batman merchandise was sold](&lt;|url|&gt;). The film ended up [as the highest-grossing movie of 1989](&lt;|url|&gt;), beating out* Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Back to the Future II, Ghostbusters 2, Lethal Weapon 2*, and more. Some people were so excited they got the bat-symbol shaved onto their heads.

I haven’t heard of anyone choosing that particular form of adulation for *Avengers: Endgame*, but it’s very hard not to see the parallels. The two films not only dominated the box office but seemingly the entirety of pop culture. The year-long, exponentially growing excitement for *Endgame* is much the same as what was dubbed “Batmania” in 1989 in terms of magnitude. But the thread tying these two together is that people, not just nerds, have simply wanted to see good, earnest movies about superheroes. What *Batman* and *Avengers: Endgame* have in common, along with the most successful superhero movies of the last three decades, is that they have taken themselves seriously.

*Batman *rejected the paternalistic camp of the ’60s TV Batman and showed him as a grim man whose past trauma drove him to become a vigilante. The totally-inappropriate-when-you-stop-to-think-about-it idea of him having an underage partner called Robin was dropped. Burton even replaced Batman’s traditional tights with something more akin to armor, which is absolutely what a man who wants to punch armed criminals while dressed as an animal should be wearing. The fact that Batman is a more “serious” comic book character than most certainly facilitated this; for all their bat-shaped planes and poison gas-filled blimps, Batman and the Joker are human instead of “super.”

This isn’t to say the movie is realistic, of course, but these changes made the world of Batman feel at least somewhat plausible in a much more compelling way than the few superhero movies that preceded it.

But perhaps most importantly, *Batman* managed to remain authentic to the source material while still being a decent film. This is by no means easy to do, as so many terrible superhero movies have proven over the years. The amazing set design, Danny Elfman’s phenomenal score, the perfectly cast Jack Nicholson as the gleefully murderous Joker: all these things helped augment the film’s core.

Part of how Batman took itself seriously was by remaining authentic to the source material. As mentioned above, many studios default to giving nerds what they want, or think they want, and make the story a distant second priority. (It’s how we’ve gotten films like *X-Men: Apocalypse*, which starred one of the X-Men’s most iconic villains and put several beloved mutants on the screen for the first time, and yet was crushingly dull.) When studios wildly deviate from the source material, the movie usually suffers. There’s a good reason these heroes have been beloved for so many decades.

Looking back, it took a shockingly long time for Hollywood to learn the lessons *Batman* taught. After the Bat-movies infamously slid back into the camp, it took until 2000’s *X-Men* for a studio to really take comic books seriously again. (There was nothing superhero-y about the 1998 *Blade* movie, which really was the first time most people had ever heard of the character.) Now we’ve enjoyed nearly 20 years of (mostly) good superhero movies, of which *Avengers: Endgame* is only the latest; given how much money they make, chances are there’ll be decades more. All these movies will need to do to succeed is keep following the Bat-signal.<|endoftext|>

# When Ignoring a Text Is the Polite Thing to Do

## Social norms need to keep up with how we communicate today

![Credit: Klaus Vedfelt/DigitalVision/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Klaus Vedfelt/DigitalVision/Getty*

It used to be a commonly held belief that every request deserved a response. Not replying to someone who had sent you an invitation, made a request, or asked a question would be seen as a breach of the social contract. Indeed, it’s the entire basis of the RSVP, which literally comes from the French phrase “répondez s’il vous plaît,” or “please respond.”

This may have worked well back in the days of the home phone and snail mail, but how many requests would the average person need to respond to in 1990 anyway? These days, however, it’s a barrage.

Requests for our time come from friends, family, acquaintances, and complete strangers. They come via messaging apps, on social media, email, or any number of online services. And that’s before you add the multitude of automated reminders of previous requests that sneak back to find you just as you’d stopped feeling guilty about ignoring the first notification (looking at you, Facebook Events).
> # Let’s be honest — you really didn’t care about what the excuse was, anyway.

We don’t communicate the same way we used to, so why should the old rules of etiquette apply? In the era of social media and texting, here’s a thought: Not replying to a request should be an implied “polite no.”

This pragmatic change to how we communicate effectively in 2019 helps both the asker and the askee in setting better expectations. If no response is assumed to be a “no,” both parties win.

Inviting someone to an event? No response simply implies they can’t go or don’t want to go. No one wants to see their house party event page filled with replies about why each person cannot come due to a multitude of conflicts, real and invented. Let’s be honest — you really didn’t care about what the excuse was anyway.

Asking someone if they can help with school- or work-related questions and get no response? That’s fine: they can’t (for any number of reasons), or simply don’t see your request as a priority. Sorry! It doesn’t feel any better to get “I don’t feel like answering these questions” in an email reply, than it does to get no response.

For some people — especially women, and especially on dating apps like Tinder — responding to requests with a sincere “sorry, but no” only invites abuse or criticism. In some cases — Twitter springs to mind — the simple act of replying is seen as an invitation to continue the conversation, no matter the content of the message. Yet for those who choose not to respond at all, the rejoinder from the original messenger is all too often “How dare you not reply!” There’s no winning.
> # It’s only rude if we all agree it is rude.

But there could be if we agree on a new set of norms. Yes, changing what is and is not considered polite or courteous will inevitably get some pushback. When I first mentioned this idea a couple of weeks ago, people jumped into my Twitter mentions to tell me that “Not replying is rude! Everyone knows this!” — which misses the point entirely. It’s only rude if we all agree it is rude. So, let’s not.

It’s not that you can’t ask people things, of course. Just don’t get upset if you don’t hear back.<|endoftext|>

# How Video Games Help Us Navigate Real-World Problems

## The sci-fi writers Tom Chatfield and Julian Gough discuss how games are becoming an important route to understanding a uniquely challenging moment in history

![Credit: Tom Eversley / EyeEm/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Tom Eversley / EyeEm/Getty Images*

I’m often struck, when talking to transhumanists and thinkers focused on the far technological future, by how often video games come up — specifically through the idea of adjusting the difficulty level of reality. If you can just accrue enough computational power and data and insight, they argue, you’ll reach a point at which you can fix things. Reality becomes a game. And the plot of [Julian Gough](&lt;|url|&gt;)’s latest novel, [*Connect](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, ends up doing something like that — alongside plenty of other unexpected things.

As well as [both writing techno-thrillers](&lt;|url|&gt;), Julian and I have each written for and about video games and are deeply interested in science fiction and geekery as mirrors of the real world’s excesses. When it comes to technology, however, Julian is among the most dazzlingly optimistic thinkers I know, while I seem to spend more and more time being drawn toward its dark side.

*The following conversation has been condensed for length and clarity.*

**Tom Chatfield: **Where is it we want to take our readers when we dive into genre fiction and games?

**Julian Gough: **I love science fiction as a way of generating metaphors that you can really see in your head; really strong, humanized, visualizable metaphors for big but hard-to-visualize social processes and technological processes. I want my hero’s journey to satisfy you as a story about a person, but it’s also a story about humanity and its relationship to technology and where the fuck that’s going. And I do want to nudge that conversation. *Connect* is an optimistic book.

**Chatfield: **Whereas I find myself increasingly obsessing over the dangerous kind of psychological reverse-engineering that games and technology promise. We build worlds expressly designed to tick our evolutionary boxes, to fascinate us, to feed and profit off whatever gets the human animal excited fast. And this business model currently eats everything else.

So an idealistic startup about slow discussions would be eaten for breakfast by one that taps people on the shoulder with gossip. Everything is in competition with everything else — and this is one of the defining dystopian worries about where we may be heading. That, if everything is a game, those who come up with the most ruthless strategies win: You bully people, seduce them, distract them, control them. This is some of the stuff I’m writing about in my novel, [*The Gomorrah Gambit](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, while trying not to be utterly depressing.

**Gough: **I like what you say about virtual reality, that it’s a trap rather than a liberation.

**Chatfield: **I’ve always been very suspicious of VR. It just feels astonishingly coercive, like the opposite of freedom. In fact, I don’t tend to like extreme verisimilitude with tech and games. Take *Red Dead Redemption 2*. It’s a highly reviewed game. But when you get down to playing it, it’s an absolute pain in the ass: all the “realistic” things you have to do, again and again, that are really confusing and fiddly and break your flow. It’s like a long, detailed, numbingly unpleasant lesson in the limitations of control systems for video games.
> # There is this sense that building better fictional and virtual worlds is an opening up rather than a closing down of possibilities.

It reminds me a bit of reading *Ulysses* because, among other things, Joyce is testing to destruction the idea that realism is the same thing as detail. Which of course it isn’t.

**Gough: **That hyperrealistic thing is sort of a dead end, cripplingly unimaginative.

**Chatfield: **You wrote [the ending to the game *Minecraft](&lt;|url|&gt;)* in the form of a philosophical dialogue between two alien beings who have been observing the player. Was *Connect* influenced by your *Minecraft *experiences? Because that’s a game that is avowedly non-realistic, yet hugely immersive and transporting because of the agency it grants.

**Gough: **I love how a game like *Minecraft* turns players into artists, because it gives us the minimal amount necessary to build a world in our heads. We provide most of it. Whereas *Red Dead Redemption 2*, we’re providing absolutely nothing. It’s asking nothing of us as creative minds. It wastes our potential.

**Chatfield: **It sort of screams at you, “Admire our artistry!” *Minecraft* is more like a novel. And we all know that novels have the best pictures.

**Gough: **My aesthetic in computer games is: How much can you take away, and still have the player create a deeply satisfactory sensory experience in their head?

**Chatfield:** So, let’s talk about tech optimism. In *Connect, *your protagonist is an autistic teenager, Colt — someone who isn’t neurotypical, who doesn’t fit in. But he not only finds a place in the world via technology — in particular, the augmented reality game that he accesses through his headset — but actually uses technology to gain an enhanced grasp of reality. He creates, for example, a visualization of the sun in this virtual world that makes a huge amount of astronomical data comprehensible. I love that.

**Gough:** Non-neurotypical people throw an interesting light on neurotypical people. Being able to move in and out of Colt’s head in the book is a way of being able to move in and out of being narrowly, normatively human… because you can’t see the universe clearly from inside a single human head.

**Chatfield:** And, with the aid of a video game, Colt is trying to create inputs into a human head that are much more faithful to reality, to some of the deeper levels of complexity out there.

**Gough: **That’s exactly what he is doing. He doesn’t want to play in his game-world; he wants to live in it. He has hijacked gaming as a tool so that he can see the world more clearly. In a way, that’s what I have done as a writer. I’ve hijacked the techno-thriller as a tool of philosophy. Which I think is a nightmare for my publishers.

**Chatfield: **You chose to set *Connect* in the Nevada desert and Las Vegas in an intensely realized, sun-bleached, hyper-capitalist landscape. It’s a liminal, extreme place where whatever it is that civilization does, it’s more obvious and more brittle. I’m guessing that, just as you used someone non-neurotypical to shed light on other people, you might have gone to the desert and Las Vegas to shed some light on this crazy capitalist experiment we’re living in?

**Gough: **Nevada as a setting is not really an accident, yes. The desert throws humanity into very high relief. If you put a family there, they are human beings trying to live without nature… and if we have a future in the universe, it might look a little like Nevada. You have to bring your ecosystem with you — there isn’t really a functional one there that suits human beings. Also, there is a long tradition of visionaries seeing things more clearly after spending a little bit of time in the desert.

**Chatfield: **Though when the visionary goes to the desert they tend to eat locusts — but when you go to Vegas you tend to eat lobster.

**Gough: **Yes, we’ve really improved enormously as a civilization over the last few thousand years.

**Chatfield: **One of the things I like about the augmented reality game Colt spends so much time inside is that it’s not treated as an addiction or a curse — it helps to open the doors of perception. There is this sense that building better fictional and virtual worlds is an opening up rather than a closing down of possibilities — the diametric opposite of the technology of the casino, which puts someone else’s profitability between you and any larger grip on reality.
> # Yes, technology is transforming humanity, and our planet, but we have agency. We can grab the controls and guide this.

**Gough: **We are basically apes looking at the stars, and holy crap that’s a really weird thing to be. We are apes looking through the Hubble Space Telescope. How the fuck did that happen? It’s kind of beautiful and terrifying. We’re these murderous philosophers. And you can’t take out the good stuff and isolate it from the bad stuff, because that’s not how things work. Us and our kids are going to have to navigate a transition. Where we are now is a profoundly unstable moment.

**Chatfield: **You have a new child, a few weeks old. How do you feel about what he’s going to see?

**Gough: **I think my son is incredibly lucky to be born at this time. There has never been a more exciting moment, there has never been a moment in the history of the universe where an animal could be born into such a situation… where their possibilities are so infinite.

**Chatfield: **I’d love to believe that. Yet there’s a lot of apocalyptic thinking today about the sustainability of human civilization as we know it, rates of biological loss and degradation.

**Gough: **I totally understand. But I think it’s an understandable misunderstanding, an understandable misinterpretation of what’s happening. Yes, technology is transforming humanity, and our planet, but we have agency. We can grab the controls and guide this. Believe in yourself! We should believe in ourselves. We do have to navigate the next few decades, which is going to be complicated. But we’re also going to have these tremendous conversations about the future of our planet, and we can make it work for ourselves and for the rest of the biosphere. With *Connect*, the same as the ending to *Minecraft*, I ultimately want to leave the player or the reader in a position that is more useful to them — and it is more useful to see the potential in where we are now, for good or ill.<|endoftext|>

# Women-Only Esport Competitions Are on the Rise — But Where’s the Money?

## ‘If you want to get more women in the door, offer them $100,000 instead of $50,000’

![Illustration: [Lauryn Siegel](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Lauryn Siegel](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Earlier this year, Emmalee “EMUHLEET” Garrido and her Dignitas Female teammates took first place playing *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* at the Intel Challenge Katowice, one of the most prestigious women’s esports tournaments in the world. They earned a $25,000 sum, divided between the team’s four players and one coach.

Though $25,000 is a sizable prize, it’s not enough for the team to live on. So Garrido holds down a job as a nurse in California during the day, leaving her house at 4 a.m. every day for her two-hour commute. After work, she dedicates at least five hours to practicing *Counter-Strike*. “My passion really drives me,” says Garrido. “Even if I only get four to five hours of sleep, I can go all night long practicing with my team.”

Prize pools in esports have never been higher. Last year, The International, an annual *Dota 2* tournament, [awarded more than $25 million in winnings](&lt;|url|&gt;). But though more and more esports athletes are able to make a living off of gaming, very few of them are women. The problem is driven by participation; in Overwatch League, for instance, [there is only one female player out of a competitive field of 194](&lt;|url|&gt;); of the top 500 earners in esports, [only one identifies as non-male](&lt;|url|&gt;); and in 2016, the BBC [estimated that women account for less than 5%](&lt;|url|&gt;) of players in competitive gaming.

To spur women’s participation, organizations have launched women’s-only events, and clubs like [Singularity](&lt;|url|&gt;), [Counter Logic](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [Gen.G](&lt;|url|&gt;) have aggressively added all-female teams to their rosters. But the purses for these events don’t match coed prizes.
> # Of the top 500 earners in esports, only one identifies as non-male.

Conditions are slowly changing: This summer, Garrido will be playing for a $100,000 prize pool at DreamHack Valencia. The prize is twice the size of the next highest purse on the female circuit, and equal to the money offered to the coed teams [at the recent DreamHack Open in Rio de Janeiro](&lt;|url|&gt;). When she heard about the prize pool, Garrido was shocked. “My jaw dropped to the ground,” Garrido told *OneZero*. “Hopefully a lot of people will come out and support it.”

Dagny Veinberg, a producer at DreamHack, says she wants to finally give women a chance to turn *Counter-Strike*, and esports, into a career. “There’s a lot of talk in esports. ‘We should do this; we should do that.’ But there’s no action,” she says. “There’s only so many panels you can attend where we can discuss this issue.”

Though the esports competitive circuit is plagued by [bureaucratic horror shows](&lt;|url|&gt;), [bounced checks](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [financial mismanagement](&lt;|url|&gt;), it’s also proven to be a stable source of income for a lucky few. Professional players in Blizzard’s Overwatch League are guaranteed a minimum salary of $50,000 a year. Players in League of Legends’ professional LCS circuit are guaranteed at least $75,000 a year, with some reports indicating [the average take-home pay is higher than $300,000](&lt;|url|&gt;). With [new investors like Drake and Michael Jordan buying in](&lt;|url|&gt;), some analysts believe esports could top [$1 billion in total valuation as soon as 2020](&lt;|url|&gt;).

As esports has evolved, it’s also given birth to women’s-only professional circuits, which are widely recognized as stop-gap efforts to bring more women into the sport.

Dignitas Female has been one of the most successful women’s teams on the planet. Still, their winnings are meager: They won $4,690 after a first-place finish at 2018’s GIRLGAMER Esports Festival, $1,505 after finishing in third at 2019’s Copenhagen Games, and $25,000 in first-place prizes at Intel Challenge Katowice in 2019 and 2018. In total, it’s estimated the team has earned [$65,524 since its founding in 2017](&lt;|url|&gt;) — a fraction of the sum they would have won for similar victories at coed tournaments.

“There aren’t enough tournaments to solely support a woman not having to work or be salaried,” says Klaudia Beczkiewicz, a free agent *Counter-Strike* player who most recently played for the all-female team Assassins. Beczkiewicz supports herself by working a stringent nine-hours-a-day shift at Microsoft, and says she stays fresh by practicing on the weekends.

Beczkiewicz is familiar with the commonly cited justifications for why coed esports tournaments pay out more than women-only tournaments. Detractors, some of whom include women, argue that women’s teams don’t match the skill level of men’s teams, and because there are no rules preventing women from competing in coed tournaments, a comparable prize pool for a division that might exclude the best players in the world is unfair.

“I come from an online poker background,” says Lillie Klefelt, who founded [Female Legends](&lt;|url|&gt;), a nonprofit dedicated to increasing the gender diversity in esports. “Usually, when guys compete it’s for millions and when girls compete it’s for nothing. It’s cool to have real money. But at the same time, the money has to be relative to the skill. You can’t dump in a huge amount of money without a level of play; that sends the wrong signal. It has to be encouraging, but it can’t be ridiculous — then it looks like a PR thing.”

Still, Klefelt says that incremental steps towards inclusivity are important, and necessary to bring in a broader spectrum of players. Earlier this year, Female Legends partnered with the gaming tournament organizer Challengermode to launch the Women’s Esports League, which is exclusively open to female and non-binary players and has a prize pool of 2,500 euros, or $2,822. Klefelt would like to see that figure go up, and she hopes for a future in which her staff can drum up sponsors and funding more easily.
> # “Just imagine you go to Sephora, and you see a girl that’s playing a video game in an advertisement.”

Veinberg has little patience for those who argue that funding women’s-only tournaments undermines the industry, or saps resources from coed tournaments. “They have how many millions to win in other tournaments?” she says. “The more it’s discussed, the more people realize that this isn’t [that big of a deal.]”

Garrido would like to see sponsors throwing their weight behind women’s esports tournaments. Sephora, in particular, comes to mind. “Just imagine you go to Sephora, and you see a girl that’s playing a video game in an advertisement,” she says. “If a girl walks in and sees that, that’s something they could relate to.”

Veinberg believes that inclusivity begins with money, and she points to traditional sport competitions as a model for bringing in women athletes. It took a campaign spearheaded by Venus Williams to finally equalize [Wimbledon’s men’s and women’s champion purses](&lt;|url|&gt;), and the U.S. women’s national soccer team recently sued the U.S. Soccer Federation for wage disparities between their team and the (much less successful) men’s team. DreamHack’s *Counter-Strike* effort has drawn comparisons with [Formula One’s W Series](&lt;|url|&gt;), which is only open to women drivers. The W Series has a total prize pool of $1.5 million, and aims to bring in women drivers in order to eventually compete in integrated races.

“If you give them the opportunity, they will be able to make a living out of it. It’s one thing to say, ‘Hey we’ll give them time to play, but they also have to have a full-time job,’” says Veinberg. “This is basically giving them the same opportunity… If you were 19 years old and you were considering your career moves, you wouldn’t go into esports. Maybe, with more tournaments like this, you can. That’s what we’re investing in.”<|endoftext|>

# How to Save the DC Superhero Movie Universe

## How to Save the DC Superhero Movie Universe

### Warner Bros. is doing almost everything wrong, but the answer is right in front of them

![Image: © Warner Bros.](<|image|>)*Image: © Warner Bros.*

You don’t need to be a nerd to see how badly Warner Bros. has squandered its DC Comics superheroes in this golden age of superhero movies. *Man of Steel*, *Batman v. Superman*, and especially *Justice League* all failed to please fans, critics, and mass audiences or meet Warner Bros.’ financial projections. Last week, Warner Bros. [unceremoniously dumped](&lt;|url|&gt;) Superman and Henry Cavill to recalibrate the DC movie universe around Supergirl, while Ben Affleck, a [superhero so depressed](&lt;|url|&gt;) that he generated [his own meme](&lt;|url|&gt;), finally escaped the solo Batman film back in June when the [studio decided](&lt;|url|&gt;) to focus on a younger Dark Knight.

In short: Warner Bros. has sidelined its star superheroes—two of the most recognizable, most beloved, and most lucrative characters in the world. It’s a massive problem, but one Warner Bros. already has the solution to. It just doesn’t know it yet.
> # For Warner Bros. getting the hell out of the DC Extended Universe is the right move.

Listing off all the mistakes Warner Bros. has made trying to replicate Marvel’s success in creating a superhero mega-franchise — a shared cinematic universe that keeps generating blockbusters, as they’re all part of one larger story — is unnecessary (although it continues to be hugely funny). Marvel blazed the trail. All Warner Bros. had to do was follow it, with the added benefit of anchoring the franchise around top-tier heroes like Batman and Superman, instead of lesser-known characters like Iron Man and Thor. But Warner Bros. has followed each mistake with a massive overcorrection (such as the forced humor shoved into *Justice League* after complaints that the previous films were too grim). Now the studio is so panicked about how to make future films a success that it’s having a hard time committing to directors, scripts, or even its own plans.

The list of DC movies the studio has announced since 2012 is [preposterously huge](&lt;|url|&gt;), but please bear with me. Besides the recently announced *Supergirl*, there’s *Batgirl*, *The Flash*, and* Cyborg *solo films; movies about the villains Deathstroke and Black Adam (played by Dwayne Johnson); plus *Green Lantern Corps., Booster Gold*, and *The New Gods. *More shockingly,* *there are *four* movies in development starring Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn: a *Suicide Squad* sequel, a Joker and Harley Quinn movie, *Birds of Prey*,* *and* Gotham City Sirens*. There are *also* four movies with the Joker: *Suicide Squad 2*, that Harley/Joker film, and a solo Joker movie, all starring Jared Leto. But then there’s another solo Joker movie, this one an origin story starring Joaquin Phoenix, that’s not only currently being made but also isn’t part of the DC Extended Universe at all.

The baffling existence of a Joker origin-story movie gets one thing right: For Warner Bros., getting the hell out of the DC Extended Universe is the right move. It’s busted, and the shocking failure of *Justice League* is proof enough. It’s no coincidence that the studio’s biggest success, *Wonder Woman*, spent 99 percent of its time ignoring the rest of DC’s bigger world.
> # DC’s heroes are so iconic, so mythic, that they allow themselves to be altered and bent in any form.

Even if Warner Bros. isn’t giving up on its troubled cinematic universe anytime soon, the next best thing the studio could do is not feel beholden to it, to force itself to connect everything, as Marvel is doing. Warner Bros. *should* be making movies outside its current cinematic universe, even if its current cinematic universe wasn’t stinking up the place. Because this is a power that belongs specifically to DC, not Marvel, and is one of its comics’ biggest strengths.

DC has never shied away from telling stories outside of its comics’ continuity. They’re called “Elseworlds” tales, and some of the finest stories are told there: Frank Miller’s *The Dark Knight Returns*, *Gotham by Gaslight* (where Batman hunts Jack the Ripper in 1800s England), *Superman: Red* *Son* (where baby Supes’ rocket lands in 1950s USSR), Alex Ross’ apocalyptic look at the DC universe’s future *Kingdom Come*, and so many more. Are comics fans confused when there’s a commie Superman running around in a stand-alone graphic novel but the Superman of the monthly self-titled comic is business as usual? No, because they’re clearly separate stories.

Marvel doesn’t really do this with its comics. Even if its entire reality is reset to a completely new status quo, these stories are still technically part of the main continuity, even if they get rewritten out of existence or every Marvel character forgets what happened. Part of the draw of Marvel’s comics is that they’re all connected — the heroes live in real cities, and Spider-Man can drop by and see the Fantastic Four at any time, and events in one comic can have ramifications in another. Marvel’s movies have this same strength, but it’s also a weakness — all of its movies need to show connections to the others, because that’s what people want from them.

But DC’s heroes are so iconic, so mythic, that they allow themselves to be altered and bent in any form and placed in any setting, better than any Marvel hero could be. Batman can be a man on a mission to destroy crime and avenge his parents, but he can also be a tragic figure, driven to near madness by his loss. He can be a brilliant strategist who can outthink any foe; the suave, cheesy do-gooder of the 1960s TV show; a paranoid who knows how to take out every other superhero just in case he needs to. He can be a teacher, a leader, a recluse, a father figure, an actual father, a badass, a detective, a vampire, or he can even be a very depressed Ben Affleck. He can be practically anything — why limit him or your opportunity to make many, potentially very lucrative Batman movies?

This can work, and proof is in the office right down the metaphorical hall.

WB Animation has already been doing this very thing with its direct-to-video DC animated movies. After many years of churning out stand-alone films, it created its own new continuity in 2013, in which most of its films were set — the key word here being “most.” Alongside this universe, WB Animation also made stand-alone movies starring the same heroes, often adaptations of very famous series like *All-Star Superman *or* The Dark Knight Returns*.

Obviously, Warner Bros. thinks audiences can handle the idea of two actors playing two different versions of the same character in its live-action movies, because it’s doing so with two Jokers. Where Warner Bros. is so astoundingly wrong is in believing that people want multiple Jokers instead of alternate versions of the biggest, most beloved heroes. People did not care for the Superman depicted in the movies starring Henry Cavill, and Affleck’s Batman is no more. But audiences haven’t suddenly stopped wanting Batman or Superman movies. You’d have to be as crazy as the Joker to believe that.<|endoftext|>

# DJI’s Action Cam Is Ready for Any Condition

## The company’s first action cam is a rugged winner

![The front-facing screen makes life easy for the action star. Photo by Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The front-facing screen makes life easy for the action star. Photo by Lance Ulanoff*

I’m at the “Brooklyn Zoo” and the animals are jumping from ledge-to-ledge. One leaps over my head and I adjust my position. I want to get the best shot.

Those animals are all young men, parkour experts to be exact, and they’re leaping, diving, flipping and running up walls in a parkour gymnasium called “[Brooklyn Zoo](&lt;|url|&gt;)” in Brooklyn, NY. I’m there recording it all with a palm-sized action cam from DJI called the Osmo Action.

Unveiled on May 15, this is DJI’s first action camera and is just another step in its quest to conquer action photography in the air and on the ground.

![The author shooting with the new DJI Osmo Action.](<|image|>)*The author shooting with the new DJI Osmo Action.*

At a glance, the $349 Osmo Action could be mistaken for a [GoPro](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s blocky with a lens on front and a big touch screen on back. But DJI adds a few important touches, including a 1.4-inch front facing screen, which might make it the ultimate action selfie cam.

Rugged, solid feeling (but not heavy), and ready to wear, hold or attach to a stick, the Osmo Action is built to go where the action is. DJI rates it for water operation up to 36 feet, without the need for a pressure/waterproof case. It can also handle dust, cold and heat.

I didn’t have the opportunity to take the Osmo Action for a swim, but did shoot with it out in the rain, which it handled just fine. Then I submerged it in water and captured a little video. That went, ahem, swimmingly, as well.

![Shot with Osmo Action](<|image|>)*Shot with Osmo Action*

On the top of Osmo Action is a physical power button and to the right of it is an instant record button. As the name implies, even if Osmo Action is off, you can start recording immediately simply by pressing that button. There’s another button on the left side, called QuickSwitch, for rapid access to shooting modes, including slo-mo, HDR and Time-lapse. (You can customize which presets appear on the list in settings.) It comes in especially handy if you’re shooting underwater and can’t access the touch-screen gestures.

Speaking of the touch screen, it’s relatively intuitive. Swiping up from the bottom sets shooting quality (up to 4K at 60 fps), swiping from the left accesses playback. Swiping from the right accesses manual camera settings like focus and ISO level. You access settings by swiping down from the top.

![The QuickSwitch button makes it easy to switch modes. Photo by Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The QuickSwitch button makes it easy to switch modes. Photo by Lance Ulanoff*

The, gray, palm-sized video camera was the perfect tool to capture the twists, jumps, turns and dives of the parkour team. Owing to its size, I could get super-close to the action without getting in the way. All the parkour performers were wearing Osmo Actions, too.

Osmo Action’s wide-angle but not fisheye lens lets me capture the action and surrounding environment without significant distortion. It’s also appears ready to handle the quick-change exposure conditions you might encounter in an action shoot. For instance, the Brooklyn Zoo was full of natural, but uneven light. However, as I switched from front to backlit parkour performers, the camera quickly adjusted. There were times where it threw someone into silhouette, but its exposure adjustments were fast and sure.

![There’s a power button on the left and the record button on the right that lets you start recording with one press, even if the camera was off. Photo by Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*There’s a power button on the left and the record button on the right that lets you start recording with one press, even if the camera was off. Photo by Lance Ulanoff*

Since DJI handed me the camera with only the briefest instructional walkthrough and no handbook, I had to figure how to use Osmo Action on my own. It went pretty well. I tended to use the instant record button a lot, with the mode switch a close second. It took me a little while to figure out that you have to press the mode switch once to access the quick switch and then again to choose the mode you want.

Swiping up from the bottom of the screen to adjust recording quality was easy enough. The adjustments are pretty simple so you can make fast changes without getting lost in the technical weeds.

![Shot with Osmo Action](<|image|>)*Shot with Osmo Action*

I shot a lot of 240 fps slo-mo video, which looked amazing, a bunch of 4K, and 1080p normal speed video. Photos is one of the QuickSwitch options, though if you plan on taking selfies, you’ll want to use the front screen. With enough light, the camera takes decent, ultra-wide, 12MP photos, and you can choose to shoot in JPEG or JPEG+RAW. There was some notable graininess in low light.

![The DJI Osmo Action takes decent 12 MP photos is outdoor lighting situations. Photo by Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The DJI Osmo Action takes decent 12 MP photos is outdoor lighting situations. Photo by Lance Ulanoff*

You can double tap the large screen with two fingers to instantly switch to the front-facing screen, though this was a move that I never quite mastered. Later I used that mode and the quick record button to take a few selfies. The front screen is small, which means it’s pretty hard to make out even your own face on the screen. It was, however, easy enough to read the QuickSwitch options, and I toggled through them to get to “Photo.”

Virtually all my Osmo Action footage looked smooth as butter thanks to the integrated Rock Steady electronic image stabilization technology. Unlike optical image stabilization, which allows the lens to float free from the motion of the camera, Rock Steady uses software and some very clever cropping to ensure that the video is smooth even if your hand or mountain bike isn’t.

It takes approximately 88 minutes to recharge the battery via a USB-C port. (The port is hidden next to the microSD card slot under a sliding panel). Battery life is rated to just under 2 hours per charge, which pretty much matched my experience.

![The Osmo Action hides the USB-C port and microSD card slot under a water-proof cover. Photo by Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The Osmo Action hides the USB-C port and microSD card slot under a water-proof cover. Photo by Lance Ulanoff*

Wireless connectivity is achieved via DJI’s new Mimo App. It allows you to stream video directly from the camera to the phone. Unfortunately, I had trouble connecting my Osmo Action to my phones. DJI did warn me that the software build on my preview device wasn’t final. My guess is a quick firmware and app update will solve this.

![The 2.25 touch screen is easy to use and a great viewfinder. Photo by Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The 2.25 touch screen is easy to use and a great viewfinder. Photo by Lance Ulanoff*

In building the Osmo Action, DJI clearly applied the same care as it did with its [industry-leading drones](&lt;|url|&gt;) and the [Osmo Pocket](&lt;|url|&gt;) ultra-portable gimbal. The selfie-screen is a nice extra, even if, at a certain distance, you can barely tell what you’re looking at.

Overall, Osmo Action — which arrives May 22 — is easy to use, ready for challenging environments, produces high-quality content and is competitively priced. What more can you ask for from a wearable action camera?

DJI Osmo Action arrives on May 22.<|endoftext|>

# A Highly Scientific Theory About Rey’s Origins in ‘Rise of Skywalker’

## A Highly Scientific Theory About Rey’s Origins in ‘Rise of Skywalker’

### *It involves the Emperor, clones, and highly questionable bioethics*

![© The Rise of Skywalker/Disney](<|image|>)*© The Rise of Skywalker/Disney*

Last weekend, Disney rocked the worlds of millions of nerds — and several million regular folks — with [its shocking trailer](&lt;|url|&gt;) for *Star Wars: Episode IX*, now known as *The Rise of Skywalker*. Fans have already been sifting through the footage to find every clue and solve every mystery put forth since the new trilogy was announced.

They can cease their investigation because I have the ultimate theory about the secret at the heart of these new *Star Wars* movies — including Rey’s true identity. I believe Rey’s origin story is tied directly to the biggest surprise of the first *The Rise of Skywalker* trailer, which teased the return of Emperor Palpatine via his iconic cackle.

So, let’s start here. How could Palpatine be back after being tossed to his death in *Return of the Jedi*? Easy: cloning. We know the technology exists in the *Star Wars* galaxy, obviously. Since the Emperor is only now revealing himself, it’s reasonable to think it took Imperial scientists a while to figure out this process — otherwise Palpatine would have been back in charge of the First Order years ago. Maybe it’s not as simple as there being a second Emperor — maybe the dead Emperor wanted a new body to inhabit.

This is totally normal for *Star Wars*. When Jedi die, they can become Force ghosts and hang out with people. It’s not crazy to assume the Sith could become similar ghosts as well — and if a spectral Emperor was out there, he’d definitely be telling someone in his R&D department to figure out a way to bring him back. If the idea of a Force ghost finding a way to return to the world of the living doesn’t jive with your idea of *Star Wars*, I remind you that none other than [Palpatine himself told Anakin Skywalker](&lt;|url|&gt;), “[Darth Plagueis] had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying” in *Revenge of the Sith.*

As Darth Sidious, Palpatine was Plagueis’ apprentice, and I’m pretty confident Palpatine kept his boss’s research notes after murdering him. So if there’s anyone in the *Star Wars* galaxy who might have an inkling on how to keep people from dying — or perhaps from staying dead — it’s the emperor. Even if you somehow don’t think Palpatine would be interested in becoming immortal, we know he set up hidden bases all around the galaxy, doing unknown research on the dark side of the Force and the light side, too. It’s also been confirmed [these research projects continued](&lt;|url|&gt;) even after the Emperor died in the recent, officially canonical *Star Wars* tie-in material — the best-selling novels, the great comics and animated series, and even a video game or two.

Now let’s turn to Rey, a girl apparently abandoned by her parents on Jakku at an early age, who grew up to be a Force-wielding badass. Her origin has been the biggest mystery of the trilogy — including to herself.

*The Force Awakens* hinted that Rey was someone important; the Skywalker family lightsaber (Anakin’s original weapon and the one Luke lost in *The Empire Strikes Back* when Darth Vader cut off his hand) [called to her](&lt;|url|&gt;) specifically. She was able to wield it with uncanny skill in her duel with Kylo Ren. But then, in *The Last Jedi*, both [the weird mirror cave](&lt;|url|&gt;) she jumped into and Kylo Ren made sure she knew her parents were nobodies.
> # If Rey is a Skywalker, that would mean either Luke or Leia had a kid, lost her somehow, and then didn’t care enough to look for her. And that is nonsense.

But it’s even more complicated than that. Disney and Lucasfilm have stressed that this sequel trilogy, like the two trilogies before it, [is about the Skywalker family](&lt;|url|&gt;). If Rey is a Skywalker, that would mean either Luke or Leia had a kid, lost her somehow, and then didn’t care enough to look for her. And that is nonsense.

But if Rey isn’t a Skywalker, why is she the star of a trilogy of movies about Skywalkers? And if she is a Skywalker, what possible way could she be related to Luke and Leia that wouldn’t feel cheap, lame, or frustratingly inconsistent with everything we’ve seen before? There’s only one satisfying answer here, and that’s for Rey to somehow be and not be a Skywalker.

It definitely requires some leaps, but they’re not too huge once you know about Palpatine’s research projects, which almost certainly would have included work on Skywalker DNA. Maybe the Emperor, knowing that Vader would inevitably betray or try to murder him (as Sith are wont to do) decided to make his own version of Anakin Skywalker, one he could control, teach, and indoctrinate from the very beginning as the perfect evil apprentice.

Or maybe the Emperor wanted to experiment with Anakin’s DNA and its connection to the Force to create other servants or even soldiers. Or maybe that legion of evil scientists only used it to try and create a new, even more powerful body for the Emperor’s ghost to possess.

Whatever the reasons behind it, I doubt only straight clones were created. I would assume they experimented and tried combining Skywalker DNA with animals, aliens, and other humans, too. Did I mention one of the Emperor’s [secret bases was on Jakku](&lt;|url|&gt;)?
> # This also helps explain why someone felt justified giving a little girl to a gross asshole like portion-dispenser Unkar Plutt. Rey wasn’t discarded — she was saved.

Tell me this is not a perfect idea! If Rey was one of these experiments, she would be a Skywalker in a very legitimate sense, with none of the narrative baggage. It explains how she’s the star of a movie trilogy we’ve been told is still all about the Skywalkers. Yes, it’s obviously a leap, but man, it’s a *good* leap. All it takes is one Imperial scientist to look at Experiment #1138 — aka little Rey — and find her too adorable to be discarded or killed, and there’s a perfectly justifiable reason why she was on Jakku. It also helps explain why someone felt justified giving a little girl to a gross asshole like portion-dispenser Unkar Plutt (as seen during [her vision in *The Force Awakens](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.) Instead of being a gross act of child abandonment, it was actually a mercy. Rey wasn’t discarded — she was saved.

But my second favorite part about this theory is this: If Rey was one of the Emperor’s secret experiments, who would her parents be? No one, of course.

My very favorite part about this theory is this: If Rey goes to the lab she was created in during the final act of *The Rise of Skywalker*, there would surely be old experiments still there, most or all of them evil. The strangest rumor about Episode IX is that *Revenge of the Sith*’s Hayden Christiansen [is going to be starring in it](&lt;|url|&gt;). It sounds bonkers, but what if he’s playing a clone of himself? Who would he play other than a clone of himself? Who would have made that clone other than the Emperor? And what would help tie all three trilogies together better than a fight between the first and last generation of Skywalkers?

I’m not saying I’m right. I’m saying I should be right, and if J.J. Abrams and Disney haven’t come up with an origin for Rey that perfectly incorporates the conflicting information from *The Force Awakens* and *The Last Jedi* and an explanation for the Emperor’s return that would allow for the most nerd-sating movie conclusion of all time, they need to hire me immediately. And then they need to get to work on a press release announcing *The Rise of Skywalker* will be delayed a few years so we can get the movie — and this trilogy — done right.<|endoftext|>

# Why We Love to Watch Monsters Fight

## Why We Love to Watch Monsters Fight

### The new movie ‘Godzilla: King of the Monsters’ reminds us of the strange joy of sitting through an epic battle between very, very large creatures

![Photo: Legendary Pictures](<|image|>)*Photo: Legendary Pictures*

It only takes one giant monster to destroy a city. Get two giant monsters together, and they’ll destroy the city twice as quickly while they battle each other for supremacy — and they likely won’t even notice where their rampage takes place, the devastation they cause, or the lives they take. Which raises the question: Why is a single giant monster in a movie terrifying, but a movie where two of them fight so much fun?

It’s weird when you think about it, because humanity doesn’t end up less annihilated while Godzilla fights one of his gargantuan foes. Cities still fall; countless lives are still lost. But somehow the tragedy fades away when this is a result of Godzilla taking on, say, [King Ghidorah](&lt;|url|&gt;), the three-headed dragon and main antagonist of the newest sequel, *Godzilla: King of the Monsters*. It’s like Tokyo (or wherever, but often Tokyo) stops being a city of living, breathing, helpless people, and gets turned into a giant MMA ring. It’s the reason why Godzilla and his brethren — often referred to by their Japanese name, *kaiju* — quickly transitioned from being singular agents of destruction to part of an ensemble.

In fact, after Godzilla made his debut in 1954, courtesy of Japan’s Toho Studios, he fought the Ankylosaurus-inspired monster [Anguirus](&lt;|url|&gt;) the very next year in [*Godzilla Raids Again](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. From there on, with the exception of the 2016 Japanese reboot *Shin Godzilla* and the [execrable 1998 U.S. adaptation](&lt;|url|&gt;) by Roland Emmerich, Godzilla has never lacked for a giant co-star through 35 movies. Clearly, fights between titans are what people want to see. The question is why.

Of course, there’s enjoyment to be had watching one giant monster — or giant monster collectives, like the ants of [*Them!](&lt;|url|&gt;) — *try to kill us. People love disaster movies. A massive creature roams about the land, callously destroying human civilization, as implacable and dispassionate as an earthquake or tsunami. We’re ostensibly there to watch the human characters try to survive the destruction and defeat the threat, but that’s not why we really bought our tickets. We’re there to see the sheer destruction. Bonus points if the *kaiju* is causing destruction because of humanity’s doing — something that was built into the story of Godzilla and its beginning less than a decade after Japan became the first (and, so far, only) country to suffer nuclear attacks.

The joy of watching giant monsters fight each other is something more profound. Cities still get destroyed, but they’re only the backdrop to the spectacle. People still get killed, but the monsters go from an inhuman force to the main characters. Sure, you can add top-flight actors like Raymond Burr, Matthew Broderick, and Bryan Cranston, and give them as much screen time as you want, but the real conflict we care about is always going to be between the cast members who can breathe atomic fire.

Part of it is the sheer spectacle. It’s a thrill to watch *kaiju* fight on a purely visceral level; they’re as fantastic as any superhero, and many of them have superpowers as well. But this isn’t why we care. We care because we’ve made Godzilla a hero. And that’s also extremely weird.

It took a little while for this to happen. In [his first movie](&lt;|url|&gt;), Godzilla was awoken by hydrogen bomb testing, and came to the surface to tell everybody to shut the hell up and let him sleep, something he did primarily through mass murder. In [*Godzilla Raids Again](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, he and Anguirus were both equal threats to humanity, although Godzilla managed to kill his competition by the end.

Toho Studios introduced several other similar *kaiju* over the years, until the giant butterfly [Mothra flew into the scene](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 1961. She destroyed Tokyo, of course, but only came there to rescue two 12-inch-tall twin priestesses from her native island, who were kidnapped and forced to perform duets on TV (as 12-inch twin priestesses so often are). The surviving city dwellers were more upset with the kidnapper than with Mothra, who was seen to have come on pretty legitimate business.

In 1964’s [*Mothra vs. Godzilla](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, the Japanese government actually asked those tiny priestesses to petition Mothra for help defeating Godzilla during another of his rampages; it took two Mothras (long story) to stop Godzilla, but after the job was done, they flew peacefully home, and the age of “good” giant monsters began.

Godzilla himself took on the white hat later that same year in [*Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. The movie begins with Godzilla fighting the giant pterodactyl Rodan, but I’ll let [Wikipedia](&lt;|url|&gt;) explain the next part, because it’s pretty amazing:

Upon arriving on the Japanese mainland, Mothra attempts to persuade the quarrelling Godzilla and Rodan to team up against the evil alien (which is translated to the humans by the [priestesses]) but both refuse, with Godzilla stating they have no reason to save mankind as both it and Rodan “have always had trouble with men and men hate them”, to which Rodan agrees … Unable to convince them and despite being vastly outmatched, Mothra resolves to fight Ghidorah by herself. Mothra engages Ghidorah and is continually blasted by its gravity beams. Fortunately for Mothra, Godzilla and Rodan, impressed by her courage and selflessness, arrive to help, and a titanic battle against Ghidorah begins.

And Godzilla has (mostly) been protecting the planet since. Even when he’s not actively being a hero, as he was during his silliest movies of the 1970s, the King of the Monsters has generally been positioned as the monster who will protect humanity from other, badder monsters, including in the new [*Godzilla: King of the Monsters](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

When Godzilla is a hero, we have a stake in his fight. We care about who wins. When Godzilla gets his ass kicked, yet inevitably emerges victorious in the rematch, it’s just as satisfying when Luke Skywalker, Spider-Man, or even Rocky does it. It’s a classic story arc for heroes in any type of media, and that’s exactly what Godzilla is in his movies, no matter how much screen time *Stranger Things’ *Millie Bobby Brown might get.

You may have heard that the [reviews](&lt;|url|&gt;) for *Godzilla: King of the Monsters* haven’t been great, and you may be wondering why that’s the case if watching giant monsters fight each other is so fun. Critics who have panned it inevitably say they found the story of the human characters extremely dumb. Meanwhile, those who gave the film a thumbs up just found the giant monster action predictably awesome.

But are the two positions actually that different? The bad reviews still praise the *kaiju* fights, while the good reviews still admit the human sections of the movie are inane. The real difference is whether you go to a movie titled *Godzilla: King of the Monsters* in order to watch giant monsters fight, or to watch the story of people who mostly spend their time watching giant monsters fight. I don’t blame anyone who wants a better story in their *kaiju* movies. But I will say this: Whatever motivates you to see it, watching Godzilla kick some very large asses was, is, and will always be the part you’ll enjoy the most.<|endoftext|>

# ‘I Love Billionaires’&#58; Author Ben Mezrich on the Winklevoss Twins and Cryptocurrency Hype

## In ‘Bitcoin Billionaires,’ Mezrich reinvents the Winklevoss twins as savvy tech investors

![Credit: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images*

Money as a social network. That was how a stranger first pitched Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the 6’5” twins, on bitcoin at a lavish pool party in 2008. The sibling investors, who were depicted in *The Social Network* as uber-jocks who found themselves thwarted in their tech ambitions by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, had never heard of cryptocurrency. But they knew an opportunity when they saw one. They began buying bitcoin in 2012, when it was worth less than $10 a coin, in what proved to be an incredibly shrewd investment. When the value of a bitcoin reached more than $11,000 in 2017, the Winklevoss twins became the world’s first verified bitcoin-financed billionaires. (Bitcoin is currently trading at around $7,600.)

The story of the Winklevoss brothers’ incredible second act is the subject of Ben Mezrich’s new book, [*The Bitcoin Billionaires](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. Mezrich, who also wrote *Bringing Down the House,* about a group of card counters from MIT, and *The Accidental Billionaires*, which was adapted into *The Social Network, *has a talent for telling cinematic tales of wealth, sex, and opportunity. And like his previous books, *Bitcoin Billionaires *is a colorful tale of savvy ambition, full of nerdy guys who are gobsmacked when they suddenly become the coolest kids in the room. If the Winklevoss brothers came off as outsmarted alpha Ivy Leaguers in *The Accidental Billionaires*, in *Bitcoin Billionaires, *the two are depicted as clever visionaries who got it right this time.

*OneZero* recently sat down with Mezrich in midtown Manhattan’s Harvard Club, to discuss why he wanted to set the record straight on the Winklevoss brothers and write about their big bet on bitcoin.

*The following conversation has been condensed for length and clarity.*

### **OneZero: How did you come to write the book?**

Ben Mezrich: For the past few years, people had been telling me that I should be writing a book about bitcoin. I had no interest in it. The idea of the blockchain just makes my eyes glaze over. But I read in the* New York Times* a year and a half ago about how the “Winklevii” were the first bitcoin billionaires. It just struck me as this incredible second act. These guys who were the bad guys in *The Social Network* are now worth a billion dollars.

### **You’ve known the twins for a decade now. Do you get along with one of them more than the other?**

Cameron has more of a sense of humor, is more artistic and tells jokes. Tyler is more serious. So maybe Tyler scares me more. They are big and smart and very alpha. I am very beta. In high school, I would have been terrified of them. A lot of the John Hughes ’80s sensibility that I grew up with, I put on them: These are the guys chasing John Cusack around.

But I’ve reassessed them. They are very smart and very honest. And what they are doing with bitcoin is really incredible. They believe in it for technological and financial reasons. And they are very different from the people who built bitcoin: the libertarians and anarchists and the [Silk Road](&lt;|url|&gt;)-esque people.

### **So you got them wrong the first time?**

I got them wrong. I think I got Zuckerberg exactly right.

### **So you read the New York Times article — but how’d you go about approaching them to work on this book?**

I immediately texted them. I was looking for my next story. I think they had [previously] mentioned something to me at a party about bitcoin when it was at $10. They said, “Buy some bitcoin and you’ll thank us later.” And I never did.

### **Why not?**

I didn’t want to be out promoting a book and sitting on bitcoin. But the other reason is that I am not an investor. I am really bad with money.

### **So you met with the Winklevoss brothers…**

The day after the article, I went down to New York. A lot had been written about bitcoin but it had been inaccessible. If you didn’t understand crypto and you [weren’t] a mathematician, all of those articles and books [were] hard to understand. But I was like, “Your story is cool. You’re on a beach in Ibiza and then you go down this incredible rabbit hole.” But [they’re also] driven by this anger towards Zuckerberg — this fierce need that everyone see what an ass he is.

I talked with the twins for about a month and then I reached out to Charlie. [The Winklevoss brothers invested heavily in BitInstant, one of the first bitcoin-trading companies, which was run by Charlie Shrem. Shrem was eventually convicted of aiding and abetting illicit online activities.] [Charlie] had read my books in prison. I had a real emotional attachment to Charlie, who looked at the Winklevoss brothers as these cool kids on campus. Charlie was drawn to them and [early investor in bitcoin] Roger Ver. Roger is very compelling and very smart. His views are out there. He’s a libertarian to the point of being an anarchist.
> # I love billionaires. We are going to be on Mars because of a billionaire. The world will be saved from global warming because of a billionaire.

### **Judging by how you talk about your subjects, it seems like you are an empathetic person.**

I think so. And I am drawn to strong characters, whatever they are.

### **You have been criticized for that.**

I think [*New York Times* book critic] Janet Maslin called me the “billionaire’s best friend.” I get that. Absolutely, with the Winklevoss twins, I err on the side of making people look good. And I think people understand what they are getting when they pick up one of my books.

### **Does that make you a writer or a journalist?**

I am not a journalist. I think that I tell true stories but at the same time I have always seen myself as an entertainer. I am going to tell a true story and tell it in the most thrilling, exciting fashion that I can.

### **So when critics like Janet Maslin…**

Well, Janet Maslin has a personal beef with me. I actually genuinely enjoy her reviews because she does it with such gusto. At some point, you think someone else would be reviewing me at the *Times*. [The day after this interview, the *Times* published [David Enrich’s review](&lt;|url|&gt;), in which he critiques Mezrich’s “uncritical parroting” of the twins’ opinions but also refers to him as a “talented storyteller.”] But I don’t write for Janet Maslin. Although, actually, I kind of do. There are times when I literally write a sentence and I go, “Oh, Janet is going to hate that.”

### **Is the title of this book a tribute to her?**

No, why?

### **She says your favorite word is “billionaire.”**

That it is my favorite word. I love billionaires. We are going to be on Mars because of a billionaire. The world will be saved from global warming because of a billionaire.

### **Can you describe the process of getting your books made into movies?**

When I write a book proposal, I take it to a number of movie producers. This book is with Columbia. But it’s not official yet. Although they did *The* *Social Network*, this is not a sequel. There has been talk of a *Social Network* sequel that Aaron Sorkin and Scott Rudin want to do. That’s a totally different story. I wouldn’t be involved. *Bitcoin Billionaires* will be its own movie.

### **Should Armie Hammer reprise the role of the twins?**

We reached out to Armie. I think he’d be perfect.

### **When you start a book, you’re clearly thinking about a lot of different things, not just the book.**

I won’t write a book unless I sell the movie. I write a treatment. And if the treatment doesn’t get excitement, then I won’t write the book.

### **Why?**

I will always be a book writer. But we live in a time when it has to have more life. It has to be a platform that is sent out to the world in a variety of different ways. I see the book as one component.

### **A big part of cryptocurrency being successful is the actual technology, but it’s also about perception.**

That people believe in it.

### **Right. And you could be a huge part of moving perception.**

I hope so.

### **It’s just like you did with painting Facebook’s origin story; it feels like you’re trying to write a defining story for cryptocurrency.**

I think that’s a fair assessment. When you read *Bitcoin Billionaires*, it’s warts and all. I don’t hide the Silk Road story. And Charlie is a cautionary tale. You are not going to come away from the book with a whitewashed version of bitcoin. I think you could come away from the book recognizing its potential. A hundred years from now, we’re not going to be walking around with pieces of paper bartering like medieval peasants. We are going to be using crypto.

### **What’s next?**

I think *Bitcoin Billionaires *will be a big movie. The UFO and woolly mammoth movies [based on his books, *The 37th Parallel: The Secret Truth Behind America’s UFO Highway* and *Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive History’s Most Iconic Extinct Creature*] are in development. I just wrote a screenplay. I don’t know my next book. I am waiting for the next billionaire to call.<|endoftext|>

# We Still Have a Ton of Questions About Apple’s ‘Services’ Pivot

## We Still Have a Ton of Questions About Apple’s ‘Services’ Pivot

### *A very long event was short on concrete details*

![](<|image|>)

Remember Monday well: It’s when Apple unabashedly shoved its services business into the spotlight, prioritizing content over the hardware the company has built its name and hundreds of billions of dollars in value on. It’s a smart move, because those service pockets are filled with money.

Services, which include things like the iOS App Store and iTunes, were a [$5 billion business](&lt;|url|&gt;) for Apple in 2015. Now, they account for well over [$10.9 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) and climbing. Revenue from iPhone sales is still much larger, but Apple’s no longer breaking out specific iPhone unit sales numbers as it struggles with a flattening handset market. Services is growing by double digits almost by the quarter, and the iPhone — long Cupertino’s crown jewel — is not.

The future is services, and the key to that future is your propensity to pay Apple for every one of them. But the company hasn’t filled in key details — like, say, cost — about many of the products it announced at Monday’s Show Time event in California.

And there were many. Here’s a quick rundown:

* News+: Apple’s magazine and newspaper subscription service includes 300-plus publications, though there are noticeable absences, like *The New York Times*. It also includes some popular newsletters — I see you, *The Skimm*.

* Apple Card: Apple’s own digital (and physical!) credit card

* Apple Arcade: A custom gaming platform full of exclusive games that you and your kids can play on any iPad, iPhone, or Apple TV

* Apple TV app revamp: With the option of adding individual premium channels at any time without the need for a separate app or bundle

* Apple TV+: Apple’s rather uninspiring name for its upcoming streaming app, where you’ll find a dizzying array of fresh, home-grown content from everyone from Steven Spielberg to Chris Evans to Alfre Woodard to Oprah Winfrey

In some instances, Apple dug deep into the details of pricing and availability. News+ is $9.99 a month for all-you-can-eat content from magazines like *The New Yorker* and *Vanity Fair* and newspapers like *The Wall Street Journal*. (Note, however, that the offerings from the *Journal*, at least, [are limited](&lt;|url|&gt;): You don’t get the entire newspaper nor do you get access to a full archive.) News+ is available right now via an iOS update.

Apple Card, which will arrive this summer, is a Goldman Sachs/Mastercard-backed insta-digital credit card with the promise of two percent cash back on every purchase and three percent back on Apple purchases. I can understand why no consumer bank wanted to touch this since it competes directly with all of their rewards programs. The Apple Card comes with hardware of a sort: a numberless, CCV-less titanium card that looks like what Jony Ive would do if he were forced to design credit cards. (And maybe he was.)

With Apple Arcade, things get a bit fuzzier. The video game platform isn’t set to arrive until the fall, likely so that developer partners can have more time to prepare their games. We didn’t even get a subscription price.

The pattern continued with Apple TV. It felt like when you keep asking your waiter for water just as he looks the other way. So tantalizing, so refreshing, and just out of reach.
> # Be where your customers are, not just where you want them to be.

Apple’s heavy reliance on star power to promote what will likely be its most expensive service, Apple TV+, was frustrating as well. Sure, I enjoyed seeing Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams, Jason Momoa — you get the idea — all on stage, but I was thirsty for details about how Apple’s streaming service will fit into the Apple ecosystem and, especially, how Apple will compete with Netflix and Hulu on price.

Of course, Apple did pull one magic trick out of its hat: putting its updated Apple TV app on smart TVs from companies like Samsung, Sony, and LG and on competing streaming boxes from Roku and Amazon. (Apple had previously announced that the [iTunes store](&lt;|url|&gt;) would be available on some Samsung TVs, but the TV app is a different beast entirely.)

That move — which seems certain to devalue old Apple TV hardware, at least — fits with Apple’s new service-focused business: Be where your customers are and not just where you want them to be.

I do get the feeling, though, that Apple is still working out the kinks of this whole service-focused vision. While Tim Cook introduced virtually every single product, he never returned to the big list to explain how it would all hang together. More importantly, he never talked bundles. Apple will have to cook up some very smart bundles of offerings like Apple Music, AppleTV+, News+, Apple Arcade, and even Apple Card to sell customers on the value of what they’re getting while locking them into these new services. If you’re a Spotify user tempted by AppleTV+ and News+, maybe Apple can convert you with a bundle that includes Apple Music, adding more value for the company in the long run.
> # Apple’s growing role as a massive content curator will either create a powerful magnet for new customers or, perhaps, finally break existing ones.

Who knows? With some of these services arriving later than others, that may be the long-term goal. But success hinges on Apple winning customers directly from other services. Apple Card may have the excellent built-in cash back, but how will the company drive people to spend, say, another $9.99 or more a month for AppleTV+ if they’re also paying $15 a month for the family’s Apple Music plan along with nearly that much for Netflix?

Apple’s growing role as a massive content curator will either create a powerful magnet for new customers or, perhaps, finally break existing ones. There are only so many dollars anyone can pour into one company. Something like $40 to $60 a month, not counting the one-off channels I might subscribe to for Apple TV or the possible bill for the iPhone Upgrade Program, is going to add up.

There’s always been an advantage to living within the Apple ecosystem. My iCloud seamlessly ties together activities on my iPhone, iPad, and Mac. But Apple’s efforts to rope gaming, high-quality news content, and studio-level streaming content pushes Apple and possibly its customers outside that comfort zone and into a space where Apple will have to compete, in some cases, with more seasoned competitors.

“Many consumers are tired of subscriptions, but most will make a change for a strong value proposition,” says Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst for Moor Insights and Strategy.

“The challenge is that there weren’t enough details.”

The real wild card here is the Apple Card. Apple’s dive into the deep waters of financial technology could help make everything almost all right for cash-strapped Apple customers. Getting two percent on purchases is sweet, but getting three percent on all those Apple purchases is even sweeter — unless you’re freaked out that the company that makes your cellphone and your computer and your streaming device and maybe also your watch is now your bank as well.

Moorhead, though, was more sanguine about this opportunity for the company and for its consumers. “Apple Card was the most unique offering as Apple is trying to solve real problems like complexity, security, and indebtedness,” he says. Though you may be skeptical of the “indebtedness” part — it is a credit card, after all — the Apple Card will have a number of connected iOS features that help you monitor spending, among other things.

Make no mistake — all of this represents a major change. Apple is pulling off the hardware highway and onto the service road. It’s a smart, market-savvy move that should protect it from the further crumbling of the smartphone market. But to stay on the path, Apple has to bring all the pieces together and convince you to join them for the full-service ride.<|endoftext|>

# What It’s Like Using the Internet When You Have OCD

## What It’s Like Using the Internet When You Have OCD

### *’When I’m not on [Twitter]… I have literal heart palpitations’*

![Original Photo: [Oleg Magni](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Original Photo: [Oleg Magni](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

*In Microprocessing, columnist Angela Lashbrook aims to improve your relationship with technology every week. She’ll go deep on the little things that define your online life today.*

*This week’s column contains frank discussions of mental illness and stigma against those with mental illness. If you have obsessive-compulsive disorder or another mental disorder and need support, you can contact the [National Alliance on Mental Illness](&lt;|url|&gt;) at 800-950-NAMI or via text at 741741. United Kingdom residents can call [OCD Action](&lt;|url|&gt;) at 0845 390 6232. Canadians can find contact information for local support [here](&lt;|url|&gt;).*

Morgan was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 20 years ago. While a combination of medication and therapy has kept it mostly under control, she says, it still comes back occasionally in an incredibly frustrating manner.

“There have been flare-ups that have slowed me down because I had to type a sentence, erase it, and type it until it was ‘safe,’” she says.

What Morgan is experiencing is an emerging manifestation of OCD: When symptoms express not in the physical world (for example, when a patient repeatedly, and in a way that interferes with their life, checks their oven to ensure that it’s off), but on the internet instead.

There’s no name for this phenomenon. In many ways, it’s merely another venue for OCD to articulate. But for some people with OCD, it can make the internet an incredibly stressful, unhealthy, and, in some cases, dangerous place to be. It can also make it easier to access care, as a hospital in Sweden is finding in its ongoing research on internet-based therapy for people with the disorder.

The term OCD and its components, obsessive and compulsive, get thrown around a lot, and in contexts where they probably don’t belong. I’m not actually “obsessed” with the latest book I read, and I don’t have a true “compulsion” to check Twitter, even though sometimes it certainly feels that way. Similarly, people use the term OCD when, for example, they like to keep their kitchen countertops sparkling clean.
> # For some people with OCD, it can make the internet an incredibly stressful, unhealthy, and, in some cases, dangerous place to be.

Simply wanting a clean kitchen does not mean a person has OCD. What makes it OCD is when the person can’t leave the house without wiping down the countertops once, twice, three more times, because they’re afraid of what will happen if they don’t. When they can’t do a task without repeating a particular prayer or mantra. When the thought of a disorganized kitchen isn’t just annoying; it causes actual distress and extreme anxiety. And OCD extends far beyond a stereotypical concern with cleanliness. Some people with OCD experience upsetting, intrusive thoughts, such as envisioning themselves hurting a loved one.

According to Sanjaya Saxena, a professor of psychiatry and director of the UC San Diego Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders Program, one of the best ways to understand OCD is that it relates to fear. Whether it’s a contamination-related fear, as in the case of needing to keep a kitchen sparkling clean, or a concern about acts of violence, accidents, or even the fear that a patient will say the wrong thing in a social situation, “these can create obsessional fears, and that can lead to compulsions,” Saxena says.

Checking their social media accounts multiple times an hour doesn’t necessarily mean a person has OCD. But for Anna*, a woman with OCD who developed a compulsion related to checking her social media accounts after an embarrassing social interaction, it does.

“Some people I knew made me feel weird about not knowing something, so I became obsessed with trying to know as much as I can, whether it is a political thing or about someone from high school being engaged,” Anna says. “Part of it is being afraid of looking stupid and having social anxiety as well.”

Jenny*, who also has OCD, says that in high school, her fears related to leaving a hair iron or a light turned on. Now she compulsively checks her Twitter account because of an ever-lingering “what if?”

“When I’m not on this site, I have, like, literal heart palpitations,” she says. “What if there’s a thread I should be commenting on? What if there’s some post I should be liking? What if, what if, what if… I hate it and wish I could quit.”

Jenny says that while she still has to manage her OCD symptoms regularly, she’s glad they’re expressed in a more “socially acceptable” manner than they were in the past, when little details would prevent her from leaving the house entirely. She can leave the house now and socialize, but, Jenny says, “I just feel so incredibly weak for being… hooked on a website, you know?”

Mental disorders don’t mean a person is weak, though [stigma](&lt;|url|&gt;) against those with mental health struggles remains steep, and the [social and economic costs](&lt;|url|&gt;) related to the disorder can be high. This is also true of internet-related symptoms of OCD, which can cause increased stress in work environments, such as when a person has fear related to sending emails.

Saxena says he has patients who have trouble sending emails at all, concerned that they might write something offensive or use foul language, even though such modes of communication are totally out of character for that person. These “checking behaviors,” he says, “can sometimes take hours and hours and hours out of a day. Some folks say, ‘I’m getting my work done, but it takes four hours longer because I have to go back and check everything over again.’” Even more serious, according to Saxena, is what he calls avoidance, in which a person with OCD decides that because of their symptoms, they’re unable to use the internet at all. In such a situation, a person’s ability to complete their work is severely inhibited, and they may miss important messages from colleagues, friends, and family members.

Perhaps more frustrating, and even frightening, is when people with OCD experience symptoms that compel them to Google dangerous search terms.
> # One of the most common ways OCD manifests online is when people have a fear that they’re somehow violent.

“I was at my grandpa’s condo, and I looked up ‘child hentai’ for no reason. I don’t know why the hell I did that, because I’m VERY against that type of stuff of any kind,” [wrote a user](&lt;|url|&gt;) on an online OCD forum in a thread about obsessive internet searching.

The user closed out the browser before the results popped up, but they’re now plagued with fear, because “if they wanted to, THEY COULD SEE THE INTERNET SEARCH, coming from my grandpa’s router. I’m horrible. I can’t keep it out of my head, and I don’t know what to do.”

Jonathan Abramowitz, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, specializes in OCD and related disorders. He says one of the most common ways OCD manifests online is when people have a fear that they’re somehow violent, even if they’ve never been violent or actually wanted to hurt anyone.

“Someone who has obsessive thoughts about violence might go on the internet to look up all about serial killers and try to compare themselves to known killers to make sure they’re not going to act on their thoughts of violence,” Abramowitz says. “Or people who are afraid, ‘What if I have a thought about molesting a child?’ and they go online and look up stuff about child molesters.” ([Research shows](&lt;|url|&gt;) that people with mental illness are no more violent than people without mental illness.)

Internet-related symptoms can be socially and financially debilitating for some people with OCD, but there’s been very little, if any, research done on the subject. Kiara Timpano, an associate professor of psychology and director of the Program for Anxiety, Stress, and OCD at the University of Miami, says very little is known about the intersection of the two. Saxena says this is because people with OCD can develop symptoms related to pretty much anything. “It’s next to impossible to kind of look into all of” the ways OCD can manifest, he says. “The fact that it relates to the internet is not really what’s critical.”

While the internet can be a problematizing factor for people with OCD, it can potentially be helpful as well. [The Rücklab](&lt;|url|&gt;), at the Karolinska Institute, one of Sweden’s top medical universities, is conducting research on how online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be used to treat people with the disorder. So far, [results](&lt;|url|&gt;) have been promising, with multiple studies showing that “ICBT” is effective and cost efficient and could make it easier for people to access treatment who might otherwise have trouble getting to or affording therapists. Further research is needed, however, to know how ICBT compares to traditional, in-person CBT, and Abramowitz stresses that nothing really compares to one-on-one work with a therapist.

The internet, as far as anyone knows, doesn’t cause anyone to have OCD. It doesn’t seem to make symptoms worse. It does, however, create new avenues for the disorder to express and new ways for people with OCD to find themselves regularly confronted with their symptoms. But as difficult as the disorder can be, with regular therapy (in particular, cognitive behavioral therapy) and, potentially, medication, OCD is manageable.

As Morgan notes, the combination of medication and years of therapy have tamped down her symptoms to the point where they only occasionally resurface. And while many people, because of insurance, busy schedules, or physical proximity, lack access to the professional support they need, if the promising work at the Rücklab is any indication, many people with OCD might soon find their symptoms a little easier to handle.

# Apple’s New iPad Mini Is a Powerful Throwback

## A tablet that looks like 2016 but plays like 2019

![The new iPad Mini looks familiar, but under the hood, it’s a different beast. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The new iPad Mini looks familiar, but under the hood, it’s a different beast. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

It’s been four years since Apple updated its iPad Mini, the pint-sized 7.9-inch tablet popular among children and professionals who need a screen large enough for work (or play) but small enough to slip into a coat pocket.

In that time, Apple has essentially rewritten its slab design language. The iPhone dropped its sharp edges in favor of an all-curved design, buttons traded mechanics for haptics to mimic movement, and screens flowed like water to the outer edges of each device.

![The only iPad that fits in your coat pocket. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The only iPad that fits in your coat pocket. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

Apple’s new iPad Mini, however, is a design throwback, thawed like Sylvester Stallone’s cryogenically frozen Demolition Man to tackle the tablet challenges of a new generation of users.

At a glance, the iPad Mini 5 is a match for 2015’s iPad Mini 4, right down to physical Touch ID button. That’s right — Apple has delivered a new tablet with a mechanical home button. In an era when the iPhone hasn’t had a movable home button since 2016, and when the iPhone XS and iPad Pros don’t even have home buttons at all, this decision is mind-boggling. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve always been a fan of that button — but this is 2019, not 2015.

![That’s a real home button on the iPad Mini. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*That’s a real home button on the iPad Mini. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

Even though it seems like Apple missed an opportunity to reinvent the iPad Mini, it does align with some of the decisions Cupertino has made on other recent tablet introductions. The education tablet has a mechanical home button and large bezels, and none of Apple’s tablets, not even the high-end iPad Pro, include the haptics-driven 3D Touch, which lets you press harder on the screen to access additional features.

![There’s an 8 MP camera on the back. It’s fine. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*There’s an 8 MP camera on the back. It’s fine. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

Apple stuck with the 2,048x1,536 Retina display, which at this size looks fantastic, but it’s hard to ignore the large white borders around the screen. Even when Apple delivers LCD-based Retina screens on cheaper devices like the [iPhone XR](&lt;|url|&gt;), it manages to deliver all-screen devices. One throwback consumers will probably appreciate is the inclusion of a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.


## **Fill in the blank**

So, what’s going on here? Is there an iPad Mini team at Apple working in the basement, completely unaware of the design work being done aboveground at the spaceship campus? What’s the purpose of a $399 tablet that looks like it turned left at 2016, got lost, and emerged in 2019 saying, “Hey guys, what’s President Hillary Clinton up to?”

Apple might tell you that the Mini (and the new iPad Air) fills a utility/performance gap between the [$299 education iPad](&lt;|url|&gt;) ($329 outside the education market) and the pricier, more stylish, and more powerful iPad Pro line. The Mini’s success with kids and industries where a midsized and relatively affordable tablet is a must perhaps encouraged Apple to stay the course on design.

![The new iPad Mini is 6.1 millimeters thick and features stereo speakers and a Lightning port. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The new iPad Mini is 6.1 millimeters thick and features stereo speakers and a Lightning port. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

Put simply, there are zero design surprises in the new iPad Mini. It’s still just 0.24 inches thick and 0.66 pounds. (The chassis measures 8x5.3 inches.) My hand is large enough that I can easily wrap my fingers around it, but the Mini is also light and thin enough that it’s quite easy to hold with just two fingers squeezing a single corner. That exquisitely svelte design (thinner even than the 0.3-inch-thick iPhone XS) belies some astonishing power. Because even though Apple didn’t mess with the iPad Mini’s body, it replaced most of the components.

![At 0.66 pounds, this is a lightweight tablet. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*At 0.66 pounds, this is a lightweight tablet. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

Apple’s iPad Mini runs the exact same CPU as the iPhone XS: the A12 Bionic (Geekbench scores are virtually identical), which now makes it the second-largest screen running that mobile CPU. (The new iPad Air has it as well.)

This upgrade takes the Mini from being primarily a content consumption device to a tiny little workhorse.

## **Raw power**

I have an old Retina iPad Mini that I use primarily for email and web browsing, and despite accommodating iOS 12, it can now barely handle those tasks. This new iPad Mini is light-years away from that experience.

As an iPhone X user, I’m well acquainted with the A12 Bionic’s capabilities. Backed by almost 3 GB of RAM, the chip is no less powerful in the iPad Mini.

![Note the split screen to support Procreate on the left and Photos on the right. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*Note the split screen to support Procreate on the left and Photos on the right. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

The processing power is further enhanced by the Mini’s new Apple Pencil support (sold separately for $99). Now every iPad, from the education iPad to the iPad Pro, supports an Apple Pencil. Having grown accustomed to the redesigned Apple Pencil that magnetically connects to and charges on the iPad Pro, I’m disappointed that Apple is pairing the iPad Mini with its previous-generation pencil. Charging that thing with the included adapter is annoying, and I do not like watching the Pencil roll away on my table. Even so, it’s just as good a drawing implement as the new Pencil, recognizing pressure and drawing angle. (There are no touch controls on the old Pencil.) As I drew, I forgot which pencil I was holding and just got carried away in the process.

![Drawn on the iPad Mini using Apple Pencil and Procreate. Illustration: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*Drawn on the iPad Mini using Apple Pencil and Procreate. Illustration: Lance Ulanoff*

The Mini is now as effective at Procreate drawing as it is at email. It can also handle an Adobe Premier Rush CC video editing project with as much ease as it can a webpage.

On the iPad Mini, iOS 12.2 runs like a champ, and the device had no trouble handling split-screen apps (up to three) and dragging and dropping images from one window to another.

![These adorable Wonderscope characters looked like they were really in my home office—and they made fart jokes, so it’s a win.

This is also an excellent augmented reality companion. The iPad Mini might even be better at AR than the iPhone XS or iPad Pro. It’s not because of raw performance; rather, it’s due to the combination of excellent AR chops, a larger screen (twice the real estate of an iPhone XR), and the iPad Mini’s ergonomically friendly design, all of which could make it the perfect AR platform for children. I had a blast trying out Froggipedia and the ultra-silly but visually impressive Wonderscope.

![I took this photo at New York’s Chelsea Piers with the iPad Mini’s 8 MP camera. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*I took this photo at New York’s Chelsea Piers with the iPad Mini’s 8 MP camera. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

Apple also updated the cameras on the iPad Mini, adding a good-enough 7 MP FaceTime Camera on the front and an 8 MP camera on the back. Both shoot HD video and take decent pictures, but with all the photographic acrobatics capable on even the iPhone XR, it’s hard to get excited about these shooters.

![Asphalt 9 plays and looks great on the iPad Mini.](<|image|>)*Asphalt 9 plays and looks great on the iPad Mini.*

The iPad Mini is an excellent action-gaming device. I played *Asphalt 9: Legends*, where the cars look almost real and the locales are lush and chaotic, and the graphically intensive *NBA 2K19* without a hitch. Plus, with a screen roughly the same size as my Delta in-flight entertainment system, the iPad Mini is a solid portable theater. Playback is bright, sharp, and saturated, and the stereo speakers get impressively loud. Most of the time, though, I paired the Mini with my AirPods. The tablet’s also a good listener. I all but whispered, “Hey Siri,” and the voice assistant responded every time. Did you know you can use Siri to open apps?

![I need to watch a lot more basketball to figure out how to properly play NBA 2K19.](<|image|>)*I need to watch a lot more basketball to figure out how to properly play NBA 2K19.*

One thing I did notice is that after intense gameplay or hours of drawing, the metal back of the iPad Mini did feel a little warm.

Touch ID integration works quickly and smoothly for unlocking the device and logging into apps. (I enabled LastPass Touch ID integration.) It’s a shame Apple didn’t use all that white space above the screen to add Face ID.

![There’s just a 7 MP FaceTime camera floating in all that space on the top edge. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*There’s just a 7 MP FaceTime camera floating in all that space on the top edge. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

Battery life was excellent. I got anywhere from 12 to 14 hours, depending on activity. There are a few other updates worth noting on my silver 256 GB, Wi-Fi + Cellular LTE iPad Mini ($749). In addition to a nano-SIM, it supports eSIMs, which will make it easier to jump from one carrier to another. It also has fast 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0.

Overall, I’m a fan of this new iPad Mini. It hits the sweet spot between pocket-sized power and big-screen creativity. Charging $399 for the 64 GB base model, while not necessarily a mistake, is a potential missed opportunity for Apple. A $199 iPad Mini, even a slightly retro, time-traveling model like this one, would have sold out.<|endoftext|>

# How to Quit Your Job in 837 Easy Steps

## I found myself Googling whether to leave my job — while leading PR at Google

![Credit: nadia_bormotova/iStock/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: nadia_bormotova/iStock/Getty Images Plus*

## **Step 1: Take lots of online quizzes, looking for sudden enlightenment.**

It all started with a quiz — several of them. Week after week, I’d hop on Google and search “how to know it’s time to quit your job.” I’d write it just like that, a complete sentence, wanting to do full justice to my question. The first results were always quizzes:

* *Is your boss a horrible person?*

* *Would you hate to have your boss’s job?*

* *Are you woefully underpaid?*

* *Do you wake up each morning dreading going into the office?*

I did them all. I never scored 10 out of 10. No, I didn’t totally hate my job. No, I didn’t dread going into the office each morning. My boss wasn’t a horrible person. And, as head of PR for all of Google, I would say I was over- not under-paid.

But I was* *unhappy. I had gotten to the top of my profession, but the truth was that I was [increasingly having doubts](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the content of this supposed dream job. And after all those years of wondering what it would be like to run things, I realized that having the big office meant you were on one side of the glass while all the people who had once been your friends were on the other side of it. It was more lonely than fun.

And so, I found myself with the ridiculous practice of asking Google whether I should quit Google. Every few weeks, I’d try a different quiz, thinking it would yield some new insight or that my score would gradually tick upward. It took several months before I hit on the real takeaway: It didn’t matter what my score was. The motivation for taking these quizzes was itself the answer. It was time to quit my job.

## **Steps 2–49: Despite your realization, don’t quit. Try to become happier in your job.**

Take walks in the morning. Eat more sugar. Eat less sugar. Use those free massage credits (did I mention I worked in tech?). Avoid the executive you thought was a bully. Stand up to the executive you thought was a bully. Spend more time meeting with reporters — horrible idea — spend less time meeting with reporters. Delegate more. Try to care less. Try to care more.

None of this worked for me. But it might for you.

## **Steps 50–690: Wait for divine intervention.**

I am generally not one for spells, incantations, or the thought that there are job fairies lining one’s career path, ready to lend a hand. But when it came to quitting my job, it seemed totally reasonable to somehow expect that the universe would rally on my behalf to figure out my next step.

If I just waited, surely my life’s purpose would reveal itself to me. I’d wake up one morning and realize that my true calling was to make flower arrangements, start a company, or become a park ranger. Or if not any of those, at least the universe would listen to me and put an exciting job opportunity in front of me. After all, I had random headhunter and LinkedIn job offers each week; it seemed very plausible that something awesome would appear one day in my inbox. Maybe some publisher would come out of the woodwork and buy [the book I had written](&lt;|url|&gt;) years earlier, or maybe my next opportunity would materialize when I was at the local coffee shop, where The Youth are often talking loudly about their vegan crypto projects.

I was open to anything. I just wanted a sign, flashing bright and neon, before me. Guess what? The universe was silent. Because, obviously, whether in the work world or in the fledgling vegan crypto industry, if you want to make something happen, you often have to do it yourself.

## **Steps 691–740: Read women’s magazines and learn fast-cook recipes that will see you through the week.**

I finally came around to the fact that it was on me to figure out my next steps. I needed some inspiration, so I grabbed a bunch of magazines targeted at women of a certain age — *More*, *Women’s Day*, *Real Simple*. These are the magazines that spend little time telling you about the current hot lipstick color and instead assume you are a sexless void who lives to tend to your children and organize your spice rack. They were also filled with stories of women who have quit their jobs and gone on to do great things.

The narrative arc was pretty similar from one story to the next:
> Leslie had gotten to a point in her career as an account executive/mid-level banker/small business marketer when she realized that she needed to make a change. The next day, as she was sucking in her gut to fit into her skirt, she had an idea — why can’t women wear even tighter-fitting underclothes to make them slimmer? Why can’t they get salon-quality waxing at the fraction of the price? What is stopping them from having better organized closets? So Leslie took a leap of faith. It was hard and she almost gave up, but today Leslie has a successful closet organization business.

I just couldn’t relate. I didn’t have a brilliant idea. My closet was a mess and always will be. The only thing I knew was that I no longer wanted to do what I was doing.

## **Step 741: Explore your options and watch them evaporate before your eyes.**

Thinking I was taking the bull by the horns, I agreed to go on a job interview for a hot car company.

“Why do you like [Car Company]”?

“To be honest, I hate cars. I find them really boring.”

“Uh, so… why would you be interested in this job?”

“Well, I think if anyone was going to make me like cars a bit more, it might be your company.”

“We should probably hire someone who likes cars.”

## **Steps 742–746: Face your fears by asking someone else what they are.**

Next, I turned to a life coach. (Yes, once again I was trying to get someone else to figure this out for me.)

“I’m scared to quit,” I told her. “What am I without my job? All I do is work. That is all I am. What if I quit and my life is empty?”

The coach told me to write down what it would look like if I quit my job. What was the worst* *thing that could happen? What was the most likely thing to happen?

So I wrote it down. Lo and behold, despite how I felt inside, there was no apocalypse. Even in the worst-case scenario, the Earth remained spinning. I could always get another job; I had been working a long time and had skills that were in demand.
> # *I decided to tell a few people I was going to quit — the idea being to make myself more accountable to my decision, like one would with a diet or New Year’s resolution.*

## **Steps 747–760: Tell people your goals in inopportune moments.**

Inspired by my coach, I decided to tell a few people I was going to quit — the idea being to make myself more accountable to my decision, like one would with a diet or New Year’s resolution. I did not typically do this in a very crisp way:

“I’m quitting,” I told a co-worker. “I don’t know when, but by the time I’m 40 for sure.” My co-worker’s jaw dropped. He didn’t say anything, so I kept talking. “By the way, I’m pregnant. Also, did you finish your headcount projections for next year?”

That was a bit awkward, so the next time I tried a more concrete approach.

“I am going to quit,” I told a friend.

“What will you do?”

“I don’t know. Maybe open an Etsy store to sell small knitted animals?”

“Do you know how to knit?”

“That’s not the point!”

## **Step 763: Solve for the real problem: your big, fat ego (for example).**

When I was a manager, employees would often come to my office and spend 25 minutes dancing around all kinds of issues related to their promotion or career. For most of us, it’s not easy to talk to our managers about what we really want. At some point, I would stop them and ask what was most important to them: Money? Promotion and recognition? The content of the job?

People aren’t driven by the same things, and many of us have a particularly hard time being honest with ourselves or others when our priorities are more materialistic or ego-driven. But for the purpose of this 837-step plan, you have to put aside the little voice that’s criticizing or second-guessing what you want. (Later, after* *you’ve quit your job, you can go do the meditation retreat that will make you less of an egomaniac or materialist. That’s like a 2,000-step plan, and it’s not what we’re here to solve right now.)

Once you can clearly identify what matters to you, it’s a lot easier to solve your problem. At the end of the day, it’s not that different from writing a business plan at work. I need *x* and so I will do *y *to get there.

For all of my supposed management prowess, it took me a long time to follow the advice I had been giving to my own employees for years. In my case, I wanted to reduce my 90-minute commute and not have to clean up other people’s messes (a big part of any PR job). I only wanted to deal with messes that I myself had created.

That’s when it all fell into place: I needed to solve for having more control.

## **Step 764–836: Throw yourself off a cliff, gently.**

If I had identified money or prestige as my key driver, I might have explored options at other tech companies or a similar position in a new industry. But that would have just been taking my existing problem to a new job. I had figured out I wanted to be a one-woman show of something. I didn’t know what that was, which was probably part of the reason why I had been paralyzed for so long. So what I needed wasn’t necessarily a new job; it was something that would help me figure out what I was interested in.

So I applied to grad school, and when I got in, paid the $100 deposit. Did I know if I would finish grad school or what would come of it? No. But it allowed me to jump right into something else — something totally different that would allow little comparison with my previous life and also give me total control over my day-to-day goals.

I did all of this at 39. I couldn’t have afforded myself that opportunity in my 20s — and of course, many people my age can’t afford to take time off to figure out their next steps. The point of my advice is not to say you should take a year off and go to grad school or decamp to an ashram in India (though if that works for you, great).
> # After the deposit was paid, it was easy to give my notice.

Rather, it’s to say that if you’re hanging on a bit too long, afraid of what will happen next, find something that forces you into your next step. Sign up for something that you will have a hard time wiggling out of. That could be taking a night class, conducting informational interviews to learn more about a particular field, or doing some volunteer work in an area that interests you. Make a small commitment that feels easy to do at the time but later may feel hard to reverse.

After the deposit was paid, it was easy to give my notice. I knew what I was doing next, and I knew what I was solving for. I wasn’t fixing all of my job existential woes — I was getting myself on a path toward figuring out what I wanted to do.

(Side note for those interested: During the year following my departure from Google, I went back to school, ended up starting a company, had a third child, paused school to zombie-walk my way through the newborn stage, and [published a book](&lt;|url|&gt;). Only the school part was in motion when I left, but none of the other four things would have likely happened if I had stayed at my job. Also, that was a crazy year; I am not normally so productive.)

## **Step 837: Accept that your life is just a late-stage capitalism business plan.**

Reading magazine profiles or listening to cocktail party versions of people’s quitting stories, it’s easy to think you should only quit your job if you have a super clear vision of your future or are blessed with a million-dollar idea. Because our own narrative doesn’t feel so simple, we second-guess our instincts, allowing fear of the unknown to push us toward putting off the things we know we want to do.

Instead, we’d do well to embrace the messiness of our process and dispassionately figure out what’s important to us on the most fundamental level, building a business plan for our life that gradually gets us from point A to point B.

There are some people who are born knowing exactly what they want to do or who are super relaxed about riding the seas of change from one wave to the next. But those people never clicked on this article. But you did. And you read all the way to this sentence. The question is, why? And what are you waiting for?<|endoftext|>

# The Star Wars Disney Theme Park Is a Little Too Authentic

## The Star Wars Disney Theme Park Is a Little Too Authentic

### Disneyland’s newest addition is a nerd paradise that plays out like an interactive theater nightmare

![ANAHEIM, CA — A preview of the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run ride at Disneyland from the Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge media event on May 29, 2019. Photo: Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty](<|image|>)*ANAHEIM, CA — A preview of the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run ride at Disneyland from the Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge media event on May 29, 2019.

When I was young, the idea of an amusement park based entirely around *Star Wars *would have been paradise on Earth. Now that I’m 42, Disney has actually created Galaxy’s Edge, and I… well, I still desperately want to go. But I’m also very, very afraid of what I’m going to find there.

If you’re unaware, Galaxy’s Edge is the newest addition to Disneyland, a giant, 14-acre theme park based entirely around the *Star Wars* franchise. Calling it a theme park may actually be misleading, as it’s supposed to be a true immersive experience, as if you’re actually being transported to the universe of the movies. What this means is there isn’t a spinning teacup ride where all the cups are Darth Vader helmets, or even a roller coaster where all the cars are made up like *Star Wars* spaceships. It’s much more intense.

When you enter Galaxy’s Edge, you are actually entering the Black Spire, a remote trading outpost on the planet Batuu, which is situated on the Outer Rim of the *Star Wars* galaxy. It’s not something you’ve seen in the movies, but a new location created for the park (and already [a very official part](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the franchise’s canon). [The food](&lt;|url|&gt;) has *Star Wars*-ian names, so if you’re hungry for chicken tenders, you have to ask for “Endorian Tip-Yip.” There’s so much verisimilitude that even the piles of merchandise for sale are made to look like they were made in a galaxy far, far away. If you’re a S*tar Wars* fan of any age, it sounds just about perfect.

It’s the “just about” part that’s killing me.

Imagine the most delicious cake in the world, a birthday cake that you’ve been anticipating for weeks. As you’re just about to shovel that first perfect bite into your mouth, you see it — a single fly inside, having flown into the batter at some point. You could easily eat around it, and scarf down the other fly-free 98% of this incredible cake… but you’re not going to do that. The cake has been tainted.
> # If you’re a S*tar Wars* fan of any age, it sounds just about perfect.

This is my worry about Galaxy’s Edge — that it’s so nearly flawless that the few inevitable flaws will drive me absolutely crazy.

Criticizing anything *Star Wars*-adjacent is a slippery slope, so let me clarify immediately that my issues aren’t because Disney failed to design this amusement park with the sole intent of pleasing bitchy, 40-year-old nerds. These are issues that I think many parkgoers — kids and adults, fans and non-fans — will find problematic, and they need to be addressed.

The biggest one is this: I think Galaxy’s Edge might be too *Star Wars*-y.

This is killing me, because I am so, so excited at the idea of visiting an entire amusement park that looks like a giant *Star Wars* film set. But I am utterly unexcited at the prospect of going to one of the park’s restaurants to tell another human being that “I’ll have the Smoked Kaadu Ribs, please.” I am already embarrassed about this encounter, because Galaxy’s Edge isn’t just a park, it’s a performance. Here’s how my buddy, io9’s Germain Lussier, [described it](&lt;|url|&gt;):

All the Disneyland cast members are truly that: cast members. They’re in character as citizens of the remote planet of Batuu rather than Disneyland park employees. They greet you with “Bright Suns!” during the day or “Rising Moons!” in the evening. They may ask you to complete tasks on the sly or help you hide from the First Order if a few Stormtroopers are walking down the street.

Galaxy’s Edge is essentially a giant, live-action role-playing session (a.k.a. LARP) that forces you to take part in it, whether you want to or not. I imagine this is a wonderful experience for kids who don’t have to pretend they’re in a *Star Wars* movie because everyone and everything else is pretending for them. It’s everything I would have wanted 30-plus years ago. Now it sounds like hell, and I believe that’s true for most adults, fans included. There’s something so mortifying about human beings forced by company policy to play make-believe with you, whether you want to or not.

Even if that sort of stuff doesn’t make your skin crawl, forcing employees to speak solely in *Star Wars* jargon makes the park experience worse on a practical level, too. Want to go to the bathroom? Well, all the signs are in the *Star Wars’* made-up language, [Aurebesh](&lt;|url|&gt;). Also, “bathroom” is not a word in the *Star Wars* universe, so what you actually need to find is the “[refresher](&lt;|url|&gt;).” Here’s a tip, courtesy of another pal, Zac Bertschy: If someone asks for an “additional credential” they want to see your driver’s license. Remember it well, because they always have to stay in character — meaning they have to keep asking for that “additional credential” until you figure it out.

This is bananas, and again, it’s mandatory. Hopefully by the time I go, Disney will have started issuing wristbands for people who prefer to be talked to like a normal human being, and like to talk to other human beings in the same way. Then I’ll be able to concentrate on being simultaneously ecstatic and miserable about Galaxy Edge’s (current) main attraction, Millennium Falcon: Smuggler’s Run.

Smuggler’s Run lets people ride in the Millennium Falcon, which is the only true thing I’ve ever wanted in this nightmare called reality. To be inside the most iconic spaceship in pop culture… I honestly don’t have words to convey what an experience this will be for me. When I get inside, I suspect I’ll tear up — at the least.
> # This is my worry about Galaxy’s Edge — that it’s so nearly flawless that the few inevitable flaws will drive me absolutely crazy.

But those will be happy tears. When the ride begins is when the trouble starts. Smuggler’s Run operates like this: Six people enter the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon and go on a “mission,” which is really just a video game. (Which is perfectly fine. You’re still in the actual Falcon!). Two people are pilots, two are gunners, and the last two are engineers, who control the spaceship’s shields. If you don’t see the issue here, let me spell it out: You are going to wait in line for four hours to get inside the Millennium Falcon and you have a five-in-six chance of not sitting in the pilot seat. In fact, there’s a one-in-three chance you’ll be stuck in the back seat and forced to fiddle with some knobs! That’s cruel.

It gets worse. Like too much of Galaxy’s Edge, Smuggler’s Run is a performance. Your mission changes based on how the pilots fly, the gunners shoot, and the engineers, uh, shield, meaning your ride is affected by five random people who may or may not be good at video games. If you’re trying to fly the Falcon between asteroids and someone’s so disappointed they’re stuck being an engineer that they don’t do their job, the other five riders are out of luck. Basically, a lot has to go right to have the best Smuggler’s Run experience, and the odds are not in your favor. (Insert Han Solo “Never tell me the odds!” joke here.)

Personally, I know whenever I get in there, no matter what job I have, I’ll be petrified that I will blow it and ruin things for the other riders. Guys, I don’t want the joyous experience of being in the Millennium Falcon to be accompanied by feelings of failure and crushing guilt.

That’s my problem, really, in a nutshell — that I will be in this amazing world I could scarcely have dreamed of a kid, and simultaneously be awed, overjoyed, and somehow miserable at the same time. The obvious solution is to not go to Galaxy’s Edge, which as advice goes is about as good as telling a fish “Well, if you don’t want to get caught, stay out of the water.” I’m a *Star Wars* nerd. I’m going, eventually. There’s simply no other option. And I’ll have to find a way to cope, one way or another.

So if you happen to wander into the Black Spire outpost sometime this fall, take a look in Oga’s Cantina. There, you might find a wide-eyed man, downing Jedi Mind Trick after Jedi Mind Trick (a cocktail of Earth vodka and grapefruit juice, among other things), looking like he’s in the middle of a nerdy mental breakdown. If you do, feel free to stop by and say hi — just don’t say “Bright suns!” And definitely don’t let him in the Millennium Falcon.<|endoftext|>

# Will Banning E-Cigarettes Help Public Health — or Harm It?

## Will Banning E-Cigarettes Help Public Health—or Harm It?

### As San Francisco cracks down on electronic cigarettes, experts are divided on the effects

Last month, in a controversial move, San Francisco became the first major city in the United States to ban the sale and distribution of electronic cigarettes. Some experts claim that e-cigs are healthier alternatives to conventional cigarettes and can help smokers quit. Others, though, say the proliferation of e-cigarettes is ensnaring a young generation — who likely wouldn’t have started smoking otherwise — in the grips of nicotine addiction.

It’s a classic public health conundrum: How should the medical community and legislators advise patients and protect the public when there’s mixed evidence on the potential harms of a given product? This is the central dilemma facing doctors, politicians, and parents as they struggle to contend with the relatively recent introduction of e-cigs.

San Francisco’s ban encompasses all sales within the city, including online sales, and lasts until the Food and Drug Administration introduces standards on e-cigs, which won’t occur until [2021](&lt;|url|&gt;) at the earliest. The law doesn’t explicitly prohibit e-cigarette use, nor does it make any adjustments to the current law around conventional cigarette sales, which remain available — with [some restrictions](&lt;|url|&gt;) — to buyers over the age of 21, and which kill almost [half a million](&lt;|url|&gt;) Americans a year.

“E-cigarettes have been targeting our young people with their colors and flavors that entice adolescents and predatorily pull them towards addiction to nicotine,” said city supervisor Shamann Walton [in a statement](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Companies like [e-cig manufacturer] Juul are contributing to increased numbers of people addicted to nicotine — people who would have never picked up a cigarette.”

Walton isn’t wrong: E-cigarette use among young people is so high that the surgeon general has labeled it an “[epidemic](&lt;|url|&gt;).” According to a CDC report, [between 2017 and 2018](&lt;|url|&gt;), e-cigarette use among high school students skyrocketed 78%, and now nearly a quarter of high schoolers say they currently use the products. For middle schoolers, that number jumped 49%, meaning that approximately 5% of kids in junior high now report using e-cigarettes. CDC researchers say that these enormous gains are responsible for “erasing the decline in tobacco product use among youths that occurred in previous years.”

E-cigarette use among kids comes with a whole host of problems. Chief among them is the evidence suggesting that e-cigarette use actually compels kids to start smoking combustible cigarettes. Worse, the resulting smoking habit is expected to be [more intense and frequent](&lt;|url|&gt;) than it would have been had the kid not started with e-cigarettes first; [a JAMA investigation](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that young people whose first tobacco products were e-cigarettes were more likely, two years later, to be smoking combustible cigarettes than if they’d used other nicotine products, such as chewing tobacco or hookah, or abstained from e-cigarettes entirely. And nicotine, whose levels vary widely and unpredictably depending on the e-cigarette brand, is especially harmful to kids’ brains, according to the CDC report. (Juul, the bestselling brand of e-cigarettes, contains about [20 cigarettes’ worth](&lt;|url|&gt;) of nicotine in a single pod; users typically go through a single pod in a day or two, according to [Vaping360.com](&lt;|url|&gt;).)

[An editorial](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the *New England Journal of Medicine* pointed out an additional hazard of nicotine addiction: further drug addiction. “Even if these adolescents do not switch to regular cigarettes, creation of a large cohort of nicotine-addicted adults has consequences beyond the adverse physiological effects of nicotine,” the authors write. “Since nicotine is a gateway drug that lowers the threshold for addiction to other agents, the use of e-cigarettes could help spawn even more opioid addiction.”

Then there are the short-term risks of nicotine and vaping that are reasonably well documented in the scientific literature. [A 2018 report](&lt;|url|&gt;) on e-cigarettes from the National Academy of Sciences states that chemicals typically found in e-cigarette aerosols, such as formaldehyde, are capable of damaging DNA, which could eventually result in cancer. It also states that there’s substantial evidence that e-cig aerosols can cause acute [endothelial cell dysfunction](&lt;|url|&gt;), which is when the inner lining of the arteries stops functioning correctly.

And [nicotine itself](&lt;|url|&gt;) can cause decreased immune response and other problems with the heart and lungs. “Nicotine products are associated with cardiovascular disease in both adults and adolescents,” says Richard Harvey, an associate professor of health education at San Francisco State University whose research has focused on tobacco cessation. “Because cardiovascular disease is among the leading causes of death across almost all age groups, reducing exposures to agents known to be associated with disease is a public health interest.”

Despite these many significant issues, e-cigarettes don’t appear — in the short term, at least — to be as harmful as traditional combustible cigarettes. And remember: Those combustible cigarettes are still on shelves in San Francisco while e-cigarettes are banned. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has not publicly addressed this apparent contradiction, and didn’t respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, the National Academy of Sciences [reports that](&lt;|url|&gt;) with the exception of nicotine, users of e-cigarettes are exposed to a lower amount of toxins than from combustible cigarettes, and that overall, the [known risk of e-cigarettes](&lt;|url|&gt;) is lower than their smoking cousins.
> # Is it better to make something illegal if it shows signs, but no long-term proof, of being unhealthy for users?

There are also potential public health benefits. Research has suggested e-cigs might be a useful way to help people stop smoking. A [2019 randomized trial](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that e-cigarettes were more successful than other forms of nicotine replacement therapy. [A 2017 meta-analysis](&lt;|url|&gt;), however, showed the opposite, indicating that it’s too early to say for sure whether e-cigarettes are a great option to help people quit.

“I do understand that there are some individual folks out there who have done well with the e-cigarette. And I don’t want to take that away from folks,” says Frank Leone, the director of the Comprehensive Smoking Treatment Program at the University of Pennsylvania. But “folks who are interested in getting their tobacco dependence under control really, really, really, really have excellent and safe options out there that are very easy to use, that are paid for by somebody else, and that are reliable.”

Vaping advocates, and many scientists, nevertheless tout e-cigarettes’ use as cessation aids as one of the main reasons why the products should be legal for adults. In an [opinion piece](&lt;|url|&gt;), the *Los Angeles Times* editorial board stated that “some longtime smokers have been able to quit that deadly habit by switching to vaping.” Juul claims in its mission statement that its founders started the brand “with the goal of improving the lives of the world’s one billion adult smokers by eliminating cigarettes,” though it stops short of calling itself a cessation aid.

Is it better to make something illegal if it shows signs, but no long-term proof, of being unhealthy for users? Should regulators wait for longitudinal studies that show a stronger link between, for example, cancer and e-cigarette use before outlawing them? Do the potential short-term benefits and reduced risk of e-cigarette use make the potential long-term harms worth risking?

So far, San Francisco is the only city to wade into these murky waters with an outright ban. Some tobacco researchers support it, while plenty of others wholeheartedly disagree.

Leone points out that while the vaping industry makes a lot of claims about the safety and even lifesaving properties of its products, they don’t line up with the epidemiological evidence we have so far. “People in positions of authority feel like there’s a race to get these products on the market as soon as possible to create a large sort of consumer base of young people, who will then turn out to be prolonged customers, if not lifelong customers,” he says. “The notion that the companies don’t have anything to do with that, that these companies are trying very hard not to get kids addicted — I don’t believe that at all, not even for a little.” He says he thinks the ban, however temporary, will ultimately be successful at decreasing e-cigarette use, and that any black market sales that will spring up in the wake of the ban won’t make up for that decrease.

In an emailed statement, Juul said that it’s supporting efforts “to enact strict new regulation and enforcement instead of a ban for all adults that will fuel a black market for vapor products and the increased use of deadly cigarettes.” The spokesperson included links to other articles critical of the ban, including editorials from the [*Los Angeles Times](&lt;|url|&gt;) *and the [*San Francisco Chronicle](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

It’s too early to say where San Francisco’s progressive zeal on this issue will fall in the grander scheme of public health history. Young lives may be saved, wrenched from the grasping arms of a new industry whose main concern is, of course, growing its customer base — but at what cost? The cost of perhaps driving people to smoke undoubtedly lethal combustible cigarettes? Of taking away a potentially successful smoking cessation method?

The ultimate answer will be found in research — research that might take decades. But public health and policy work on very different timescales, as San Franciscans are about to learn.<|endoftext|>

# The Trump Administration Is Trying to Outlaw Union Organizing Over Company Email

## A Republican-dominated agency argues that allowing organizers to use company email is impinging on companies’ First Amendment rights

![Donald Trump speaks to a crowd gathered at the Local 18 Richfield Facility of the Operating Engineers Apprentice and Training, a union and apprentice training center on March 29, 2018 in Richfield, Ohio.

David Galvan’s job is typically either hard, or very hard. As the lone full-time organizer for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 304 — the largest electrical workers’ union in Kansas — he is tasked with starting new unions in industries ranging from rural gas service to power line construction, and building support when it’s time for renegotiating a contract for the roughly 2,500 workers he represents. He needs to be able to talk to union members, meet the new guys, and convince everyone that a union is worth fighting for.

But he’s often faced with a problem: reaching workers. Sometimes, he doesn’t even know where they are. The workers Galvan represents are scattered around the state of Kansas, with many in isolated, rural towns. Some work out of their trucks, traveling a hundred miles from one day to the next.

Fortunately, most of these workers have company email addresses, which Galvan can use for coordinating union activities. He says email has become an indispensable method for maintaining steady communication with his members and reaching out to new employees.

But now the Trump administration is threatening to set back Galvan’s work by passing rules that would prevent workers from contacting union organizers and discussing working conditions over company email. Trump’s labor officials may also extend this to restrict other electronic communication, like texts and social media posts, made on company-owned equipment.
> # “Email is the predominant means of employee-to-employee communication.”

By law, most private-sector employees have the right to organize, though precisely how workers are allowed to organize has evolved over time. In a 2014 case called [Purple Communications](&lt;|url|&gt;), the National Labor Review Board (NLRB), the judicial body tasked with deciding how employees can and can’t go about organizing unions, concluded that employees of Purple Communications — which provides telecommunications to deaf and hard-of-hearing people — had the right to discuss their grievances over company email.

At the time, the NLRB concluded that unions have long had the right to communicate during downtime and lunch breaks, and that email was an extension of those communications in cyberspace. “In offices that rely exclusively or heavily on telework,” the Board wrote in its majority decision, “it seems likely that email is the predominant means of employee-to-employee communication.”

Thanks to that 2014 ruling, companies that offer their employees email accounts must also let them discuss union-related activity online. According to Galvan, this decision was a boon to his Kansas union; he estimates that union density for the home-based workers he represents (that is the percentage of workers belonging to the union at any given company) soon doubled from roughly 10% to over 20, drastically increasing the union’s negotiating power.

“Purple Communications secured longstanding employee rights to organize and discuss unions in the context of modern workplaces, when jobs increasingly lack a shared physical space for employees to organize any other way,” Sarah Lonardo, a spokesperson for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) — which represents employees in industries ranging from healthcare to local government to janitorial work — told *OneZero*. She explained that many of SEIU’s two million members “work separately across a large geographic area and rely on email to communicate. These employees have no other way to find each other but through work email.”

In 2017 and 2018, Trump appointed three new Board members to the NLRB, which now has a 3–1 Republican majority. Last August, after the Caesars hotel chain appealed a lower court decision enforcing employees’ right to organize over email, the Board decided it would just relitigate the Purple Communications case. The two Democratic Board members at the time — both of whom were involved in the Purple Communications decision — wrote dissents, arguing it was improper to even consider overturning those rights. “I do not support giving a golfer a mulligan simply because he or she wants to swing another club,” Board member Mark Pearce wrote. “Nothing has changed since the issuance of Purple… The only thing new is the Board’s composition.”

In September 2018, five senators, including the Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand, wrote a letter to the Board, arguing that one of Trump’s appointees, William Emmanuel, should recuse himself from the case. Emmanuel’s old law firm represents Purple Communications, the very business that lost the case that guaranteed organizing workers access to email. Emmanuel, wrote the senators, is “in the position of using the power of his office to influence the interests of his former employer,” a “clear violation” of federal ethics laws.

The Caesars hotel case is still under review, and it can take the Board years to issue rulings. Meanwhile, the Trump-appointed NLRB general counsel — the Board’s top legal advisor — recommended that the organization go ahead and abolish the right to use company email for organizing, as well as ban organizing over any other form of electronic communication over company property. Since company email is the employer’s property, he argued, forcing the company to let workers discuss their problems online violates the company’s First Amendment rights.
> # “Taking that away would be a crushing blow for us.”

It’s widely expected that the Board will side with their general counsel, though it’s unclear when a decision will come down. Whenever the ruling is made, unions will likely immediately lose their right to use email. “There’s writing on the wall,” says Martin Malin, a professor of labor law at the Chicago-Kent School of Law. Malin says it’s impossible to say when the decision will be finalized, but the last Democratic Board member’s term expires in December and there’s typically “a flood of decisions” before someone leaves the Board. “Everyone assumes that the Trump-appointed Board is going to flip it back.”

Galvan is frustrated by the lack of public outcry around the proposed change. “I believe email is kind of seen as a white-collar, office worker type of thing, but it’s really not,” he says. “Taking that away would be a crushing blow for us.” He says a return to pre-internet organizing is not even an option. “You got a guy who’s on the road for six or 12 hours a day — he doesn’t communicate except over company email,” Galvan explains. “The trucks don’t have radios anymore.”

Workers in dozens of industries, from nursing to used-car sales, have formally voiced similar complaints to the Board, describing how technology has changed the structure of their workplace, making older forms of union communication less viable. “Many of our members work remotely from one another and depend on email to communicate,” representatives of the Service Employees International Union [wrote to](&lt;|url|&gt;) the Board last October.

“The Board should not attempt to turn back time.”<|endoftext|>

# Facebook Is Inviting Washington to Regulate Libra — Good Luck With That

## Is it a bank? Is it anonymous? Is it an investment? The questions are unending

![Head of Facebook’s Calibra David Marcus testifies during a hearing before Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on July 16, 2019.

Last week, Facebook faced a grilling before both the House and Senate over its Libra cryptocurrency project. The committees did [not seem to be fans](&lt;|url|&gt;) of Facebook’s plans to create a global currency. Some of their concerns were due to [a general distrust of Facebook](&lt;|url|&gt;), but also because it’s hard even for members of Congress to understand what Libra is.

That might be an obstacle to crafting the regulation that Facebook is inviting.

In the company’s [opening statements](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Facebook promised that it would not offer the Libra cryptocurrency until “we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.” In a rare twist, Facebook is inviting regulation before it launches a product, rather than after, as if it were aiming to both move slow and* *not break stuff.

The hearings, though, showed why that may be difficult for the regulators. If there was one guiding theme for the House committee hearing — aside from a general disdain of Facebook over its myriad past privacy failures — it was confusion over what, exactly, Libra is and how it fits into Facebook’s world. A few examples:

Representative Bill Huizenga (R-MI) asked, regarding Libra, “Is it a security, is it an exchange-traded product? What exactly is this? Is it fish or fowl? And it seems that it’s more of a platypus to me.”

Representative Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) said, “What we’re struggling with is, what are you?” before moving on to compare Facebook’s Libra wallet, Calibra, to money changers [from the Bible](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Representative Joyce Beatty (D-OH) said, “This is very complicated. We have some of the best minds here on both sides, and clearly there’s a lot of unanswered questions.”
> # Put simply, cryptocurrencies are notoriously difficult to understand, both from a technical perspective and a financial one.

Unlike what happened during Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s notorious appearance before Congress last year, the confusion wasn’t due to tech illiteracy — multiple members of the House committee asked highly technical questions regarding programming languages, [GitHub commits](&lt;|url|&gt;), and cryptography. Rather, the topic itself was incredibly complex. Put simply, cryptocurrencies are notoriously difficult to understand, both from a technical perspective and a financial one. That presents a challenge for regulators.

A key point of contention was whether Libra, the cryptocurrency managed by the Libra Association, or Calibra, the digital wallet app Facebook would build on top of it, qualify as a bank. One of Facebook’s main arguments is that Libra [will help the nearly 2 billion adults around the world who lack bank accounts](&lt;|url|&gt;). However, the company simultaneously argues that Libra is not designed to compete with bank accounts. That distinction would have a profound impact on which regulations Facebook or the Libra Association that would run it would fall under.

By not being classified as a bank, Facebook is able to avoid some of the rules that other banks have to follow. For example, in the United States, all banks are required to follow [Know Your Customer (or KYC) regulations](&lt;|url|&gt;), which means they have to be able to identify anyone they do business with, in order to help crack down on illegal activity. According to Jay Zagorsky, senior lecturer at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business, “Right now, Facebook does not have to follow those regulations.”

Facebook representative David Marcus attempted to assuage worries that Libra would be used for illegal activity by saying that Libra wallets would still follow KYC guidelines. However, as Representative Bill Foster (D-IL) pointed out, that kind of assurance isn’t so straightforward. A bank would be able to confirm the identity of anyone who signs up for an account, but Facebook only manages its own Calibra wallet app, which lets users buy, transfer, and sell the currency. The Libra currency itself can still be held anonymously, and other companies can create their own versions of Libra wallets that use the currency, with different features and policies.

When trying to determine whether Libra could be traded anonymously, the answer Foster got was complicated. Marcus explained that there are “on-ramps and off-ramps” for the Libra ecosystem, all of which use KYC polices. Foster asked if it would be possible for a wallet to exist in “some set of islands” that illicit transactions could run through. Marcus gave a slight dodge of the question, simply pointing out that if you’re a U.S. resident, you’d be required to use wallets that are properly regulated by U.S. law.

There are other nuances that aren’t always easy to work out. For example, Facebook insists that, unlike Bitcoin — which has [fluctuated wildly in value](&lt;|url|&gt;) — Libra won’t behave as an investment. Its value won’t change based on the whims of the market. Since it is [backed](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the U.S. dollar and other currencies, Libra’s value should stay the same, relative to those other currencies.

But Zagorsky says it’s more complicated than that. In some parts of the world like Europe and Japan, government banks have experimented [with paying negative interest](&lt;|url|&gt;). This means that if, for example, you leave $100 in an account with -1% interest, at the end of the year, you’ll have $99. The goal is to incentivize private banks, companies, or individuals to spend or invest money, rather than leave it stored.

“If Libra comes out and says we’ll give you $1 and I guarantee you it’s going to be worth $1 a year from now, that is actually a better investment than leaving it in your checking account, which is being docked 1% a year,” explains Zagorsky. In other words, even if Facebook or the Libra Association don’t intend for the currency to be investments, they can still function as one.

Perhaps the most confusing thing about Libra, though, is who’s in charge. Facebook maintains that it’s only going to be responsible for the digital wallet Calibra, but the Libra currency itself will be managed by an independent association. Yet it’s Facebook that’s present at the hearings and it’s Facebook that’s in every headline. For good or ill, Facebook’s name is the one attached to this thing.

“I think in very confusing situations, people try and tell themselves a simple story,” says Zagorsky. “The story I believe people are going to tell themselves, no matter how many people are part of the Libra Association, is that Libra is backed by Facebook.”

Of course, there’s nothing “simple” about any of this. There’s no precedent for lawmakers to draw on, yet they must make decisions now that will shape the future of the global monetary system.

No pressure.<|endoftext|>

# A Farewell to ‘Gotham,’ Which Defied Everything Superhero Entertainment Is Supposed to Be

## A Farewell to ‘Gotham,’ Which Defied Everything Superhero Entertainment Is Supposed to Be

### *Most comic book shows cater to hardcore fans. But ‘Gotham’ went its own way.*

![Credit: Fox/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Fox/Getty Images*

A major cornerstone of superhero entertainment ended this week — and no, it wasn’t the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With the finale of *Gotham*, we lose a wild TV show that knew how to make comic book material weird as hell. While its contemporaries try to honor their source material to please hardcore nerds, *Gotham* made the bold decision to not give a damn about what longtime Batman fans wanted. The result was a show that was divisive, frequently baffling, crazy as the Joker — and very, very entertaining.

That’s not how it started, though.* Gotham* was created to be something more like a crime procedural than an action series where costumed heroes and villains square off with all the power of that week’s visual effects budget. It primarily focused on new Gotham City cop Jim Gordon — the future Commissioner Gordon — and nascent crimelord-to-be Oswald “Penguin” Cobblepot, with frequent check-ins on a school-age Bruce Wayne as he grappled with his parents’ murder.

As someone who [recapped the show from the beginning](&lt;|url|&gt;), I can attest that this was a tremendously boring premise. The Gotham City Police Department mainly fought generic mobsters, and occasionally there’d be a cameo by someone the viewer would recognize as a major character in Batman’s future. It turns out that watching 13-year-olds incrementally become superheroes and villains is a hell of a lot less interesting than, you know, actually watching superheroes fight villains. Go figure!

*Gotham* couldn’t break Batman’s long-established comic book canon, so it could only allude to all the major characters, stories, and relationships that would be established after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. It was hamstrung by its own premise, because hardcore Bat-fans would never accept it otherwise.

But *Gotham* eventually made the bold decision to stop caring about decades of established comics that continuity demanded or what nerds wanted, all while other superhero entertainment, from *Daredevil *to *Dawn of Justice*, was working so hard to satiate them.

Once season two began, the show started doing whatever it wanted. *Gotham* began to introduce Batman characters as quickly as possible, especially the villains. Their origins were rescheduled, repurposed, or outright jettisoned. Bruce Wayne’s traditional training to become the world’s greatest fighter and detective was mostly dropped so he could hang around the city and wonder whether Selina, the future Catwoman, was his girlfriend or not. Any important figure in the comics lore could get killed, become good or evil, or end up doing wildly uncharacteristic nonsense just to stay on screen. (Brilliant Wayne Enterprises scientist and future Batman techmaker Lucius Fox once inexplicably spent a season as the GCPD medical examiner, for instance.)

Unlike virtually all of its contemporaries, *Gotham* also decided that it was no longer interested in that veneer of “real life” that modern superhero entertainment aims for. Instead, the show embraced the zaniness that lurks in the corners of the comics, behind the long-established ideal of Batman as the grim, obsessed, and practically invincible Dark Knight. I knew the show was changing once a centuries-old cult somehow based entirely around hating the Wayne family arrived in town.

Other standout material:

* The Penguin, through the use of “crime licenses,” managed to bring crime in Gotham City to historic lows. The heroic Jim Gordon became so pissed about people losing faith in the police that [he teamed up with the mafia](&lt;|url|&gt;) to end the Penguin’s reign of peace and safety.

* The show introduced Jerome, a kid who had the Joker’s smile and laugh. Over the next few seasons, Jerome got the green hair and pasty complexion and eventually discovered a penchant for purple outfits and poison gas that made people laugh themselves to death. He was literally the Joker in all but name, but then Gordon killed him. Then they revealed Jerome’s twin brother, who also turned into a Joker simulacrum.

* *Gotham* brought in veteran musical actor Michael Cerveris to play the incredibly disturbing villain Professor Pyg and then gave him [his own musical number](&lt;|url|&gt;) — during which he forced Gotham City’s rich and famous to eat homeless people.

* Some lunatic cut off dead Jerome’s face and wore it in a ridiculous attempt to be the pre-Joker. When Jerome woke up, he stapled his skin back on, allowing for a scene late in season three when [*Gordon literally punched his face off](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

* Finally, the Penguin fell in love with the Riddler, a wholly original development that came complete with [a genuinely romantic scene](&lt;|url|&gt;) that looked for all the world like it was leading to a kiss between the two murderous villains. Alas, the bad guys didn’t lock lips — the Riddler only loved Penguin as a friend — but that didn’t make Batman fandom go any [less bananas](&lt;|url|&gt;).

I remember very distinctly watching the mouths of these two supervillains get closer and closer, my jaw literally open in total disbelief at how willing the show was to revise established Batman canon. When so many other comic book adaptations have shied away from openly depicting characters as LGBTQ ([*Black Panther](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and [*Wonder Woman](&lt;|url|&gt;)* among them), *Gotham* made the Penguin’s homosexuality a visceral revelation, even though it was unspoken and unrequited. That’s fantastic. I only wish DC Comics had the bravery to incorporate this into the comics universe.

And though *Gotham* featured constant and often incredibly graphic violence — a child’s throat was visibly slit, despite the show airing around dinnertime — it also gleefully embraced the campy vibe of the 1966 *Batman* TV show from time to time. It had range!

And while some Bat-nerds might consider any Adam West homage to be the gravest insult possible, I think it’s one of *Gotham*’s strengths. In its weird way, *Gotham* managed to celebrate Batman without ever really showing the character himself. There was something massively compelling about watching a comic book adaptation where, for the first time in goodness knows how long, viewers had absolutely no clue what was going to happen.

But that’s not what most hardcore fans want. They want what they know and love, rendered as faithfully as possible to the original scripture. [*Gotham*’s ratings steadily declined](&lt;|url|&gt;) over its five seasons. Was this because it stopped kowtowing to the fans that most nerd entertainment tries so hard to reach and please? Was it just the increasingly bloated market of superhero shows? Only the world’s greatest detective could find out, but alas, *Gotham*’s young Bruce Wayne was never the sharpest batarang in the utility belt.

That’s fine by me. I’d never before seen a Bruce Wayne who had no interest in bats, a Jim Gordon whose moral code shifted randomly each episode, and two — two! — Joker wannabes. And now that the show is over, I’ll never get to see them again. In all honesty, *Gotham* was almost certainly the least accurate Batman origin story ever told. But that never once stopped it from being entertaining as hell. Your move, Marvel.<|endoftext|>

# Marvel’s Spider-Man Has an Iron Man Problem

## Marvel’s Spider-Man Has an Iron Man Problem

### Spider-Man may take center stage for now, but someone’s going to need to put on that armor eventually

![© Marvel Studios](<|image|>)*© Marvel Studios*

*(This post contains spoilers for Avengers: Endgame, but come on.)*

*Avengers: Endgame* may end up as the highest-grossing movie of all time — [it’s very close to edging out *Avatar](&lt;|url|&gt;)* — but it hasn’t earned all that money without a cost. It marked the end of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, and now the Marvel Cinematic Universe has a Robert Downey Jr.-shaped hole that needs to be filled. In *Spider-Man: Far From Home*, Tom Holland’s Peter Parker is clearly being groomed for the position. Here’s why that won’t work.

Although *Endgame* was the conclusion to Marvel Studios’ first 11 years of cinematic storytelling, it turns out that *Far From Home* isn’t as much the beginning of something new as it is an epilogue to Robert Downey Jr.’s reign as Tony Stark. While the world mourns the loss of its biggest hero, Peter mourns the loss of his mentor. That is, until Stark’s right-hand man Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) arrives to give Peter the metaphorical key to Tony Stark’s kingdom of enhanced technology, i.e. Iron Man’s A.I.-enhanced sunglasses. In *Far From Home*, Peter is predictably wishy-washy about stepping into Tony’s shoes at first, but realizes with great power comes great responsibility (as Spider-Men are wont to do) and if Iron Man thought he was good enough, then Peter should indeed step up.

While Stark posthumously asks Peter to be his replacement, *Far From Home* is equally about Marvel Studios trying to position Spider-Man as its new Iron Man, and Tom Holland as the new heart and soul of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is the problem. Spider-Man may have Iron Man’s tech skills, but as affably, dorkily charming as Holland is as Peter Parker, he can’t come close to the titanic swagger RDJ brought to Tony Stark, around which the juggernaut that is the MCU coalesced. For instance, it’s very difficult to imagine Holland’s Peter Parker leading the Avengers anytime soon (whomever ends up on the new roster). Given Spider-Man’s worldwide popularity as a character, putting Spider-Man at the center of Phase Four or Chapter Two or whatever they’re calling their next decade-plus of movies is definitely a smart move, but the hero’s going to have to do a great deal of growing to anchor the multi-mega-movie franchise.

At any rate, there’s one more question that remains: Who will be the next Iron Man? Because someone is going to put on that armor eventually.

I don’t mean which fictional character will don the iconic red-and-gold armor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, although that’s certainly an option. Like *Captain America*, *Iron Man* is its own franchise whose individual movies earned billions of dollars. Robert Downey Jr. may be gone, but the intellectual property is quite alive, and while Marvel Studios may be content to shelve the character for a while, surely no one actually believes that there’s never going to be another *Iron Man* movie. That would be absurd.

That said, Marvel seems to have deliberately avoided every sensible way to continue the franchise. The easiest thing in the world would have been to put an existing, in-universe character in the armor/title role. There’s been a long precedent in the comics of other characters moonlighting as superheroes, including Iron Man. James “Rhodey” Rhodes, who normally runs around in the Stark-made War Machine armor suit, filled Iron Man’s metallic shoes in the comics many times. Presumably Don Cheadle’s Rhodey would be interested in doing the same for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but no plans have been announced. (Likewise, both the Falcon and Winter Soldier have been Captain America for a bit, but the MCU versions have been relegated to [costarring in a TV series](&lt;|url|&gt;) coming to the Disney+ streaming service.)

An even easier solution would have been to simply recast the role of Tony Stark. It may sound like blasphemy, but hear me out: As iconic as RDJ’s performance was, if you accept the fact that Marvel will make another *Iron Man* movie in your lifetime, you need to also accept the fact that Robert Downey Jr. is not going to reprise the role. It will need to be recast eventually, so why not let Tony Stark survive *Endgame*, hire a new actor, and keep making very lucrative *Iron Man* movies? It’s worked just fine for James Bond, now preparing to star in his 25th movie.

Besides, even if another in-universe character like Rhodey had taken the name and armor, eventually Don Cheadle would want to retire and Marvel would find itself in the exact same position as it is now.

Unless Marvel continuously kills off and replaces Iron Man with a new character — first Rhodey, perhaps, then Peter Parker, or who knows — it may have to take a cue from the original comics and reboot its entire Cinematic Universe.

Like the inevitability of future *Iron Man* movies, we should all admit to ourselves that yes, one day the MCU will be reset. Maybe it’ll be because superhero movies go out of fashion for a while, and Marvel decides to try to bring them back, although that seems unlikely. It makes more sense that the increasing history and lore of the MCU — everything audiences need to know and remember to enjoy these films to their utmost — will become so long and unwieldy that Marvel decides to clean the slate to make their movies accessible for new audiences, much like when Marvel Comics reboots a comic title and resets the issues to #1.

However, the inevitable problem with this is that while a refreshed version may attract new fans, it also stands the chance of losing old ones who had invested all that time learning the history and lore of the first universe, only to see it wiped out. Marvel Studios is going to fall into the exact same trap Marvel Comics faced many times over the years, trying to balance the strengths and weaknesses of long-term, serialized storytelling.

In a way, killing off Tony Stark is probably the smartest thing Marvel could have done. Since these movies began with him, his death is a natural end, and provides as solid an ending as possible for the past decade of storytelling. It closes the curtains on all the events that made up the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe thus far, relegating them to history. And while Stark’s life and death helps set Peter Parker on his path in *Far From Home*, that path will now lead through all the other future *Spider-Man* movies that are presumably on the way, and no one will need to remember everything that happened in the previous 20+ movies to understand what’s happening. Those who do will simply have a deeper enjoyment.

In fact, I’d go so far as to say killing Tony Stark is the perfect solution… as long as Marvel never makes another Tony Stark movie. Of course, that’s simply not a realistic option; people will want more *Iron Man* movies (if they don’t already), and Marvel Studios will want to make more billions than it already has. The question isn’t if, it’s when, and how, and who. Because it sure as hell ain’t Spider-Man.<|endoftext|>

# Is Social Media the New Smoking?

## We can no longer deny the significant dark side of social media

![Credit: NicolasMcComber/E+/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: NicolasMcComber/E+/Getty*

The horrific events in New Zealand on March 15 have once again put social media, and Facebook in particular, under intense (and deserved) scrutiny. The mass shooter who killed 50 people was trying not only to inflict death and injury to as many as possible, but to achieve notoriety via social media by streaming the sickening rampage online. [In a powerful piece](&lt;|url|&gt;) in *The Register*, Kieren McCarthy suggested we — the users — have created a monster in social media, through avarice and a lack of moral compass.

Any suggestion that social media companies should be policed, restricted, or otherwise made to abide by established norms and legal rules inevitably attracts a deluge of trolling — but what happens when the good that social media certainly provides is increasingly outweighed by the harm it causes? This surely deserves more considered debate, and I would argue, some sort of action. Banning social media is not a feasible solution, self-regulation has failed, and while government regulation is a popular proposition supported by a number of politicians, actually making it work may be harder to achieve. So what is the answer? Perhaps looking at another industry could provide some ideas.

Smoking is a habit which many find pleasurable. It helps ease social interaction and provides important breaks and opportunities to relax and unwind. It is of course also highly addictive, damaging to your health and those around you, and exacts a huge cost on society. Governments around the world have acted to limit the harm from tobacco — and those efforts have been effective. In the U.K. in 1948, [approximately 4 out of 5 men smoked some form of tobacco](&lt;|url|&gt;). Now, the number has fallen to 1 in 5 adults.

![Credit: Cancer Research UK](<|image|>)*Credit: Cancer Research UK*

A combination of public education programs, on-pack warnings, strict enforcement of age limits for purchase, and bans on where people can smoke have proven effective in protecting the health of millions of people. Social pressure from friends and relatives, even disapproving looks from others, acts as a multiplier, increasing the incentive for individuals to try and quit harmful behaviors. Could we see the same combination applied to social media consumption?
> # Governments must consider the option to mitigate the harm to society caused by social media.

Facebook is already losing users [in the U.S.](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [across Europe](&lt;|url|&gt;), potentially, in part, because of scandals over data use and privacy concerns; could the New Zealand atrocity encourage more people to vote with their eyeballs and stop supporting platforms that do too little to prevent such things from spreading online? Perhaps that sounds unlikely, but why shouldn’t governments step in and create public awareness campaigns informing people of the risks of social media, just as they did for smoking? Wide-ranging citizen awareness campaigns — launched in the teeth of opposition from the tobacco lobby — were effective in educating people to make better choices about smoking. Governments must consider the option to mitigate the harm to society caused by social media.

Governments already invest in public awareness campaigns that try to nudge us into behaviors that are better for the health of the individual and society — everything from eating better and getting more exercise to road safety. With clear evidence that social media has a [negative impact on mental health](&lt;|url|&gt;), governments must surely add it to the list of “ills” that they try to manage. We know that providing people with knowledge, awareness, and tips to help them make better decisions does work — so let’s start to talk honestly about social media consumption and help manage the growing mental health crisis.

Imagine social media sites displaying a government warning on the homepage — just as cigarette packs are required to carry graphic illustrations of the damage caused by smoking!
> # It seems clear to me that doing nothing now is no longer an option.

Social media delivers enormous value to millions of people around the world. The ability to stay in touch with friends and family; to find and engage with individuals who share your views; and to learn, organize, and take action on the things that matter to you is a significant benefit to individuals and society at large. But we can no longer deny the significant dark side of social media. It not only provides the means for criminals, hate-mongers, and terrorists to deceive, promulgate evil manifestos, and arrange atrocities, but contributes to the harm the countless “ordinary” people suffer as they are bullied, trolled, or made depressed by interactions on social networks.

The players that dominate the social media landscape have so far paid only lip service to their moral and ethical obligations to try and manage the unintended and negative consequences of their product. They do enough to head off the worst of the PR crisis, but do not address the core issues in any adequate manner. They do not fear regulation as they believe (correctly) that governments have neither the resources nor the will to enforce it. But they might react if their members — and their customers, the advertisers — start to shun them. Mandated warnings on their sites, combined with public awareness campaigns, perhaps funded through taxes on social media companies, might be the way to mitigate some of the damage resulting from social media.

There are always reasons not to take a stand, and challenges to acting in the right way, but it seems clear to me that doing nothing now is no longer an option.<|endoftext|>

# Snapchat’s Gender-Swap and Baby Filters Doubled Downloads of the App

## But can the company build on the momentum?

![Illustration: [Sally Thurer](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Sally Thurer](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Last month, Snapchat achieved the kind of virality most companies can only dream of.

On May 8, Snapchat released a photo filter (a “Lens” in Snapchat parlance) that, by rounding a users’ face and smoothing away their wrinkles, transforms them into a toddler. Over the next two days, Snapchat also debuted a pair of gender-swap lenses, which either gave users a square jaw and stubble to look more stereotypically masculine, or a dolled-up, soft glow to look more feminine.

The lenses unleashed a torrent of content, mostly people showing the world what they’d look like if they flipped genders. Men “joked” about being attracted to the female versions of their bros, while women trolled their boyfriends with their rugged good looks. Many engaged in catfishing “[pranks](&lt;|url|&gt;)” (some of which [backfired spectacularly](&lt;|url|&gt;)) and others professed to [wanting to literally go screw themselves](&lt;|url|&gt;).


The internet usually churns through viral ephemera in a matter of days, if not hours, but the gender-swap filters have had surprising staying power. The filters have ignited discussions about [the mutable nature of gender and attraction](&lt;|url|&gt;), and the [arguably transphobic](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [sexist](&lt;|url|&gt;) manner in which some people have used them.

The filters also seemed to drive a sharp increase in the daily downloads of the Snapchat app across iOS and Android. Snapchat was downloaded across the platforms an estimated 41.5 million times worldwide in May, more than twice the number of downloads from the previous month (16.8 million) and in May of last year (17.6 million), according to third party data.

Prior to the baby and gender-swap filters, Snapchat was being downloaded approximately 600,000 times per day worldwide, according to estimated data provided by Sensor Tower, a mobile app market research firm. Daily downloads doubled after the introduction of the new filters to more than 1 million per day. On three different days in May, the app was downloaded around 2 million times. (It’s unclear how many of these downloads are new users versus people coming back to the platform after abandoning and deleting the app.)

![](<|image|>)

The filters are a much-needed victory for the embattled social media company, which has struggled to retain users over the past several years. (Snapchat declined to comment for this story, saying it couldn’t speak about user growth outside of earnings calls.)

And though the company is experiencing a tepid resurgence — users are holding steady, and revenue and stock price are all up — it remains to be seen whether Snapchat can maintain its momentum.

As recently as 2016, Snapchat was the [fastest-growing social network in the U.S.](&lt;|url|&gt;) and heralded as a viable contender to Facebook. In the intervening years, though, Facebook has used Instagram, the photo-sharing app it acquired in 2012 for $1 billion, to steal Snapchat’s thunder.


Snapchat pioneered the art of photo filters in 2015 with Lenses, only to have Facebook [acquire a little-know facial imaging app called MSQRD](&lt;|url|&gt;) the following year and roll out filters of its own. And in August 2016, Instagram launched its own version of Stories, Snapchat’s signature feature. According to conversations with several former Snapchat employees, the company failed to take seriously the competitive threat posed by Instagram — and suffered for it.

User growth tapered off in the second half of 2016, and the platform [lost millions of users after a disastrous redesign in late 2017](&lt;|url|&gt;). The company went through [multiple](&lt;|url|&gt;) [rounds](&lt;|url|&gt;) of [layoffs](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year and its stock price plummeted, reaching an all-time low of less than $5 per share in December 2018.

But Snapchat has been mounting a comeback of late. Snapchat beat its projected revenue for the first quarter of 2019 and increased its daily active users by 4 million. Snapchat’s stock price has steadily increased this year. (As of this writing, Snapchat is trading at $13.92 a share.)

“We believe the monetization growth we saw in the quarter, particularly in the US, was evidence of the platform’s longer-term potential, particularly as the company continued to improve in direct response [advertising],” Goldman Sachs wrote in its latest research analysis of Snapchat. Goldman Sachs still gave Snapchat a “Neutral” rating due to “growing competition” and the stock price being potentially overvalued.

But the rebound is real, argues [Rich Greenfield](&lt;|url|&gt;), a media industry analyst at investment bank BTIG. “We’re among the most bullish people on Wall Street about Snapchat,” Greenfield says of his firm. “We had a ‘sell’ on this stock back in September, and we look at it it’s one of the most exciting opportunities right now on the market in media.” Greenfield credits the rebound to Snapchat’s continued popularity among young people.

Digital ad agency Digitas has increased their Snapchat spending by approximately 15 to 20% from last year, according to Danisha Lomax, the agency’s head of paid social media advertising. “For clients who engage that younger demographic, we’ve started including Snapchat in most of our media buys,” she said.

Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, on the company’s latest earnings call, bragged that Snapchat reaches 75% of all 13 to 34 year olds — more than Instagram, he claims.

“Instagram has crossed over — it’s used by a lot of people now,” says one advertising industry executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “But Snapchat continues to be used by the post-Facebook generation. So if you want to reach young people, a highly-coveted audience, Snapchat has to be on the media plan.”

The baby and gender swap filters prove Snapchat can still dominate the online discourse on occasion, but the company has struggled to turn the popularity of its individual features into long-term, sustained success. The company has enjoyed spikes like these before: Snapchat had a viral sensation on its hands in 2017 with its [dancing hot dog Lens](&lt;|url|&gt;) but user interest proved fleeting — [growth plateaued](&lt;|url|&gt;), and Snapchat was forced to keep looking for new gimmicks to draw users back.

Earlier this year, Snapchat announced it would integrate with other platforms to allow users to share their Story updates externally, to other apps. Its first two partners are [dating app Tinder and video chat app Houseparty](&lt;|url|&gt;).

For the first time in company history, Snapchat is looking to expand its influence beyond the app itself.<|endoftext|>

# The Case Against Breaking Up Big Tech

## The Case Against Breaking Up Big Tech

### Elizabeth Warren has a point, but too much regulation could strangle the sector

![Photo: Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis/Getty*

After witnessing decades of unfettered growth and ever-increasing influence and power, consumers have understandably fallen a little out of love with the tech industry. Nor does it help that tech has at times been acting like America’s abusive boyfriend — mishandling data, violating user privacy, policing closed ecosystems. What was once an adoring relationship has flipped to distrust — and, sometimes, outright hate.

The undeniable power of these platforms and the tech giants that build them has prompted a wave of regulation that started in Europe with the General Data Protection Regulation and is poised to crash onto U.S. shores.

To my mind, regulation is deserved and reasonable. Politicians, however, can’t resist going further, turning tech companies into political footballs. One politician in particular — senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren — is ready to play ball with a single-minded strategy: Break them up! In doing so, however, she may inadvertently dismantle years of economic and technological progress in the name of regulation.
> # Warren’s master plan for unwinding years of tech consolidation is the sharp snap at the end of the techlash whip.

Warren’s master plan for unwinding years of tech consolidation is the sharp snap at the end of the [techlash](&lt;|url|&gt;) whip. I could almost see the millions of fists shooting up into the air when Team Warren posted [its manifesto to break up big tech on *Medium](&lt;|url|&gt;)* last week. I groaned when I saw the on-the-nose headline and as I read some of the article’s frankly ignorant lines.

After detailing Microsoft’s efforts to dominate the internet in the 1990s by including Internet Explorer with every copy of Windows, Warren adds as an aside: “Aren’t we all glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?”

Here’s a tech history lesson for the senior senator from Massachusetts. Microsoft launched Bing years after the company had decoupled Internet Explorer from Windows (albeit under government pressure). Bing was built in an effort to compete with Google — which really does have an effective monopoly on internet search. Also, Senator Warren, Bing is a perfectly decent search engine!

Her praise for Googling notwithstanding, Warren’s post also targets Google, Amazon (which she accuses of copying successful products outright), and, of course, the easy target that is Facebook. Notably, she left out Apple, although when asked by the media about whether that company should be able to sell its own apps on its App Store, Warren didn’t hesitate to [swing her anti-trust ax](&lt;|url|&gt;).

“So, it needs to do one or the other,” Warren [responded](&lt;|url|&gt;) on MSNBC’s *Morning Joe*. “Either it runs that platform, the App Store, or it’s selling its own products on the App Store, but it doesn’t do both of those simultaneously. Because whenever it does, it has this enormous competitive advantage that wipes out all the other little businesses.”

At another point, Warren used a sports analogy to explain her issues with companies owning platforms and the businesses on those platforms.

“You can be the umpire—that’s the platform—or you can have a team in the game that’s running these individual businesses that meet on the platform,” she said. “But you don’t get to do both simultaneously. So, I think those ought to be broken apart.”

Perhaps not coincidentally, Warren’s statements echo an argument that the music-streaming service [Spotify recently made against Apple](&lt;|url|&gt;). The Stockholm-based company filed a complaint with the European Commission arguing that it is impossible to compete fairly against Apple because Apple effectively owns both the store and a major Spotify competitor, Apple Music. In an accompanying [blog post](&lt;|url|&gt;), Spotify CEO Daniel Ek calls Apple’s 30 percent fee a “tax” and a “discriminatory tariff.” He also expresses frustration that if Spotify’s premium service doesn’t use Apple’s payment system, the company can’t communicate with or market to its customers through the Spotify app on iPhones.
> # “The competition issue here is not black-and-white.”

In an animated video the company [posted](&lt;|url|&gt;), the company echoes Warren’s case, arguing that in both owning the App Store and running Apple Music, Cupertino is acting as both tennis player and court line judge. (This is a case of European versus American sports analogies.) Even though Spotify claims to hold no direct ill will toward Apple, the animation does make the company look particularly nefarious.

So, is Apple taking unfair advantage of its competitors?

“The competition issue here is not black-and-white,” Greg Francis, managing director at Access Partnership, a global public policy consultancy for the tech sector, tells me. The issue is more complex, he adds, because there are other content rights holders involved here beyond Apple and Spotify—namely the artists creating music and, through their representatives, enabling the relationship with Apple.

Both Warren and Spotify’s Ek call Apple’s 30 percent cut on all App Store transactions a “tax.” But as [I’ve written before](&lt;|url|&gt;), a tax implies a charge on top of the listed price of goods or services. In the case of App Store transactions, consumers see only one price and so do not recognize a post-sales tax.

“The idea of tax is a bit of nonsense,” Francis says. The 30 percent that Apple charges app makers “is the cost of doing business.”

While Apple didn’t respond to my request for comment on Spotify’s claims, it did post [a lengthy](&lt;|url|&gt;) answer on its website. Apple calls Spotify’s claims misleading and says the music-streaming service wants the benefits of being in the App Store—and drawing revenue from it—without paying its own way. From the post:
> Spotify seeks to keep all the benefits of the App Store ecosystem — including the substantial revenue that they draw from the App Store’s customers — without making any contributions to that marketplace.

The question of competition and control is intertwined with size and scope. Regardless of industry, companies with symbiotic technologies and market strategies tend to pool together like mercury. They get larger and shinier and inevitably consolidate control. For more than a century, government and watchdog groups have kept tabs, seeking to manage natural industry expansion and contraction without stifling growth and innovation. As Warren sees it, big tech has gone well beyond acceptable levels of size, reach, and control.

Fundamental to the question of whether tech companies have gotten too big or powerful is how their existence affects innovation, especially in the startup space. According to Warren, first financing rounds for tech startups [have tumbled](&lt;|url|&gt;) 22 percent since 2012. That stat contradicts [a recent CrunchBase report](&lt;|url|&gt;) on tech venture capital, which identified 2012 as “a year of superlatives: the most amount of money invested in the highest number of private tech company financing events on record; the largest venture capital deals in history.”

Warren insists these big tech companies are hurting the startup community by duplicating competing products and acquiring companies and technologies they cannot easily build on their own. In my experience, though, the preferred endgame for some startups is acquisition. I don’t see a lot of long faces when a small tech firm gets bought up by Apple, Google, or Amazon. Eero, for example, sounded almost gleeful when [Amazon absorbed](&lt;|url|&gt;) its mesh networking hardware business.

There was some concern with existing Eero customers (including me) about how Amazon might change the brand, technology, or privacy protections, and Eero has sought to reaffirm its commitment to privacy. We’ll have to see how that plays out.

It’s hard to find anyone — including the leaders of Facebook, Google, and Apple — who does not, at least grudgingly, support some form of tech regulation, which most people expect to arrive over the next year. But Warren’s strategy takes the notion further, layering on the assumption of guilt and giving local governments and consumers new rights to sue and even the right to block products or services from the marketplace.

Warren’s point of view works only if you paint these companies as evil. But for all the bad press tech has gotten recently, there’s [not much evidence](&lt;|url|&gt;) that Americans view big tech companies negatively.

“I don’t think the average individual regards tech as malevolent,” says Francis, who regularly advises governments and companies in developing and executing public affairs strategies. Even as some consumers support Warren, Ek, and others railing against the largest tech companies and their alleged monopolies, most people cannot live without their smartphones and the services on them — nor would they want to.

Warren has some legitimate points. Facebook, in particular, has played fast and loose with consumer data across a broad swath of its products — most recently in storing [hundreds of millions of user passwords](&lt;|url|&gt;) in plain text for years. Was it done maliciously? Probably not. Carelessly? Absolutely. What’s more, Spotify and Warren do have a point about Apple. The company cannot deny its viselike dominion over the App Store, a strategy that controls millions of apps and affects billions of users, or the fact that it develops and owns multiple apps that compete directly with apps and services in its store.

On the other hand, I can’t think of a single supermarket that doesn’t stock its shelves with its own brand of cereal, juice, meats, and frozen pizza. These products are invariably cheaper, if not always better. As far as I know, no one is seeking to stop ShopRite from selling its store-brand chicken next to Perdue’s.

What if Warren is elected president in 2020? Could she enact her sweeping tech reform? Francis is blunt: “No, she couldn’t. When those companies start to mobilize against process, they could stall it for decades.”

The danger for tech companies is that they simply ignore Warren and allow her rhetoric to stick with the public. Francis suggests that tech companies get out ahead of this and explain to the public why they don’t deserve the treatment she’s prescribing.

Senator Warren is an exciting politician who isn’t afraid of big ideas, but I’m glad she wasn’t running for president 30 years ago. She would’ve killed the internet—and all the innovation that has come with it—in its crib.<|endoftext|>

# Smart Home Technology Is Still Not Smart Enough

## Smart Home Technology Is Still Not Smart Enough

### *Get ready for disappointment when you unwrap “smart” gadgets this year*

![Credit: cherry7966/iStock/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: cherry7966/iStock/Getty Images Plus*

It’s a function of our collective laziness that turning Christmas lights on and off is a process worth automating. I’m not pointing fingers here: I’m lazy person number one and have been trying for years to get my Christmas lights on some sort of automated schedule. Light timers, little pluggable things that tick off the minutes until they hit a preset hour — they’ve all been in my home for years.

More recently, though, that desperate need to avoid flipping a physical switch has been married with my steady efforts to add smart devices to my home.

But as millions more people like me join the smart home revolution this holiday season (the Echo Dot was reportedly [the most popular gift](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Amazon on Black Friday and Cyber Monday), they’ll soon discover that the promise of a smart home is more like a rain check.

This year, I plugged my outdoor lights into an iDevices outdoor plug and connected it to Apple’s Home app. Then I set an automation so that the lights would automatically turn on at sunset and off at sunrise. It worked for a couple days.

Then, one morning, my wife looked out the front door and called to me.

“I thought the outside light was on a timer,” she said.

“It was,” I replied, knowing what was coming next.

“It’s on,” she said.

This wasn’t an isolated incident. In fact, my so-called smart home is really just a collection of semiautomated ticks and quirks:

* My lights follow a schedule… until they decide to stop.

* My security webcam tracks… the neighborhood cat and strong breezes.

* My thermostat trains itself… to cook us at night.

* My voice assistant pipes up… whenever it feels like it.

I’ve closely tracked the smart home revolution and watched as it started and sputtered in the early 1990s, earning some fun parodies that presaged our concerns about a too-wired home careening out of control:

“Moved in at last. Finally, we live in the smartest house in the neighborhood,”* *wrote Michael Schrage in 1993 in an [eerily prescient tech humor column](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the *Los Angeles Times*.
> Everything’s networked. The cable TV is connected to our phone, which is connected to my personal computer, which is connected to the power lines, all the appliances and the security system. Everything runs off a universal remote with the friendliest interface I’ve ever used.

Of course, Schrage’s dreams soon transformed into this:
> This is a nightmare. There’s a virus in the house. My personal computer caught it while browsing on the public access network. I come home and the living room is a sauna, the bedroom windows are covered with ice, the refrigerator has defrosted, the washing machine has flooded the basement, the garage door is cycling up and down and the TV is stuck on the home shopping channel.

I recently tracked down Schrage, who currently serves as a research fellow with MIT Sloan School’s initiative on the digital economy. He told me via email that this fake diary of smart home mania was one of his most popular columns. He’d tapped into a nearly universal desire to live in the home of the future, even one that could turn on its owner.

“The ‘nightmare’ always struck me as obvious,” Schrage told me. “Even though ‘malware’ had yet to become a term du jour, it seemed pretty clear that these sorts of systems would always attract disproportionate mischief-makers and bad actors.”

But that nightmare scenario of a single system undermined by a smart home virus is far from our current smart home reality — which is actually part of why existing gadgets are so frustrating. There is no single system, and one smart gadget may or may not talk to another. In my house, my Nest devices are a pretty tight bunch, but they’re blissfully unaware of anything I have running on Apple’s HomeKit, and my HomePod is not on speaking terms with my Nest smart thermostat.

Back when Schrage wrote that story, and even when I helped cover the burgeoning smart home space [a decade later in *PC Magazine](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, we envisioned centralized systems with a sort of single, globally aware consciousness that would connect and control virtually everything. But it hasn’t turned out that way.

Instead of a single remote or screen, we have chatty speakers, smartphones, and multiple apps. Aside from Wi-Fi, there is no agreed-upon standard for smart home operation and control. Centralized, basement-to-roof-spanning intelligence remains a distant concept. Our smart homes are actually a growing collection of smart things, some that talk to each other, others that do not.

The confusion starts at the top, where manufacturers and retailers are pushing individual smart home gadgets with little guidance or thought to how average homeowners might integrate them.

In Home Depot, the smart home area is tiny and underfed. There are switches, plugs, lights, and thermostats with almost no information about how any of them might work together or be controlled. It’s up to the consumer to check the product boxes for the critical “Supports Alexa” or “Google Assistant” or “HomeKit” or, if they’re lucky, all of the above.

I give some credit to my local consumer electronics store, P.C. Richard & Son, which has a larger and better organized smart home area than most, with each platform, and supported smart gadgets, cordoned off into its own space. There’s even a printed “Smart Home 101” guide that the company co-produced with a local newspaper.

It includes a little narrative describing how a true smart home could work, with everything from the outdoor security lights to a robot vacuum and even a smart mattress, all coordinated and programmed for your comfort. But one line caught me: “What sounds like science fiction is reality in 2018 if you, like 32 percent of U.S. homeowners, have a smart home.”

I wondered about the provenance of that statistic. Are 32 percent of Americans really living in smart homes? A third of us are fully automated? Not quite. The statistic comes from a recent [Parks Associates study](&lt;|url|&gt;) on smart home penetration. It found that 32 percent of broadband-enabled U.S. homes had at least one connected device.

That’s one, not the five or 10 that might identify a dwelling as truly smart. And while it’s not that I think people shouldn’t buy these smart home gadgets and try some home automation, there are some harsh, inescapable realities:

**Platform wars:** Not all gadgets work with every platform. Just remember to check before you gift or buy.

**Too many apps:** Many smart home devices have their own apps and service registrations, which may or may not work with your smart home platform or voice assistant of choice.

**Your Wi-Fi may not be ready:** Even though most homes have broadband and Wi-Fi, the coverage may not accommodate wirelessly connected devices in every corner of the home.

**“This old house”:** While much of today’s smart home technology is plug and play, there are still many things, like Wi-Fi updates for smoke detectors and video doorbells, that may require more expertise or even infrastructure upgrades to work properly in your home.

**The name game:** For virtually every smart gadget you install, you’ll have to identify where it’s installed in the home and give it a name. These are not inconsequential tasks. You’ll be using those identifiers every time you want to ask your voice assistant to, for instance, turn off the living room light.

**There’s always the unexpected:** The other day, my Amazon Echo started glowing orange. It was still connected to the internet and was even able to answer my Alexa queries. Thinking the system was undergoing an update, I left it alone for 30 minutes, then a full hour. As it continued to glow, I tried asking Alexa what the system was doing. It didn’t understand the query. Finally, I went old-school and unplugged it and then plugged it back in. That solved the issue.

Companies like Amazon have sought to mitigate these issues by creating relatively open systems. Alexa Skills, in particular, makes adding disparate smart hardware to the mix relatively easy, as long as you don’t mind authenticating devices through a third-party platform before adding it to the Alexa network. Apple’s HomeKit makes it even easier to add new smart products: You just scan the product’s HomeKit QR code or ID number through the Home app on your iPhone. However, Apple’s more tightly controlled system (for security, Apple says) accommodates fewer third-party products than Amazon.

Amazon, Apple, and Google are all trying to recreate that single-screen control ideal, but none of them have nailed it.

I asked Schrage if he’s surprised about how different the smart home reality is from the one he envisioned 25 years ago. He said that his concept of a single, universal remote control was an oversimplification, “but, yeah, I thought you’d work with your landlord/cable company/home security firm/etc. and have things easy-peasy by 2005.”

In the meantime, I’m trying to figure out why my smart outlet left my Christmas tree on, why my outdoor Christmas lights follow their automation routine only 50 percent of the time, and why my back-door smart light forgets to turn off every other day.

There’s nothing like smart technology to make you feel so dumb.<|endoftext|>

# Cowboy Bebop Is Hollywood’s Best Chance at Doing Anime Right

## Cowboy Bebop Is Hollywood’s Best Chance at Doing Anime Right

### Netflix’s plans for the TV series may finally give Japanese cartoons a shot at live-action success

![Credit: Netflix](<|image|>)*Credit: Netflix*

Last week, Netflix announced a live-action adaptation of *Cowboy Bebop*, a Japanese anime series that has been an American favorite since it was imported back in 2000. It might not seem like huge news, since U.S. studios have been grabbing up the rights to hit anime for years now, despite the fact that these movies (such as the recent *Ghost in the Shell*) have almost totally been horrible. A U.S.-made *Cowboy Bebop* would almost certainly suck as well — except that Netflix, perhaps inadvertently, might have finally figured out the key to turning anime into live-action success.

This is good, because the world has enough problems without adding a crappy adaptation of the coolest animated series of all time to it. While it’s primarily a science fiction story about four bounty hunters adventuring through the solar system — the laconic Spike Spiegel, his patient partner Jet Black, the beautiful Faye Valentine, and the carefree genius Ed — *Bebop* perfectly integrates American westerns, film noir, Chinese martial arts movies, and hardboiled detective stories. Then, there’s the show’s critically acclaimed soundtrack by Yoko Kanno, which is… well, please just listen to the show’s theme song “Tank!” and *try* not to groove:


The end result is a staggeringly entertaining, 26-episode show that hasn’t aged a bit and has remained one of the most popular anime series ever. It’s been an Adult Swim mainstay since the programming block debuted in 2001. Before Netflix’s announcement, Fox had been attempting to make a *Cowboy Bebop* movie, with Keanu Reeves set to star as Spike; the movie languished for years in development hell because of budgetary issues. I’m not sure whether Netflix has resolved these issues or is just reaching into its enormous vault of cash, but of the many projects the streaming company has announced, it would be foolish for it not to put a *Cowboy Bebop* series on the fast track.

But an American-made, live-action *Cowboy Bebop’s* success won’t come from its Western (or western) sensibilities, at least not entirely. The real key is in Netflix’s decision to make it a 10-episode series instead of a movie, which could make all the difference.

Here’s the thing about most anime series: They don’t make for good movies. Not in the way U.S. studios want, at least. When a studio licenses an action-packed, beloved anime series like *Neon Genesis Evangelion, Naruto, Bleach, *or* Attack on Titan* (just to name a few) it’s licensing TV shows that could be 26 — or maybe even hundreds of — episodes long. It looks for a single story, or story arc, that can be condensed and/or dissected into a single, simple plot, maximized for action and spectacle, in order to appeal to the millions of potential ticket buyers who aren’t anime fans.

But doing that kills the main appeal of most anime series, which values exploring the characters and their world more than telling a single story. It’s not that the story isn’t important, it’s that the show is in no real hurry to get to it. This is especially true of anime series based on manga (Japanese comics) like *Naruto *and* Bleach*, which run for hundreds and hundreds of episodes — and whose story arcs can take an entire year or more to tell. It’s the old “it’s not the destination, it’s the journey” cliché, except this time the journey is the scenic route, which isn’t even in the same direction as the destination, and also there’s no ETA whatsoever. It can be frustratingly boring to some, but those with patience are rewarded with a much richer experience — their emotional investment in the characters and the story grows over time, making those plot developments and moments of character growth that much more satisfying.
> # Because anime and manga are usually masterminded by a single artist with a single vision, they are at their core a single tale.

Even though these story arcs can theoretically be condensed into a single movie, that doesn’t solve the other problem — that anime and manga are more than the sum of their parts. The story arcs that make up a series are rarely truly self-contained — not in the way, say, a season of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* is. Because anime and manga are usually masterminded by a single artist with a single vision, they are at their core a single tale, even if that tale is a hundred TV episodes long (just FYI, the two series that adapted the *Naruto *manga combined to equal 720 episodes). The story arcs that make up the tale build off and progress naturally from each other, which means that taken individually they lose a lot of their narrative momentum, and thus their appeal, no matter how focused or action-packed they might be.

“Summing up” manga and anime into a movie inevitably makes them feel flat. It’s true of Netflix’s own live-action movie adaptation of the hit series *Death Note*, as well as 2009’s *Dragonball: Evolution*, which, to be fair, suffered from being god-awful on every conceivable level. Even the recent *Ghost in the Shell* streamlined its source material, a stand-alone movie, and suffered the same fate — although the whitewashing controversy of casting Scarlett Johansson as a character originally named “Motoko Kusanagi” didn’t help either.

This isn’t just a Hollywood problem, by the way; Japan has also made condensed versions of hit manga and anime series, both animated and live-action. At their best, they can be described as “fine.” Case in point: the very violent humans-vs.-giants series *Attack of Titan*, now licensed by Warner Bros. was condensed into three animated films, which [made less than $50 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) combined, and two live-action films, which also [made less than $50 million](&lt;|url|&gt;). Meanwhile, [over 76 million copies](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the original manga have been purchased in Japan.

*Cowboy Bebop* is unique from these other series in that it only consists of 26 TV episodes — a mere blip compared to *Bleach, Naruto, *and* Attack on Titan* — but it still manages to have the same problem because it’s so episodic. Technically — very technically — the overarching story is about how Spike’s past as a member of a Chinese space crime syndicate catches up to him, but it’s mostly limited to the show’s final two episodes. The show’s richness derives entirely from the time we’ve spent with Spike and the rest of the *Bebop* crew, as they chase bounties, eat hallucinogenic mushrooms, meet the solar system’s smartest corgi, and more. You could make a movie out of Spike confronting his past, but it wouldn’t have close to the same emotional resonance as the show. You could tell an entirely new story — there was a 2001 animated *Bebop* movie that did this — but like the compilation films, it required viewers to come in with knowledge of and emotional investment in the characters to really enjoy.

This is why Netflix’s decision to adapt *Cowboy Bebop* into an actual series is so, so important. Giving all those potential viewers who aren’t in love with the anime 10 full episodes to get to know Spike, Jet, Faye, and Ed is exactly what *Bebop* — and almost any anime adaptation — needs. The fact that the show is already so accessible to Western audiences makes the U.S. adaptation’s chance of success even higher.

There are still a million ways for Netflix to screw this up, of course; *Cowboy Bebop* is a very special series, and replicating its many immense charms will be no easy feat. (Honestly, if they aren’t using Yoko Kanno’s original soundtrack — or new music from her — they shouldn’t even bother.) But with 10 episodes, a live-action series finally has the opportunity to give an entirely new audience a chance to see why *Cowboy Bebop* is one of the best-loved anime series of all time — and what people love about anime in the first place.<|endoftext|>

# Doctors Are Braving Social Media to Battle Medical Misinformation

## Doctors Are Braving Social Media to Battle Medical Misinformation

### *But not everyone agrees they should*

![Credit: JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images*

Health misinformation plagues the internet, and it isn’t only anti-vaxxers who buy into it. From influencers peddling useless supplements to fashion publications extolling the virtues of CBD oil face masks, misinformation — while often not malicious — touches [most of us](&lt;|url|&gt;). At best, it can [waste time and money](&lt;|url|&gt;). At worst, [it puts people’s lives at risk](&lt;|url|&gt;).

The question of how best to battle this misinformation, if at all, is a vexing one within the medical community. What responsibility do doctors and other medical professionals have in fighting pseudoscience, particularly online? Some believe doctors should essentially be [seen and not heard](&lt;|url|&gt;). A growing contingent of the medical community, however, is choosing to voice their frustration and correct the record on social media. But this comes with some risk, as confronting conspiracy theorists and alternative health moguls can be exhausting and even dangerous.

These medical professionals — doctors, nurses, even health policy lawyers — often differ in their methods, but for the most part they share one goal: to battle the health misinformation that infiltrates every corner of the internet. And while anti-vaxxers, who cluster in private Facebook groups and other closed communities like fervent supporters of some new church, may be beyond the reach of even the savviest doctor online, the rest of us — from those who may have questions about new dermatological treatments to those who aren’t entirely convinced one way or another about vaccines — could stand to benefit from the wisdom of the medical professionals who dare wade into social media’s treacherous waters.

[Austin Chiang](&lt;|url|&gt;), a gastroenterologist based in Philadelphia, is the president of the [Association for Healthcare Social Media](&lt;|url|&gt;) (AHSM), a new nonprofit organization whose mission is to educate doctors on proper social media use and advocate for it as a crucial tool in the public health toolbox.


Patients are getting their medical information from social media and Google — everywhere “except for the clinic visit that they have with us for 30 minutes at a time,” Chiang says. “With every single field out there, there’s something that is misinterpreted or misconstrued by the general public… We want to meet the patient where they are.” Chiang points to the existence and belief in colonic cleanses and detox teas as two issues that plague his own specialty, along with the most commonly known medical misinformation issue, anti-vaxxers.

Doctors need to consider their digital bedside manner as they approach all of this, but there’s a problem. Medical professionals, says Chiang, aren’t taught how to communicate online in an engaging and accessible manner, while the communications teams employed by hospitals and doctor’s offices don’t possess the same medical expertise as the doctors and nurses themselves. “If we aren’t engaged with online discussion, then the conversation is dominated by other people, and who knows where they’re getting their information from,” he says. “There are plenty of docs and nurses online these days, but relatively speaking, compared to the number of health professionals we have out there it’s still a very small minority.”
> # Harassment is rampant, and some doctors have even been sued by proponents of alternative medicine.

And when doctors engage, there’s a debate around the best approach. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and managing editor of the popular medical blog [*Science-Based Medicine](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, took to Twitter to point out that countering misinformation is more complicated than merely “drowning it out,” as a recent [CNBC story](&lt;|url|&gt;) said Chiang was aiming to do.

“We frequently assume the answer to bad information is good information, in greater quantity than the bad information, but we’ve known for some time that this is not how human minds work,” wrote Gorski in a tweet [thread](&lt;|url|&gt;). “There just aren’t enough doctors and scientists who are interested enough in and good enough at social media to execute this strategy, at least not compared to the armies of cranks, trolls, and bots spreading the misinformation.”

An [April post](&lt;|url|&gt;) on *Science-Based Medicine* written by its founder Steven Novella, a neurologist and host of the science podcast [*The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, lays out a framework for the medical community as it participates in the grand war against misinformation. Much of its advice is internal, focusing on issues like the acceptance of alternative medicine within the greater medical community, as well as the publishing of inflammatory, preliminary studies that aren’t being held to high enough standards. But it also mentions that the “knowledge deficit” model — the idea held by many doctors that the public lacks the health information it needs — is flawed. Lack of information is a problem, but it’s less important than a lack of critical thinking skills more generally. “Facts don’t matter if you are stuck in a conspiracy mindset, or do not trust science, or are overwhelmed with motivated reasoning and confirmation bias,” writes Novella in the post.

But doctors are nevertheless working to combat misinformation on social media. Some of them host opinionated and passionate discussions on Twitter, as in the case of Gorski or the popular gynecologist [Jen Gunter](&lt;|url|&gt;), who has [written](&lt;|url|&gt;) about how doctors can use social media to fight misinformation. Others create irreverent and informative videos for YouTube and Facebook, like the physician Zubin Damania aka [ZDoggMD](&lt;|url|&gt;), and still others engage with followers on Instagram, like the British dermatologist [Anjali Mahto](&lt;|url|&gt;).


“[Doctors] that do join, join with all the best interests of wanting to stamp out misinformation, [of] being that louder, more credible voice. The problem is you realize very, very quickly that it’s such a difficult battle,” says Mahto. “If I do a post about [food and acne](&lt;|url|&gt;), and acne and diet, the amount of backlash I will get being like, ‘No you’re just wrong,’ and I’m like, I’m just telling you the evidence.” Mahto says some of her most successful posts result when she talks about her own struggles with acne.

Bogus corrections are just the start. [Harassment](&lt;|url|&gt;) is also rampant, and some doctors have even been [sued](&lt;|url|&gt;) by proponents of alternative medicine. There’s also the chance that the doctor’s institution may not take kindly to their employees’ posts, as happened to a nurse at New York-Presbyterian Hospital after she reposted an image of a [messy trauma room](&lt;|url|&gt;) on her Instagram.

Still, Damania thinks doctors have a responsibility to fight misinformation, which he elects to do on his [various](&lt;|url|&gt;) [popular](&lt;|url|&gt;) social media channels. “If we motivate [people] with stories and emotional hooks, then we can guide them simply with instructions that don’t overwhelm and cause folks to shut down,” Damania says. He adds that former vaccine-hesitant parents have messaged him to say that he changed their minds about vaccines or educated them about the dangers of “raw water.”


Timothy Caulfield, a professor of health law and science policy at the University of Alberta and host of the Netflix show [*A User’s Guide to Cheating Death](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, thinks that Chiang’s initiative could prove helpful. “It’s true that ‘more science’ on its own rarely changes minds,” Caulfield says. But “there has been too much tolerance of pseudoscience from many in the health care community. An initiative like this can help to build momentum that may nudge more in the direction of a science-informed approach.”

Of course, doctors alone can’t fight this battle. It demands collaboration from lawmakers, educators, the people behind social media platforms like Facebook, and the general medical community. But when Americans’ [faith in doctors is falling](&lt;|url|&gt;), [vaccine hesitancy](&lt;|url|&gt;) is a global health crisis, and other conspiracy theories run rampant online, we need all hands on deck.<|endoftext|>

# Ninja’s Twitch Defection Is the Opening Shot in a Streaming War

## Mixer’s shot across the bow is a big deal for the industry, but fairly insignificant to viewers

![Credit: Johannes Eisele/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Johannes Eisele/Getty Images*

On Thursday, Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, one of the world’s most prominent *Fortnite* players and Twitch’s [most popular streamer](&lt;|url|&gt;), [announced](&lt;|url|&gt;) he was leaving the Amazon-owned platform to exclusively stream for the Microsoft-owned competitor [Mixer](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a move that shook up the streaming world.

This is a huge deal for the business of streaming, but probably meaningless for streaming viewers. Like sports broadcasting rights changing hands between the major networks, although the balance of power has shifted, fans will still tune in to watch the game on Sundays. Still, streaming platforms sit at a relatively new intersection of internet media and video game industries. That Microsoft — which, wouldn’t you know it, has a gaming console called the Xbox — just scooped up the internet’s most popular streamer suggests that console exclusivity could extend from more than games, but to personalities.

Over the last few years, watching people play video games online has become a big business. Between the four major players, Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming, and Mixer, it’s estimated that viewers watched 3.7 billion hours of live footage in the second quarter of 2019 alone. Twitch, which launched in 2011 and was acquired by Amazon [for $970 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2014, practically invented the format. Today, the service enjoys a near-monopoly on game streaming — Twitch accounts for 72% of all live video hours watched across the entire industry. By comparison, Mixer, which launched in 2016 as Beam and was [snatched up](&lt;|url|&gt;) and renamed by Microsoft later that year for an undisclosed amount, accounts for just 3%.

That market discrepancy is why Blevins jumping ship to Mixer is so unexpected. Until yesterday, he was Twitch’s most popular streamer [with 14 million followers](&lt;|url|&gt;). (The next most popular streamer, Mike “Shroud” Grzesiek, commands a relatively small 6.7 million followers.) Last year, Blevins brought streaming into the public eye by convincing [Drake to play a few rounds of *Fortnite* on stream](&lt;|url|&gt;), breaking Twitch’s concurrent viewer record and arguably cementing Blevins as the face of video game streaming. Whenever he plays, he draws in between 20,000 and 40,000 viewers.

This massive popularity translates into a sizable income. In the days after the Drake stream, Blevins [confirmed to CNBC](&lt;|url|&gt;) that he pulls in $500,000 a month from streaming, a large portion of that coming from subscriptions. Like YouTube, streams are typically free to watch, and are often wrapped in pre-roll advertisements that play every time you tune into a new stream. But if you like a particular streamer on Twitch, you can spend $4.99 to subscribe to their channels for a month. This removes the pre-roll ads, unlocks stream-specific [emotes](&lt;|url|&gt;) and badges, and — if the streamer has it enabled — allows viewers to participate in subscriber-only chat. Fans and subscribers can also cheer their favorite players on with “bits,” essentially Twitch fun-money users can buy in predetermined amounts, with every 100 bits cheered paying a streamer $1. (Fans can also just straight up “donate” money to streamers through Venmo or PayPal.)

Twitch takes a cut where it can, adding up to a business model CEO Emmet Shear [believes could eventually bring in $1 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) annually. The model is so lucrative that other streaming platforms adopted it.

For streamers, the finances aren’t quite as good. Last year even Blevins [lamented](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the *New York Times* that the system incentivizes streamers to stream 12 hours a day, almost every day — lest they lose valuable subscribers.

Still, Blevins is making a fortune off Twitch and vice versa. So why jump ship for an upstart? In his announcement, Blevins [explained](&lt;|url|&gt;) that he wanted to “get back to the streaming roots.” Finances surely played a role too. Some [have](&lt;|url|&gt;) [speculated](&lt;|url|&gt;) that Microsoft might have offered Blevins a lot of money to make the switch, freeing him to stream when, and as often, as he wants, and not having to worry too much about maintaining a subscriber base.
> # Mixer luring Blevins away from Twitch isn’t just a costly marketing ploy — Blevins brings the dollars.

Blevins’ [slickly-produced announcement](&lt;|url|&gt;) video about defecting to Microsoft, along with the limited time free subscription offer to Blevins’ channel, suggests that Microsoft is willing to throw some amount of money behind this partnership. It’s not uncommon for companies to throw around big money on exclusives and e-sports streaming deals: EA reportedly paid Blevins $1 million to stream *Apex Legends,* a *Fortnite *competitor*,* on its opening weekend, and Mixer pays to [exclusively stream](&lt;|url|&gt;) the *SMITE* pro league.

All of which is to say, individual streamers are immensely valuable to the streaming platforms. According to [third-party Twitch data](&lt;|url|&gt;), there are nearly 4 million people broadcasting on Twitch, with only a fraction of those streamers, just 35,000, meeting the requirement to be considered a [Twitch Partner](&lt;|url|&gt;). Of those 35,000 Partners eligible to make money, [5,000](&lt;|url|&gt;) are responsible for 2 billion of the 2.7 billion hours watched last quarter. In other words, an extremely small portion of of Twitch’s streamer base is responsible for three quarters of its viewership. Mixer luring Blevins away from Twitch isn’t just a costly marketing ploy — Blevins brings the dollars.

It’s hard to say if this is going to kick off a bidding war between the streaming platforms to ink exclusivity deals with their most valuable talent — in many ways, Ninja is in a league of his own. Still, Twitch has proved that a platform can make a killing with a limited pool of 5,000 popular streamers, and Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, would be foolish not to follow the company’s lead.

As for the viewers, well, not much really changes outside of who gets to collect their subscription fee. Twitch, Mixer, YouTube, and Facebook Gaming are so functionally similar that the process and price of subscribing and watching Blevins is nearly identical between the four platforms. If you enjoy watching Blevins, his move to Mixer changes almost nothing about the experience of watching his streams. It’s hard to imagine anyone who is a fan of Blevins being more tied to Twitch than they are to watching Blevins be really, really good at *Fortnite*. What’s more, since subscriptions are tied to specific streamers, users don’t have to commit to a specific streaming platform. The magic of modern internet browsers means they can watch Ninja on Mixer, or Shroud on Twitch for about the same amount of money as before. Sure, it’s mildly inconvenient to not have all your favorite streamers on a single website. But Blevins moving to Mixer isn’t going to transform the act of watching someone play video games on the internet in the same way Jay-Z acquiring Tidal hoped to upend Spotify.

The only wrinkle in this is the fact that Mixer is owned by Microsoft, and as such, there is no Mixer app for Sony’s Playstation 4. There is, of course, [one on Xbox](&lt;|url|&gt;). While it certainly doesn’t make Blevins console-exclusive to Xbox, it definitely makes watching him easier if you have an Xbox. And maybe, when the next console generation launches, the fact that you can watch your favorite streamers on Xbox and not Playstation just might inform your decision on which one you ultimately pick up. You could see a future in which Microsoft-sponsored streamers play Xbox-only games on Mixer, and Sony-backed streamers play Playstation exclusive games on Twitch, which now has a much better Playstation app than Xbox. Or maybe Blevins goes back to Twitch after six months, and nothing changes.

Ultimately, Blevins’ Mixer jump is similar to networks battling it out to secure rights to NFL games. Sure, for the viewer the set dressing changes, and the commentators might play some role in your enjoyment, but everyone is tuning in to watch the game — Terry and the boys yucking it up at halftime isn’t going to make you stop watching your favorite team.

Blevins suggested as much in his own announcement. “I love you guys,” he [told his fans](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Obviously, streams are going to be exactly the same.”<|endoftext|>

# Amazon Warehouse Worker&#58; “I Don’t Have Energy to Do Much Else Aside from Amazon.”

## Warehouse Worker: “I Don’t Have Energy to Do Much Else Aside From Amazon.”

### ’I am totally in favor of the automation in the warehouses.’

![Illustration: [Glenn Harvey](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Glenn Harvey](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

*Valued at nearly $1 trillion, Amazon is one of the most powerful companies in the world. The Seattle-based retail giant employs more than 600,000 people and operates 100 sortation and fulfillment centers in North America, sometimes sending out as many as 1 million items per day to customers. But Amazon does more than just retail. Amazon publishes its own books and comics, finances TV shows and movies, operates a Texas wind farm, builds robots, streams music, delivers prescription medications, and operates web services for everyone from Medium to the CIA. And that’s not even counting its high-profile acquisitions, which include Twitch, IMDb, Zappos, and Whole Foods, among countless others.*

*Nearly all of us use Amazon in one way or another. But what is it like working inside the beast? Over the next few weeks, we’ll be talking to workers at every level of the Amazon empire to find out.*

*Welcome to the Amazon Diaries.*

Amazon’s warehouses are the backbones of its retail operation, the real-life nodes between the billions of items sold on its digital marketplace and millions of customers. Altogether, Amazon operates 386 logistics facilities domestically and 847 globally, covering nearly 213 million square feet of distribution infrastructure. The majority of Amazon employees work here, either full-time or on contracted gigs. Turnover rates at these facilities are [very high](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the company [announced it would hire](&lt;|url|&gt;) 100,000 seasonal workers for this past holiday season alone.

Though Amazon raised minimum hourly warehouse wages to $15 last year, firsthand reports indicate that work in these warehouses can be grim. Workers’ time is so closely managed that some avoid taking bathroom breaks, [reportedly](&lt;|url|&gt;) sometimes even peeing in bottles. Temperatures inside facilities range from [blisteringly hot](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [freezing cold](&lt;|url|&gt;). Fifty-four workers were exposed to bear repellent when a [malfunctioning robot punctured a container](&lt;|url|&gt;) at a warehouse in New Jersey, hospitalizing 24 people and leaving one in critical condition. According to a workplace safety report released last year by the [National Council for Occupational Safety and Health](&lt;|url|&gt;) (COSH), seven workers were killed at Amazon warehouses between 2013 and 2018.

In an email, an Amazon spokesperson disputed those characterizations, and the accuracy of those figures. “COSH is financially supported and run by committees which are private coalitions of labor unions and other interested parties,” they wrote. “We are proud of our safety record and the thousands of Amazonians who work hard every day innovating ways to make it even better.”

“These are tired narratives based on historical bad reporting, cobbled together to create a false narrative around our employer practices,” they went on. “Everyone is encouraged to come and see for themselves what it’s like to work in an Amazon fulfillment center by booking a tour.”

In early December, I spoke with a 21-year-old Amazon warehouse employee who requested anonymity to speak freely about her experience working in two different facilities. In a location outside Pittsburgh, she worked as a fulfillment associate, stacking and wrapping pallets of goods. For the past four months, she has been working at a location in Kentucky in the “sortation” department, loading and unloading trucks for $15 per hour. She says that she’s looking forward to the day when warehouse jobs are automated out of existence. “It’s either that or we all sit there and sort all [packages] manually,” she says. “And I do not want that as a prospect.”

*This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.*

### **How did you start working at Amazon?**

I think I heard about [it] from relatives. The [job] up in Pittsburgh, my grandmother mentioned something about an office job up in the area. I looked into it, and it wasn’t an office job, but it was a warehouse gig. I didn’t have a job at the time, so I took it. This one [her current job] was more, “Oh, there’s an Amazon down here. Cool, I’ll take that back up.” I’m a part-time associate. Currently, this is my only job. I don’t have energy to do much else aside from Amazon.

### **What are some of the similarities and differences between working as a fulfillment associate and working as a sortation associate?**

The tasks that I’ve been put on as a sortation associate have been loading trucks with boxes and unloading trucks that come in with boxes. It’s different from fulfillment up in Pittsburgh. Up there, all we did was fill pallets that we wrapped up, and then we took those wrapped pallets out to be loaded up into the trucks. But we did not load them into the trucks. We just put them on a staging area, where someone else handled that. Sortation is a bit more hands-on. You’re doing more. You’re playing a more active role, I’d say, in the shipping of things, in their distribution.

### **How many hours a week do you work?**

Normally, they have me working 24 hours a week. It can go anywhere from 18 to 30 hours, $15 hourly. Currently, I’m making enough money to live on. I could do this, I suppose, in perpetuity. Financially speaking, I could keep this going forever. But I’m not the best off, I’ll put it that way. As things stand, I’m going paycheck to paycheck. I haven’t really worked out the numbers, but I can keep myself above water.

### **Why do you think it was so difficult to get Amazon to pay workers $15 per hour?**

I personally see no reason why that was such an issue, why that was such a big mess to get that implemented. I can only speculate. It is a company, [and] what is the sole purpose of a company? To make money. I say this probably simplifying a reasonable amount. That’s fair… but if you’re making that sort of wealth, it seems to me you have an obligation to not hoard it like a dragon. To not just keep it all, because at that point the money seems rather useless.

[Bezos] is the richest man in the world — he can afford to pay his workers a reasonable wage. It would be an entirely different thing if Amazon was some mom-and-pop sorta shop, some locally grown thing, and they’re working with “the family.” That sorta thing I kinda understand getting paid kinda bad, because you don’t have much money to throw around. But when your net worth is in the billions, you can afford to pay people a reasonable wage.

### **Are you an Amazon Prime member?**

Yes, I am.

### **Do you ever talk about when Amazon or Jeff Bezos is in the news, either with your managers or other people you work with?**

No, not really, [although] I can almost guarantee that it is a talking point in maybe the office area.

### **Do you think that’s because people on the warehouse floor are too busy to stop and talk?**

Oh, very possibly. They keep us very busy. They divide [our] time into four-hour blocks. So, for example, I work from seven to 11 at night. But they have this policy that’s called flex up or flex down. That depends on the incoming volume of packages. If there’s a bit too much work, they’ll flex us up an hour to get more things done. If volume’s lacking, they’ll flex us down an hour, or 30 minutes, or 45 minutes, or 15, or something like that. If they decide to flex us down, we don’t get breaks.

### **What happens during flex-up periods?**

The way that they handle peak season in general, which is basically the entirety of the holidays, is hire a bunch of people and flex up when needed. Flex up is basically just adding an hour. Normally, I work a four-hour shift, but when they flex up an hour, I work a five-hour shift.

### **What would happen if you said, “I can’t work this extra hour”?**

They do a point system. Like, if you’re late within an hour, you get half a point. If you’re over an hour late, you get a point. If you basically ditch the entire shift, you get one and a half points. If you have five points, they give you an attendance warning, basically saying, “Hey, you’re about to get fired because your attendance is abysmal.” And if you get six points, they terminate you outright. So, if I were to clock out an hour early or two hours early, I would just take those points. I’m not sure if flex up is considered part of the schedule. I would presume that they would either say, “No, I’m sorry, you have to keep working,” or, “You could clock out if you want to. Just know that you’re gonna take the points for it.”

### **Do they give points for other things, other than attendance and lateness?**

No, these are points just specifically for attendance. I presume there are other ways you can get terminated or released or whatever you wanna call it. But I do not want to find out those ways and those methods.

### **In the past two years, how has your perception of Amazon changed?**

It’s been an interesting sort of thing. I am aware that there have been some frustrations and murmurings of low pay, of bad warehouses, [in the warehouses across the pond](&lt;|url|&gt;). And that kinda came to me through the grapevine. I’ve [said things like], “Oh, you should just get it on Amazon,” to a friend, and they said, “Oh, no, I’m boycotting Amazon because some of the workers aren’t getting paid well,” and that sort of thing. And I said, “I’m sorry, actually I got paid reasonably well. I got pretty good hours. I had a pretty good time of things.”

On the whole, it’s been rather positive, because you do get to see those inner workings of it. Definitely interesting just from a logistics point of view. To see the technologies they employ, that sort of thing. On the whole, it has been good. As with any company, there are some issues. And that holds true with Amazon. In my facility, there’s a kind of “voice of the people” board that you can write things on to help implement changes to the management.

### **What shows up on that board?**

Lack of equipment. There aren’t enough pallet jacks; there aren’t enough tape guns. Certain things aren’t acting properly; there are certain technical hiccups. Apparently they’re rather slow to get that sort of thing rectified, because I’ve seen one complaint that’s popped up seven different times, like, “Hey, this isn’t working. Hey, this still isn’t working. This still is not working. Why haven’t you fixed it?” That sort of escalation.

### **How much of what goes on in these warehouses is automated?**

The majority of things are automated, at least in inbound and outbound. All you’re doing in inbound is just taking the packages and putting them onto the conveyor belt, and it puts it into the system. For outbound, you’re taking boxes off the thing and putting them into the truck.

### **Do you feel like, on the whole, the parts of the process that are automated tend to make your job easier?**

On the whole, I am totally in favor of the automation in the warehouses, because at the end of the day, it’s either that or we all sit there and sort all [packages] manually. And I do not want that as a prospect. These mechanical breakdowns, these technical malfunctions, they happen, but it’s just kind of the nature of the beast. I say they’re a necessary evil. Machines tend to be a heck of a lot more accurate than a person who can be tired or just not thinking right. People can sort things wrong.<|endoftext|>

# How to Raise Money From a VC

## On whether to raise venture capital, how much to target, and how to spread it out

![Credit: BlackSalmon/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: BlackSalmon/Getty Images*

Should you raise venture capital for your startup? If so, how much?

At first blush, the answer to these questions seems fairly obvious — raise as much money as you possibly can at the highest possible valuation in order to grow your business. John Doerr famously compared fund-raising to attending a cocktail party. When the waiter comes around with the tray of mini hot dogs, you should always take one. The reason being that you never know when in the course of the remainder of the cocktail party the waiter will make it back to you. In similar fashion, the right time to raise capital is when the capital is available; who knows if the fund-raising waiter will ever make it back to you when you decide you are in fact ready to raise money. But that only works if you’re at the right cocktail party.

Let’s start with the decision to raise money in the first instance, and specifically, the decision to raise from VCs. Just as with product-market fit — where VCs care about how well your product satisfies a specific market need — you need to determine whether your company is appropriate for venture capital.

The cardinal rule of VC investing is: Everything starts and ends with market size. No matter how interesting or intellectually stimulating your business, if the ultimate size of the opportunity isn’t big enough to create a stand-alone, self-sustaining business of sufficient scale, it may not be a candidate for venture financing.

Rules of thumb are overgeneralizations and crude ways to simplify complex topics, I admit. But, as a general rule of thumb, you should be able to credibly convince yourself (and your potential VC partners) that the market opportunity for your business is sufficiently large to be able to generate a profitable, high-growth, several-hundred-million-dollar-revenue business over a seven-to-ten-year period.
> # Your business might be helping people, enriching lives or even saving them, and still not be the right fit for raising VC.

There is no magic to any of these numbers, but if you think about what it takes to become a public company, these financial characteristics (at least in today’s market) could support a public market capitalization of several billion dollars. Depending on the VC’s ultimate ownership level of the company at this time, the returns to the VC on this investment should be meaningful enough to move the needle on the fund’s overall economics.

So, what if the market opportunity just isn’t of that scale? That doesn’t make you a bad person or your business a bad business. It’s unfortunate how many founders can feel that way. You could be running a multimillion-dollar business with great profits and be living a happy, wealthy, influential life. Your business might be helping people, enriching lives or even saving them, and still not be the right fit for raising VC. All that means is that you might need to think differently about where and how to raise capital and come up with a different approach.

For example, there are smaller VC funds (often with less than $100 million fund sizes) that do invest very early in companies and for which the business model is to exit companies largely through acquisitions at lower ultimate end valuations. That type of firm might be more appropriate for your opportunity if the market size can’t support a stand-alone business. Not every small fund adopts this strategy; there are many angel and seed investors who, despite their smaller investment amounts, are also playing the home-runs-per-at-bats game. So make sure you understand the core strategy of your potential partner up front.

The point is simply that venture capital may not in all cases be the right source of capital for you. It might not be the right tool for the job.

What does that mean? VCs are people, too, and they respond to the incentives that are created for them. Those incentives, simply put (and boiled down to financial ones only), are:

1. To build a portfolio of investments, with the understanding that many will not work (either at all, or will work only with constrained upside) and a small number will generate the lion’s share of the financial returns for a given fund; and

2. To further turn those large financial returners into cash within a 10-to-12-year period so that the cash can be paid back to their limited partners, with the hope that the limited partners will then give that cash back to the VCs to play the game again in the form of a new fund.

And even if your business is appropriate for VC (because of the ultimate market size opportunity and other factors), you still need to decide whether you want to play by the rules of the road that venture capital entails. That means sharing equity ownership with a VC, sharing board control and governance, and ultimately entering into a marriage that is likely to last for about the same time as the average “real” marriage. (It turns out that eight to 10 years is about the average length of real marriages in the U.S. …make of that what you will.)

Now, assuming you made the decision to raise venture capital in the first place, how much money should you raise? The answer is to raise as much money as you can that enables you to safely achieve the key milestones you will need for the next fundraising.

In other words, the advice we often give to entrepreneurs is to think about your next round of financing when you are raising the current round of financing. What will you need to demonstrate to the next round investor that shows how you have sufficiently de-risked the business, such that that investor is willing to put new money into the company at a price that appropriately reflects the progress you have made since your last round of financing?

In general, most entrepreneurs at the early stages of their business raise new capital every 12 to 24 months. Those time frames are not sacrosanct, but they do reflect the general convention in the startup world and also reflect reasonable time periods during which meaningful business progress can be made.

Thus, if you are raising your first round of financing (typically called the Series A round), you will want to raise an amount of money that gives you enough runway to get to the milestones you will need to hit to be able to successfully raise the next round of financing (the Series B) at (hopefully) a higher valuation than the A round.

What are those milestones? Well, it varies significantly by the type of company, but for the purposes of our example, let’s assume you are building an enterprise software application. The Series B investor is likely to want to see that at least the initial version of the product is built (not the beta version, but the first commercially available product, even though the feature set will, of course, be incomplete). They will want to see that you have some demonstrated proof in the form of customer engagement and contracts that companies are in fact willing to pay money for the product you have built. You probably don’t need to have $10 million in customer business, but something more like $3 million to $5 million is likely sufficient to get a Series B investor interested in providing new financing.

If you posit that set of facts, then the decision you need to make at the A round is how much money you will need to raise to give yourself a realistic chance of hitting those milestones over the one-to-two-year period before you try to raise the B round. This, of course, is partly a spreadsheet exercise, but also includes a gut check from you as CEO to build in some cushion for things that just might not go according to plan (because nothing ever goes exactly to plan).

A fair question to ask here is why not just raise all the money you need for the company, all at once, and forget this idea of staging out capital raises by round? Well, first, a successful enterprise software company that makes it to an IPO is probably going to raise at least $100 million (and, in some cases, a few multiples of that), so there aren’t too many VCs who are going to write that size check up front.
> # If you accomplish the objectives that you laid out at the time of your A round, your B round investor will pay you for that success in the form of a higher valuation.

More likely, even if you could raise that amount of money, the terms on which you would raise it — in particular, the valuation you would receive and thus the amount of the company you would need to sell — would be prohibitively expensive. Spreading out your capital raises allows you, as the entrepreneur, the ability to get the benefit of increases in the valuation of the company as you de-risk the opportunity, and provides the VC the ability to right-size their total capital exposure to the business based on the achievement of these milestones.

In other words, if you accomplish the objectives that you laid out at the time of your A round, your B round investor will pay you for that success in the form of a higher valuation. This means that you will have to sell less of the company per dollar of capital you raise. In that case, you and your employees are all better off — you have the capital you need to grow the business, and the cost of that capital is less than it would have been had you raised more money than needed at an earlier stage.

The other consideration regarding the amount of capital to raise is the desire to maintain focus for the company by forcing real economic trade-offs during the most formative stages of company development. Scarcity is indeed the mother of invention. Believe it or not, having too much money can be the death knell for early-stage startups.

As a CEO, you may be tempted to green-light projects that might be of marginal value to your company’s development, and explaining to your team members why they can’t build something or hire that next person when they know you don’t have financial constraints is harder than it may seem.

Nobody is suggesting that everyone live on ramen and sleep on the floor, but having a finite amount of resources helps to refine what are in fact the critical milestones for a business and ensures that every investment gets weighed against its ultimate opportunity cost.

# Browser Tabs Are Ruining Your Brain

## Browser Tabs Are Ruining Your Brain

### *Here’s what to do about it*

![Image: Lefler/iStock/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Image: Lefler/iStock/Getty Images Plus*

*In Microprocessing, columnist Angela Lashbrook aims to improve your relationship with technology every week. She’ll go deep on the little things that define your online life today.*

The state of your browser is like the state of your kitchen: If the counters are cluttered with pots, pans, and dirty dishes, it’s going to be significantly more difficult to cook dinner than if you were getting started in a clean and tidy space.

Research has found that a browser with so many tabs that you can barely see the favicons is a stressful, productivity-killing time suck. [One study](&lt;|url|&gt;) from 2014 analyzed how poorly-organized computer screens affected physicians’ response times and productivity in emergency rooms. It found that cluttered screens increased the time it took for doctors to find medical records as well as how long it took to scan and identify needed information within those records. If a doctor was already stressed, the negative effects became even more pronounced.

Most of us, of course, are not doctors or nurses desperately attempting to sift through messy electronic medical records while a patient waits. But we still have often disorganized work lives in which timeliness is crucial — even if it’s just a report you have to turn in by 2 p.m. — and scanning through 50 tabs to find the one website that will help you complete your task is, frankly, a waste of time.

But, like your kitchen or desk, your browser doesn’t have to be messy. Several different tools and methods can help you keep a tidy, well-organized browser and stave off [information overload](&lt;|url|&gt;).

### **OneTab**

If you’re in the market for a tab organizer that is easy to use and extremely no-frills, the browser extension [OneTab](&lt;|url|&gt;) is an excellent option. Its functionalities are limited but simple: When you click the browser extension, it automatically closes all your tabs and lists them as links in a new window. You can rename this tab group and share them with a link — or a QR code if that’s your jam, for some strange reason. It’s currently available for Chrome and Firefox.

![](<|image|>)

Privacy is an often overlooked facet of software recommendations, and given how much information a program can glean from a person’s internet usage, its privacy policy for many of us should be a crucial component in deciding what software we use. OneTab’s [website asserts](&lt;|url|&gt;) that “information about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to the OneTab developers… Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the ‘share as a web page’ button.” (OneTab didn’t immediately respond to a request for a full privacy policy.)

### **Pocket**

Pocket is another simple and aesthetically pleasing browser extension to help with maintenance. It allows you to save links to read or access later so you can avoid sifting through piles of content to find that one report you actually need. It’s an option for Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Microsoft Edge, and it’s built into Firefox.

![](<|image|>)

Like OneTab, Pocket’s capabilities are limited; it only saves one tab at a time, so it can take awhile if you have a lot to sort through. But what I like about Pocket is that it integrates with Twitter, so if you want to save someone’s tweet, you can easily do that. Saved tabs can be tagged for later reference, which is helpful if you’re working on a number of projects at once and need to keep your tabs organized. It also has an app version, so if you save a tab from your browser you can read it later from your phone.

One thing that makes Pocket stand out is that it offers recommendations. When you save a tab to Pocket from your browser, an automatic drop-down menu will show you other stories similar to the one you’re saving.

![](<|image|>)

Pocket also has a recommendations section on its homepage where you can find more stories similar to those that you’ve Pocketed.

![](<|image|>)

I find this recommendation engine incredibly useful, particularly if you’re looking for something to read on a commute, but I think Pocket is best used for recreational or low-stakes tab-saving, where you only need to save a couple of tabs for later reference. Pocket does [share aggregated data](&lt;|url|&gt;) with third parties, so it might not be for you if you want total privacy.

### **Toby**

David Murphy, an editor at LifeHacker, [wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) that he’s “one-hundred percent [Toby](&lt;|url|&gt;) now” after discovering this browser extension and for good reason. It reminds me a bit of Trello, another app I love. Toby is beautifully designed, comes in either white or dark mode, and relies on super-easy drag-and-drop organizing tools.

With Toby, you can either save one tab at a time or all your tabs at once. When you open a new tab, you can see everything you’ve saved in Toby and select which content you’d like to access.

![](<|image|>)

You can also share your collections with others, so if you’re working on a collaborative project and want to send someone the research you’ve done so far, Toby makes it easy.

![](<|image|>)

Toby is available on Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, and it [shares aggregated data](&lt;|url|&gt;) with third-party vendors for advertising purposes.

### **Evernote**

Evernote might be my personal favorite because it’s the most robust option, but it’s also the most complicated. More than just a tab-saving browser extension, Evernote is an entire productivity app, with a note-taking feature and to-do lists as well as tab-saving.

What I like most about Evernote is that, true to its name, you can annotate your tabs. Since I frequently reference studies and previous news stories for my articles, I need to take a lot of notes. Evernote simplifies that process, allowing you to highlight and mark up websites before saving them to your “notebook.”

![](<|image|>)

When you save a tab in Evernote, you can do so either as a full webpage with corresponding graphics and ads; as a simplified article (shown by the image above) with just the central text and images, leaving off ancillary images and ads; or as a clip where just the feature image, title, and a one-line excerpt are saved to your notebook. The clip option is the best if you just want to remember to go to a particular link later.

Like Pocket, you can only save one tab at once, so Evernote is probably best to adopt at the beginning of a project rather than when you’re trying to wrap it up. For sharing, though, you can share either specific tabs or notebooks full of tabs. Also similar to Pocket, Evernote has a recommendation feature, so when you save a tab, a drop-down menu will show other stories similar to the one you’re saving.

![](<|image|>)

Evernote is available on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. Its [privacy policy](&lt;|url|&gt;) states that it doesn’t sell or give data to third-party parties for advertising purposes, and it also offers two-factor authentication. That said, though, Evernote did endure a scandal in 2016 in which it abruptly [changed its privacy policy](&lt;|url|&gt;), allowing its employees to read its users’ notes “to improve machine learning analysis.” Following a customer backlash, the company [reversed course](&lt;|url|&gt;), allowing users to opt-in to authorize Evernote employees access to their notes. Evernote’s responsiveness to its users’ concerns is refreshing in an era when [our very DNA](&lt;|url|&gt;) is a potential data gold mine, but it’s worth noting that privacy policies — even those of more enlightened companies — can change suddenly.

### **Other methods to cut down overload**

If you don’t want a browser extension, or if you just like having 50 browser tabs open, there are other ways to keep organized or at least lessen the load all those tabs take on your computer’s RAM. Depending on how many tabs, windows, and extensions you have open and running, [it can be brutal](&lt;|url|&gt;).

[Great Suspender](&lt;|url|&gt;), a browser extension, has a very simple purpose: It saves your computer’s RAM. If your tabs are slowing down your computer, Great Suspender “suspends” any tab not currently in use. It’s available for Chrome, and its [privacy policy](&lt;|url|&gt;) states that it doesn’t share any information.

Another option is using your browser’s bookmarking feature. Nathan Zeldes, the president of the [Information Overload Research Group](&lt;|url|&gt;) tells me that a good method for keeping your Firefox or Chrome browser window organized is clicking “Bookmark Open Pages,” or Ctrl+Shift+D, and then saving those tabs to a folder for later reference.

Despite the abundance of browser extensions I now have, I’ll probably stick to my typical and rather niche method: saving everything in a Google Doc. I create one for every story I write for saving everything I might need to reference: contact info, studies, other articles, interview transcriptions, and random notes and thoughts. They look like this:

![](<|image|>)

This allows me to keep everything I need for a story all together in one document so I don’t have to jump from browser extensions to apps to Google Docs and back again. But it takes more time to assemble rather than having a webpage automatically saved to a folder somewhere, so it’s not a practice for everyone.

A messy browser is like a [messy home](&lt;|url|&gt;): distracting, unnecessary, and after a certain point, probably unhealthy. A couple tools and coping mechanisms can take you far, freeing up the mental space you waste searching through a trillion tabs so you can focus instead on the task at hand — and maybe even leave work early as a result.<|endoftext|>

# Telemedicine Will Change How Underground Abortions Work

## Telemedicine Will Change How Underground Abortions Work

### *But it’s hardly a solution to legislation against reproductive rights*

![Photo: Phil Walter/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Phil Walter/Getty*

The past few weeks have been a terrifying time for the American reproductive rights movement, as state after state has passed legislation banning all but the earliest possible abortions — and, [in the case of Alabama](&lt;|url|&gt;), banning the procedure outright. Although none of the bans have gone into effect yet, and there’s a good chance at least a few if not all will be overturned or enjoined by the courts, the wave of anti-abortion legislation nevertheless feels like a terrifying omen of things to come.

To many in the abortion-rights camp, it’s clear that it’s only a matter of time until a significant portion of the country is thrust back to the pre-*Roe v. Wade* era, one where people in need of abortions are forced to go underground. And no matter what happens in the courts and the legislatures, recent technological advancements in medicine have made it unlikely that the underground abortion scene will bear any resemblance to the back alleys of decades past.

The most significant change is the development of mifepristone and misoprostol, two medications that work together to safely and effectively terminate a pregnancy — even when a person takes the pills on their own, without the supervision of a doctor. (Misoprostol, which is more widely available than mifepristone, can also be used alone, though it’s less effective than the two medications in combination.) In combination with telemedicine, these pills offer a fallback plan, one where an illegal abortion can be safely administered in the privacy of one’s home with medication ordered off the internet. Although the FDA has only approved mifepristone for use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, self-managed abortion advocates argue that misoprostol pills can be used to safely terminate pregnancy [up to 12](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [potentially even ](&lt;|url|&gt;)20 weeks in.

There are already sites that provide access to abortion pills, as well as detailed instructions on how to safely induce an abortion at home. Advocacy and education site Plan C maintains a [report card](&lt;|url|&gt;) that rates the available options on price, product quality, and speed of delivery (a key factor for people looking to induce an abortion). Plan C’s top pick, the Europe-based [Aid Access](&lt;|url|&gt;), is ignoring an order from the FDA and is [continuing to ship abortion pills to the U.S.](&lt;|url|&gt;), even to states with restrictive abortion laws, or where self-managed abortion is outlawed.
> # As the U.S. moves toward a patchwork collection of conflicting stances and state policies regulating abortion, some advocates see a path for telemedicine to provide relief to patients.

While physically safe, self-managed abortion does come with potential legal risks. As Jill E. Adams, executive director of [If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice](&lt;|url|&gt;), tells me, there are six states that ban self-managed abortion, 10 states with fetal harm laws that do not make an exception for the pregnant person, and 14 states with antiquated laws that could be misapplied to criminalize people who end or lose a pregnancy. Even when there are no laws on the books that specifically criminalize self-managed abortion, a sufficiently motivated prosecutor can find a way to make a criminal case.

“The law is secondary,” says Adams. “They will use whatever part of the criminal code they can get their hands on to try to punish someone, even when those laws were never intended to be used against a person who ends their own pregnancy.”

But as the United States moves toward a patchwork of conflicting stances and state policies regulating abortion, some advocates see a path for telemedicine to provide relief to patients living in anti-abortion states — without having to turn to a potentially sketchy website, or seek aid from outside the country. Even as states like Alabama move towards outlawing abortions, a significant portion of the country — including states like New York, California, Maine, Nevada, and Illinois — are taking steps to make abortion legally protected and more accessible. These abortion-rights oases could play a key role in providing pharmaceutical abortion access throughout the United States.

At present, there is one physician-backed, U.S.-based abortion telemedicine site, the FDA-reviewed research project [TelAbortion](&lt;|url|&gt;). Sponsored by the non-profit reproductive health organization Gynuity Health Projects, TelAbortion currently provides online abortion access to residents of eight different states: Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, New York, Maine, and, perhaps surprisingly given its recent move to severely restrict abortion rights, Georgia.

In order to make use of TelAbortion’s services, one has to be able to conduct an online consultation and receive mail within the borders of one of its approved states — simpler and less stressful traveling to an abortion clinic in another state, especially when pills alone are often significantly cheaper than a surgical abortion.

Additionally, online abortion services offer scheduling flexibility rarely afforded by clinics, where abortions may only be available one day a week when providers happen to be on site. “The nice thing about the TelAbortion project is that women are able to obtain the service at a time that’s convenient to them,” says Inga Platais, a program associate for Gynuity.
> # Easy access to self-managed abortion in some states is hardly a panacea for regressive abortion laws in others.

But even as telemedicine has the potential to radically change our understanding of abortion access, the promise of projects like TelAbortion is currently stymied by FDA regulations. Since its debut on the U.S. market in 2000, mifepristone has been governed by an additional set of restrictions known as Risk Evaluation and Management Strategies (often referred to as the REMS), which severely curtail when, how, and under what circumstances [the drug can be dispensed](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Most notably, the REMS requires mifepristone to be dispensed at a clinic, hospital, or medical office — a restriction that makes distribution by mail potentially in violation of FDA policy. As a research project, TelAbortion is given some leeway with regards to the REMS, but until the REMS is overturned, it’s unlikely that we’ll see other U.S.-based telemedicine abortion projects following in its footsteps. Even if it is, it’s possible that states may decide to curtail the expansion of telemedicine abortion, through restrictions that discourage pregnant people from self-managing their procedures at home.

And while the combination of telemedicine and self-managed abortion has the potential to provide an appealing alternative to unsafe back-alley abortions or lengthy trips to the lone abortion clinic in a neighboring state, it’s still far from a perfect solution for people living in anti-abortion states. Easy access to self-managed abortion in some states is hardly a panacea for regressive abortion laws in others.

“Every state should be held on the hook for making abortion more accessible within its own borders,” says Erin Matson, co-founder and co-director of the reproductive justice advocacy organization [ReproAction](&lt;|url|&gt;). “It’s not acceptable to point to other states as a solution.”

At a time when a rapid expansion has made it nearly effortless to gain access to erectile dysfunction medications, anti-balding drugs, and even [dubious libido pills](&lt;|url|&gt;), it’s frustrating to see the promise of radically transformed abortion access stymied by politics and regressive attitudes towards reproductive rights. But that reality points to a larger truth: Tech may make it easier for people to navigate punitive abortion restriction, but it’s no replacement for sensible laws that recognize abortion as the necessary and essential medical procedure that it is.<|endoftext|>

# NSFW Videos Are the New Sex-Ed for Adults

## NSFW Videos Are the New Sex Ed for Adults

### Startups are using explicit footage to improve our understanding of our bodies

For the past 15 years, Swedish filmmaker Erika Lust has devoted herself to the world of indie adult cinema, using her talents to create stunningly beautiful films that document a variety of intimate relationships and sexual experiences. Through her work, Lust has seen firsthand how ill-equipped many of us are to talk about sex, or even explore our own sexualities. And over the years she’s worked to help move the conversation forward.

In 2017, Lust and her husband launched [The Porn Conversation](&lt;|url|&gt;), a site geared towards helping parents navigate conversations about adult entertainment with their kids. Now she’s using her platform to address the needs of adults. This spring, Lust unveiled [The Lust Ed](&lt;|url|&gt;), a series of free videos created in partnership with sex experts and adult entertainers. The videos will offer viewers honest information about topics like squirting, mutual masturbation, and navigating masturbation as a disabled person, supplementing those lessons with graphic depictions of the subject matter.

For Lust, this new video series is a way to fill the wide space between pornography and sex education, providing adults with something more exciting that conventional sex ed lectures, but less vulgar than hardcore porn. She isn’t the first to explore this space. In August 2012, the self-proclaimed “real world sex” site MakeLoveNotPorn.tv launched with the promise of offering an antidote to pornography, one that would offer people the chance to expand their understanding of sexual pleasure by getting a peek into other people’s bedrooms. Three years later, [OMGyes](&lt;|url|&gt;) debuted a collection of videos in which women talk about — and then demonstrate, in graphic detail — the various vulva stimulation techniques that help them experience sexual pleasure.

Given that porn is often treated as a menace to budding sexuality — [numerous state legislatures have passed bills asserting that porn is “a public health crisis”](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the idea of enhancing sex education with explicit content might seem backward. But [research suggests](&lt;|url|&gt;) that, rather than pushing us even deeper into our supposed “public health crisis,” sex education that refuses to shy away from the reality of sex actually helps to make us healthier and happier. Whether or not these projects are the future of sex education, they’re still an important tool in the fight to make our culture more sensible when it comes to sex.
> # Rather than perverting our minds and warping our libidos, exposure to sexual content can actually improve our understanding of our bodies and those of our partners.

In many ways, the move to make sex education more explicit just brings us in line with the education offered in other, more open, parts of the world. “The U.S., relative to other first world countries, has low explicitness in sex education,” says Nicole Prause, a scientist at the [Liberos Center](&lt;|url|&gt;), a biotechnology company specializing in research on sexual psychophysiology. In the Netherlands, for instance, there are approved sex education videos that use fully naked adults to educate young people about anatomy — a strategy which, Prause remarks, would likely lead to jail time were someone to attempt it in the United States.

But the panic we feel about letting our sex education feature actual sex, and the resulting emphasis on [censorship of sexual imagery](&lt;|url|&gt;), is incredibly overblown. Rather than perverting our minds and warping our libidos, exposure to sexual content can actually improve our understanding of our bodies and those of our partners, according to Prause — provided that we consume that content within an appropriate context.

“Pornography is somewhat agnostic. It depends what you take from it,” Prause explains. “We know that adolescents that view more pornography have more accurate genital knowledge,” largely due to the fact that they’ve had the chance to observe a variety of genitals, up close and in action. Although pornography that features a limited and often cartoonish range of body types and sexual activities [can be damaging](&lt;|url|&gt;) by lowering viewers’ self-esteem by reinforcing the idea that there’s just one way to be sexy, merely seeing naked bodies or sex itself does not have that effect.

In fact, pulling back the curtain and encouraging people to actually see and appreciate the diverse range of what bodies and sex, can look like, can have tremendously positive effects. Destigmatizing sexual content helps to increase feelings of body positivity, self-comfort, and sexual self-confidence. It helps sharpen understanding of what consent looks like and helps us better understand how to properly identify when our bodies are actually aroused and ready for sex.

“Hiding the rawness of sex behind a mask of euphemism only heightens the stigma surrounding it,” says Lust.

Prause notes that the research suggests she’s correct. “All the data are very consistent that [increasing the explicitness in American sex ed] would be a positive shift for a variety of outcomes,” says Prause.

OMGyes has seen firsthand the positive effect explicit sex education can have on viewers. In [a recent study](&lt;|url|&gt;), scientists at Indiana University School of Medicine showed OMGyes to 1,000 people, ages 18–83. A full 94 percent of subjects said that after viewing OMGyes content, they could more confidently explain their sexual preferences in detail, while 95 percent said they had their understanding of pleasure expanded, and 81 percent said they discovered new ways to describe the kinds of things they liked.

And it’s the video aspect of these projects that seems to be particularly essential. In their own research, the OMGyes team has surveyed thousands of people about the tools they’ve found to be helpful when exploring and learning about sex pleasure. “[Fewer than] 10 percent of them actually found anything useful from reading,” says Rob Perkins, co-founder of OMGyes. Perkins compares reading about sexual techniques to trying to learn dance moves from a chart of foot positions: “There’s just such a difference between reading about these nuanced touches and doing them” — and getting a video demonstration can do wonders to help close the gap.

It remains to be seen whether such explicit projects will become a standard part of the sex education curriculum. But Lust believes that “if we can normalize explicit sex outside of porn sites, and as a way of learning, then I think we can reach more people who haven’t had the sex education that they need.”<|endoftext|>

# The Great Smartphone Experiment

## If smartphones are a great big unknown, why are we so casual about introducing them to our kids?

![Credit: Maskot/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Maskot/Getty Images*

It happened in an instant. One moment, the yellow school bus was thundering on its way, full of chattering 12-year-olds. The next instant, it hit an unseen pothole and bounced violently. Two classrooms of children were suddenly floating, airborne, as though they were cresting the top of an amusement park’s best roller coaster.

A moment later, the kids crashed to the ground. Teachers hurried back to take stock while I—a parent chaperone—talked to a few of the less affected students near the front of the bus.

“I was all right,” a nearby girl told me. “But Alyssa hit the roof.” She showed me her phone. The classroom of kids—the majority with smartphones anyway—had put their devices to work. Mere seconds had passed, but they were already dissecting the drama in a group chat.

If you’re a kid in high school or middle school, you more than likely have a smartphone as an ever-present companion. The average age for a child to get a first smartphone [was 10 in 2016](&lt;|url|&gt;), down from 12 a few years earlier. The average young smartphone user is on their device around an hour a day (at first), then [nearly three hours every day](&lt;|url|&gt;) when they hit their teenage years.
> # Until there are large studies that follow children through years of early smartphone use, it will be impossible to draw accurate conclusions about their long-term effects.

Parenting has always been a tough job. But compared to the other anxiety-inducing hazards of modern life—television, computer games, dating, junk food—the smartphone is unique. Only a smartphone is embedded in our daily lives. It occupies a place of privilege, permanently by our side in a pocket or a purse. This placement gives it the possibility of influencing almost every activity and interaction we experience.

If you’re expecting an angry screed about the way smartphones change young lives—consuming hours of free time, taking focus from previously enjoyed activities, shortening attention spans—this isn’t it. In fact, the science around early-age smartphone use is far from definitive. How could it be? The very first iPhone was released in 2007. If you gave an iPhone on its release date as an expensive gift to a classroom of 12-year-olds, you’d barely have data to age 24. Until there are large studies that follow hundreds of children through years of early smartphone use, it will be impossible to draw accurate conclusions about their long-term effects.

That hasn’t stopped people from speculating. Researchers have suggested that smartphones [promote obesity](&lt;|url|&gt;) (by reducing activity), [inhibit social skills](&lt;|url|&gt;) (by replacing face-to-face communication with endless texting), and the [blue light emitted](&lt;|url|&gt;) by smartphones may affect our sleep patterns and cognitive performance. Smartphone use could even trigger physical changes. Just as our eyes suffered an epidemic of myopia when our civilization embraced reading and other types of near-focus work, perhaps hours spent hunched over the screen of a tiny mobile device will change the posture of future generations. But each of these arguments is just a hypothesis, backed by provisional research over a few years of study at most. We simply don’t know the real answers.

That’s not to say there aren’t red flags. Studies that look at adults find that simply having your smartphone out on the table beside you is enough to cause a [drop in performance](&lt;|url|&gt;) on any task that needs focused concentration. The effect could be worse for teenage brains, which are already in a period of dramatic upheaval. In fact, the changes taking place in a teenage brain are second only to the neuronal rewiring of early childhood.

More troubling, a study published in 2017 found a surge of [depression symptoms](&lt;|url|&gt;) in teenagers. Out of half a million teenagers, those who had more smartphone screen time and spent more hours on social media were the ones most likely to be struggling with feelings of low self-esteem and unhappiness. The sudden uptick started in 2012—the first year that a majority of teenagers were smartphone owners.

Studies like these can only show suggestive connections. Despite the blaring headlines, they don’t prove anything. But they should make us ask if an uncritical love of our miraculous pocket computers could be putting our children at risk.

If smartphones are a great big unknown, why are we so casual about introducing them to our kids?

One reason may be that we have no other choice. Technology companies have outgamed us. They’ve built phone-powered solutions for everyday activities (finding directions, staying in contact with friends, taking pictures, answering questions) that are leagues better than the ones we used before our lives were dominated by smartphones.

Having a smartphone also plays well to parental concerns about a child’s newfound independence. The smartphone offers a cushion of comfort as growing kids begin walking alone and going to parties outside of parental supervision. Safety is a powerful totem. And more than a few families quietly relish the ability of phones to keep their kids away from other anxiety-inducing activities. After all, you don’t need to worry that your kids are skateboarding down a busy freeway with a reckless gang of friends if they’re safely behind the screen of a Snapchat session.

Smartphones also have potent socioeconomic meaning. Few parents are immune to the silent status competition that plays out between families—the desire to show your child is ahead of others, or at least keeping up with their peers. Living without a phone is difficult for a 12-year-old and almost unthinkable for most teenagers. It means being cut out from an entire peer social world of shared texts, pictures, and plans. Combine this with the natural desire of quickly maturing kids to adopt the habits of the adults around them, and you can see why giving smartphones to children is an idea that seduces the whole family. But voices urging caution with smartphones have come from unexpected places, including some of the titans of the tech world.
> # Kids describe how their smartphone distracts them from schoolwork; adults describe how it distracts them on the job.

Bill Gates made headlines in 2017 when he declared that he didn’t allow his kids to have smartphones [until age 14](&lt;|url|&gt;). Steve Jobs [restricted the iPad](&lt;|url|&gt;) (now a family favorite) from his children when it was first released. Tristan Harris, Google’s former in-house ethicist, argues that smartphones are designed to capture kids’ attention and hold onto it—forever. (As [he remarks](&lt;|url|&gt;), “YouTube has one goal: to make you forget your goals and to keep you watching as many YouTube videos as possible.”) But the most forceful smartphone skeptic is surely Chamath Palihapitiya, the former vice president of user growth for Facebook. He sees social media as [ripping apart](&lt;|url|&gt;) the fabric of society, replacing meaningful interactions with short-term feedback loops centered on hearts, likes, and thumbs up. He doesn’t allow [his children](&lt;|url|&gt;) to participate.

But perhaps the most important voices are those of the kids themselves. A clear majority of teenagers with smartphones—90% of those between the ages of 13 and 17, according to a [Pew Research Center survey](&lt;|url|&gt;)—say that spending time online is a problem facing their generation, with 60% calling it a major problem. They may need our help. One detail that stands out in the Pew Research surveys is how teen troubles mirror those of their parents. Kids describe how their smartphone distracts them from schoolwork; adults describe how it distracts them on the job. And just as parents report being concerned about teen screen time, teens describe parents who are too occupied by their smartphones to have face-to-face conversations. Perhaps this shows that they, like us, are often powerless to turn away from the wonderland of digital distraction. Or maybe it suggests that the examples adults set have more effect than we realize on our children’s smartphone habits.

Families that set clear smartphone rules may be able to manage the endless temptation of digital distraction. For example, homes that create “family device hubs”—a place to leave your devices recharging overnight and out of impulse’s reach—may be happier. But one thing is certain. We’ve already plunged headfirst into the great smartphone experiment. The outcome is unknown. And someday, in the still-distant future, it will be up to our children to write the final result.<|endoftext|>

# Google’s New Pixel 4 Imagines a World of Hands-Free Computing

## New gesture- and voice-based controls promise the dawn of “ambient computing”

![Image: Google](<|image|>)*Image: Google*

In the most recent *Avengers* movie, Tony Stark unlocks the secret to time travel the same way he invents all of his cool toys: by talking to his computer and waving his hands around in the air. If Google has its way, that’s how you’ll use its upcoming [Pixel 4 phone](&lt;|url|&gt;). Minus the time travel bit.

The device will include a radar chip that lets you control your phone with hand gestures — no touching required. The feature, which Google is calling Motion Sense, is based on Project Soli, one of many experimental research endeavors in Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects (or ATAP) division. A small chip in the front of the phone can detect tiny hand or finger movements. Early versions of Soli [that Google showed off in 2015](&lt;|url|&gt;) could even measure sub-millimeter movements. Imagine rotating an invisible volume dial or sliding a thumb along your finger to fast forward a video player. That’s the kind of thing Soli was designed to do. And we don’t know how much progress Google has made in the years since.

The hand gestures are reminiscent of the way we’ve seen characters manipulate holograms and control computers in movies from *Iron Man* to [*Minority Report](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. The new gestures in the Pixel 4 are an early attempt at this — although it’s a bit less flashy and futuristic.

We don’t yet know the full extent of these gestures, but an early promo video shows a user [swiping at a music app to skip tracks](&lt;|url|&gt;). They’re also not the only “hands-free” innovation to expect in this phone. Earlier this year, Google demoed [a new, next-generation version of its voice assistant](&lt;|url|&gt;). It could handle multiple commands in a row, understand follow-up questions, and control virtually everything on the phone. The ability to hold a continued conversation or handle multiple tasks at once already makes the Assistant stand tall [over competitors like Siri](&lt;|url|&gt;), and running the voice assistant directly on the device will only make it that much faster.


For example, in the middle of replying to a text message, a Googler asked “show me my photos from Yellowstone,” then followed it up with “the ones with animals.” She then tapped on a picture and said “send it to Justin.” The Assistant texted the photo to Justin. And all of this without invoking the “Hey Google” wake words for each command. While the company has demoed lofty visions of products at I/O before that eventually end up scrapped, like [the controversial Google Duplex that almost perfectly replicated a human voice](&lt;|url|&gt;), Google says this version of the assistant will come out on the Pixel 4 later this year.

And all of this extends well beyond the smartphone, of course. Today, you can access versions of Google Assistant [in your car](&lt;|url|&gt;), with a smart speaker, smart displays, and [even some TVs](&lt;|url|&gt;). In my own home, we have a few Google Home devices spread out enough that there are times I’m not even sure which one I’m talking to. I just say “Hey Google, turn off the kitchen lights” — and it happens.
> # Instead of a phone or a smart speaker, the “computer” is your environment.

This all converges on a concept that Google refers to as “[ambient computing](&lt;|url|&gt;).” Instead of a phone or a smart speaker, the “computer” is your environment. Want to set a timer? Just say so. Need to pause the music? Use your hands to tell your speaker to [zip it](&lt;|url|&gt;). While Motion Sense is coming out first on the Pixel 4, the company has already shown how it can be used in other devices like speakers and smart watches. In other words, Google wants this tech everywhere.

Of course, there’s still a lot we don’t know about how this will work. Early Project Soli demos showed people using very fine, arcane gestures to control things like volume sliders, but will people prefer this to what they’re already used to? And how far away from the phone will these gestures work? An inch? A foot? From across the room? Notably, [a very early Soli demo](&lt;|url|&gt;) showed a user had to get right in front of the screen to employ a gesture. At that point, why not just touch the screen? Samsung has made [a similar attempt at gesture control](&lt;|url|&gt;) on its phones, which don’t include a radar chip, but so far they haven’t changed how we use our phones just yet.

The new version of the voice assistant raises similar questions. Can you do everything with your voice, or only most things? Even in the demo at I/O, Google’s test user still occasionally had to touch the screen. That might make it hard to send an email from across the room or respond to a text without picking up your phone. It was also a controlled demo. In real life, these things are usually a lot more finicky than they are on stage. A big part of Google’s argument is that its new Assistant will work immediately and for most things on your phone. If the lag is even a hair too long, or if you still have to pick up your phone to complete basic tasks like sending an email, the whole thing falls down.

However, if Google can pull it off — or even get reasonably close — it could change how we use our phones in a way that’s as fundamental as when we started using touchscreens. It’s easy to forget, but there was a time not very long ago when touchscreens were slow, clunky and inaccurate. They weren’t good enough to use as the primary means of interacting with your phone, which might explain why people held onto their button-filled Blackberries for so long. That changed.

Of course, we still use keyboards and mice, and we’ll continue to use touchscreens. The point of the Pixel 4’s new features aren’t necessarily to replace how you use your phone entirely, but to turn the device itself into something that occupies the background of your life. Sometimes it’s convenient to touch it, but maybe other times it’s easier to talk or gesture at it — if you’re working at your desk, cooking, or carrying groceries, say.

It’s a bold vision that we’ve seen in sci-fi for decades, but it’s never really materialized. Google is claiming that you will (almost) never have to touch its new phone. After over a decade of getting used to interacting with our phones through a touchscreen, Google’s ready to throw out the play book and try something new. The question is, are we?<|endoftext|>

# Confessions of a 40-Year-Old Mega-Nerd

## Confessions of a 40-Year-Old Mega-Nerd

### I have gotten old, but I have somehow failed to grow up

![Photo by [Zakaria Ahada](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Zakaria Ahada](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

It happens every day. Like so many fortysomethings who aren’t interested in having a heart attack and dying just yet, I take a pill to combat my high blood pressure. Unlike many of my peers, however, when I take this pill at the desk in my home office, I do so while surrounded by action figures. Rey from *The Force Awakens*. Soundwave from *Transformers*. He-Man and She-Ra. A small horde of characters from Japanese kids’ TV shows. I have gotten old, but I have somehow failed to grow up.

This is my life, but I can’t wrap my head around it. At age 41, I still play video games, regularly watch cartoons, and buy toys and collectibles based on movies and shows I enjoyed when I was six. The fact that I am a nerd at this age feels wholly unnatural, despite the fact I’ve never *stopped* being one. I’ve even parlayed this nerdiness into an almost 20-year career writing about nerd stuff, most recently as the editor of *io9*, *Gizmodo*’s site devoted to pop culture.
> # The fact that I am a nerd at this age feels wholly unnatural, despite the fact I’ve never *stopped* being one.

Despite this, I still feel like I’ve fucked something up, and badly. I always assumed I would become what I considered “an adult.” Certainly when I was young, I expected to get a conventional job and do serious things like watch the news. Even in my twenties and thirties, when I was still devouring comics and cartoons nonstop, I felt confident I would, *at some point*, leave it all behind to become a capital-G Grown-Up. Even though half my life is over — if I’m lucky and get to the gym more — I’m still, in the back of my mind, waiting for that moment where I put away all my toys and comics and actually become an adult.

I assumed it was mandatory. After all, every generation before me had left their childish things behind. When my dad was 41 (in 1992), he was the operations manager of a steel company, overseeing the tons of metal that went in and out of its giant warehouse. He spent his nights and weekends reading the newspaper and watching slow sports, namely golf and baseball. He was not still collecting baseball cards, as he did as a kid. When my grandfather was 41 (back in 1968), he was a civil engineer in Nashville and planned roads and highways all across the country and beyond. I don’t know what kids played with in the ’30s, but in all the years I knew him, my grandfather never went to the toy store to buy a new bag of marbles or brought out his old hoop-and-stick for a quick roll around the block.

Meanwhile, I remain worried that eventually some grown-up is going to notice that I’m still living my best sixth-grade life and stick me in an accounting department somewhere.

Please don’t get me wrong. I’m not looking for my daily life to change, because then I’d miss out on the 40,000 or so superhero shows currently on the air. I wouldn’t have seen the ultimate superhero team-up movie and a new *Star Wars* film in the same week. I couldn’t read the glut of great comics out there, only some of which involve people in tights. I couldn’t be eagerly awaiting new *Transformers* and *He-Man* movies or new *ThunderCats* and *She-Ra* TV series or — wait. No. That’s something I was 100 percent also doing back in 1984. Which only further proves my point.
> # We are living in an unparalleled era for pop culture, where nerds and especially nerd nostalgia dominate entertainment.

I recently discovered that my generation, born in the late ’70s and early ’80s, trapped in some netherworld between Generation X and the millennials, had finally gotten its own name: Xennials, a name so terrible it should be illegal. Let me posit a new one: Generation Nerd. No, not all the people I grew up with are what most people would consider nerds. But many of them are buying toys, now for their kids, of the things they loved when they were younger. And then they’re taking those kids to the new installments of the movies they loved and getting them into the same series and characters they were into as kids — because, in some form, they’re all still available.

We are living in an unparalleled era for pop culture, where nerds and especially nerd nostalgia dominate entertainment. It’s fun and silly and terrible and fascinating, all at once… which brings us here. Welcome to “Nerd Processor,” a new weekly column here on Medium, by me, Rob Bricken. I’ll be using my 20 years of professional nerd experience (and another 15-plus years of amateur nerd experience) to explore, celebrate, analyze, and criticize all of this — the movies, the shows, the franchises, and the fandoms (both good and, unfortunately, extremely bad) that make up this *renerdaissance*.

Oh, and to make fun of it, too. Because at the end of the day, even if this stuff is a multibillion-dollar industry, it’s vitally important to remember 1) most of it is technically supposed to be for kids, and 2) a lot of it is very, very stupid. Nerds are programmed to get upset about the things they love, myself very much included, but we should never forget that we’re losing our minds about shit like what space wizards can or cannot do. (In space. With their space magic.)

Please join me as I examine nerd culture seriously and explain why none of it needs to be taken seriously, a job I’m delighted to do until I finally take that step into true adulthood. Because I can’t *possibly* still be a nerd when I turn 50. Right?<|endoftext|>

# What’s on Your Home Screen, Jeremy Burge?

## The Emojipedia founder on rude weather apps and living on a boat

![Jeremy Burge](<|image|>)*Jeremy Burge*

*This is “What’s on Your Home Screen?” a Q&A column from *OneZero*. We want to understand more about how people use their smartphones — those life-consuming devices we dump hours into every day — to pave a way toward a better future. Or at least a more reflective one. We’ll add new entries regularly, and each will feature a new interview with a notable person about the apps they use, how they’re organized, and whether those red bubbles drive them nuts.*

Perhaps no one on this planet knows more about emoji than Jeremy Burge. He founded [Emojipedia](&lt;|url|&gt;) and serves as a vice chair on the [Unicode Emoji Subcommittee](&lt;|url|&gt;), which makes key decisions around those iconic little characters.

(He is also, full disclosure, a friend — which is why I didn’t worry too much about giving him a hard time over his generic wallpaper.)

Burge’s professional life revolves around how people communicate using modern technology. And so I assumed he’d have a deliberate approach to his iPhone’s home screen — maybe even some wisdom for the rest of us.

What I didn’t expect is a recommendation for a weather app that openly berates its users.

*What follows is our chat, edited for length and clarity.*

### **OneZero: The first thing I want to talk about is this default wallpaper. I see people with this wallpaper all the time, and I always wonder why they don’t change it. Why not something with a little more personality?**

**Jeremy Burge: **Because behind all the icons, it’s hard to get a picture that’s good! You put a picture of your friends or your family, whatever, it looks awful behind all the icons. I’ve looked through some of my own photos, and they don’t look good behind the icons. I just had black for ages, and I missed the color. Honestly, I could just never come up with something I was happy with.

Apple did an okay job with its default wallpapers. They’re better than anything I’ve come up with.

### **Well, I’m recording! Okay, hold on. It’s black, but it has a little color thing around the notch.**

I kind of hate it, but I kind of like it as well.

### **It has a little green line and some purple around the dock too. It was designed by this guy [Hideaki Nakatani](&lt;|url|&gt;).**

I think past me would have created a wallpaper. One of my teenage, nerdy things was creating kaleidoscope schemes for Mac, redesigning interface themes. I had one that looked like stationery, and it had little sharpeners and pencils in the title bar. It was ugly as anything, but I was really into the customization thing, designing all my own icons. I don’t place as much priority on it as 15-year-old me did.

The phone just became a tool. It’s the thing I want to get stuff done on. I’m more inclined to make my house look nice. I feel less ownership over the iPhone, because you can’t actually customize it that much.

### **I noticed you leave free space on your first home screen — is that for a specific reason?**

I try to leave two spaces open. I just filled the other one a couple days ago. It just makes me happy. It makes me feel like I could try out a new app. When I get a new app, I want it straight on the home screen.
> # The phone just became a tool. It’s the thing I want to get stuff done on. I’m more inclined to make my house look nice.

I did put one app in one of those spots two days ago. It’s called Calzones, and it’s a calendar with better time zone support than the built-in calendar. When you’ve got an appointment, it shows you what time it is in all the time zones. I want to get into it, but I’m not sure yet if I am. I’m kind of putting it there to see how it works out in my groove.

### **Is Calzones interesting to you because you travel so much?**

Yes, and nearly everyone I speak to is in different time zones quite often. I’m originally from Australia. I’m living in the U.K. at the moment. A lot of people I speak to for work are in the U.S., and the U.S. has too many time zones. Just pick one, you guys.

### **Well, it’s a big country.**

Just settle on one — mountain time or something.

### **You have an Emojipedia bookmark, of course.**

I genuinely use it somewhat often. Not to plug my own thing, but sometimes I literally can’t find an emoji on the emoji keyboard that’s built into the iPhone. Apple’s iPhone emoji keyboard doesn’t have search. I like to use Apple’s keyboard because nearly all our users are actually iPhone users. It’s better to use what our users use. So, I like to use Apple’s keyboard, but sometimes I can’t find an emoji.

Some are hidden from Apple’s keyboards. All the humans have three gender options, but only two of them are displayed. The third one looks the same on Apple, but it actually doesn’t specify the gender. If I’m tweeting on behalf of Emojipedia, I don’t want to give the impression that I need this to be a woman shrugging, so I’ll search for the generic shrug, even if it looks like a woman to a lot of people. I want to be as clear about that as I can.

![*The “[person shrugging](&lt;|url|&gt;)” emoji looks like a woman on Apple devices, as you can see on the left, but technically, the code for the emoji specifies no gender. Thus, the [Emojidex](&lt;|url|&gt;) character for the same emoji, seen on the right, has ambiguous traits.*](<|image|>)**The “[person shrugging](&lt;|url|&gt;)” emoji looks like a woman on Apple devices, as you can see on the left, but technically, the code for the emoji specifies no gender. Thus, the [Emojidex](&lt;|url|&gt;) character for the same emoji, seen on the right, has ambiguous traits.**

### [**You’ve written about this for *Medium](&lt;|url|&gt;)*: There is a discoverability issue with emoji. Is this Emojipedia hack okay, or do you want to see this technologically addressed elsewhere?**

I mean, it’s not great. No one likes to copy and paste something if their system could suggest it. Definitely one of the biggest requests we get is for a search feature on iOS, which I’m sure they’ll put in someday. At the moment, the Mac one is quite bad, so I don’t think they want to implement it until it’s ready. Apple gets a lot of scrutiny.

This gender thing, some of that is on Unicode to standardize better. If there was a standard set of three for every emoji, you could make the interface better. [Google does this a little](&lt;|url|&gt;), where they bury the gender under a submenu. There’s a ways to go, and it’s a matter of all the steps lining up: Unicode has to do some work, and Apple and the other vendors have to do some work, and users have to be happy. Platforms don’t like to make huge changes, because the users get upset. If you did a massive overhaul of the emoji keyboard tomorrow, you’d have a lot of upset people.

### **Moving on a little bit from that — you have Open Canal Map on your home screen. What is this?**

I’ve just in the past month bought a boat—a narrow boat for the British canals—and I’m going to move in there soon. So, I need to know where I’m going, and Google Maps is awful for it, and Open Canal Map is good for it.

### **You’re going to be the king of emoji, living on a boat, surfing the waterways of the United Kingdom.**

They can take you all over the country. The canal network is quite extensive over here. You don’t really see them, because they wind through villages and towns and you don’t see them from the motorways or the train lines, but that’s going to be me. I’m going to live on a boat. I’ve got a big ol’ antenna for some high-speed 4G to come into the boat, and I’m going to see what that’s like.

### **Nice. Between this and the Calzones app, this is definitely the most European home screen I’ve seen.**

Buried in the banking section as well — digital banking is quite European. I have a little folder there with credit card and money emojis there. Europe is much better at digital banking and open banking than the U.S., because people — at least in the U.K. — regularly deal in euros and pounds. You travel a lot, so therefore, whenever you think of finance, you think of at least two currencies.

One of the banking apps I use, I have balances in five different currencies ready to go. That’s called Revolut. It’s kind of a prepaid card, but they don’t charge any fees, and you can move your money between all the balances.
> # I’m going to live on a boat. I’ve got a big ol’ antenna for some high-speed 4G to come into the boat, and I’m going to see what that’s like.

### **And, of course, all of your folder labels are entirely emoji. Which is on-brand.**

It is on-brand, and I hate the words Apple puts in there when you make a folder. You’ll drag something like Twitter onto Slack, and it’ll say something like “communication” or “productivity” — Apple calls nearly everything “productivity.”

### **What is this Carrot** **app? It looks like something for, like, a *Battlestar Galactica *fan, but I bet it’s something entirely different.**

Carrot is a weather app. There’s a whole Carrot family of apps. Carrot Weather is the only app I use from the Carrot family, but I find it more accurate than the built-in weather app on iOS. It has good wind direction — I like to ride my bike, and the wind direction makes a big difference.

The fun part is it’s got this snarky personality. It insults you when there’s bad weather. You open it up and it’ll be like, “You deserve this awful weather because you’re a terrible person,” or something.

### **That’s not what I want from my weather app. Be nice to me, weather app.**

You can change the snarky setting. I don’t know that you can make it be nice to you, but you can turn it off. But I feel an affinity for the Carrot app.

### **I think that’s a little disturbing, but that’s okay. I’m glad it works for you.**

Let’s see what it says now.

*[Carrot makes a joke about how Jeremy will never fit into his skinny jeans again.]*

### **Wow!**

It’s a bit harsh, but for me, I don’t mind a bit of my app giving me a hard time.

### **I think that would hurt my feelings too much, but I’m very sensitive.**

Well, it’s also a good weather app. I wouldn’t like it if it just snarked at me.

### **You have a lot of home screens, so you must download a lot of apps.**

I gave up on deleting apps. I’ve got a bunch of random airline apps, games that I might like once or twice or I might like to play with my nephews — very incidental. It’s a wasteland, but it’s ready for search, so why not leave it there?

### **One last thing: I ask everyone about notifications. It seems like you have very good notification hygiene.**

I use badges and notifications for the same thing — I turn them off for everything, except the ones I want. I don’t mind a notification for a Twitter DM or Facebook Messenger or iMessage. It’s people I know. I just turn off everything else, because obviously, apps these days take advantage, they spam you all the time. Mostly, I don’t need to know.

# Why AirPods—and Earbuds Like Them—Are Especially Bad for Your Hearing

## Why AirPods—and Earbuds Like Them—Are Especially Bad for Your Hearing

### *It’s all about the fit and the background noise*

AirPods are everywhere — even though they’re pretty awful at what they do.

This style of earbud, which rests next to your ear canal but not quite inside it, offers [practically zero noise isolation](&lt;|url|&gt;). In other words, AirPods, by far the [most popular wireless earbuds](&lt;|url|&gt;), do a poor job overpowering noise like [chattering colleagues](&lt;|url|&gt;) or teens on the subway. The natural response is to turn the volume louder to compensate — which can quickly turn dangerous for your hearing.

“I’m seeing a lot of younger people in their twenties who are coming in with ringing in their ears,” says Sarah Mowry, an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. “I think it’s probably related to this all-day earbud use. It’s noise trauma.”

Headphones, in and of themselves, are not a risk. You could listen all day at a low-to-middle volume without health worries. It’s only once you start listening to loud volumes for sustained periods of time that they can start damaging your ears.
> # It’s likely that earbuds are contributing to widespread hearing damage among younger people.

And the type of headphones that are the most likely to cause hearing problems are these earbuds. A [2007 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that adults turn up their music louder when they’re wearing earbuds than over-the-ear headphones. It also discovered that users wearing earbuds were more likely to turn up their volume to compensate for background noise (in this case, street noise and “multi-talker babble”) than people wearing over-the-ear headphones. A [further study](&lt;|url|&gt;), from 2011, expanded on that research, finding that teens wearing earbuds turn their volume up to overcome background noise, some to harmful levels, more than those wearing noise-isolating, over-the-ear headphones.

Brian Fligor, an audiologist who has studied the impact of earbuds on hearing damage, says that people typically listen to their earbuds about 13 decibels higher than the background noise. If you’re wearing headphones or earbuds in a school classroom, where the background noise usually runs at about 60 decibels, and you turn your music up to 73 decibels to compensate, that should be fine for most people’s ears. But if you’re in a noisy coffee shop, where background noise is usually about 70 decibels, or on an airplane, where the noise typically reaches 80 decibels, things get dicey. “When the background noise induces [people] to listen 13 decibels louder than the background and the background is 70 decibels, now we’re talking about potential to do damage,” he says.

Public transportation is “the number one time and place for you to be exposed,” says Fligor. The New York City subway system is [monumentally loud](&lt;|url|&gt;): the mean noise level on subway platforms and inside the trains is 94 decibels, and 20 percent of those spaces exceed 100. Add 13 decibels from turning up your earbuds, and we’re at anywhere from 107 to 113 decibels, [yet people can only safely be exposed](&lt;|url|&gt;) to 100-plus decibels for 15 minutes a day.

You can see the problem.

This may help explain why my hearing has gotten so terrible in recent years. My Bay Area bus commute, which was typically at least an hour long and at least 84 decibels twice a day, five times a week, was bad enough. Now I live in New York, where for several years I commuted about an hour one way on the train, and where public transportation is quite a bit louder. (I work from home now, bless.) That was at least 10 hours a week I spent exposing myself to unhealthy levels of noise — and most of the time, I was wearing my Apple earbuds.

So is most everyone else. [2014 research](&lt;|url|&gt;), conducted by Fligor and others, looked at the impact of urban environments on people’s headphone listening levels by measuring sound levels through a mannequin’s ears. The research involved asking passersby to take their headphones off and place them on this mannequin at the same volume level they had been listening to. The average listening level was 94 decibels, 58 percent of people polled were exceeding their weekly sound exposure limit — and an overwhelming 92 percent of them were wearing AirPod-style earbuds. (The researchers excluded canalphones, those earbuds that go deep into your ears, from their survey, because the mannequin used to test volume didn’t have deep enough ears to accommodate them.)

“In quiet, only a very small percentage of people choose levels that are potentially hazardous,” says Cory Portnuff, an audiologist at the University of Colorado Hearing Research Lab. The addition of background noise, though, makes for “a totally different story,” according to Portnuff.

It’s likely that earbuds are contributing to widespread hearing damage among younger people. According to the [American Osteopathic Association](&lt;|url|&gt;), approximately one in five teens today suffer some form of hearing damage, a rate that’s 30 percent higher than it was 20 years ago. The World Health Organization [estimates that](&lt;|url|&gt;) over “1 billion young people” are at risk of hearing loss, primarily from listening to music on headphones or earbuds.

Adults, meanwhile, have experienced a leveling out in hearing loss — but societal factors indicate that that rate should have gone down, not stayed the same. “We’ve outsourced a lot of our manufacturing jobs and that’s where a lot of noise-induced hearing loss was coming from,” Fligor says. Disregarding hearing loss among those serving in the military, which is [on the increase](&lt;|url|&gt;), people are generally much healthier than they were in past decades, and therefore, “our rate of hearing loss should be going down, and we know that it’s not,” says Fligor.
> # You can listen to 80 percent of your headphones’ maximum volume for 90 minutes before you start damaging your hearing.

While there’s [some research](&lt;|url|&gt;) to suggest that listening to music may not be as detrimental as we think, Portnuff and Fligor both agree that it can cause damage. The question is how long it’ll take for that damage to set in, and how the hazard posed by headphones and earbuds intersects with other, daily sounds like traffic, construction, and crowds.

While there’s only so much we can do about loud workplaces and bustling bars, we can mitigate the potential damage from listening to headphones or earbuds. For the safest volume levels, Portnuff recommends “80 for 90” meaning you can listen to 80 percent of the maximum volume for 90 minutes before you start damaging your hearing.

And you should think about ditching the AirPods for quality over-the-ear — and preferably noise-cancelling — headphones, or snug-fitting, in-ear [canalphones](&lt;|url|&gt;). If you like the convenience of AirPods, which quickly and seamlessly pair with your iPhone, try BeatsX or the new Powerbeats Pro, both of which contain the same proprietary Apple chips used by AirPods.

“I prefer a style that physically blocks background noise by sealing your ear rather than a style with digital noise-cancellation systems,” Portnuff says. [*The Wirecutter](&lt;|url|&gt;)* recommends the over-the-ear, closed-back [Sony H900N](&lt;|url|&gt;), which combines physical sound isolation with active noise isolation that allows you to keep your music on a lower level, even on an airplane or crowded subway. They’re $300, which isn’t cheap, but that’s only $100 more than the latest model of AirPods — and considerably less likely to be dropped down a subway grate.

For a cheaper option, the tech review site [*RTings](&lt;|url|&gt;)* recommends the [Mpow H10](&lt;|url|&gt;), which at $66 are nearly $100 less than a pair of AirPods. If you want something that looks nice, *Mashable* suggests the [Urbanears Plattan 2](&lt;|url|&gt;), which have pretty good passive noise-isolation, come in lots of colors, and have a [wireless option](&lt;|url|&gt;). They range from $50 to $100, depending on whether you can handle a cord. And if you prefer an in-ear headphone style, CNET [says](&lt;|url|&gt;) the $250 Bose QuietComfort 20 are comfortable with excellent noise-cancelling capabilities.

“It’s a whole lot cheaper to protect your hearing than it is to try to remediate your hearing,” says Fligor. “Hearing is outrageously precious. People take it for granted, they lose it, and then you can’t get it back.”

I don’t need another reminder because my hearing is bad enough as it is. Cute, pink noise-isolating headphones: add to cart.<|endoftext|>

# These Bodies of Mine

## How video game character creators helped me explore my own queerness

![The man with the gun who I failed to make pretty. His job is to pretend to not want violence, and then to do it.](<|image|>)*The man with the gun who I failed to make pretty. His job is to pretend to not want violence, and then to do it.*

“Are you a boy? Or a girl?” *Pokemon Diamond* asked me as I sat on the floor of my grandmother’s living room, the light from my brand new Nintendo DS and those from the Christmas tree fighting for space on my face.

I sat there for a very long time.

This decision, as small as it may seem, required me to question, fundamentally, what I wanted from this character and from this game. On one hand, boys were cool, and on the other, girls were pretty. And never the twain should meet because, as we all know, these are entirely mutually exclusive, and gendered, concepts. So after much consideration I decided to play as a girl and began my *Pokemon* adventure and, despite the simplicity of the system, a lifetime love of character creators.

When I played[ *Halo: Reach](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and, later, *Halo 4*, I had a habit of switching between the male and female Spartan models after every multiplayer match. I didn’t think much of this behavior at the time. It just felt like the natural thing to do. Years later, I recognize this as among my earliest experiments with gender and my presentation. If my digital body was to be an extension of myself, I was trying to define what an idealized me would look like.

Around 11 or 12 years old I picked up [*Mass Effect 2](&lt;|url|&gt;)* from a local video rental store. I remember sitting in front of my grandmother’s bulky old television, curled up on the armchair, swaddled in blankets. This was the place where I felt most at home and I tried to bring that feeling of home into the game. I tried to make a Shepard who I saw myself in, but I couldn’t seem to manage it. I tweaked sliders, trying with increasing desperation to make someone I wanted to be. What I wanted to be, even though I didn’t have the language for it at the time, was pretty. And the men can never be pretty. I pushed the sliders to their limits and that was not enough. His jaw was still too hard and his chin too sharp. I wanted him to look soft and inviting: queer. What bothered me the most were his eyes. They were cutting, as if violence had seeped into the ocular tissue itself. These were eyes that said “aim,” wired to hands that said “shoot.” And they were not mine. They could not be mine. There are no hands like mine; my thin fingers, well-kept nails, and small wrists; my prominent knuckles, visible tendons, and that hair that won’t stop growing back. My hands are androgynous in the truest sense, wholly feminine and wholly masculine. And they are soft. The hands with the guns can never be soft.

It was while playing *Mass Effect 2* that I felt the limits of my influence upon narratives for the first time. I would steer conversations away from violence, hoping to prevent conflict, rather than revel in it. And yet they always ended with a gun in my hand. Just as I could not draw my weapons on Citadel Station to open fire (not that I planned on doing so), I could not help but pull the trigger aimed at enemy troops who I’d been in conversation with moments before. And it was with this game that I realized that these limits were imposed upon me by the structure of the game itself. That someone had made the decision to put those barriers in place. The guns would not fire, the sliders would never go far enough.

What then, places confines on character creation? Where are these imposed limitations borne from? I would suggest that there are two primary sources: the first of which I believe to be a failure, the second of which, I would argue, holds incredible potential.

The first is a failure of imagination. What bodies can developers imagine taking up the mantle of their player character? Consider Lieutenant Commander Shepard, the human protagonist of the *Mass Effect *trilogy. Bioware, the creator of Mass Effect, lets you choose to play as a man or a women. But what does that mean? What kind of person does Shepard look like? Shepard is always able-bodied. Shepard is always traditionally fit. *Mass Effect* takes place in the future, specifically a future built on the back of incredible technology. If this is the case, then why is my character’s body limited by the world as it exists now? Why can’t I play as a Shepard who uses an exoskeleton to assist with their mobility? Why can’t I play a fatter Shepard? Why are these bodies so clearly absent from the world? These questions are especially relevant in the case of *Mass Effect* as you are playing not just a soldier, but Commander Shepard, the first human Spectre. To fill this role is to become the face of humanity, to define for the galaxy what it means to be human.
> # Character creation should not be an act of replication, it should be an act of self-definition.

When one cannot find oneself in one’s body, at least from my experience, it can be felt. My Shepard will do violence. My Shepard will not talk their way out of everything. My Shepard will always be right in the end. But why won’t my Shepard ever feel like me? Why does the slider only go so far? Was a queer body so unimaginable in the role of humanity’s representative that the sliders had to stop before a body like mine could be made? Why is it when a black woman sits down to make herself in a character creator she is forced to download mods to even approximate her natural hair? These are not technical limitations — these are concerns of priority and of access. Who is being allowed to fill these roles and to what degree are they being legitimately considered?

*Saints Row: The Third* does a phenomenal job of providing this sense of legitimacy to its players. Anyone can be the leader of the Third Street Saints, which is what makes them so charming. The Saints are not exclusionary. They will take almost all comers, and because of that, the Boss can be anyone. The Boss can be the douchiest looking straight white dude you’ve ever seen, or the Boss can be a queer fat woman. The Third Street Saints are over the top, just as Shepard is always human. Thus the player can inhabit any body within that possibility space. And that space is fluid. There is nothing restricting players from radically changing their player character’s appearance on a whim. You can play a black trans woman in *Saints Row: The Third *and the game considers that an entirely viable vision of the Boss. It is in this way that the game effectively engages with the central idea of its protagonist, and it is this same way that the *Mass Effect* franchise fails.

Video game character creators were the route I took for my first forays into exploring my queerness. I know firsthand how powerful they can be, which is why I believe that writers, directors, and designers can and should do better. They need to know who their story is about and what that means. If you’re making a game in which the player embodies the representative human being to much of the galaxy, and you’re limiting what bodies can fulfill that role, then you’re making statements about who has access to the position of protagonist within the world that you’re making. You’re deciding who counts, and who doesn’t.

The second source of limitation for character creation is both underutilized and one of the greatest assets to the *Mass Effect* series. I have asked “What defines Shepard?” What is core to that character? Their leadership? Their military prowess? I would argue it is their humanity. Shepard is the first human Spectre. Shepard can be a man or a woman, come from several backgrounds, be smooth or bumbling, paragon or renegade, but is always human.

To be human in the first *Mass Effect* game is to be a newcomer to the galaxy at large, both as a player and as a character in the world. Humans are the newest species to arrive at the Citadel, and the other species of the Council have their doubts. The story of Shepard is the story of humanity’s first attempts at intergalactic cooperation. This is why Shepard can never be a Quarian or a Salarian, because their humanity is fundamental to how the world interacts with them. Characters within the world remark upon your humanity, they draw attention to what you represent to them, and change their behavior accordingly. You are human, and that means you have a very particular perspective, that of an outsider slowly integrating yourself into a larger community. Forcing the player to play as a human is a massive benefit to the story as it allows the game to tell a specific story instead of attempting to represent every experience simultaneously.

This is not to say that I want games to restrict character creation arbitrarily. Instead I would rather developers think with more intent about who their story is about, and allow for experimentation and exploration within that space. Create a premise and commit to it. The [*Fallout](&lt;|url|&gt;)* franchise, for example, has always used the aesthetics of 1950’s America without fully engaging with the implications of that aesthetic. To be queer in the 1950s was to live under threat. To be black was to live under threat. Yet *Fallout *refuses to engage with these facets of its world. One cannot engage with nostalgia directed toward the 1950s without reckoning with the very real harm inflicted upon the marginalized people of the era. To be a queer woman in the world presented by *Fallout* should be radically different than to be a straight man. Power dynamics are all but forgotten in *Fallout*, and the series fails to meet its full potential because of it. I want a *Fallout *game that demands I inhabit a particular body to tell a particular story. I want a *Fallout* game that forces me to engage with the world critically, instead of presenting a playground.

After years of failing to find a body I could call home, I gave up on making me and I started making them. It was freeing. The man with the gun who I failed to make pretty — his job is to pretend not to want violence and then to do it. The young elven woman with the strong jaw and a home outside the cities, the genderqueer cyberpunk strapped into the cockpit of a warmachine that we made look like us — all of these bodies and more are strange, beautiful, and unrecognizable as anything but me. Queer.

Forced to look outside of myself, I began identifying what I truly believed mattered to me. Why did I want the man with the gun to be pretty? What about the elven woman’s jaw drew me to her? Why did I decide to be a girl when I was seven years old, playing *Pokemon*? As desperate as I have been to make a cohesive vision of myself, I could not do so in a single body. Video games made me realize that this body of mine, all flesh and bone and performance, was a forgery too. I could only find myself by looking to others, to bodies alien from my own. Character creation should not be an act of replication — it should be an act of self-definition.

Character creators can build immediate investment in a player character and that investment goes on to build empathy. To have some influence over aesthetic is to allow a player to see some aspect of themselves in their character and for their character to impose some aspect of themselves on the player. I want games to speak to [more specific experiences and perspectives](&lt;|url|&gt;) and to allow for more robust options in character creation. I do not want my ability to express myself to be limited by someone else’s imagination. I want my ability to express myself to be limited by my relationship to the narrative. I want more stories to engage with identity and power, and that may mean limiting the option to create bodies exactly like my own, but I want the stories more than I want the skin.<|endoftext|>

# This Alternative to Google Maps Aims to Protect Indigenous Land

## Even high tech often ignores indigenous lands, but an ambitious mapping project called LandMark is helping communities stake their claims

![Credit: LandMark](<|image|>)*Credit: LandMark*

Zoom in on Peru with Google Maps in satellite view and you’ll see a country comprised of three distinct zones. Sediment-rich rivers, including the Amazon, serpentine through the rainforest, ridges on the Andean mountains — Peru’s highland spine — look like veins, and parched deserts edge the Pacific Ocean. These diverse ecosystems are home to equally diverse indigenous peoples: around 55 groups, speaking 47 languages, according to the Denmark-based[ International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Yet these communities’ existence and their land rights have long been contentious issues for Peru, says Richard Chase Smith, executive director of the conservation charity Instituto del Bien Común in Lima. “The state prefers not to see them and for them not to be seen. That’s because of a major political change, starting after the military government in 1980, to view the communities as a threat and to view community lands as a waste of resources.”
> # Cartography allowed colonial governments to carve up indigenous lands, and mapping remains a tool of both recognition and suppression.

Indigenous peoples across the globe — from Native Americans and Australian Aboriginals to the tribes of Indonesia and Tanzania — face similar challenges. They may have long occupied the land, but that doesn’t mean they always own it — at least in the eyes of states. According to a report by the[ Rights and Resources Initiative](&lt;|url|&gt;), “Communities are estimated to hold as much as 65% of the world’s land area through customary, community-based tenure systems. However, national governments only recognize formal, legal rights of indigenous peoples and local communities to a fraction of these lands.”

Cartography allowed colonial governments to carve up indigenous lands, and mapping remains a tool of both recognition and suppression. Google Maps is a present-day manifestation of a centuries-old political impulse to visualize territory.

Smith understands the political authority associated with maps. Working with local groups, he and his team have spent the last 20 years mapping 2,500 native communities in Peru’s Amazonian regions. In 2005, they also began the mammoth task of mapping the country’s 8,000 so-called *comunidades indígenas*, or peasant communities. “We decided we had to get communities mapped, to show their existence and to allow community peoples to use those maps to say, ‘We are here. This is us,’” he explains.

International concern about threats to indigenous lands is growing. At a land rights conference in Switzerland, in September 2013, Smith and colleagues coled** **a call for the development of a global map-based platform of indigenous and community lands, backed by the sustainability nongovernmental organization, World Resources Institute (WRI) of Washington, D.C., alongside the Indonesian human rights group Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara. By 2015, a steering group of 12 members, including the Union of Indigenous Nomadic Tribes of Iran (UNINOMAD) and the World Atlas of Indigenous Peoples’ Territories (WAIPT), was collaborating on the project.

Their solution,[ LandMark](&lt;|url|&gt;), was launched in November of the same year.** [**LandMark](&lt;|url|&gt;) aims to make lands and the peoples who live on them visible and to help indigenous communities protect and secure their land rights. The centerpiece of the project is an interactive world map, one different than anything you might find on Google.

Users­ — mostly communities, governments, companies, development agencies, and researchers — can zoom in on specific regions. Areas that have been mapped are color coded to distinguish between indigenous and community land. Indigenous land is collectively held and governed by indigenous peoples with distinct social, cultural, or economic characteristics; community land is collectively held by a community (a grouping of individuals and families that share common interests in a definable local land area) regardless of recognition under national statutory law.

Color also shows whether the land is formally recognized and indicates its legal status, including whether it is held under customary tenure or if a formal land claim has been submitted. Every area illustrates assets — contributions that indigenous peoples and communities make to managing land and, in turn, protecting the environment — as well as specific threats, such as infrastructure development, mining, and timber extraction.
> # LandMark offers a current picture of the world, rather than the historical one frozen in most maps.

The data behind the map is aggregated from a network of recognized experts and organizations, some gathered at the community level, and some from government records. Traceability and verification processes are strict. Sources are attributed on the platform and data is reviewed by LandMark and external experts.

LandMark offers a current picture of the world, rather than the historical one frozen in most maps. Some peoples use the data to reclaim land that was once recognized as being theirs; others want their land, and their role as the best managers of that land,** **legally recognized for the first time, and hope that inclusion on LandMark will help.

In the Philippines, LandMark’s partner organization is the Philippine Association for Intercultural Development (PAFID), which is using LandMark to collect environmental statistics like forest coverage and soil carbon data. Positive reports help communities argue that they can manage their land better than the state and, in turn, that their claims should be legally recognized.

The platform is also making an impact at an international level, says Peter Veit, the director of land rights resources at WRI and a LandMark co-founder. “A lot of companies and investors are beginning to shift from dealing with land conflicts on a case-by-case basis to a more institutional approach.” They are interested in understanding whether the land that they are targeting for investment — or land that governments are offering them — is clear of counter claims and potential conflicts.

Many companies now have internal risk assessment platforms that incorporate LandMark data. This has big implications, according to Veit. Not only does it mean that companies may avoid targeting indigenous and community land, but they can now access data about who holds the territory. “Then they know who to negotiate with over access to it,” he explains. “That’s a huge opportunity for communities to deal with the threats that they face.”

LandMark also allows communities to connect and compare data. In Australia, advocates of Aboriginal rights have used legal data available on the platform to show that federal laws aimed at protecting indigenous land rights in Australia are nowhere near as strong as they are in some other countries.

Back in Peru, communities are now using maps in their campaigns, says Smith. “Whether it is mining, whether it be oil spillage on their lands, whether it be illegal invasion of their lands, they’re using those maps.”

The scale of the project is vast. LandMark has so far mapped around 12.4% of the world’s collectively held land. South, Central, and North America, along with Australia and parts of South Africa, are widely mapped but large areas of Africa, Asia, and Europe still need data. LandMark is being restructured so that the team can access a wider network of partners and funding, and new data from Nepal and Mozambique has just been added.

This global collaboration faces complex challenges and uses 21st century technology, but its aim is age-old. Like any map, LandMark is potent visual tool. It lets indigenous peoples and communities show the rest of the world a simple fact: we are here, on this land.<|endoftext|>

# Scientists Release the First Image of a Massive Black Hole

## Here’s how they did it

![Credit: Handout/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Handout/Getty Images*

Of all the enigmatic phenomena in our universe, there’s perhaps one that has captured our attention and imagination the most, even though we had never actually seen one: the black hole. These space objects are so dense that even light cannot escape their grip. Ever since Einstein first proposed their existence, we’ve made simulations, art, and CGI versions of what we imagine black holes could look like. But it wasn’t until this morning that we saw a black hole for the first time. We have finally gazed into the cosmic abyss.

On Wednesday morning, teams of scientists around the world who work on an experiment called the Event Horizon Telescope released a much anticipated image of the ultramassive black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy. This galaxy is 55 million light-years away in the Virgo supercluster, and it is 6.5 billion times more massive than our sun. “You’re looking at a black hole that is essentially the size of our entire solar system,” says Sera Markoff, EHT team member and professor of theoretical astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam.

Capturing an image of a black hole is exceedingly difficult. It’s not like taking a photo of a planet, or a cluster of stars, or even another galaxy. It’s not as simple as using the Hubble Space Telescope. “We never thought this was possible,” says Priyamvada Natarajan, professor of astronomy and physics at Yale University.

Natarajan is not involved with the EHT team, but she’s been studying black holes for nearly 20 years. “We’re in the grip of a black hole!” she said, hardly able to contain her excitement. She and many others in her field have waited years for this data. It did not disappoint.

The Event Horizon Telescope is an array of radio telescopes around the world that are collectively so powerful that together they create a telescope as large as the Earth. The images and data they produce are so massive that the scientists had to wait to capture the images until hard drives existed that could hold all the information. “It is a huge technical feat,” says Natarajan.
> # “It’s a reframing of our cosmic view.”

The sheer quantity of information from the EHT left researchers with five petabytes of recorded data. “Thats’s more than a half a ton of hard drives,” says EHT team member Daniel Marrone. “It’s equivalent to 5,000 years of MP3 files or the entire selfie collection over a lifetime for 40,000 people.”

Despite the mind-boggling hard drives needed to complete the work, the actual image of M87 is only a few hundred kilobytes. “We had to collapse five petabytes of data into an image that’s five billion times smaller,” Marrone says.

The image itself contains enormous scientific value. “In astronomy and physics, pictures are extremely meaningful,” says Natarajan. “They have agency to shift our thinking. They have a transformative capacity because you can see things visually because most of the things in astronomy we are dealing with the unseen.

“It’s a reframing of our cosmic view.”

The photo shared by the EHT team shows the black hole in M87 as it was 55 million years ago, just 10 million years after the dinosaurs went extinct. The picture that we see is light that traversed the cosmos to reach our telescopes. It’s not new. It’s just new to us.

For the first time, we can see the accretion disc and the shadow of the event horizon—the point of light with no return—which is the dark circular shape in the center. Scientists are still unsure how the debris surrounding a black hole falls in or gets expelled out, so this photo will likely help answer some of those questions.

“Now we know that superheated, supermassive black holes existed at the center of most galaxies, but because they are so small, we’ve never seen one,” says Shep Doeleman, EHT director and Harvard senior research fellow.

We can only see black holes while they are eating material around them. If a star passes too close, for example, the mass of the black hole will rip that star to shreds, creating markers of gas and magnetic signals we can study from Earth.

Black holes also burp and emit high energy jets of gas that we can see. These jets are so intense they can carry the power of 10 billion supernova. While this ultramassive black hole is dead, maxed out on mass and no longer able to take in any more material, the sheer gravitational influence of it destroys anything that comes close, giving off beacons of light for us to see.

The findings from the EHT team are unprecedented and are sure to usher in a new era of our understanding of black holes as well as general relativity, dark matter, and a myriad cosmic mysteries.

“The EHT project is dedicated to the idea that we can make an image of this black hole,” said Doeleman. “We have seen what we thought was unseeable. Here it is.”<|endoftext|>

# Tech Platforms Love Moving Fast — Except When Their Users Are in Trouble

## The CEOs of YouTube and Twitter are being far more cautious in addressing the problems of their platforms than they were in building them

![Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty*

Jack Dorsey and Susan Wojcicki seem to have little in common, aside from their jobs—running two of the biggest platforms on the internet.

Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube, comes across as an accomplished, even-keeled professional who blends in and shuns the spotlight. A Harvard graduate from a distinguished Silicon Valley family, she took over YouTube after successful stints at Intel and Google. A rare profile of her in the *New York Times* called her “[the most measured person in tech](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and CEO, is an unkempt idealist who throws himself into wellness trends, mindfulness retreats, and facial grooming experiments. An NYU dropout who once aspired to be a fashion designer, he helped start Twitter after he was rejected for a job at a shoe store. His [onstage interview at the annual TED conference](&lt;|url|&gt;) was only the latest in his ongoing tour of the media circuit.
> # Both Twitter and YouTube are rife with abuse, harassment, misinformation, manipulation, and every manner of extremism.

Although the CEOs are quite different, their recent media appearances revealed they are grappling with the same kinds of problems on their respective platforms — and taking a strikingly similar approach to addressing them. This approach could be charitably described as deliberate, even philosophical, and that deliberation stands in stark contrast to the breakneck speed at which the platforms were built, grew, and continue to operate.

Both Twitter and YouTube are rife with abuse, harassment, misinformation, manipulation, and every manner of extremism. One platform is stalked by armies of human trolls and bots lobbing death threats at scale. The other sucks users through wormholes to parallel realities where Earth is flat, vaccines cause autism, and radical ideologies are the cure for society’s ills. Both [struggled to contain](&lt;|url|&gt;) the viral circulation of livestreams of the New Zealand massacre.

Neither CEO is blind to this — not anymore, at least. The *Times* found Wojcicki reflecting on a staff meeting she called to address the appearance on YouTube of bestiality images alongside children’s content. At TED, Dorsey sounded more like one of Twitter’s many critics than the company’s CEO: “It’s a pretty terrible situation when you’re coming to a service where ideally you want to learn something about the world, and you spend the majority of your time reporting abuse, receiving abuse, receiving harassment,” he said.

Both executives acknowledged that they had failed to anticipate the severity of the problems their platforms would create as they grew. This explanation has started to feel more like an excuse in the tech world. No doubt it’s true that the people who built the platforms that now dominate the global flow of information underestimated how their creations could be misused. But at this point, intentions are irrelevant. What matters is how they respond. And to judge by their recent words and their actions until now, Wojcicki and Dorsey are responding very slowly.

It’s true that both companies have begun hiring more human reviewers and using machine learning to flag potential policy violations, with YouTube focusing more on problematic content and Twitter on patterns of user behavior. But neither has undertaken fundamental changes to their algorithm or the structure of the platform, and both have used freedom of speech as an excuse for inaction.

This timid approach seems to come from the top. A Bloomberg feature in April painted Wojcicki and her team as [obsessed with growth and engagement metrics](&lt;|url|&gt;), even as YouTube’s problems mounted. When her employees pressed her to address problematic content, Wojcicki reportedly demurred, saying it wasn’t her job to decide what users could say or see. In the *Times* profile, Wojcicki took issue with that characterization, pointing to the sheer complexity of content moderation. “It’s not like there is one lever we can pull and say, ‘Hey, let’s make all these changes,’ and everything would be solved,” she said. “That’s not how it works.”

The *Times*’ Daisuke Wakabayashi sat in on a meeting in which Wojcicki and her deputies pondered — in painstaking depth — the proper response to a potentially dangerous video called the “Condom Challenge.” They ultimately decided not to remove it. While more sympathetic than Bloomberg’s portrayal, the *Times* profile concluded that Wojcicki’s “deliberate style may be at odds with the pace and scale of horrors and just plain stupidity that relentlessly arises on YouTube.”

That will sound awfully familiar to anyone who has followed Dorsey’s handling of Twitter’s ongoing troubles with bots, neo-Nazis, and widespread harassment of women and people of color. While Dorsey has been admirably forthcoming about Twitter’s shortcomings, he rarely matches his frank words with decisive actions. An official update on Twitter’s progress toward its goals of healthier interactions showed mostly incremental improvements, such as a [16 percent decline in reports of abuse](&lt;|url|&gt;) by users whom the victim doesn’t follow. The company is justifiably proud of the fact that it is now proactively flagging 38 percent of the abusive content on which it takes action, but the bigger surprise is that the company was doing none of this work as recently as a year ago. Until 2018 — more than a decade after the company was founded and years after the scale of abuse it enabled [had become clear](&lt;|url|&gt;) — Twitter had put the entire burden of reporting on its users.
> # Taking action will help only if it’s the right action, and caution is warranted when making changes to platforms this important — and not just to shareholders.

A year ago, I praised Dorsey for “[rethinking everything](&lt;|url|&gt;)” and admitting he didn’t have all the answers at a time when Facebook was acting as though it did. That’s the first step toward reshaping a platform around the understanding that algorithms will always be gamed, anonymity can shield the hateful, and not all engagement is good. I still believe Dorsey wants to build a better Twitter. To that end, the company has begun looking for healthier metrics to prioritize, and has rolled out a [beta-test app called Twttr](&lt;|url|&gt;) to test new ideas. So far, it has tested features such as Reddit-style reply threads, hiding replies that may be abusive or spammy, and making like counts and retweet counts less readily visible. At TED, Dorsey suggested that the entire concept of likes and follower counts may be incentivizing the wrong sorts of interactions.

The *Times* profile finds Wojcicki waxing similarly philosophical, albeit perhaps partly to counter her mercenary image, which began to take shape in Bloomberg’s exposé. “One way I think about some of the decisions is putting myself in the future and thinking: in five or 10 years, what will they say?” Wojcicki said. “If someone were to look back on the decisions that we’re making, would they feel we were on the right side of history? Would I feel proud? Will my children feel like I made good decisions?”

These are the kinds of questions a reflective political leader might ask, and they underscore the sheer power these CEOs wield—not always willingly. Taking action will help only if it’s the right action, and caution is warranted when making changes to platforms this important — and not just to shareholders.

But posing the right questions now does not excuse the failure to ask them years ago, and it does not excuse these companies’ ongoing inability to devise solutions proportional to the problems they’ve created. It’s hard to shake the sense that these companies and their leaders were far less risk-averse regarding features that might help them grow, make money, and demolish competitors than they are when it comes to making sure their creations don’t ruin people’s lives.

TED’s Chris Anderson kept pounding this point in his interview with Dorsey. Calling the CEO the “[captain of the Twittanic](&lt;|url|&gt;),” Anderson told Dorsey, “There are people on board in steerage” who are saying, “‘We’re worried about the iceberg ahead!’ And you go, ‘That is a powerful point’ and ‘Our ship frankly hasn’t been built properly for steering as well as it might.’ And we say ‘Please do something!’ And you go to the bridge, and we’re waiting, and we look in, and you’re showing this extraordinary calm — but we’re all standing outside saying, ‘Jack, turn the fucking wheel!’”

One explanation for why Dorsey and his counterparts have been reluctant to turn the wheel is that it’s not obvious what alternate course they could chart, given the vessels they have built. Hate, bullying, violence, and extremism are endemic in social media, as they are in the real world, and it’s probably impossible to eradicate them on a platform of YouTube or Twitter’s scale. The hard question these companies face is how to contain them, and avoid exacerbating them, without destroying a business model that’s premised on automation. The answer almost certainly involves forgoing some growth and profits and paying more humans to moderate content, which can be a tough sell to investors.

Perhaps the deeper reason these leaders have been reluctant to make those sacrifices is that they don’t actually see real-world harm as an iceberg. Facebook has livestreamed murders, suicides, and now a terrorist massacre, yet Mark Zuckerberg is still CEO and the company is posting record profits. The unintended consequences of these platforms’ flaws may be fatal to others, but not to the companies or their leaders.

For tech companies and their CEOs, the real iceberg is stagnant user growth, declining revenues, shareholder panic. Confronted with Anderson’s metaphor, Dorsey reminded the audience that when he took over the company, his first job was to steer it away from financial ruin and irrelevance. He succeeded because he didn’t dither. He acted.

If Facebook’s former unofficial motto of “move fast and break things” summed up the blitzscaling mentality that gave rise to modern social media, with all its power and problems, it might make sense that the antidote would be to “move slowly and fix things.” The problem is, the platforms are still breaking as rapidly as ever, and only the fixing is moving slowly.<|endoftext|>

# It’s Time to Say Goodbye to Our Beloved Mars Rover

## It’s Time to Say Goodbye to Our Beloved Mars Rover

### The Opportunity Rover’s mission on Mars is coming to a close

When the Opportunity Rover — formally known as Mars Exploration Rover B — arrived on Mars on Jan. 25, 2004, it impacted the planet in a suit of giant airbags. The rover landed, bounced up 10 feet, slammed back down, and jumped another 22 feet before eventually settling on the surface for good. The airbags deflated, the enclosure opened up, and Opportunity slowly unfurled its wing-like solar panels to begin collecting the Martian sunlight it would need to survive.

Mission Control at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was filled with cheers. “We’re on Mars, everybody!” yelled JPL’s Rob Manning. After the first color image was sent back to Earth, team member Steve Squyres declared that “Opportunity has touched down in a bizarre, alien landscape. I’m flabbergasted. I’m astonished. I’m blown away.”

The Opportunity Rover’s mission was planned to last only 90 days. But the rover survived long past its expected expiration. Fourteen years later, it was still sending NASA data from the red planet.

But in June 2018, the most severe Martian dust storm in recorded history covered Opportunity in darkness and prevented sunlight from reaching the solar-powered rover. As a result, Opportunity could no longer communicate with Earth. June 10, 2018, was the last day we heard from the rover. Its last photos were of the sun completely blacked out.

It’s expected that NASA will soon announce the end of the mission.

Since the rover’s calls to Earth stopped, team members, NASA employees, and fans of the mission have taken to social media to beg NASA not to give up on the rover. They shared stories about what the spacecraft has meant to them. Some met their spouses while working on the mission, and some pursued careers in engineering and science with the sole purpose of working with Opportunity — or “Oppy” as it’s colloquially referred to.



“I drove Spirit and Opportunity for nine years,” Scott Maxwell, a former Mars rover planning lead for Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity at the JPL, [shared with me via Twitter](&lt;|url|&gt;). “My cat died. My dad died. I got divorced. And I met the woman I would marry, now the mother of my son. Through all the ups and downs, Opportunity was there: a constant, a joy. She became the thing we could rely on.”

![A selfie from Opportunity. Photo courtesy of *NASA/JPL/Doug Ellison*](<|image|>)*A selfie from Opportunity. Photo courtesy of *NASA/JPL/Doug Ellison**

As I’ve watched NASA scientists and space enthusiasts share their grief online, I’ve contemplated why it’s so upsetting to let a rover go. After all, it’s been 14 years. To say this mission was a success would be an understatement. It’s not the first time [we’ve said goodbye to a spacecraft](&lt;|url|&gt;) either.

But the loss severs a connection to the cosmos — a place that’s off-limits for humans. In 2012, Opportunity took a panoramic photo of an area called Cape Tribulation from the rim of the Endeavor Crater. NASA’s JPL issued a press release with the photo titled [*Mars Panorama: The Next Best Thing to Being There](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

![Opportunity’s 2012 panoramic image of Mars. Photo courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell/Arizona State University](<|image|>)*Opportunity’s 2012 panoramic image of Mars. Photo courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell/Arizona State University*

These spacecraft are, in many ways, better explorers than astronauts. Humans can be much more efficient when it comes to conducting science, but the risk is also significantly higher. Even so, humans dreamed about these spacecraft, designed them, launched them into space, and operated them. They feel as human as a robotic spacecraft can possibly be.

Opportunity has allowed us to be on Mars for 14 years. There are other missions that will follow, not just to Mars but to entire other worlds. We are at Jupiter right now. We will go back to Saturn and its moons. Someday we’ll visit Venus and fly by Uranus and Neptune again.

After seven quiet months, the Opportunity Rover still sits with a permanent view of Perseverance Valley. If I look at a photo, I can imagine being there, gazing down into a silent Mars. There will always be boundaries for human kind. But our spacecraft can take us anywhere we want to go.<|endoftext|>

# Post-Theranos, Startups Are Still Out for Blood

## ‘Hubris is very dangerous’: How blood diagnostic companies are distancing themselves from Theranos’ fraud charges

![Illustration: [Ariel Davis](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Ariel Davis](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Tanay Tandon ditched class the day Elizabeth Holmes came to speak to his fellow freshmen at Stanford University a few years ago. At the time, says Tandon, now 22, the campus community was already skeptical about Theranos, Holmes’ now-infamous blood testing company. That’s because her talk took place around the time John Carreyou at the *Wall Street Journal* published his first story questioning Theranos’ legitimacy. According to Tandon’s classmates, Holmes — who dropped out of Stanford to start her company — spent part of her lecture explaining to the students why she felt the accusations against her were wrong.

“It was the brink of everything starting to explode,” Tandon says about her visit.

The meteoric rise and fall of Holmes and Theranos has been the subject of the [*Wall Street Journal* investigation](&lt;|url|&gt;), a bestselling book, a podcast, and a documentary. Most damningly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Holmes and former Theranos president Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani “with raising more than $700 million from investors through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.”
> # “It has been a black eye for the field to have this thing occurring.”

Tandon is on a leave of absence from Stanford and is now the founder of a finger-prick blood testing startup called [Athelas](&lt;|url|&gt;), which he hopes will one day allow chronically ill people to test themselves in the privacy of their own homes. Despite the similarities between Tandon and Holmes, Tandon says the swirl of negative publicity surrounding Theranos has ultimately created more, rather than less, interest in the field.

Athelas is one of a handful of biotech companies seeking simpler blood-based diagnostics. [Karius](&lt;|url|&gt;) is a company that says it can identify more than 1,000 pathogens from a single blood draw in order to quickly diagnose infectious diseases. [MindX Sciences](&lt;|url|&gt;) is an Indianapolis-based startup that’s developing blood tests for psychiatric disorders. Flux Biosciences, a company co-founded by Theranos whistleblower Tyler Shultz, uses blood, urine, or saliva to “measure biomarkers related to exercise, stress, fertility, and diet and will correlate those measurements to sleep and activity data collected from wearable technology.”

Tandon argues that while Theranos’ product was clearly fraudulent, the sheer amount of investor interest indicates that it would have been worth billions if Holmes could have delivered on her promises. “For an investor, there’s really no better proof that there’s a market here,” he says. “It’s just going to take the right company, the right team, the right people who have the right kinds of ethics and, obviously, the right technology, to pull it off.”

Still, Tandon notes ruefully, “The Theranos saga really took a lot of the oxygen out of the room.”

In traditional science and medicine, peer-reviewed data is king. So, when Alexander Niculescu III, MD, saw Holmes gracing the covers of magazines in her trademark black turtleneck, boasting about how her blood test machine was going to change the world, he too was skeptical. He wanted to see data that backed up her claims, and, most important, he wanted to see data that showed how her technology worked. She was potentially a competitor, after all.

Niculescu, co-founder of MindX Sciences and a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine, says that because his company is deeply rooted in academia — and based outside Silicon Valley — the Theranos controversy hasn’t affected it. But he does see an impact for biotech startups more generally.

“It has been a black eye for the field to have this thing occurring,” Niculescu says. “For the credibility of the field and for the general public to have confidence, [Theranos] was a setback.”

For Niculescu, one major tell that Theranos lacked credibility was, ironically, one of the major attractions for investors: the company’s star-studded board. It included the likes of Henry Kissinger and George Shultz but lacked anyone with what Niculescu refers to as “domain expertise,” meaning health and medicine credentials.

Niculescu and Tandon each stressed that their companies have medical doctors on their respective boards and that their results have been published in [peer-reviewed](&lt;|url|&gt;) [journals](&lt;|url|&gt;). Tandon says he never saw Theranos and Athelas as competitors or even as existing in the exact same field. Theranos operated as a central laboratory, he explained, while Athelas was founded to build blood testing devices that would analyze a finger prick’s worth of blood in the home or other non-laboratory settings.

“There was overlap in the space, but in application, we’re quite different,” Tandon says.

Niculescu says MindX Sciences — which is developing blood tests for psychiatric disorders, as well as creating a diagnostic test for evaluating pain — is more on the scientific and biotech side than Theranos was.

“We’re not developing a machine that does laboratory testing. We use standard machines for our testing,” he explains. “We’re just developing the science and the tests that would be used to make the diagnosis and help inform treatment.”

R. Matthew Neff is the president and CEO of MindX Sciences and has written [several](&lt;|url|&gt;) [articles](&lt;|url|&gt;) about Theranos for the *Indianapolis Business Journal*. He fears that the Theranos scandal could shake the faith of consumers, who trust their doctors and pharmacists to deal with reputable companies.
> # Perhaps the biggest fallacy is the notion that Mark Zuckerberg’s motto, “move fast and break things,” is an appropriate strategy for a health biotech startup.

“Theranos was definitely a failure of multiple systems,” Neff says. “There should have been publications. There should have been diligence done by Walgreens. There should have been diligence done by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.”

Instead of demanding scientific proof from Holmes that her company did what she claimed it could do, many people took Holmes at her word.

“Everybody wanted another Steve Jobs, and here comes this charismatic, blonde-haired, blue-eyed scientist who looks a lot like the female version of Steve Jobs,” Neff says. “There’s a psychological tendency of people to see what they want to see, and in Elizabeth Holmes’ case, they did.”

But perhaps the biggest fallacy, according to Tandon, Niculescu, and Neff, is the notion that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s famous motto, “move fast and break things,” is an appropriate strategy for running a health biotech startup.

“There have to be many more safeguards when you go into people’s health care,” Niculescu says. “That might work for renting apartments and ride-shares, but when you go into health care, I think that hubris is very dangerous and can backfire.”

That doesn’t mean health care startups can’t be innovative and experimental, according to Tandon. “When you’re just working with R&D samples in a lab, you can totally move fast and break things,” he says. “But when you are in production and when you’re returning results to patients, that doesn’t apply anymore. That’s the real distinction. You can’t be in production as a health care company and be actively breaking things.”<|endoftext|>

# You Can Now Order STI Tests Online to Take in the Comfort of Your Own Home

## You Can Now Order STI Tests Online to Take in the Comfort of Your Own Home

### Telemedicine companies think the onerous process of in-office testing dissuades patients

![Photo: Kwanchai Lerttanapunyaporn/EyeEm/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Kwanchai Lerttanapunyaporn/EyeEm/Getty Images*

Back in my college days, I was a volunteer at [GHAP](&lt;|url|&gt;), Columbia University’s queer health program — and, more specifically, the wing of the student health center that was responsible for providing HIV testing and education. As part of my volunteer work, I provided counseling to students prior to their HIV tests, chatting with them about their sexual histories and identities, their behaviors and choices, and potential strategies for risk reduction.

The counseling I did was part of New York state’s legal requirements for HIV testing, which mandate counseling prior to receiving the test. But it was also representative of the dominant mode of thinking at the time about reproductive and sexual health care. HIV testing, along with other STI testing and sexual health care services, was seen as a prime opportunity to connect with people who might otherwise be disconnected from the health care system. Once you’d gotten them through the clinic doors, the thinking went, you could connect them to education and prevention resources, as well as take time to chat about their behavior and encourage risk reduction. Without that in-person visit — or that legally mandated counseling — some providers feared patients might miss out on crucial services.

Almost two decades later, however, that thinking has begun to change. While some providers still see in-person visits and counseling as an essential component of reproductive health care, others worry that onerous requirements can function as a kind of gatekeeping, serving mainly to discourage potential patients from seeking needed care. Patients who’ve dealt with discrimination from providers, who live in remote areas far from quality providers, or whose busy schedules make it hard to get to the clinic may not be willing to jump through hoops to access health services — a fact that becomes more troubling when you consider that these people are often the vulnerable patients who may be the most in need of services like STI testing.

Rather than upping the requirements associated with reproductive health care, some providers are focused on reducing barriers to access. Reproductive health care telemedicine startup Nurx recently added [full-panel STI testing](&lt;|url|&gt;) to its slate of services, except in New York, where legislation doesn’t allow at-home collection and testing. Although over-the-counter STI tests have been available for a few years, telemedicine has made them much more accessible: If you’re anxious about your STI status, you no longer need to make an appointment with your doctor, head to your local clinic, or hope your drugstore has kits in stock. You just need to go online and order an at-home testing kit.

STI testing was a natural extension of Nurx’s existing services. From its beginnings as an online birth control pill supplier, Nurx has expanded into offering clients at-home HPV screenings and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for consumers concerned about HIV prevention. “We listened a lot to our existing users, who were asking for [STI tests],” says Jessica Horwitz, vice president of clinical services at Nurx. She notes that birth control pill and PrEP users are likely more interested in seeking out regular STI testing.

The company’s sales data suggests that hunch was correct. According to Horwitz, within a week of the launch, Nurx had sold several hundred kits, many purchased by people in places where access to STI testing is thin on the ground. Horwitz adds that Nurx’s first STI kit customer was a 30-year-old woman from Georgia. After purchasing her comprehensive testing kit, she messaged the company to thank them for providing the service — in her hometown, the woman explained, there was no other way to access STI testing services. (Currently, 40% of Nurx’s birth control patients are based in the nine Southern [states it currently serves](&lt;|url|&gt;); a 10th Southern state, Kentucky, debuted on the platform on July 23.)

It’s not just telemedicine startups that are experimenting with new ways to deliver these essential reproductive health care services. In rural and conservative states, where residents have limited access to full-service reproductive health care or feel anxious about accessing such services in person, sexual and reproductive health clinics are rethinking what it means to serve their communities.
> # “We’re also trying to innovate service delivery so that we can reckon with the real barriers that our patients face.”

At [Maine Family Planning](&lt;|url|&gt;), abortion pills and transgender health care services are available through the clinic’s telemedicine platform; although STI testing has not yet been added, community organizer Cait Vaughan says the organization is open to the possibility. “We’re trying to innovate service delivery so that we can reckon with the real barriers that our patients face,” Vaughn explains, barriers that can include a busy schedule, remote location, or discomfort or anxiety about receiving in-person care.

Despite fears that making it easy for patients to access reproductive health care from the comfort of their homes might erode the quality of care, the health care providers I spoke with are confident their patients are still getting access to everything they need — and, in some cases, might even be receiving better care than they would in the clinic. “Not being in the same place allows for [more openness]” about a sensitive subject like sex, Vaughn notes.

And in many cases, the choice isn’t between receiving care in a clinic or at home; it’s between receiving care at home or not receiving it all. Katy Leopard, assistant director of the Memphis-based clinic [Choices](&lt;|url|&gt;), explains that in some cases, requiring a clinic visit “can be a nonstarter to receiving the care.” Patients who’ve been traumatized by negative health care experiences are often uninterested in accessing in-person care. Giving them the option to access care online may be the only way to reach them at all.

“It is almost a little paternalistic,” says Leopard of the long-standing belief that seeing a doctor in person is the only way to receive quality health care. “It’s not like our patients don’t know and understand [their health care needs]… I think there can be benefits to coming in [to a clinic], like connecting with support services. But there are creative ways of making that happen.”

“We come from a long feminist legacy of trusting patients,” Vaughan says. “At the heart of it, we’re trying to continue to trust our patients.” An organization that is truly committed to caring for its patients is one that is able to meet them where they’re at. When it comes to reproductive health care, that increasingly means using telemedicine to bridge a gap of a few — or a few hundred — miles.<|endoftext|>

# It’s a Huge Mistake to Memorize Your Passwords

## It’s a Huge Mistake to Memorize Your Passwords

### *Here’s what to do instead — and which services you should use*

![Credit: Andrew Brookes/Cultura/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Andrew Brookes/Cultura/Getty*

You shouldn’t know any of your passwords. But there’s a decent chance you do — many of us fall into a default pattern of memorizing one or two and using them across countless websites and services.

That’s a mistake. If you’re still doing this, or if you know any of your passwords at all, it’s time to change it up. These days, the only secure password is one you can’t possibly remember. Studies have repeatedly shown that [password reuse](&lt;|url|&gt;) is the most common security blunder people make. When a single service gets hacked — [which](&lt;|url|&gt;) [happens](&lt;|url|&gt;) [constantly](&lt;|url|&gt;) — hackers are able to guess which other services you use and break into those with the same password.

This tactic, called credential stuffing, is used by hackers to target people’s most personal information. Say you signed up years ago for a service like last.fm, which was [breached](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2012; if your banking password is the same, you might be kissing your identity goodbye simply because hackers are able to guess that the passwords matched.

If you’re lucky, you’ve probably been only caught up in a single breach, but the reality is that the majority of us have been affected multiple times over the years. All it takes to find out is typing your email address into [Have I Been Pwned](&lt;|url|&gt;), a free service run by security researcher Troy Hunt.
> # You shouldn’t know any of your passwords for the services you use. Most importantly, every single site or app you’re using should use a unique password.

The site, which tracks publicly reported breaches, who was caught in them, and what information was breached, will reveal how many companies have failed to keep your data safe. I ran my own email address through it and found I’ve been breached more than 10 times. Thankfully, in most of these cases, the password I used for each site was unique.

In 2019, the only way to completely protect yourself from a password breach is to log off, delete all your accounts, and live a hermit’s life in the woods. If the offline lifestyle isn’t for you, then it’s time to manage your exposure.

## What you should be doing

Here’s one fact you should memorize: every single site or app you’re using should use a unique password.

That’s where password managers come in. In a way, they’re similar to those little password books many families kept next to their computers in the ‘90s–they store all of your passwords for easy retrieval.

Unlike password books, however, these tools are much more secure, locked by a complex “master” password that only you know, which renders the contents of the digital safe accessible only by you. When you sign up for a new website, you fill in all of your details like normal. When you reach the password field, instead of typing in that password you always use, you click the manager’s icon in your browser, unlock it, and generate a new, random password. These should be longer and more complex than you would ever be able to memorize — and they’ll be stored for easy access later.

The next time you return to that service, you can click the password manager’s icon (or use a keyboard shortcut) to instantly log in. If you haven’t unlocked your password safe recently, you’ll need to type the “master” password again, which unlocks the safe for a set period of time and magically logs you into the service.

While centralizing your passwords in a single tool might seem like a bad idea, they’re designed to protect you. They use strong encryption and make it easier to practice better security in your daily life.

## Which password manager should I use?

As[ with VPN services](&lt;|url|&gt;), there are a dizzying array of password managers out there. It’s important to choose a trustworthy tool, because whatever you settle on should work for the long haul — it’s not exactly fun to switch password managers.

Here are a few solid options.

### **My pick: [1Password](&lt;|url|&gt;)**

1Password is the gold standard in the password manager space, with apps available for macOS, Windows, web browsers, Android, and iOS. I’ve tried the majority of password managers out there over the years, and 1Password checks all of my boxes. It hasn’t been subjected to a serious data breach of its own, offers simple synchronization to all of your devices, detects which of your accounts have been affected by a breach, and quickly adopts new technology to make life easier — like unlocking your safe with Apple’s Face ID on your iPhone.

1Password costs money to use (starting at $2.99 per month), but it offers a family plan for multiple users, so you can secure everyone you care about. And paying for a password manager means the company behind it is motivated to protect you as best it can.

Out of all the tools I’ve used, 1Password offers the best balance of simplicity and strong security.

### **Runner-up: [Dashlane](&lt;|url|&gt;)**

If you’re looking for a little more out of your password manager, Dashlane is a great, younger alternative to 1Password. It does the same basic things well but offers additional tools, like a feature that can automatically change passwords on supported services on a regular basis.

I really like Dashlane, but its apps don’t feel as polished as 1Password’s. The company is also slower to add new features, and the subscription is a [little more expensive at $60 per year](&lt;|url|&gt;).

### **Honorable mention: [KeePass](&lt;|url|&gt;)**

If you can’t swing a monthly fee, that doesn’t mean you have to miss out. KeePass is an open-source password manager with decent features and a community of developers working together to build a free tool for everyone to use.

Because it’s open source, the code behind KeePass isn’t a secret, so anyone can read it and be sure that it’s secure. That also means hackers can too, but historically that hasn’t been an issue.

One major difference, however, is usability. The polish you see in 1Password and Dashlane isn’t present here, so the app isn’t as user-friendly, nor is it as fast to come to new platforms. You get what you pay for.

## **Other tools**

**LastPass** is a well-known option, but it was [subject to a breach back in 2015](&lt;|url|&gt;), which gives me pause. Plus, its apps are largely browser-based, so they don’t feel as easy to use as the competition.

**Apple Keychain**, which is built into iOS and macOS, is convenient, but I don’t recommend it. While it’s better for your security than nothing at all, it’s far less sophisticated than a dedicated tool, and it’s tied to your Apple account — which makes it an easy target if attackers break into your Apple ID.

## One last thing: choosing a master password

We’re almost there; the last thing you need to know is how to choose the “master” password to protect all of your individual logins.

Experts have varying advice on the subject, but [many suggest](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the best master password is difficult to guess and easy to remember. This approach was covered [by the web comic XKCD](&lt;|url|&gt;), which suggested a password like “correct horse battery staple.” That’s strange enough to remember, but it’s also difficult to quickly guess at random.

Here’s my advice:

* Think of a set of 3–5 obscure, unrelated words, like “octopus house quark medium.” Again, easy for you to remember, but hard for someone else to predict.

* Tie those words together with an unexpected character, like a ‘-’ or ‘$’ instead of the space bar.

* Combine the two into your master password. In this example, you would get “octopus$house$quark$medium” — which you can practice by repeating to yourself until you remember it.

* Never, ever use this password anywhere else, and do not forget it.

[Some writers disagree with this approach to password creation](&lt;|url|&gt;), because there technically are ways for a hacker to brute-force their way in. But it’s important to remember that security is a spectrum; you can’t fight every battle. For me, this trick works well, and balances human-friendly words with actual security.

Once you’ve locked a master password in, you can start creating new passwords for the services you already use and store them in your password manager for easy login.

I’d highly recommend changing the more important services you use immediately, like your bank, Apple ID, or tax login details, to increase your overall security. For everything else that you’re not using daily, make a habit of changing them as soon as you need to log in with a memorized password. It gets easier as you keep doing it.

Security practices like this aren’t fun or obvious, which is why so few people tend to use them — it takes time to set them up and learn why they’re important. (Perhaps not coincidentally, the two [most popular passwords](&lt;|url|&gt;) are “123456” and “password.”) But take it one step at a time and you’ll help yourself avoid a devastating hack in the future.

If you’re in the habit of using one of these tools, the next time that inevitable email warning that a company was breached comes in, you can sleep much easier: At least the attackers can’t get into absolutely everything*.*<|endoftext|>

# The Gig Economy Makes Workers Vulnerable to Sexual Harassment

## Clients have a good idea of who they’re hiring or letting into their homes, but workers don’t have the same luxury

![Credit: bankrx/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: bankrx/Getty Images*

Inviting someone to your home can be a signal of familial closeness, friendship, or sexual desire. Rarely do we let visitors into our bedrooms or onto our couches. We teach children to never open the door to strangers and to lock the door when their parents leave for work. At the same time, the sharing economy, with its focus on peer-to-peer service, often relies on unknown people entering the home of another unknown person to do things like cook (Kitchensurfing, now defunct) or sleep (Airbnb), or to clean, make minor repairs, or assemble furniture (TaskRabbit). Meanwhile, Lyft and Uber and other app-driven car services involve people getting into a stranger’s vehicle — violating one of the first “stranger danger” rules that many children learn.

In response to many people’s leeriness of strangers, sharing economy companies often promote their background-screening mechanisms. For example, TaskRabbit’s website notes that Taskers must pass an identity check, are screened for criminal offenses, and must attend an orientation. Uber drivers in New York City are required to undergo the same background checks and fingerprinting as taxi drivers. Drivers in other cities and states, however, may undergo only a background check that looks for criminal records within the past seven years; critics [have alleged](&lt;|url|&gt;) that even such [minimal background](&lt;|url|&gt;) checks have been easily sidestepped.

But while workers are screened to varying degrees, clients are not. The terms of service of most peer-to-peer apps ostensibly prevent clients from setting up more than one account, but as long as one has access to multiple email addresses and credit cards, it’s very easy to create numerous identities. Worker profiles are often much more complete than those of clients and include a photo and short biography. TaskRabbit, in particular, requires workers to supply additional information for their profiles before it allows them to “pass” orientation.

As a result, clients can generally rest assured that they have a fairly good idea of who they’re hiring or letting into their homes, but workers don’t have the same luxury. In addition, to protect identities, TaskRabbit provides only the first name and the first initial of a customer’s or worker’s last name. Unless there is an unusual spelling or additional details, Googling for more information is nearly impossible.

In one illustration of the possible danger of entering a stranger’s abode, several TaskRabbits told me that one Tasker had accepted a gig to clean a man’s boat, but their follow-up conversations led the Tasker to become suspicious of his task description. The woman looked up her client online and learned that he was a convicted sex offender. She quickly canceled the task.
> # “[They’d say,] ‘Have some wine. Do you want to smoke [marijuana]?’ Like, ‘I’m okay. Thank you. I have a job after this. I have to get home.’”

Although it’s impossible to determine if this story is a true account, the fact that it was repeated to me several times over the course of my research for my book, *Hustle and Gig*, suggests a sense of discomfort with the imbalance of background checking and resulting risk in the sharing economy. As Jasmine, a 23-year-old worker, put it:
> Well, I don’t know how they do it now, but before, I felt like they would let anybody get on the website as a client. But it was so strict to be a Tasker. And I didn’t like that, because sometimes I would get people who wouldn’t have a profile picture [and] they would have no reviews. They would basically have nothing on their page, but they want to hire you. And I’m like, how is that fair that we have to basically give them blood, and then they will let anybody come on the website? I just feel like you can’t say you’re worried about our safety if you allow any type of person to be on the website… I just think for the safety aspect, it should be verified on both ends.

None of the workers I interviewed, for any of the services, said they had been sexually assaulted on the job. But even though my interview guide didn’t include any questions on sexual harassment, a surprisingly large number of workers mentioned sexually uncomfortable situations. Jasmine noted that some TaskRabbit clients were especially generous when she was in their home: “‘Have some wine. Do you want to smoke [marijuana]?’ Like, ‘I’m okay. Thank you. I have a job after this. I have to get home.’ Those are usually the guys.”

Jasmine also noted that she was sometimes hit on, often through a text message after the task. And then there was the cleaning task where she wasn’t exactly hit on, but an invitation of some sort seemed to be on the table:
> I had one job where, [when] I went the first time, he wasn’t there. He left his key. I cleaned the house. He had his lotion on the side of the table, soiled sheets, like obviously there was some rough-and-tumble before. Okay. So that was, I think, the first test. The second time I went, he wasn’t there again. I did this job three times. It was always the same situation — you know, same dirty-sheet situation, lotion next to the bed, box of condoms, wine on the table. Like, you know what’s going on. So again, I’m just like, whatever. I clean it up. I have my gloves. Blind eye. I’m here to help.
> Third time, he was there. I don’t know how the conversation came up, but he was like, “Does anyone ever hit on you?” All awkward: “Anyone ever hit on you?” I’m like, “Sometimes it gets really uncomfortable.” I’m just speaking as myself, so I’m not thinking of the context. “Yeah, sometimes it’s uncomfortable when I clean for some men and they hit on me or…,” and I said something to that regard. He’s like, “Okay.”
> And two minutes later, he’s like, “I got all my stuff. I’m going to go to the cafe across the street so I’m out of your way.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” And I thought to myself, “Oh my God, was he trying to…?” I think he was testing me those last two times. I don’t know — like they look for opportunities everywhere.

Getting hit on while working isn’t limited to female Taskers. Twentysomething Austin was the only Tasker from outside New York City that I interviewed. A full-time engineer with a relatively high income, he took on TaskRabbit work only in the evenings and on weekends as a source of “quick, easy money for beer or whatever.” In three weeks of tasking, Austin completed more than 20 tasks, ranging from picking up and delivering pillows to a home to installing 250-pound storage shelves on the ceiling of a client’s garage, directly above a Porsche and several Range Rovers — a project he described as “a little bit intimidating.”
> I would say out of the 20 tasks I’ve had, most of them have been — it’s different, it’s different clients. Some of them are older women who just physically can’t do it. Some of them are lazy people. Some of them are guys, whatever, middle-aged guys who just don’t have the ability. But there definitely have been several younger girls or women who, I think, if I was single *[chuckles], *I think I probably could have gotten a date.
> In all honesty, it almost seemed like that was what they’re looking for… but when I said I was married, they’re like, “Oh, okay.” So, yeah, I can definitely see it being like a sort of pseudo dating service, because a good-looking guy comes in and he’s handy.

Many Taskers provided errand-running services or were hired as one-day temps with local companies; as a result, Taskers found themselves in people’s private homes with the clients only a fraction of the time. Kitchensurfing chefs, by virtue of the service’s focus on providing a chef-created meal in the comfort of one’s home, almost always found themselves in people’s homes and interacting with their customers one-on-one. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they also reported more interactions with sexual overtones or other situations that simply made them feel uncomfortable.
> # “He tried to invite me his rooftop to have dinner with him because his girlfriend didn’t show up, and I was like, ‘No, I’m going to leave.’”

For instance, Roxanne, 27, had several clients ask to take selfies with her, including one client she described as “weirding” her out:
> So this guy wanted to take a selfie with me. He was helping me cook. Then he tried to invite me up to his rooftop to have dinner with him because his girlfriend didn’t show up, and I was like, no, I’m going to leave. This is too much. *[Laughing.]*
> I was like, “No, I hope you enjoy your meal and everything.” He was like, “Yeah, it’s really good. You should like stay.”… I just make excuses. I’m like, “Oh, unfortunately, I have another booking, so, you know, maybe some other time. Maybe I’ll see you around again.” I try to leave it civil. I try to make sure the situation doesn’t end up coming off badly, just try to leave it like, “No, you know, thank you anyway, but I’m going to head out,” or something to that extent. I don’t just plainly say, “No, you weirded me out. Now goodbye.”

Just as workers have to be careful about how they convey pain or injury on the job, sharing economy workers also need to be cognizant of how they come across when a client is hitting on them or otherwise suggesting something inappropriate. They know the person who just made them uncomfortable is about to give them a rating in the app.

None of the people I interviewed suggested they would lose their sharing economy gig work if they declined an invitation, but such invitations often created uncomfortable situations for workers and sounded suspiciously close to sexual harassment.

Not only is the issue of sexual harassment rarely touched on by sharing economy companies, but also workers don’t expect to *have *workplace protections. Behavior that would be unacceptable in a corporate office is ignored or explained away as “weird” when it occurs in an employer’s bedroom or kitchen or when the work is allegedly focused on the egalitarianism of peer-to-peer connections. Instead of feeling free to identify this treatment as sexual harassment, workers who find themselves sexually approached by clients struggle to describe what exactly is going on, using terms like “bizarro-land”* *to demonstrate a sense of confusion and discomfort.

# What Will Kill Podcasting?

## It’s probably not what you think

![Photo: avdyachenko/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: avdyachenko/Getty Images*

The *New York Times* posted an article last week entitled “[Have We Hit Peak Podcast?](&lt;|url|&gt;)” For the record, though, I got a brief quote in the article, and I don’t think we have. I just think producing a quality, audience-focused podcast is hard. But podcasting as we know it is very much alive and well.

Still, the article did get me thinking — what could kill podcasting?

I have a thought.

First, here are a couple of things that people say will kill podcasting that will not kill podcasting. The first surfaced [in this interview I did a few months back on KPCC](&lt;|url|&gt;), one of L.A.’s two NPR affiliates, shortly after Spotify’s purchases of Gimlet and Anchor, and right on the heels of the Luminary announcement. With so much money being plowed into the medium, I was asked if the arrival of “big money” podcasting would squelch the voices of independent podcasters and oft-unheard voices whose stories may be crowded out by better-funded, better-marketed content. And will that not “kill” the egalitarian spirit of the Pod?

My glib answer was, “Of course not.” Those voices will only be silenced if they, themselves, stop podcasting, right? Anyone can podcast. Anyone can listen to a podcast. That’s kind of the deal with podcasting. As a medium with an almost nonexistent barrier to entry, it’s one of the best ways for the less heard to be heard. Silence is a choice, not a thing caused by “Big Podcasting.”

Here’s what I didn’t say, though. No one has a right to an audience. Though your cause be just and your hearts be pure, you don’t get handed an audience. Not one single pair of earballs.
> # No one has a right to an audience.

And thus, podcasting simply becomes like every other medium known to humankind. No blogger has the right to an audience, either. Wilkie Collins out-Dickensed Charles Dickens and wrote the first detective story before Poe. But we read Dickens and Poe today, not Collins. Dickens had his own magazine. Go figure.

So, while I agree that it is difficult for some of the voices that may have been ignored or even silenced by other media to be heard in podcasting, the only thing that will kill podcasting is if those voices stop trying. And that has nothing to do with “Big Podcasting.”

The second thing I have heard will kill podcasting is somewhat related to the first: the loss of podcasting’s open, RSS-based standard. I would love to dispense with this by noting that the loss of wax-based cylinders didn’t destroy the recorded music industry, but hey — let’s air this one out a bit and see what we think.

The argument goes something like this: Podcasts that are distributed via paid platforms such as Luminary, or closed ecosystems such as Spotify, are not really podcasts. I’ll go right to the source for this opinion: [Dave Winer](&lt;|url|&gt;), who introduced enclosures to the RSS standard, allowing audio to be distributed in a feed, just like text. In his brief post from 2018, [Podcasts are Feeds](&lt;|url|&gt;), he notes:
> If it doesn’t have an [RSS](&lt;|url|&gt;) feed it isn’t a podcast.
> Please if you make a podcast, remember that.

Similarly, I have heard some podcasters from the earliest days of the medium comment that newer entities were trying to “kill the download” or otherwise cripple the open standards that form the plumbing of podcasting. I am sympathetic towards this line of thought. If RSS is “abandoned,” then the free and open nature of podcasting will be threatened.

Or maybe it’s just RSS that will die. After all, [as Andreessen Horowitz’s Andrew Chen has pointed out](&lt;|url|&gt;), it kind of already has, at least in that it’s something we care to discuss:

![](<|image|>)

This, of course, just means that we take it for granted — RSS is still the way many sites talk to each other — but I post this Google Trends snapshot to make my real point here: People don’t care*.*

Does *This American Life* cease becoming a podcast [if it is consumed on Pandora?](&lt;|url|&gt;) Technically, yes. It’s a stream, not a podcast. There are undoubtedly technocrats out there who, after finally getting their Luddite friend to try a podcast, will sharply correct their nomenclature when told about hearing the “latest podcast on Luminary.” As long as it has taken for the term podcasting to finally sink into the zeitgeist, is this really the hill we want to die on? As I have long said, if you believe podcasting is a format, formats die. If you believe it is a medium, like recorded music, then it evolves.

The atomic unit of the podcast is not RSS. It’s the show.** **(Alex Carter [pointed out on Twitter](&lt;|url|&gt;) that it’s actually the episode, which is fair.)

And anyway, it’s never been up to the creators. It’s always up to the audience. If I put my show on Spotify, it may no longer be a podcast by definition. But what do you think the average Spotify listener will call it? We’ve done a pretty good job normalizing what is a pretty wonky technical term: “podcast.” Why screw this up now?

So, no, I don’t think closed systems like Luminary and Spotify (and many more to come) are going to kill podcasting. If killing RSS kills podcasting, maybe podcasting wasn’t that strong to begin with. If you think that it has to come from a public feed to be called a “podcast,” I respect that. Let’s come up with a different name for non-RSS podcasting, then. I’ll spot you a few: Videodisc, 8-track, MiniDisc, LaserDisc, Betamax, VHS, Cassette, Cassingle, DAT, and MP2. (Ahh, MP2. Did we ever really even know you? I feel like we got off to a bad start.)

If “Big Podcasting” and “Walled Gardens” aren’t going to kill the medium, can anything? Or is podcasting ensured many more years of continuous global growth? I don’t think anything can kill podcasting, really, just like nothing really killed blogging. Some bloggers were killed, maybe.

But I do think that something could kill the podcasting industry — the fat end of the long tail:

Bad, cheap ads.

At their best, podcast ads are a magical blend of relevance, context, relationships, and the pixie dust of an engaged host. I have been scared into buying a SimpliSafe home security system by *To Live and Die in L.A.*, even though I live on the 18th floor of a secure high-rise in Boston. The partnership between Sonos and the wonderfully produced audio of Blackout is about as perfect a marriage as you can get. And Bill Simmons has convinced me that I need to be using ZipRecruiter, though I am not sure why and for what. But I’ll start recruiting something.

These kinds of partnerships are the backbone of podcast advertising. Free from the broadcast radio mandate of pleasing everyone most of the time, podcasts can produce truly targeted content — and advertising — precisely suited to the right audience in the right context. It’s why podcast advertising has commanded, and deserved, a premium in recent years. In fact, it’s not even a premium, as the leading performance marketing vendors in the space will tell you — it’s worth higher CPMs and CPAs because it works really well.

But, warning signs are starting to crop up. In the past few months, I’ve heard a screaming local car commercial dynamically inserted before a national podcast. A network “tune-in” spot promoting live sports inserted as a mid roll, at about twice the volume as the podcast it was shoved into. Pre-recorded insurance company spots on some very risky podcasts. All exactly as I might have heard them on a local commercial radio station. And that is just the first manifestation of the problem.

If you are an avid podcast listener, you know what a turnoff this kind of advertising is. In fact, for many of you, you started listening to podcasts precisely to get away from this sort of thing. The intimate atmosphere of a podcast is not well suited to an ad that has, to be charitable, been produced for a very different environment. In no way am I saying that pre-recorded spots don’t have a place in podcasting. They do. They don’t work as well as host-read live ads, but they work, and they work well enough to be viable. We’ve got years of research at my company ([Edison](&lt;|url|&gt;)) that proves all of it. But using the same ads on podcasts that are used on commercial radio is, at best, unimaginative. At worst, it triggers something far, far more sinister.

I’m hearing about some of these ads being sold for really low CPMs — as low as 20% of the going rate. To a pure-play podcasting entity, rock-bottom CPMs are potentially an existential crisis. Podcast ads are worth more than that. The whole economy of the industry is based on that. But here’s the thing: If the larger media-buying shops start putting out RFPs for $5 buys, and one or more podcast networks take those buys, that sets the rate. And that’s a race to the bottom.

Put yourself in the shoes of a media buyer. You’ve got a buy from a leading national advertiser, and on the one hand, you’ve got a podcast network offering something risky — host-read content, or something bespoke to the show, at (say) a $25 CPM, or another network offering reach across all their shows, using your existing audio/radio creative, for a $5 CPM. Which is the safest bet for your media buying career?

Great content is expensive to produce, and great advertising native to that content’s form and delivery is well worth a premium. But if several large players in the space start taking poorly executed, irrelevant ads at ultra-low (for podcasting) CPMs, that’s going to have repercussions on the economic feasibility of great audio content.

And that, my friends, is what worries me the most.<|endoftext|>

# The One When ‘Star Trek’ Used Technology to Excuse a Horrifyingly Sexist Planet

## The One When ‘Star Trek’ Used Technology to Excuse a Horrifyingly Sexist Planet

### Reflections on ‘Spock’s Brain,’ the worst episode in the series

While its legions of fans will surely disagree, I think when most laymen consider the hallmarks of the original *Star Trek* TV series, they imagine charmingly goofy science fiction and occasional chauvinism, as the crew of the USS Enterprise traveled the universe only to discover it was chock-full of alien women in sexy outfits — most of whom found Captain Kirk irresistible. Many of these original episodes were genuinely great. But there was also complete garbage, like “[Spock’s Brain](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

Not every fan considers “Spock’s Brain” to be the worst episode of classic *Star Trek*, but most have it in the top three. It was the show’s third season premiere, airing in 1968 after NBC had significantly cut its budget, prompting a disgruntled Gene Roddenberry to step back from the series he created. But these problems don’t even come close to justifying the wretchedness of this episode, which embraces horrifyingly overt sexism.

It begins when the Enterprise encounters a spaceship of unknown yet highly advanced design, and a woman suddenly teleports onto the bridge. She’s dressed in her native alien fashion — a purple lamé dress revealing the maximum cleavage allowed on NBC at the time, as well as thigh-high purple leather boots. Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) is not particularly unhappy about this intrusion until the woman presses a doohickey on her wrist, which knocks out every single crew member of the Enterprise simultaneously. When everyone comes to, Dr. Leonard “Bones” McCoy (DeForest Kelley) urgently calls Kirk to the sick bay, where Spock (Leonard Nimoy) has been discovered on life support.

Because the alien woman stole his brain.

Let me be very clear about this: Spock’s mind was not stolen, nor was his knowledge “sucked out” or anything like that. His physical brain was surgically removed from his skull with such impossibly advanced skill that somehow all the nerves were “neatly sealed” and there was “no bleeding.” Because he now has a softball-sized empty space in his head, Spock’s body only has 24 hours before it completely perishes.

Kirk is no longer pleased by the sexy, brain-stealing alien woman, and demands the Enterprise chase after her to a system containing three life-bearing planets, none of which seem to have the technology to create the spaceship they encountered or, uh, steal brains. Kirk asks his crew their opinions on which planet they think he should search, specifically so he can ignore them and go with his gut, as per usual.

The planet Kirk chooses is currently in an ice age, but it emits a strange energy source. At first glance, it seems to be wrong; all the landing party finds is a group of tall Caucasian cavemen wearing giant fake beards. They throw sticks and stones at the crew until Kirk stuns one with his phaser. Upon interrogation, the caveman reveals he is terrified of a group called the “Others.”

Eventually Kirk and the crew find a trap meant to capture these cavemen, which they assume would lead them to the “Others” if sprung. But first, Kirk asks Dr. McCoy to come down. He does, and he brings a surprise: Spock! Who is still missing his brain! But now Bones has a remote control for Spock. ([I am not kidding.](&lt;|url|&gt;)) The doctor has put a metal headpiece on Spock’s empty head and uses a handheld device to make the brainless Spock slowly walk and turn, giving the Vulcan all the capabilities of an R/C car from the ’80s. It is both laugh-out-loud stupid and deeply sad to see Nimoy forced to act this nonsense out.

Kirk and the crew spring the trap, which turns out to be an elevator that takes them deep inside the planet, where they discover an elaborate structure with highly advanced technology. There’s also a different sexy alien lady, this time in orange. Kirk demands answers, which she doesn’t give. This doesn’t deter Kirk, who grabs the woman’s arm and manhandles her a bit — until McCoy uses a very sketchy scanner of some kind (it detects plot points) to discover this grown woman has “the mind of a child” and that she genuinely doesn’t know anything at all.

This is pretty upsetting, and it gets much worse! Suffice it to say, the terrifying “Others” are in fact “women.” After Kirk and the crew are eventually captured by the woman in purple, who is named Kara (Marj Dusay), they discover that even though she’s the one who must have performed the super-surgery on Spock’s brain, she no longer knows how — and she doesn’t remember going to space at all.

In fact, it turns out all the women in the complex have the minds of children, which is *Star Trek*’s polite way of calling them morons. They are deeply confused by just about everything, including basic grammar. The best (worst) example comes upon Kirk’s 37th demand for Spock’s brain, when Kara infamously shouts [“BRAIN AND BRAIN WHAT IS BRAIN”](&lt;|url|&gt;) in petulant frustration.

Still, Kirk, Scotty, and Bones make sure to have another conversation among themselves later about how these women are too dumb to have created the advanced technology they’re living with, let alone perform the surgery — just in case the clues had been too subtle for you. As Bones puts it, the “mental faculties” of the women in the complex “seem to be almost atrophied because of nonuse.”

Just let that sink for a minute.
> # Spock is saved, and only at the cost of the women’s entire way of life.

The explanation the show gives for this astounding chauvinistic premise is that everything in the women’s world, including the technology, was created for them by someone tens of thousands of years ago. Since then, it’s all been maintained by a device called the Controller, a black box that acts as the bunker’s nervous system, circulating air, purifying water, and making things as needed. Basically, everything has been so well taken care of that the women inside no longer needed to think. So, uh, they stopped doing it.

Of course, there would be the odd occasion where a smart woman was needed, say, for instance, when the organic 10,000-year-old brain needed to run the Controller was dying and a new one needed to be acquired. In such a case, there’s a helmet, also created by their mysterious benefactor. It looks like the headpiece of a classic salon dryer chair, but when a woman, such as Kara, puts it on, highly technologically advanced information gets downloaded into her head — including how to travel through space and surgically remove major organs from people without making a mess. However, the knowledge is only temporary, and lasts a short while. Because why should these women need to think more than is absolutely necessary?

Kirk forces the helmet onto Kara, who gains the ability to comprehend what’s happening and form complex sentences but still refuses to destroy her society by giving Spock’s brain back. So Bones takes a risk and put the helmet on himself. He reattaches most of Spock’s brain before the helmet’s effects wear off, forcing Spock to walk him through how to do the rest of it. How does Spock know more about surgery than the ship’s doctor? How is he giving instructions at all with only half a brain attached? Who the hell knows?

![© Paramount Pictures / CBS Studios](<|image|>)*© Paramount Pictures / CBS Studios*

At any rate, Spock is saved, and only at the cost of the women’s entire way of life. When the back-to-subpar Kara asks what her people are going to do now, Kirk explains how he’s decided the women will abandon the only home they’ve ever known for millennia to move to the planet’s surface — which, again, is undergoing an ice age — and live among the cavemen who feared them. When Kara points out that the cavemen aren’t particularly likely to help the women, Kirk obliquely tells this woman — whom we’ve been told has the mental acuity of a child, to reiterate — that the women will “figure out” how to win them over, that is, they’ll use sex. Kirk is not only fine with this, he’s actually smug — because he is completely confident the women will be “better off” for all of it.

I guess someone could technically argue that Kirk is trying to help these women become independent thinkers, but there’s still not a single point in the episode where these women have any agency whatsoever.

Look, it’s indisputable that the *Star Trek* franchise is and has been progressive in many ways, right from the beginning. The original series started with an impressively diverse cast, and then boldly aired TV’s first interracial kiss between Shatner and Lt. Uhura’s Nichelle Nichols. It regularly took on racism in some very imaginative ways, such as “Let This Be Your Final Battleground.” But it fared much, much worse when it came to gender issues; “Spock’s Brain” is only [one of many episodes featuring overt sexism](&lt;|url|&gt;). Sure, it was a show of its time — but that doesn’t somehow make its time less problematic.

I wouldn’t dare dub “Spock’s Brain” the most sexist *Star Trek *episode ever, because I have no business judging that. I feel completely confident that I can judge stupid science fiction, and the ludicrous, genuinely pitiful premise that drives the episode is utterly brainless. In a universe of spaceships, advanced technology, aliens with unknown and unfathomable powers, the physical theft of a brain still feels completely implausible — as if the normally thoughtful *Star Trek* had descended into [some kind of B-movie drivel](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Combine the stupidity and the sexism, then add half-assed sets and props (thanks to those budget cuts), half-hearted acting from stars who’d just seen the writing on the wall (everyone’s portrayal of being shocked with unbearable pain is to gently lay down on the floor and roll around a bit), and brutally bad dialogue (seriously, if you took a shot every time someone said “Spock’s brain” during this episode, you would be dead of alcohol poisoning by the halfway mark), then multiply all this by the indignity of R/C Leonard Nimoy, and I believe you have *Star Trek*’s worst episode ever. Because Spock was far from the only brainless person who worked on it.<|endoftext|>

# Stranger Things Is Making Me Grow Up All Over Again — and I Don’t Like It

## Stranger Things Is Making Me Grow Up All Over Again — and I Don’t Like It

### The hit Netflix show has entered its awkward adolescence, and it’s dragging me along for the ride

![Photo: Netflix](<|image|>)*Photo: Netflix*

For me, *Stranger Things* is less a TV series and more of a time machine.

I know its many fans dig the show’s retro setting and style, but that’s not what I’m talking about — not exactly. See, I’ve watched a lot of TV series and movies inspired by the entertainment of my youth, primarily because ’80s nostalgia makes up a significant portion of pop culture now. I’ve seen remakes of ’80s movies (too many to list), sequels made 30 years too late (*Blade Runner 2049*), action films set in the ’80s (*Bumblebee*), stuff content to simply list things people used to like (*Ready Player One*), and… you get the picture. I’ve seen every homage, allusion, tribute, and straight-up rip-off of ’80s entertainment possible, ranging from charming to blatantly pandering. *Stranger Things* is different.

When I first began watching *Stranger Things* when it came along in 2016, I was one of the many who benefited from knowing nothing about the retro horror series other than a small but increasing buzz. I’m still grateful for that, because the experience of watching the show’s first season without really knowing what to expect was magical. The story of a group of schoolkids and a psychically powered girl/escaped science experiment known only as Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) who come together to rescue their friend Will (Noah Schnapp) from the Upside Down, *Stranger Things *was made up of pieces of many ’80s classics, to be sure, but they felt like part of the show’s own DNA. It’s as if the series came out of the same cultural source material that generated *Goonies, It, Stand by Me, Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, and more, instead of being a modern show doing a karaoke version of the past.

When I watched it, I felt like I had gone back in time. I was watching something actually made in the ’80s, which had just been unearthed. I was not just reminded of my childhood — I relived it. I felt the exact same feelings and sensations I felt watching those earlier classics as a 10-year-old in suburbia. *Stranger Things* made me feel like a kid again, an experience for which I am profoundly grateful. As a result, I’m not just a fan. I’ve formed a deep, emotional attachment with the show… and that’s the problem.

By necessity,* Stranger Things* is growing up. When the show’s first season filmed in 2015, the show’s child stars were about 12–13 for the most part, under the wire to play elementary school kids. In season two, the slightly older kids defeated the giant, tentacle monster called the Mind Flayer, all while a far more insidious foe began its assault: puberty. The innocent camaraderie of the kids was threatened by hormones as much as extra-dimensional lizard-dogs, resulting in a fracturing of the group and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas’ (Caleb McLaughlin) fight for the affections of newcomer Max (Sadie Sink), among other issues.

When I watched season two, it slowly dawned on me that I was still emotionally attached to the show — and this connection wasn’t necessarily benign. The best example is from the final episode when the boys go to a middle school dance called the Snow Ball and Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and Eleven share their first kiss. It’s cute and all, but I couldn’t enjoy it. I was on the edge of my seat, paralyzed with nervousness and embarrassment — because the *Stranger Things *time machine had transported me back to every middle school dance I ever went to, and it was horrible.
> # When I watched it, I felt like I had gone back in time.

Nothing specifically awful happened to me back then; I certainly avoided most [buckets of pigs’ blood](&lt;|url|&gt;). But check out Dustin in the episode’s final moments. I didn’t have his incredible and unwarranted self-confidence, but I completely remember how overwhelming it was to enter the hormonally and socially high-stakes world of a dance held in a school gymnasium. Like Mike, I remember exactly what it was like to see my friends (however occasionally) go off to dance with a girl and to seethe with both jealousy and shame at not being dance-worthy. Watching Dustin awkwardly and repeatedly call the name of a girl who refuses to even acknowledge his presence hit home in the worst way. And all of that misery, for what? So I could extend my arms as far out as possible, then put them on a girl’s waist, ensuring [there were four million cubic meters of air space](&lt;|url|&gt;) between us? Ugh. And yet, they were somehow all that mattered in the world.

The scene brought all these memories and feelings crashing back, just as the first season had, but in this case, they were mostly traumatic. I had lived through the nightmare of early pubescence once, and somehow survived the gauntlet that was middle school; I had no desire to do it again. But such was *Stranger Things’* hold over me that I no longer had a choice in the matter, and was merely along for the ride.

On one hand, this is a marvel. For a piece of art to be so accurate — not just factually, but tonally — as to remind me exactly how it felt to be a 12-year-old is a stupendous achievement. On the other hand, please don’t make me go to a middle school dance ever again*,* mentally or otherwise. Just remembering the gold chain and cheap cologne boys used to wear back then to “formal” occasions is enough to make me shudder in shame.

It makes me genuinely apprehensive to think about what’s coming in the show’s third season, premiering July 4 on Netflix. It was filmed in 2018, when the bulk of the show’s youngest tier of characters were about 16. I think it’s a reasonably safe bet to say that this will be their age in the season, where they’ll be waist-deep in the perils of high school, still reeling from the final ravages of puberty, minds clouded by hormones and their ability to perceive objective reality splintered by emotions, constantly turned to maximum.

Presumably, *Stranger Things* won’t go so far as to make its main characters’ that special brand of obnoxious and maddening that teens so often are — there have been several teen characters on the show already and they have generally fared pretty well. But the show’s ability to relentlessly drag me back through my youth, and replicate both its highs and lows in stunning clarity, makes me worry about what’s coming — or, rather, what’s coming back to me.

What dark secrets about my high school years does *Stranger Things *remember that I have intentionally forgotten? What stupid acts and horrible decisions will I see on-screen that parallel something I did that was stupid and horrible? I don’t know, but whatever it is, I’ll feel it to the depths of my soul. (If Mike gets so super-needy about Eleven that it drives her away, I may not make it through this.)

I’m trying to have some hope in that since season three is set in 1985, and I started high school in 1990, maybe the cultural touchstones between my life and the show will be different enough that I won’t be involuntarily teleported back through a lowlight reel of what it’s like to be a teenaged nerd before nerds were cool. But I’m not holding my breath.

Maturation can be a painful process for anyone. But *Stranger Things* has managed to tap into something so authentic, to access something so deep inside me, that I don’t seem to have any choice in the matter — other than not actually watching it, of course, but that’s not happening. The fact is that kids, both real and fictional, grow up so fast. Hopefully the same holds true for nostalgic, 40-something nerds.<|endoftext|>

# The Physics of Car Crashes in ‘Stranger Things 3’

## Could a Cadillac knock a speeding Camaro out of the way of our heroes? A physicist explains.

![Credit: Stranger Things/Netflix](<|image|>)*Credit: Stranger Things/Netflix*

There is a bunch of great physics in the latest season of *Stranger Things*,* *including a quick use of the value of Planck’s constant as a code. But I’m not just a fan of the show — I’m also a scientist. You might enjoy some popcorn while you view an episode, but I like to add a little bit of physics analysis.

Now for a slight spoiler alert. I’m going to be looking at the last episode in season 3. It’s not a huge plot element, but I know that there are some purists out there who haven’t cleared out their Netflix queue. So, here’s your chance to make a run for it.

If you’re still here, then let’s get to it. In this particular scene, someone is driving a Camaro with the intention of crashing into a stationary car. But wait! At the last moment before impact, a convertible Cadillac comes out of nowhere to T-bone the Camaro, pushing it out of the way so that it misses the stationary car.

But how realistic is this scene? Could a Cadillac actually save the stationary car? Let’s start by considering a collision between two equal-mass cars — which roughly seems to be the case here — moving at right angles to each other. Here is a diagram.

![](<|image|>)

Here are some important notes regarding this diagram:

* The yellow box is the Cadillac (with the label “A”) and the other box is the Camaro (labeled “B”).

* Both cars are moving — as indicated by the arrows with the labels pA and pB where the “p” stands for momentum. Yes, I’m going to explain momentum.

* During this collision, both cars push on each other — that’s the force arrows. These two forces are the same magnitude because that’s how forces work.

* Finally, don’t worry about the arrows over F and p. That just means these are vector quantities. You don’t really need to know about vectors right now. However, if I left the vector symbols off, all the other physicists would make fun of me and I don’t like that.

A collision like this (and really all collisions) is about forces and momentum. But what the heck is momentum? It’s simply the product of an object’s velocity and its mass, denoted by “p.” (I have no idea why we always use the symbol “p” for momentum. It probably has [something to do with its origins in Latin](&lt;|url|&gt;).)

Momentum is important because of forces. What does a force do to an object? You might want to say it “makes it move” — but that’s not quite right. The best way to describe the forces and motion is to say that a force changes the momentum of an object. In fact, we even have this as an equation called the momentum principle.

![](<|image|>)

If we think about this momentum principle in respect to the colliding cars, the Camaro changes momentum because there is a force (from the Cadillac) acting on it. But the Cadillac also has momentum change due to the force from the Camaro. Since these two cars have the same magnitude force for the same time, they have the same (but opposite) changes in momentum.

Or better yet, let’s consider the whole system consisting of both cars. In this case, there isn’t an external force on the system, so the total momentum doesn’t change. The sum of the momentum before the collision must be equal to the total momentum after the collision. This is called conservation of momentum, and it’s kind of a big deal. Also, this way I don’t even need to know the value of that collision force. I can just stick with momentum.

That’s enough physics. Now we can answer the question: How fast would the Cadillac need to drive to knock the Camaro out of its targeted collision with the stationary car, a station wagon? Since I’m going to need some values for stuff, that means it’s time for estimations:

* Both cars are about 1,500 kg (close enough). I actually Googled this. (That’s about 3,306 pounds.)

* The Camaro has a 0 to 60 acceleration of around nine seconds. (Again, thanks Google.) In the clip it accelerates for about nine seconds. So, let’s say that right before the crash it’s traveling at 60 mph, or 27 meters per second.

* It’s not true, but I am going to say that the two cars stick together after the crash. This just makes the calculation a little easier.

* Finally, if the cars collide 10 feet (about 3 meters) in front of the station wagon, then the Camaro would need to be deflected about 30 degrees to avoid hitting it.

I’m going to let the x-direction be the initial direction for the Camaro and the y-direction be the perpendicular direction of the Cadillac. This is useful since momentum is a vector. Instead of dealing with a vector equation (which I am sure no one wants), I can write two momentum equations — one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction. Maybe one more diagram will help see what’s going down.

![](<|image|>)

With that, I can write the conservation of momentum equations for the x- and y-directions as the following:

![](<|image|>)

Now I just need to solve for the velocity of the Cadillac (vA). After a quick substitution, I get (you should check this on your own):

![](<|image|>)

Here’s where a diligent physicist would just do a quick check on this expression. Does it have the correct units on both sides of the equation? Yup. On the right, the two mass units cancel and the tangent function doesn’t have units. So both sides have units of meters per second. Another check: What happens as the velocity of the Camaro (car B) increases? Car A would also have to increase in pre-collision speed. That makes sense. Okay, I’m mostly happy.

Now is the time for some numbers. Since the masses of the cars are approximately the same, they cancel each other out. Using a Camaro speed of 27 meters per second and an angle of 30 degrees means the Cadillac needs to be traveling 15.6 meters per second or about 35 mph to knock it out of the way. Oh, that’s nice. It seems real. Nothing like a good science fiction show that has extradimensional monsters but also employs plausible physics.<|endoftext|>

# Could Your Therapist Be Replaced with an App?

## Could Your Therapist Be Replaced with an App?

### While the field of internet cognitive behavioral therapy holds a lot of promise, the best mental health care still requires a human touch

![Credit: fergusowen/iStock/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: fergusowen/iStock/Getty Images Plus*

Every evening, I receive a text message from a robot. Its name is [Woebot](&lt;|url|&gt;), and sometimes the messages are as simple and straightforward as “Hello there, my friend!” Yesterday, the text was a bit odd: “I flossed my grills today.”

The bot’s earnestness is strange and cute, but it’s not just there to entertain me with bizarre quips. Woebot’s job is to coach me through my stress and anxiety in 10-minute segments each night.

Woebot is a part of a burgeoning field of therapy called ICBT, or internet cognitive behavioral therapy. [Cognitive behavioral therapy](&lt;|url|&gt;) is a decades-old, highly studied, and remarkably effective form of psychotherapy that focuses on problem-solving and emotional troubleshooting. Yet whether because of [geographic distance](&lt;|url|&gt;) from a therapist, financial issues, or insurance struggles, [many Americans](&lt;|url|&gt;) lack access to the mental health care they need. Hence the appeal of ICBT: If much of the costly and time-consuming therapy patients currently receive could be outsourced to a program, considerably more people could access needed mental health treatment.

At least that’s the hope. But there are significant limitations to getting ICBT to the general public. It isn’t yet clear to researchers and app developers how to best implement ICBT outside of clinical trials; what works in a research setting may not necessarily translate to the less-controlled real world. And a lack of regulation or even guidelines means developers have little incentive to use actual scientific findings when designing their apps.

There’s a large body of research showing that ICBT can work. It can relieve symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even harder-to-treat issues like obsessive compulsive disorder or body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), an underdiagnosed and undertreated disorder in which patients experience intrusive and obsessive thoughts about perceived flaws in their physical appearance. A [2018 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) out of the Karolinska Institutet’s Rücklab in Stockholm looked at how a 12-week internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program affected patients with BDD. Participants in the program read traditional cognitive behavior therapy self-help texts and completed worksheets in interactive modules, similar to how one would complete homework in an online class. They also had unlimited access to a therapist via a messaging system within the platform.

![](<|image|>)

![](<|image|>)

The study found that, two years following treatment, 69% of participants had responded positively to the treatment, and 56% no longer had a full diagnosis for BDD. This finding was significant, says Christian Rück, the group leader of the Rücklab, because many therapists shy away from treating BDD since they view patients with the disorder as being unmotivated and difficult to treat. This is because many patients with BDD strongly believe there is something wrong with their bodies, and it can be difficult to compel them to think otherwise.

“Therapists would rather treat people who will be successful cases,” Rück says. For people with BDD, as a result of so few therapists who will work with them, treatment options are limited. “With BDD, we felt we were actually at the frontier of what we thought was possible, but we have had huge successful trials there… the potential there for patients is huge in the way that if they don’t get this treatment, they probably don’t get any treatment.”

Rück estimates there have been about 200 randomized controlled trials finding ICBT to be an excellent treatment option for people with various mental disorders. But things get trickier when the treatments are transferred from the steady hands of psychologists into those of app developers and entrepreneurs. Scientists, says Rück, “are not good at making sexy apps but rather boring-looking things where we claim they are effective and we can reference a scientific paper. But in the app-store world, that’s not too important, and I think we are looking at an avalanche of crap apps in mental health.”

Rück says he thinks there are likely thousands of mental health apps that are rankable by reviews and download numbers but not necessarily scientific rigor. A [2019 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) looked at 73 Android and iPhone mental health apps and found that while most of them claimed the ability to diagnose or treat mental disorders, only two of them described evidence of it and just one cited research that backed up those claims.

While there’s no evidence yet that ICBT is harmful in a clinical setting, it isn’t hard to imagine the dangers inherent in having a bunch of unregulated, unscientific mental health apps potentially taking on the role of a traditional therapist or psychiatrist. If someone is seriously mentally ill and decides to use an app rather than a certified therapist, they could be much less likely to get better. They could even, in severe circumstances, be in danger. And there’s the not-insignificant issue of data privacy; [our health data](&lt;|url|&gt;) is perhaps the most private — and most valuable — data we produce, and the protection of it is crucial.

The American Psychiatric Association is aware of these problems. The group’s [proposed solution](&lt;|url|&gt;) is a hierarchical rating system that evaluates an app based on a number of factors:

* Risk, privacy, and security: Is the app safe for a user? Is there a privacy policy, and is data de-identified, and with whom is it shared?

* Evidence: Does the app actually do what it claims that it can do? What peer-reviewed evidence does it provide?

* Ease of use: Is it easy and compelling to use? Is it accessible for people with disabilities?

* Interoperability: Who owns the data? Can patients print it out and share it with their psychologist?

It isn’t clear how this evaluating system will be deployed, however. It certainly isn’t available in the Apple App Store as a way for consumers to judge which mental health app is best for them, and the complexity of the system, which fairly acknowledges the nuances that make an app good for some people and insufficient for others, might require too much for the average user. People interested in using mental health apps currently have little to rely on other than user reviews, which [research shows](&lt;|url|&gt;) are actually terrible indicators of its efficacy.

Woebot, which wasn’t one of the iPhone apps included in the study, appears to be one of the few ICBT apps that conducts its own peer-reviewed research of its program. [Its study](&lt;|url|&gt;), published in 2017 in the peer-reviewed *Journal of Medical Internet Research: Mental Health*, found that participants using Woebot experienced a greater decrease in depression symptoms than a control group, which was assigned a book about depression published by the National Institute of Mental Health. Among the more surprising findings of the study was that participants found the bot “empathic,” implying that artificially intelligent, nonhuman therapists could play a key role in further development of ICBT apps.

Rück, who is currently conducting a study comparing ICBT without a human therapist to ICBT with a coaching component, says that as of right now, the question of whether or not it’s better to practice ICBT with a therapist is “up in the air.” But, he adds, “it’s not unthinkable that you could, in the future, replace that with some other kind of A.I. bot.”

I personally have found Woebot more engaging than the other apps I tried for this story. Rather than merely completing a worksheet, I chat about whatever is making me feel anxious or depressed that day, and Woebot replies with ways to dismantle my negative thoughts and form newer, more rational versions. It’s a tool I’m familiar with from my face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy: The goal isn’t to deny the feeling or the thought but rather to transform it into something that’s less harmful and black-and-white.

Woebot is far from perfect. It has typos, and I find myself simplifying my language (and thus the anxiety-inducing situation I’m writing about) to increase the likelihood that it understands me. This is a problem that Athena Robinson, a former associate professor of psychiatry at Stanford University and now Woebot’s chief clinical officer, says the company is working on. Woebot has further research in the pipeline. Right now, the company is partnering with the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford to study how Woebot can help women who have just given birth.

I don’t know if Woebot or another ICBT app would be enough for me on its own. The work I’m able to do with my actual therapist is considerably more nuanced and complex than anything I can do on my phone. But what I like about the app is that it compels me to keep challenging my anxieties and negative thoughts regularly in between therapy appointments. It’s a bit like homework, meant to reinforce what I learned in class.

But so far, the field of mental health apps hasn’t caught up to the research. David Mohr, the director of the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies at Northwestern University, says that too few researchers and developers take into account how patients engage with the ICBT programs or what role caregivers, like coaches or therapists, are supposed to fill.

“We are on the verge of a digital revolution in mental health,” he says. “But we won’t get to a revolution without a paradigm shift. And we won’t have a paradigm shift if we keep trying to tie digital mental health to constructs from other domains, such as CBT… I think for digital mental health to become successful, we have to stop thinking about it as ICBT.” He says [Mindspot](&lt;|url|&gt;), an Australian company, is a successful example of ICBT practice; it offers anxiety and depression assessments as well as eight weeklong treatment courses for free to any Australian adult not currently in a mental health emergency. Unlike many ICBT programs, the service heavily relies on human coaches.

ICBT holds a lot of promise. Depression is the [leading cause](&lt;|url|&gt;) of disability worldwide, and mental illness generally costs Americans nearly $200 billion in lost earnings every year. Successful deployment of clinical practice in the real world could change and even save human lives. But for ICBT to have an effect on these statistics, those programs need to be paired with a coach or therapist, and further work needs to be done integrating scientific findings with app development.

In the meantime, there’s probably no harm in downloading an ICBT app and taking it for a spin — just don’t use it as an excuse to skip out on your regular therapist appointment.<|endoftext|>

# Ethics Boards Won’t Save Big Tech

## Tech companies need more than advisory boards if they want to create ethical products and services

![Photo: [Paweł Czerwiński](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo: [Paweł Czerwiński](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

On March 26, Google announced the formation of an [external advisory group](&lt;|url|&gt;) to help the company navigate complex questions around the ethical and responsible development of new technologies, including artificial intelligence. By April 4, however, [the council had been disbanded](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [Google acknowledged](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the company was “going back to the drawing board.”

Ironically, Google’s new group of ethics advisors fell apart because of ethical challenges. But apart from underlining just how fragile the current state of technology ethics is, the incident attests to a much larger challenge tech companies are facing: How can a company ensure that the products it develops — especially A.I. — are as good for society as they are for the company’s bottom line?

Google’s advisory council was established to help the company implement its [A.I. principles](&lt;|url|&gt;)—an “ethical charter to guide the responsible development and use of AI in our research and products.”

Launched last June, the principles articulate ideals and aspirations that few would dispute, including developing socially beneficial technologies, avoiding unfair bias, and ensuring safety. They mirror similar efforts from companies like [Microsoft](&lt;|url|&gt;) to develop an ethical foundation for A.I. development. They also reflect frameworks such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ (IEEE) [guidelines on ethically aligned design](&lt;|url|&gt;). At a time when there is legitimate growing concern over the potentially harmful personal and social impacts of A.I. and other technologies, these principles are laudable.
> # Ethics are essential to establishing a guiding basis for how powerful new technologies are developed and used.

And yet, as Google found out the hard way, framing socially responsible and beneficial development in terms of ethics is far from easy.

Part of the issue Google and other companies face is that while ethics involve enforcing social norms around what is considered right and appropriate versus what is wrong and inappropriate, ethics on their own don’t provide robust mechanisms for developing and building safe and responsible products.

Ethics are essential to establishing a guiding basis for how powerful new technologies are developed and used. Yet they are worth little without mechanisms and processes that ensure research, development, and commercialization decisions will lead to outcomes that are socially responsible and beneficial.

## Entrepreneurial ethics

I have been grappling with this disconnect between ethical aspirations and social impact since 2013, when I first started teaching ethics to budding entrepreneurs as part of the (now defunct) [University of Michigan Master of Entrepreneurship](&lt;|url|&gt;). Even though this program predated the current flurry of excitement around A.I. and technology ethics, it recognized that emerging tech entrepreneurs need a strong foundation in ethics. And yet, as I developed my entrepreneurial ethics course, it quickly became obvious that these graduate students needed more than an ethical compass as they grappled with the realities of launching their own startup.

As a result, the course ended up focusing on equipping students to make tough business decisions in the real world while remaining true to personal and institutional values and social norms. It focused on building skills around five pillars:

* The basic principles of entrepreneurial ethics.

* Personal values and how they integrate with institutional values.

* Critical processes for codifying values within enterprises.

* Interacting and engaging with key constituencies.

* Socially responsible practices and products.

Students taking the course developed an understanding of the importance of ethics in technology innovation. But they also left it understanding how to translate good intentions into strong business practices and societally beneficial outcomes.

In teaching the course, I was especially interested in how this approach to entrepreneurial ethics could foster a culture of responsibility within the startup community. But I was also focused on the future success of these students and how practical ethics could help them navigate the innovation challenges they would inevitably face.
> # It became apparent that these future founders could have the best technical idea in the world, but if they couldn’t wrap their heads around the social impacts, they risked failure.

As I was developing the course, my research and that of others was making it increasingly clear that the broader social-risk landscape around new technologies was becoming a growing threat to entrepreneurial success. It became apparent that these future founders could have the best technical idea in the world, but if they couldn’t wrap their heads around the social impacts of what they were planning, they risked failure. Six years later, this is more apparent than ever as a growing number of companies face the [consequences of social ignorance](&lt;|url|&gt;).

## Operationalizing values and social norms

Each year I taught the entrepreneurial ethics course, I was reminded of how most entrepreneurs really are striving to make the world a better place. These students weren’t in it for the money (at least most of them weren’t). Rather, they wanted to cure disease, curb climate change, protect the environment, and make the world a better place. They were driven to transform their values into a future that looked better and brighter for others.

The trouble was that their values were naive and ephemeral. They had good intentions but no idea how to translate them into good practice. As a result, they were all too easily subsumed by the harsh realities of building a business. These students needed a way to hardwire their values and aspirations into their businesses so they could weather the tough choices every innovator encounters.

My students needed a solid foundation in ethics — but they also needed a way to operationalize what was important to them so their enterprises didn’t fail at the first ethical hurdle. More than this, they needed to understand how to navigate and thrive in a complex social landscape where every action they took potentially threatened something of importance to someone else, and where social norms and expectations could throw up barriers that no amount of technical expertise prepared them for.

These are the types of real-world challenges that I set out to prepare my students for, and they are not the types of challenges that are readily addressable through convening ethics boards or advisory groups.

This is reflected in more practical approaches to technology ethics, such as the [IEEE approach to ethically aligned design](&lt;|url|&gt;), which sets out to “provide pragmatic and directional insights and recommendations” to technologists, educators, and policymakers. The IEEE approach begins to help operationalize ethical approaches to technology innovation. And yet, despite the availability of resources like this, there’s still a remarkable level of naivety around the use of ethics boards and similar advisory structures within technology companies. And this is partly why Google’s efforts to get things right imploded.

## Beyond ethics

Much of current naivety around A.I. ethics, and technology ethics more broadly, arises from assuming that developing ethics guidelines and convening advisory groups are sufficient to ensure socially responsible innovation.

Unfortunately, they are not.

At worst, ethics advisory boards can easily become a smoke-and-mirrors attempt to mask business as usual under the guise of social responsibility. But as companies like Google and others are beginning to discover, people aren’t so easily fooled.

At the other end of the spectrum, ethics advisory boards have a valuable role to play in helping set the ground rules and boundaries for innovation practices. But on its own, this does little to ensure socially beneficial innovation unless there are associated mechanisms to operationalize ethical rules, boundaries, and expectations within an organization. As the [*Verge* recently reported](&lt;|url|&gt;), the evidence so far is that such boards do little to affect actual outcomes.

So, what are the alternatives? How does a company like Google go about ensuring that its actions and products increase societal value while causing as little harm to society as possible?
> # At worst, ethics advisory boards can easily become a smoke-and-mirrors attempt to mask business as usual under the guise of social responsibility.

The first step is not to throw the ethics baby out with the bathwater. The ethics of technology innovation are important. They are essential for solidifying nebulous good intentions into concrete values that reflect social norms and expectations.

But ethics alone aren’t enough. Businesses also need to focus on outcomes, the often tortuous pathway between aspirational goals and what happens when the rubber hits the road.

This is where ethical innovation and social responsibility take a very practical turn and require developers and decision-makers at every step of the process to be working toward creating products and services that do good without causing harm.

Delivering on socially responsible and beneficial outcomes requires a plethora of tools and processes, including internal and industrywide standards, measurable expectations, enforceable checks and balances, meaningful policies, and a culture of social responsibility. They also demand buy-in across the complete enterprise ecosystem, from employees and executives to investors, business partners, consumers, affected communities, and regulators.

And most important, they require a strategic commitment to training and education, ensuring that employees and business leaders two, five, and 10 years from now have the skills they need to build successful enterprises that are socially responsible. This in turn will require an openness to new skill sets that don’t fit old and outmoded job titles and a willingness to engage with experts who understand how to innovate responsibly and successfully in a rapidly changing world.

What we don’t need are ethics boards that are more of a liability than an asset.

Of course, technology ethics (including A.I. ethics) are vitally important — they are at the very heart of what it means to innovate responsibly. Yet many tech companies, especially in the A.I. sector, have fallen into the trap of equating ethics with success while skipping over the hard stuff in between. They’ve become enamored of the allure of ethics boards and ethical principles as a way to blunt criticism, instead of as an avenue to improve their companies. As a consequence, tech companies have risked becoming blinded to the much tougher challenge of successfully running a business while creating social value.

This is where companies like Google are desperately in need of an ethics reset. Not so they can abandon their commitment to ethical innovation, but so they can make it count where it matters.<|endoftext|>

# The Human Zeal for Adventure Has a Genetic Basis

## A new study shows that a gene identified in fruit flies may help explain why some of us take risks—and some stay at home

![Credit: HeitiPaves/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: HeitiPaves/Getty Images*

As humans, we like to think that we occupy a special place within the animal kingdom, and we’re often surprised when we see other animals expressing humanlike qualities. Even our closest living relatives—other primates—impress us by using basic tools or expressing emotions. But if we profiled our commonalities with other species in detail, we might be less likely to harbor exaggerated perceptions of human superiority. The best way to dispel illusions about what it means to be human is to compare our behaviors to the behaviors of the simplest animals we can find — including Drosophila, also known as humble fruit fly.

There’s one particular [behavioral question](&lt;|url|&gt;) that unites many animal species: “Should I explore the wider environment or exploit my current environment?”

For most animals, the question relates to whether they should remain in a familiar location, where they understand the availability of food and risks from predators, or explore entirely new and potentially dangerous environments in order to improve their options. For humans in the developed world—unlike for many animals—the question usually lacks fatal consequences. But it can still apply to the most important decisions in our lives, like whether I should keep my current low-risk job or aim higher and start the business I’ve always wanted.

There’s a gene that underlies this behavior in fruit flies commonly referred to as the “[foraging gene](&lt;|url|&gt;).” It has two specific variants: One is thought of as a “rover” variant, which predicts wider and more comprehensive search paths during exploration. The other can be thought of as the “sitter” variant, which predicts a more conservative exploration style. The rover variant of the gene predicts more adventurous exploration by fruit flies and ultimately a heightened ability to find food sources within uncertain environments.

These differences in behavior seem to relate to risk aversion. A fly willing to explore widely and adventurously is more likely to find new food sources, but it also leaves itself open to new dangers like crossing a predator’s territory. A fly that sticks to exploiting nearby environments, and remaining as sheltered as possible in its search patterns, may find fewer food sources but also fewer dangers associated with uncertain territory.

In a [recently published study](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the journal *PNAS*, a group of researchers tested whether the human equivalent of the foraging gene, known as PRKG1, may also predict how humans explore the world. Previous evidence already highlights a role of this gene in regulating human behavior, including potential links to traits such as a mother’s [maternal sensitivity and responsiveness](&lt;|url|&gt;) toward her infant. Given the gene’s connection to foraging in fruit flies and its existing links to some general human behavioral traits, the researchers wanted to understand whether PRKG1 would predict adventurousness in human exploration.

The researchers recruited 450 undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo in Ontario. Each offered up a saliva sample for genetic testing and completed a questionnaire that assessed adventurous tendencies by asking for levels of agreement with statements such as, “by the time I accomplish a task, I already have the next one in mind.” Answers to these questionnaire items identified whether people leaned more toward a “do the right thing” mindset, or a “just do it” mindset.
> # As we hack further into our genetic code, we realize that our innate biological fortuities predict many of our decisions and characteristics.

The less adventurous “do the right thing” mindset cautiously evaluates options before jumping into decisions and aims to avoid making mistakes due to premature actions. In contrast, the more adventurous “just do it” mindset commits to spontaneous decisions and impulsive actions that minimize the fear of missing out.

The college volunteers then played a game where they were asked to find as many berries as they could in a computerized environment. By analyzing people’s search patterns, the researchers identified different exploration styles. They also located two forms of the human PRKG1 gene and discovered that one of these forms resembled the fruit fly sitter variant.

People with this human sitter variant had a more cautious “do the right thing” mentality and were more likely to stick to the game’s external boundaries as they explored. They were also highly persistent in picking up difficult smaller berries within the playing field. In other words, they were not only more cautious in their global search patterns, they also carefully collected all available berries on sight rather than exploring more widely and aiming for easy targets—a classic marker of a risk-averse individual.

Fascinatingly, this behavior parallels the actions of fruit flies that have the cautious sitter variant of the foraging gene. Just like their human peers, these flies hug the boundaries of a foraging environment and avoid adventurous search strategies that cover extensive territory but raise their exposure to risks.

How could the *PRKG1* gene have these effects in humans? The researchers suggest that it could relate to how the genes are expressed in an area of our brain known as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Those of us who may be cautious in our exploration show fewer products of the PRKG1 gene within our prefrontal cortex. And, with this trait, we once again parallel the humble fruit fly: Those flies who are classified as cautious sitters, rather than adventurous rovers, have less productive foraging genes.

We’ve yet to see an independent study that replicates this effect and tests the same question among older age groups. As with most scientific research, it’s worth waiting for more evidence. But the data highlights an obvious but frequently overlooked fact about human nature: Our genes may affect our behavior. When we consider how we explore the world—how we roam around a new city or travel around a large museum—we attribute our choices to what we might call “free will.” But as we hack further into our genetic code, we realize that our innate biological fortuities predict many of our decisions and characteristics. Our genes, and their interactions with the environmental influences in our lives, play a crucial role in determining whether we ultimately become adventurers or homebodies.

Our foraging behavior may be similar to the humble fruit fly, but we set ourselves apart with our ability to consciously reflect on that behavior and understand our motivations. The triviality and brevity of human life in our universe should drive us to appreciate every fortunate moment of our conscious experience—whether we prefer the comfort of home or the adventure of abroad.<|endoftext|>

# WhatsApp Won’t Save Facebook

## Zuckerberg’s “privacy-focused vision” for social media misses some big problems

![Credit: NurPhoto/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: NurPhoto/Getty Images Plus*

Mark Zuckerberg said last week that the future of Facebook may look a little more like WhatsApp, the private messaging service his company acquired for [$19 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) back in 2015.

“I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won’t stick around forever,” he [wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a blog post about his “privacy-focused vision for social networking.”
> # Zuckerberg’s manifesto misses something big: WhatsApp and other private messaging services have, at times, enabled deeply toxic communications.

Not surprisingly, rumors have swirled recently that Facebook might consolidate its messaging platforms — Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram — into one central “[platform or protocol](&lt;|url|&gt;),” as CBS News put it. There are risks involved — for people who rely on these messaging services, a [centralized outage](&lt;|url|&gt;) like the one occurring throughout Facebook’s services this week, could be disastrous. But the move seems otherwise sensible, even responsible, in an era dominated by “fake news” and viral outrage. Shifting emphasis away from a News Feed populated by all of your connections and toward more meaningful, private messaging might allay some of these concerns.

But Zuckerberg’s manifesto misses something big: WhatsApp and other private messaging services have, at times, enabled deeply toxic communications, much as Facebook’s News Feed has. Just this Wednesday, Abhijit Bose, the head of WhatsApp India, said the company was working to “[limit viral content and educate users](&lt;|url|&gt;)” following a number of fatal incidents there.

Last year, a *New York Times* [investigation](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that false rumors being spread via WhatsApp had led to mob killings in India, where the service has 200 million users. Those mob attacks ultimately claimed the lives of two dozen innocent people — though some sources [estimate](&lt;|url|&gt;) an even higher body count overall from WhatsApp-related murders.

In Indonesia, WhatsApp has been the [key purveyor of hoaxes](&lt;|url|&gt;) connected to a rise in violence and attacks against religious minorities and LGBT community members. And in Sri Lanka, a sudden surge in attacks on mosques led to WhatsApp [being temporarily blocked](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year. WhatsApp has promised to address these issues, but the moves made so far — such as limiting message forwards, which keeps people from sending a message to[ more than five chats at once](&lt;|url|&gt;) — are [not considered sufficient](&lt;|url|&gt;) by local experts.

These issues, coupled with Zuckerberg’s new position that the WhatsApp model represents the future of social networking, suggest a different motivation for the manifesto: It’s good business.

“To what extent is he really drawing to the WeChat playbook here?” Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, tells *OneZero*. “Is he applying the same copycat logic he’s used with Snapchat or Instagram to simply recognize that Tencent is doing something right by focusing on messaging as the killer app?”

The Chinese company Tencent’s WeChat service represents the kind of mega-social app that Zuckerberg might hope Facebook could become. Incredibly popular in China and increasingly used worldwide — it has more than a [billion monthly users](&lt;|url|&gt;), just behind Facebook’s WhatsApp and Messenger — WeChat bundles many different types of functionality under one umbrella. There are other Asian competitors showing up as bigger blips on Facebook’s radar: LINE, which is especially popular in Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, or South Korea’s Kakao Talk.

Already there are [signs](&lt;|url|&gt;) that users in the U.S. and other mature markets are shifting away from Facebook and toward seemingly private services like Instagram and WhatsApp. In a sense, Zuckerberg’s writing fills in lines that are already drawn.

“Behavior around Facebook is changing,” Ashkan Soltani, an independent researcher and former chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission, tells *OneZero*. “People aren’t engaging on the platform as much as they were previously. This move by Facebook allows them to deal with the market shift in how people engage with social media and the move to messaging platforms… as a privacy feature.”

In many ways, Asia’s top chat apps barely resemble WhatsApp. Sure, they have chat functions, but they offer much more. Picture sharing, profiles, in-app games, quizzes, and more opportunities for advertisers to engage users through influencers and sponsored accounts.

WeChat, in particular, takes this to another level thanks to protections from the Chinese government. China guards against foreign competition by blocking Facebook, LINE, and Kakao with the so-called [Great Firewall](&lt;|url|&gt;), which has allowed WeChat to offer dozens of features, including payments through the WePay service, an integrated gaming platform and a Facebook-like feed.
> # In the end, Zuckerberg’s vision might be aimed less at general users, many of whom don’t care or know much about encryption to begin with, than at regulators.

It’s not hard to imagine a future Facebook mega-app, perhaps technically spread across WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger, that would rival this service — especially with Facebook’s investments in original content, virtual reality, and the recent launch of its Patreon-like “[Fan Subscriptions](&lt;|url|&gt;)” service, which allows people to pay to access exclusive content from creators.

“Most of the concerns are not about Facebook reading our messages, but much more around the largest data ecosystem that Facebook is part of,” says Jennifer King, director of consumer privacy at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society. “It’s a question about what they know about us as individuals, and their ability to target us or use that data about us in a way that could affect us.”

In the end, Zuckerberg’s vision might be aimed less at general users, many of whom don’t care or know much about encryption to begin with, than at regulators. It’s telling that Zuckerberg’s blog post is only available in English. The intended audience is not those users in Indonesia, India, or Sri Lanka: It’s officials in Washington, D.C., and, potentially, Sacramento, where state legislators are [considering amendments](&lt;|url|&gt;) (opposed by Facebook) that would strengthen California’s landmark 2018 digital privacy law. Meanwhile, [Elizabeth Warren’s call](&lt;|url|&gt;) to break up Facebook and other tech giants would force the company to make social networking and messaging separate entities.

What seems like “vision,” then, is more of a defensive posture for a company under assault by competition and regulators.

“It allows them to deal with market shift towards messaging platforms, regulatory criticism about their privacy practices, and simultaneously combine multiple services,” says Soltani. “In an environment with growing scrutiny about anticompetitive practices, this also allows them to do it as a privacy feature.”

Of course, Facebook has successfully transformed itself before. Remember when Snapchat was the [only](&lt;|url|&gt;) service with “Stories”? You might — but many of the [1 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) people who use Instagram probably don’t, if they even care at all.<|endoftext|>

# The Real Reason Apple Wants You to Use Its Sign-in Service

## Control in the guise of security

![Credit: Hector Retamal/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Hector Retamal/Getty Images*

What will you trade for convenience? In this era of online life, the common answer seems to be “everything” — and that’s assuming people understand they’re making an exchange at all.

Facebook, by far the world’s most dominant social network, has built its fortunes on a complex ad-targeting system that harnesses the data provided by its users. And it’s [reportedly](&lt;|url|&gt;) working to integrate its diffuse messaging services — offered by WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger — on a core platform that could [make it much easier](&lt;|url|&gt;) for the company to learn about, and market to, billions of people who presume to be talking to one another in private. Meanwhile, it’s no big secret that Amazon is leveraging the information generated by [shoppers](&lt;|url|&gt;), [third-party vendors](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [even open-source software developers](&lt;|url|&gt;) to gain a competitive edge and extend its reach in arenas it already [dominates](&lt;|url|&gt;). When it’s easy for you to use these services, it’s easy for them to grow.

Enter Apple, with its new “Sign-in” service unveiled at a conference for developers this week. The feature promises to make security easy when it launches in the fall: Click a new “Sign In with Apple” button rather than manually logging into a service like, say, *Medium*, and the company will authenticate your identity, register your account via a new, anonymous email service, and allow you to dive right in without all the fussy typing-in of passwords you’d endure otherwise. It promises to snip the strands tying your identity to your personal email account, limiting the creepily accurate ad-targeting we’ve normalized through years of convenient social networking and Google searches. But while that’s a noble purpose, Apple itself gets something out of the exchange: A new lock and key to bind you to its own platform.

Though Sign In with Apple will [technically work across the web](&lt;|url|&gt;), it will be at its best on your iPhone, where a quick check with Face or Touch ID will open the locked doors of whatever services enable the feature. There will be quite a lot of them, as Apple will [require iOS developers to offer the feature](&lt;|url|&gt;) wherever rival sign-in features from Facebook and Google are present. Many users will grow accustomed to the convenience of Sign In with Apple on their iPhones — and that will make leaving the so-called “walled garden” even harder.

Put another way, if you become a dedicated Sign In with Apple user, it will make even less sense for you to ever make the switch to a competing Android phone down the line. If you did, you would encounter an array of Sign In with Apple prompts that [ask you for credentials tied to your Apple account](&lt;|url|&gt;), similar to logging into your Facebook and Google profiles, though perhaps you’re less accustomed to accessing your Apple ID. You’d miss the easy Face ID login, as suddenly a one-touch sign-in process became onerous.
> # Not for nothing, Sign In with Apple also presents another opportunity for a monolithic tech corporation to consolidate your data.

Of course, when people begin to associate convenience of Sign In with Apple with their iPhones, they’ll be less tempted to switch to begin with. This feature, [like the blue bubbles of iMessage before it](&lt;|url|&gt;), is another Jenga block yanked from the base; eventually, the structure will be so delicately arranged that you will do nothing to upset its architecture. Move a piece yourself, by switching devices or login methods, and the entire tower will fall, leaving you to pick up and rearrange the pieces: not an impossible task, but a frustrating and lengthy one. Inconvenient, in other words.

Not for nothing, Sign In with Apple also presents another opportunity for a monolithic tech corporation to consolidate your data. When it comes to your privacy, Apple has a considerably better track record than, say, Facebook or Google — but Sign In also follows a substantial business pivot [away from selling hardware and toward providing “services”](&lt;|url|&gt;) like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and the forthcoming Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. Apple didn’t have much to gain from leveraging your data for profit when it was primarily a vendor of exceptionally pricey stuff. We can only hope it maintains some measure of ethics in the coming years as its profit motive orients toward making and marketing original television programs, movies, and editorial content — all of which would benefit from Apple knowing as much as possible about its users.

The issue here isn’t that Sign In with Apple is particularly nefarious or even a bad choice for consumers. To the contrary, its convenient security features promise a much-needed and arguably improved alternative to the gigantic online marketing apparatus dominated by Facebook and Google. But there remains this insidious thread in consumer technology where companies attempt to stitch customers into the fabric of their products, limiting their ability to move to a competitor at any time, for any reason. It’s present here, [it’s present in a folding phone](&lt;|url|&gt;); it’s just about everywhere.

A prevailing concern in tech today is oneness — or the idea that some digital force will come to define every part of how we do business and talk to each other online. This is the idea motivating [antitrust probes](&lt;|url|&gt;) into the so-called “[Big Four](&lt;|url|&gt;)” tech companies (Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Google) as they move to expand their services to the people who use the internet. It’s implicit in the [argument](&lt;|url|&gt;) of these same companies that breaking them up would leave the online world to be conquered by Chinese monoliths that face no restrictions on their appetite for growth.

“We must give people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold — and do it in a way that doesn’t lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, [wrote in a Medium post](&lt;|url|&gt;) about her plan to break up major tech corporations.

As the *Verge*’s Casey Newton [suggested](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Wednesday, Apple’s ears might have perked up at this as it rolled out its sign-in feature. For now, though, it’s unclear that they’re really listening. Eventually, perhaps, consumers — or the regulators representing them — will.<|endoftext|>

# Ctrl-Alt-Delete&#58; The Planned Obsolescence of Old Coders

## Old coders never die, they just become middle managers.

![Illustration: [Cathryn Virginia](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Cathryn Virginia](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Each year, 600 coders gather to talk shop at a conference in New York called PyGotham. The organizers know how [male](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [white](&lt;|url|&gt;) the tech industry is, so they make a special effort to recruit [a diverse speaker lineup](&lt;|url|&gt;). They promote the event on mailing lists for women and people of color who code, and they run a workshop for women in tech to encourage them to submit talks. The organizers ask speakers to fill out a demographic survey so they can track the progress of the conference’s diversity.

I serve on the conference committee, and after PyGotham ended this year, I realized I had made no effort to reach one group in particular: older coders. Compared to the underrepresentation of women and minorities in tech, the scarcity of programmers in their forties and beyond has mostly escaped notice. There are no Meetups or mailing lists for them in New York, no prominent advocacy organizations devoted to them. Although I will seek older programmers to speak at PyGotham next year, I don’t yet know where to look.

The software industry is overwhelmingly young. The [median age of Google and Amazon employees is 30](&lt;|url|&gt;), whereas the [median age of American workers is 42](&lt;|url|&gt;). A 2018 Stack Overflow survey of 100,000 programmers around the world found that [three-quarters of them were under 35](&lt;|url|&gt;). Periodic posts on Hacker News ask, “[What happens to older developers?](&lt;|url|&gt;)” Anxious developers in their late thirties chime in and identify themselves as among the “older.”

I turned 40 this October, and I have worked seven years in the same job at a database company called MongoDB in New York City. Many programmers my age have gone back to school to switch careers or have become managers. I am committed to a lifetime as a programmer, but my career path for the decades to come is not well-marked. I know disturbingly few engineers older than me whose examples I can follow. Where have all the older coders gone, and what are the career prospects for those of us who remain?

In 2007, [Mark Zuckerberg, then 22](&lt;|url|&gt;), said out loud what many in the software industry think: “Young people are just smarter.” Twelve years later, the lack of older programmers is still little studied compared to other dimensions of diversity. [Google’s annual diversity report](&lt;|url|&gt;), for example, counts how many women or people of color it employs. [Microsoft tallies its American Indian and Alaskan Native staff](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [Apple is proud to hire veterans](&lt;|url|&gt;). It is commendable that these companies have revealed some measures of their diversity, but there is an omission: None report their age distribution.

Ari Rapkin Blenkhorn is a 47-year-old engineer who says she quit her last full-time job because the company, she says, wanted “a crowd of cheap youngsters. They didn’t want to support more senior people with established careers.” Her employer, which she requested not be named, valued her professional connections but did not invest in that network by sending her to conferences. “I believe they really didn’t understand why this was important or how my attending a research conference was different from junior developers attending technical training.”

Blenkhorn says that once she was back on the job market, the ageism she experienced was compounded by sexism. Despite her profound technical achievements, she was dismissed by recruiters as irrelevant and dull, as a “mom.” She recently completed a PhD in computer science and hopes the education will improve her chances in the job market.

Kevin Stevens, a 55-year-old programmer, faced a similar attitude when he applied for a position at Stack Exchange six years ago. He was interviewed by a younger engineer who told him, “I’m always surprised when older programmers keep up on technology.” Stevens was rejected for the job. He now works as a programmer at a hospitality company where he says his age is not an issue.

For other programmers, the outcomes can be far worse. [A 2018 investigation](&lt;|url|&gt;) by *ProPublica*’s Peter Gosselin and Ariana Tobin into age discrimination at IBM found that starting around 2014, the company attempted to reinvent itself by replacing older workers with younger ones. It laid off veteran employees by the thousands and strong-armed others into retiring. One 60-year-old systems engineer named Ed Kishkill was sent a layoff notice and told he had three months to find another job at IBM. Despite his decades of experience, he was rejected for all other positions. By the time of the *ProPublica* article’s publication, Kishkill was working as a Staples store clerk.

Lifelong programmers must keep their skills up to date, but they are in a race against time in a constantly transforming industry. According to a [2018 research paper](&lt;|url|&gt;), skills change faster in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) jobs than in other industries, and the headlong rate of change for programmers is especially severe. Kadeem L. Noray, one of the paper’s authors, says that “STEM is more skills-oriented that other fields,” valuing short-lived competencies over durable wisdom. For each skill a STEM professional learns, another becomes obsolete, leaving little chance for accumulating skills and increasing salary.

Although starting salaries in tech are famously high, their advantage compared to other fields is halved in the first decade of employment. “This is something most economists just don’t know,” Noray says. A [2017 report from Hired.com](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that salary offers were actually lower for tech workers over 50 than for younger ones. Therefore, many STEM workers switch to professions that change more slowly in search of sustained salary growth. At the age of 24, 89 percent of STEM majors have STEM jobs, but at 35 years old, the number declines to 71 percent and continues to fall thereafter.

One way coders can get off the skills treadmill but stay in the industry is by becoming managers. A 54-year-old engineer in Massachusetts tells me, “My company has an obvious track for new people: They come in as developers and move up the chain into management.”

But management is not right for everyone. Sue LoVerso, a 54-year-old senior staff engineer at MongoDB, told me, “There are personality characteristics that managers need, but I’m an introvert, and solving technical problems is what interests me.” A 63-year-old Google engineer says his brief time as a manager was uncomfortable: “I knew I could rely on myself to do a job, but I couldn’t figure out how to rely on other people.”

As an alternative to the management track, Google, Microsoft, and other large companies define an “individual contributor (IC) track,” a ladder of job titles for senior engineers that rises in parallel to the management ladder. The IC track lets engineers climb a seniority ladder without forsaking the craft they love.

But the IC track is flawed. The programmers I spoke with said that promotion is slower on the IC track, and the distinctions between titles are blurry. According to David Golden, a 45-year-old engineer at MongoDB, “In the development-only track, there’s a bigger hurdle for me to move to the next level. It’s not clear how you get from one to the other and whether it’s something you can actually do anything about.”

Based on interviews with a half-dozen programmers, it is clear to me that companies should create a qualitatively different role for their most senior individual contributors. Candidates for such roles would be judged by their past effectiveness, the same as managers are, not by a fast-churning checklist of skills. Greater clarity would mean engineers could climb the ladder faster, and the prestige and renewed intellectual challenge of each level would keep programmers motivated into their fifties and sixties.

Proven engineers who occupy the most senior roles should be deployed to solve the hardest problems on the most critical projects. Their roles should emphasize technical leadership through writing, speaking, and mentoring.

Because of their deep knowledge and broad experience, older programmers are able to translate their knowledge into ordinary terms, which puts them in a position to act as ambassadors to the nonprogramming world. Ari Blenkhorn filled this role when she led a cloth simulation project at the special effects studio Industrial Light and Magic. “Yoda’s robe, Harry Potter’s Quidditch cloak, the Dementors’ robes—all of that was the software that I helped develop,” she says. “I needed to speak the language of both the physics simulation research team and the animation team. They don’t think about partial differential equations. They think about cloth that’s silky and stretchy and ripples in the wind.”

I am fortunate: My company responded to my midcareer ennui with empathy and has allowed me to embark on a journey of professional exploration. This year, I am rotating among three teams for a few months each to decide what I want to be when I grow up.

Other companies might not be so generous. I especially worry for [older women](&lt;|url|&gt;) and people of color in the industry, who are subject to combined biases. Companies must define meaningful levels for programmers advancing on the IC track. Meanwhile, programmers should be more proactive, organizing and pressuring companies to combat age bias. Unions can standardize salaries and protect senior employees from layoffs; doing so would also likely [narrow racial and gender wage gaps](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Making the software industry more welcoming to coders past their thirties and creating roles suited for very experienced programmers will make companies more effective and more fair. These changes will also benefit the rest of us — in a society increasingly governed by software and algorithms, programmers must gain some wisdom to match their power. They must learn from recent incidents of [hacking](&lt;|url|&gt;), [biased algorithms](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [online incitement of genocide](&lt;|url|&gt;). The only way to do that is for older coders to stay in the industry long enough to pass their knowledge to their successors. Cultivating lifelong coders will ensure that the lessons learned today are still remembered 50 years from now.<|endoftext|>

# Designers Are Imagining Video Games Without Guns

## At a moment when real life is wracked by crisis, designers say that games should offer a respite from violence, rather than a celebration of it

![Illustration: [Maria Chimishkyan](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Maria Chimishkyan](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Shooting things in games is intrinsically compelling. Firing, watching something blow up, and then seeing our score ping higher on the screen creates an exciting feedback loop that gives us immediate agency and power. Shooters are the [most popular genre of video game](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the U.S. and account for 25% of all games sold. The defining titles of our era are battle royale mass brawlers such as *Fortnite* and *Apex Legends*, and epic narrative adventures (with plenty of shooting) such as *Grand Theft Auto*, *Far Cry*, and *Uncharted*.

But after years of playing games like these, I’ve started to ask myself: Would it be possible for any of these mainstream blockbusters to [exist without guns](&lt;|url|&gt;)? Have developers overlooked other ways to explore stories? Are there more interesting dynamics we could play with in games, designs that could encourage a different kind of feeling in players?

The obvious answer is to swap out guns for something just as intuitive and rewarding, but without the lethal force. Nintendo’s brilliant *Splatoon* is a multiplayer online shooter with paint guns rather than assault rifles, and in the excellent *Marvel’s Spider-Man*, our hero webs enemies to walls and hangs them from threads, rather than murdering them. “You can imagine a get-hit-and-you’re-out version of *Battle Royale*, but with a Frisbee rather than guns,” said game designer Mitu Khandaker. “There’s a rich wealth of mechanics to explore when we draw inspiration from playground games.”
> # “If I were designing for a broader audience, I would look beyond the known adrenaline/dopamine reward loop.”

Another replacement for gunplay could be photography, which demands the same point-and-shoot action — yet doesn’t involve anyone getting their head blown off. The horror series *Fatal Frame* of the early 2000s had the player taking photos of ghosts, while *Pokémon Snap* and the recent indie title *The Bradwell Conspiracy* used photography too, but these have been outliers. Could a mainstream action title use this mechanic?

Game designer Holly Gramazio told me she could imagine a paparazzi adventure with the same “action at a distance” thrill of a shooter. Perhaps you’re given the freedom to roam a city, stalking celebrity targets to get the most profitable shot. “There have been a good few physical real-world games that work like that — giving players the challenge of photographing other participants without getting captured in an image themselves,” she said. “It really encourages a lot of the same kind of sneaking and hiding and waiting and plotting that makes guns so popular in online games.”

Photography can also engender a sense of creativity and immersion. Imagine a game where you’re a war reporter seeking to capture the most iconic, representative images in a battle environment: You’d still get the sense of peril that audiences expect from action adventures, but your relationship with the environment would be more profound. It would be *Call of Duty* from the perspective of a creative participant rather than a violent interloper.

Some designers have already started to explore a more environmental experience, such as the “walking simulator” games *Dear Esther*, *Gone Home*, and *Firewatch*. Bruce Straley, co-creator of award-winning post-apocalyptic adventure *The Last of Us*, would like to play a game about the Shackleton expedition or the first crew to summit Everest. “[It would have] deep traversal mechanics and a world with a lot of feedback while climbing different snow and ice surfaces, and a story of how the crew isn’t getting along under rising tension, à la *The Descent*,” Straley [tweeted](&lt;|url|&gt;) earlier this year. “You could have different surface types you’d have to read in order to find a safe route, and avalanches, and some sort of skiing mechanic. You’d explore ice caves, acquire useful tools and ideas for routes from previous dead explorers.”

Several designers I spoke to suggested variations on the disaster movie, where you guide survivors on a sinking ship or a failing space station, or heist games where you select a crew and bust open a series of evermore challenging bank vaults. The dynamics would be interesting and complex — trust, fear, self-preservation, altruism — all without firing a single shot.

Last year, the game designer Brie Code set up a new studio called TRU LUV to explore possibilities in design and play that didn’t revolve around violence and tension. We started talking about the idea of a narrative action game set in a society with complex rules for etiquette, gesture, and engagement — maybe a stealth romance in the 18th century English city of Bath, or a bitchy simulation of the fashion trade. “I would totally play *Devil Wears Prada: The RPG*,” she said. “The guilds would be different fashion blogs or magazines and the main things you do are networking and casting and photo shoot design.”

While most action adventures are based around the “fight-or-flight” response to stress, Code is interested in “tend-and-befriend” — a more altruistic instinct to care for other people and form social communities. “In traditional games, designers encourage a flow state in the player by managing an ever-increasing balance between challenge and winning,” said Code. “But about half of us, or maybe all of us some of the time, have a response to stress that involves the desire for care and connection rather than the desire to win. If I were designing for a broader audience, I would look beyond the known adrenaline/dopamine reward loop.”

TRU LUV’s first app, SelfCare, is a series of mini-games in which you lie in bed, cuddling your cat, consulting tarot cards or sorting laundry into colors. “There is a reward structure,” said Code, “it’s just that it’s based on connection rather than challenge. Almost anything that humans find rewarding could be put on a design curve — gardening, decorating, fashion design, throwing parties, knitting, cooking. These experiences are about deepening connection rather than [increasing] tension.”
> # “The idea of killing to win is becoming far too real for it to be entertaining for many people.”

We could have a mainstream narrative game about crafting stuff and helping people. We could have *Uncharted* meets *Animal Crossing* — it just requires a shift in how we think of compulsive design. “I’d love to make a game where you travel through a war-torn country healing people, fixing demolished architecture, working to rebuild what was lost,” [tweeted](&lt;|url|&gt;) Mary Kenney of Insomniac Games. “The heart of it would be that war never changes, but people can.”

At a time of enormous uncertainty, widespread gun violence, and climate crisis, maybe it’s time for a new era of mainstream games that provide an escape from conflict, rather than reveling in it. Game designer Robin Hunicke has been thinking about this her whole career. Starting out on *The Sims* series, she was the producer of *Journey*, one of the most beautiful and thoughtful adventure games ever made. Now, at her development studio Funomena, she and her team are working on peaceful, interesting video game projects, such as the virtual reality experience *Luna*, an interactive fairy tale set in an enchanted forest, where players can create their own relaxing aural environments. She thinks the time is right for this kind of approach to enter the mainstream.

“The idea of killing to win is becoming far too real for it to be entertaining for many people,” she said. “When I play a game like [*Edith Finch](&lt;|url|&gt;)* or [*Dear Esther](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, [*Papers, Please](&lt;|url|&gt;)* or [*Return of the Obra Dinn](&lt;|url|&gt;)* or [*Florence](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, I see the power of making meaning through game mechanics — of combining story, play, and systems to engage players without resorting to gun-based action. This work represents a return to thinking of games as contemplative experiences that are more about discovering the reality of a character, system, or world.”

We all get the appeal of action games, the way that nested systems of attack and react make for compulsive experiences; shooters are never going away. But games need to look beyond violence as the only expression of drama in epic narratives. As Hunicke puts it, “When I contemplate the emerging climate crisis, what’s the set of ‘laws’ that encourage altruism and loving kindness in a large group of people? How do we move beyond the tragedy of fear and violence as the solution to scarcity? If game designers have one skill it is systems design. We should all be thinking very hard about how to design better, more responsive, kindness-reinforcing systems.”<|endoftext|>

# The Dawn of the Reliance Economy

## Your attention was never the endgame

![Photo by [Bram Van Oost](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Bram Van Oost](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

*“Once you hit the first intersection in town, make a right onto Main Street. Go past the fire station and over the railroad tracks. Make your second right after the tracks. If you see a large metal building with a truck parked in overgrown grass, turn around; you’ve gone too far…”*

These are part of the directions to the house I grew up in. For decades, these directions, in one form or another, would be dictated to people planning to visit for the first time. Once I could drive, I would reference equivalent narratives, hastily scribbled down on paper, as I made my way to somewhere new.

This was a deeply inefficient process. It required an upfront conversation to get the directions, followed by significant effort and consternation to decipher them en route. If you were lucky enough to have a “navigator” in the passenger seat next to you, that opened up a whole separate level of coordination. “Wait, was that the big tree with the ‘Y’ in it? Wasn’t that our turn? You were supposed to be watching for the ‘Y’ tree!”

But while inefficient, this process represented something profoundly valuable: awareness and connection.

In order to rattle off a narrative like that, tethered to a landline phone in your kitchen, you had to maintain a detailed map of the area in your head. You and your visitor had to have a shared awareness and contextual understanding of major landmarks and geography, allowing you to shortcut details: “Can you get yourself to Interstate 70? Yes? Great, get to I-70 and head west…”
> # If you regularly use navigation, think about your own mental map of your town or city. How far out can you go before your map starts to fade?

To follow the directions, you had to remain acutely aware of your surroundings throughout the journey. Getting lost and turned around was a common occurrence. But every wrong turn and missed landmark represented new learning and discovery, a chance to expand your own internal map and build your resilience as you were able to troubleshoot and get back on track.

This process, of course, rarely happens today. Now all we have to do is text our address to someone and Google Maps does the rest. It’s an exponential boost in efficiency, but a significant erosion of capability and connection. We don’t need to be aware of our surroundings at all anymore. We can just wait for the voice from our phone to tell us where to turn. If we happen to make a wrong turn, it is immediately corrected. We don’t have to figure anything out.

[Some believe](&lt;|url|&gt;) that over time this kind of reliance will degrade our broader cognitive function. It’s unclear if that is true, but what we can say is that it does diminish our skills and our level of self-sufficiency.

If you regularly use navigation, think about your own mental map of your town or city. How far out can you go before your map starts to fade? Can you name the streets and key landmarks directly surrounding your house? Those a few blocks away? How easily could you give someone narrative directions to your home from miles away? How different is your internal map today than it was five or 10 years ago?

For those who have offloaded navigation to their phones, these questions can start to prove challenging. As our awareness fades, GPS-enabled navigation becomes something we “can’t live without.”

## **The reliance economy**

Today, much of our existence centers on the [attention economy](&lt;|url|&gt;), where our focus and time are mined, and the resulting data is manipulated and sold as a commodity in service of driving advertising revenue and feeding algorithms. We’re becoming painfully aware of the downsides of this arrangement as services architect themselves to put us in a perpetual “can’t look away” state. But as detrimental as the attention economy is, it’s just a temporary stop on our way to a very different destination.

“Can’t look away” was never the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal has always been “can’t live without,” and that is a very different animal.
> # As technology advances, we have begun offloading more and more of our cognitive functions and skills to our devices.

In [2016, researchers conducted a study](&lt;|url|&gt;) to test the effects of the internet on human memory. Participants were divided into two groups and asked a series of challenging trivia questions. One group was allowed to use the internet to answer the questions, while the other group could only use their memory. Afterward, both groups were asked a second set of trivia questions. This time, the questions were easy and both groups were allowed to answer them using any method they chose. What the researchers found was that the group who had already used the internet for hard answers was significantly more likely to use it to find easy answers as well. In fact, 30% of the internet group did not even try to answer any simple questions from memory.

As Benjamin Storm, PhD, lead author of the study, put it:
> “Memory is changing. Our research shows that as we use the internet to support and extend our memory we become more reliant on it. Whereas before we might have tried to recall something on our own, now we don’t bother. As more information becomes available via smartphones and other devices, we become progressively more reliant on it in our daily lives.”

As technology advances, we have begun offloading more and more of our cognitive functions and skills to our devices. This isn’t altogether surprising — cognitive offloading is a strategy we use in other areas of life as well.

In close relationships, like a marriage, ownership of life tasks is frequently split between the couple, with one person taking responsibility for each area, like paying bills, cooking, or managing car maintenance. This allows us to gain efficiency, but it can also have significant detrimental effects. If a spouse dies suddenly or a couple gets divorced, our cognitive support is stripped away and we are left to relearn skills or find outside help with things for which we may have had no responsibility over the years. Yet despite the risks, in this case, reliance has an evolutionary benefit in helping us maintain long-term relationships by forging tighter bonds through shared dependence in a (hopefully) mutually beneficial exchange.

This isn’t the case with our reliance on digital devices. With technology, we aren’t becoming dependent on another person — we’re becoming dependent on corporations. Even if our relationship with a company is mutually beneficial in the short term, the chances of a long-term mutually beneficial relationship are almost nonexistent. We don’t build companies to create long-term relationships. We build companies to drive profits, and that leaves us vulnerable.

Despite the way we position it, technology is no longer a tool to solve problems; it has been twisted into a tool to grow profits. Capitalism isn’t geared to solve problems. If a company truly solved a problem, it would put itself out of business. Instead, the system is geared to keep consumers perpetually in need. For every solution we create, we have to manufacture a new problem. One way we do this is through [planned obsolescence](&lt;|url|&gt;): intentionally designing things to have a short lifespan, which drives frequent upgrade cycles. This is the reason Apple releases a new iPhone every year and stops supporting older versions. This is also the reason that the average appliance now lasts about eight years, and why the fashion industry pushes seasonal trends.

But planned obsolescence isn’t the most powerful problem a company can generate. The most powerful problem a company can create is the “I can’t live without it” problem. If a product replaces a human skill, we become reliant on it, and making us reliant is the ultimate long-term growth strategy. Monopolization isn’t just about pushing out the competition. It’s about monopolizing human capability.

But while this process drives business and economic growth, it degrades our resilience at an individual and societal level. This creates a compounding fragility at the base of our societal structures and we become increasingly vulnerable to catastrophic events. This is a self-perpetuating downward spiral where, as our resiliency continues to diminish, it takes less and less for an event to be catastrophic. Just like a marriage, when our partner goes away or the situation changes, we’re left holding the bag. We’re becoming progressively less capable of handling those changes.
> # Despite the way we position it, technology is no longer a tool to solve problems; it has been twisted into a tool to grow profits.

Our true reliance on technology is still emerging. We’ve only just reached generations who have never seen a world without it. But navigation and Googling for trivia answers are only the tip of the iceberg. The expanding capabilities of artificial intelligence (A.I.) are going to dramatically accelerate the number of tasks we fully offload to devices. Self-driving cars. A.I. personal assistants. Scheduling. Communication. Writing. Purchasing. Courtship. Designing. Coding. Solving mathematical problems. Art. Music. Problem-solving. It’s all up for grabs.

As Marvel’s [Dr. Strange put it](&lt;|url|&gt;), “We’re in the endgame now.”

Some take comfort in the fact that A.I. is still relatively “dumb,” with the sense that it is not a concern until it becomes smarter than us. But what they’re missing is that this isn’t a race to create a superintelligence — this is a race to replace human skills and build the next “can’t live without it” monopoly. In that race, A.I. doesn’t need to become better than us. We just need to become dumber than it. As smart devices subsume more of our capabilities, we will gain efficiency, but we will lock ourselves into a dependent relationship.

This isn’t the first time we’ve headed down this path. We’ve taken a lot of potentially empowering products and contorted them into tools for reliance.

Take the car for example. The car is a massive enhancement to our ability to travel and is incredibly empowering, but in our drive for monopolization, we’ve stripped that empowerment away by developing a system that locks us into car-based travel. We’ve planned and built our entire environment around vehicles, to the point that it is nearly impossible to live without access to motorized transportation. We now have an entire segment of mobility companies trying to untangle those decisions. Additionally, over time we’ve made cars more and more complex to fix and maintain, creating a reliance on an intricate system of mechanics and dealers in order to use them. Finally, we’ve created an unnecessary upgrade cycle through a combination of marketing and mediocre craftsmanship. We’ve taken what was an empowering technology and imprisoned ourselves in it.

We don’t have to continue down this road. Technology is not something that happens to us — it’s something we choose to create. We have the ability to make different choices in the way we design and build our products and the way we incentivize our companies. Despite what we’ve been told, we can [build for empowerment](&lt;|url|&gt;) instead of reliance, and still create profitable businesses. The next decade will see a dramatic expansion of our digital capabilities. It’s time for us to start thinking critically about the choices we make and the things we decide to build.<|endoftext|>

# 5G Could Finally Herald the Era of Wireless Surgery

## The network’s low latency may finally allow remote operations

![](<|image|>)

Though it may still sound like science fiction, over the past 15 years, robotic-assisted surgeries have become practically commonplace. The vast majority of these operations are performed by the [da Vinci surgical system](&lt;|url|&gt;), a four-armed, minimally invasive surgical robot controlled by a doctor sitting at a nearby console. In 2018, the da Vinci system was used in roughly [1 million surgeries](&lt;|url|&gt;). However, some experts see surgical robotics as just a stepping-stone to the next transformational surgery technology: telesurgery, or surgeries conducted by doctors located miles away from their patients.

Telesurgery procedures are still exceedingly rare, due in part to concerns around internet reliability and infrastructure. Controlling a surgery remotely is possible only if the data connection is broad and secure. But now, with the adoption of 5G communication networks, there’s reason to believe that mass-market telesurgeries are finally on the horizon. In fact, earlier this year, [unconfirmed reports](&lt;|url|&gt;) emerged that surgeons in China had conducted the world’s first 5G telesurgery on a human patient.

Remote surgery research in the United States dates back to the late 1990s, when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began funding the development of surgical robotics. The first human telesurgery was [performed in 2001](&lt;|url|&gt;), when doctors working in New York removed the gallbladder of a patient in France using the Zeus Robotic Surgical System. The operation was conducted and monitored by a team of 40 people, including surgeons, engineers from France Telecom, and representatives of Computer Motion, the company that created Zeus. The machine was rudimentary by today’s standards, with a 2D camera and pre-HD video quality. It also had just three surgical arms, as opposed to the da Vinci’s four. “It was really kind of an advanced version of traditional laparoscopy,” says Roger Smith, PhD, chief technology officer of the AdventHealth Nicholson Center.
> # 5G’s ability to penetrate farther than current wireless networks could finally enable telesurgery, bringing necessary operations to those who need it more.

The 2001 surgery, known as the Lindbergh operation, relied on a hardwire internet connection tapping the highest-speed fiber optic service available at the time: 10 megabits per second. (By comparison, in 2018, the average home internet connection speed in the United States was [18.7 megabits](&lt;|url|&gt;) per second.) At that speed, surgeons experienced a transmission delay of no more than 200 milliseconds — small enough to be considered safe. The proof of concept was a success. Since then, several more surgeries have been performed or assisted remotely, though most attempts have relied on a hardwire internet connection rather than a mobile one.

The Department of Defense funded Smith and his team to study telesurgery latency — the delay experienced by remote doctors — from 2011 to 2014. They found that telesurgery could be achieved with remarkably low latency over a hardwire internet connection, with delays as small as five milliseconds within a closed hospital network and usually no more than 100 to 200 milliseconds even over long distances. Smith says that most surgeons could not detect latency between 100 and 200 milliseconds. In simulations at 300 milliseconds, surgeons did notice a delay, but most were able to adapt. “Above 500 milliseconds, some surgeons could still perform pretty well,” Smith says. “But most of them had reached the edge of their tolerance.”

Populations in rural areas often [lack access](&lt;|url|&gt;) to specialized surgical procedures and, particularly in emergencies, miss out on life-saving care. Experts say that 5G’s ability to penetrate farther than current wireless networks could finally enable telesurgery, bringing necessary operations to those who need it more.

Though a few surgeries have been “tele-assisted” via wireless networks in recent years, the first fully wireless telesurgeries were reported to have taken place earlier this year. In January, stories in the Chinese press indicated that a surgeon there had [removed the liver](&lt;|url|&gt;) of a lab animal 30 miles away using da Vinci robots and wireless 5G internet. Then, in March, Dr. Ling Zhipei, of Beijing’s PLA General Hospital, reportedly [performed brain surgery](&lt;|url|&gt;) on a human patient more than 1,800 miles away—the first reported wireless human telesurgery.

Information on these operations is difficult to verify: All reports source Chinese state media, and Zhipei could not be reached for comment. Available reports do not clarify what kind of latency doctors experienced and how the medical team accounted for potential errors. Given China’s significant investment in both [surgical robotics](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [5G networks](&lt;|url|&gt;) — Chinese tech giant Huawei in particular is emerging as an industry leader — the 5G telesurgery feat is credible, though there’s reason for skepticism.

“They would have had to make significant alterations to the current da Vinci platform to use it over 5G,” says telesurgery pioneer Dr. Mehran Anvari, who has [routinely performed](&lt;|url|&gt;) telerobotic operations since 2003 and continues to work on the development of new surgical robotics. And as the editor in chief of the *International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery*, Anvari says he would expect to have heard about the coming publication of any articles regarding the surgery. He has not.

A representative from Intuitive Surgical would not deny or confirm the use of the da Vinci system in the Chinese 5G operation, though they pointed out that the machine is not designed for telesurgeries. “Our systems are not telesurgery systems — they are robotic-assisted surgical systems, which are under full surgeon control at a console in the OR with the patient and surgical team,” they said.

Regardless, Anvari is excited about the prospect of 5G telesurgery. 5G networks are able to move more data, much farther, far more quickly and reliably than existing 4G networks by operating at significantly higher frequencies — anywhere from 30 GHz to 300 GHz, compared to 4G’s 6 GHz. With more frequency bands available, the network is also far less likely to be interrupted. In the United States, 5G is only available in home service and mobile hotspots in a few cities, with a wider rollout not expected until 2020. China, Japan, and South Korea have all [outpaced the United States](&lt;|url|&gt;) in building 5G infrastructure.

Today’s surgical robots are large and heavy because they require great computational power to process graphics, vision from the robot’s cameras, and movement. In addition to enabling telesurgery, 5G technology could also enable smaller, nimbler surgical robots, which could greatly expand a remote surgeon’s capabilities.

“With a 5G wireless connection, you can do those things not on the robot, but somewhere else, in the cloud,” says Ludovic Righetti, who leads the Machines in Motion Laboratory at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering and works with 5G in the [NYU Wireless](&lt;|url|&gt;) lab. “With 5G, we can transmit a lot of data, and we can do all the processing as fast as we receive it.” Righetti says that 5G’s ultra-low latency could even allow surgical robotics to incorporate haptic — or tactile — feedback, so that surgeons could actually feel what their instruments are doing.
> # Remote robotic capabilities could allow one surgeon in a central location to perform interventional procedures on patients across an entire network of hospitals.

Among U.S. surgical robotics companies, [Corindus Vascular Robotics](&lt;|url|&gt;) is leading the way in 5G testing. The company’s CorPath GRX is an interventional vascular robot that assists physicians in placing stents and is already in use around the world for coronary and peripheral vascular interventions. The company recently [began the process](&lt;|url|&gt;) of seeking FDA approval for stroke intervention.

In 2018, the CorPath was [used for remote procedures](&lt;|url|&gt;) in humans for the first time. Dr. Tejas Patel, of the Apex Heart Institute in Ahmedabad, India, successfully performed remote procedures on five patients from a distance of about 20 miles away. The telesurgeries relied on a hardwire internet connection with a guaranteed speed of 100 megabits per second. Doctors were on the scene with the patients, ready to take over in the event of any problems.

For the past six months, Corindus has been testing its technology in 5G. In late April, the company conducted its first 5G surgical simulations. From the Verizon Innovation Center in Waltham, Massachusetts, Dr. Ryan Madder operated a machine located about six miles away at another Verizon center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, completing between 12 and 15 simulated surgical cases using a combination of 5G and hardwire internet. In the second half of the year, Corindus plans to expand this testing into a multiple-city, cross-country pilot.

Doug Teany, chief operating officer at Corindus, says the company sees two medical conditions as candidates for remote intervention: heart attack and stroke. In rural areas, valuable time is often lost while transporting a patient to a facility where they can relieve specialized care. The more quickly patients receive treatment, the more likely they are to make a full recovery and less likely to need long-term care. Remote robotic capabilities could allow one surgeon in a central location to perform interventional procedures on patients across an entire network of hospitals.

In addition to 5G’s ability to reach rural areas, Teany points out that network “[slicing](&lt;|url|&gt;)”— a unique 5G capability that lets users create dedicated end-to-end networks for a specific function — could make telesurgery more secure.

In the future, Corindus is also interested in using 5G to create augmented reality. “It becomes feasible on ultra-high-speed connections to give more information to a remote physician about what’s in the room and what’s happening. The clinical goal is to create a sense of immersion so it looks and feels like they’re in the room,” he says. “The more advanced features we can layer in, [the more we can] reduce risk to the patient.”<|endoftext|>

# A Local Code for America Brigade Works to Reprogram St. Louis

## Overhauled digital infrastructure will help people access the services they need — but deep-rooted problems persist

![Photo: benkrut/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: benkrut/Getty Images*

Right now, in a four-block section of the Wells-Goodfellow neighborhood in north St. Louis, cranes and backhoes are demolishing and clearing [130 badly blighted properties](&lt;|url|&gt;) with the help of Jack Dorsey, a native of the city and co-founder of Twitter and Square. Dorsey’s hometown has struggled with blocks and blocks of blight [for decades](&lt;|url|&gt;), which serve as magnets for drug activity and gun violence. But those backhoes might not have been there were it not for the efforts of local civic techies.

Which brings us to rooms 126–128 in the St. Louis City Hall building, where you’ll find the recorder of deeds office. Late last year, Michael Butler, a tech-savvy millennial and former Missouri state representative, [ousted an incumbent](&lt;|url|&gt;) who had held that office longer than Butler had been alive. Butler’s platform? “In 2019, you should not have to go to City Hall to access your city government,” he says. “The general public, they can’t believe that the government that they pay taxes to every day is not up to date with the private sector they pay fees to every day. … All we’re asking is that government keep up.”

At a hackathon back in 2015, while nearby Ferguson still smoldered in the wake of the Michael Brown murder, Butler first met members of [OpenSTL](&lt;|url|&gt;), the local volunteer brigade of [Code for America](&lt;|url|&gt;), the innovative nonprofit that began 10 years ago as a sort of Peace Corps for well-meaning nerds. Code for America’s brigades operate in [81 cities](&lt;|url|&gt;) and in almost every state. They’ve produced a range of solutions for real, local problems, from a [renter’s rights app](&lt;|url|&gt;) in San Jose, California, to a [reentry resources website](&lt;|url|&gt;) in Greensboro, North Carolina, for people recently released from prison.

That 2015 St. Louis hackathon focused on reform of the municipal courts system and produced [YourSTLCourts](&lt;|url|&gt;), a tool to track upcoming court dates and receive text message reminders on a mobile phone. There, Butler met Nehemiah Dacres, then the captain of OpenSTL, who had found his way to the civic tech world after becoming interested in local policy and infrastructure when the bus routes he rode to get to his computer science classes at Saint Louis University were terminated. Dacres eventually headed up OpenSTL in his spare time while working as a private sector engineer and developer.
> # “It’s only people who don’t believe in government that think that there’s no hope.”

“We’re trying to make government services better so it serves the people better,” he says. “It’s only people who don’t believe in government that think that there’s no hope.”

Dacres’ 22-year-old OpenSTL co-captain, Mohith Rao, keeps a day job as a machine learning engineer at Anheuser-Busch but sets aside a significant portion of his evenings and weekends for tinkering on local problems.

“We’re not motivated by money,” Rao says. “We’re invested in the city because this is where we live. If we help the city do its job, then we’re all better off.”

When Butler was elected St. Louis recorder of deeds on his platform of digitizing city hall, he recruited Dacres as his software specialist to help him make good on his promises. Dacres continues to co-captain OpenSTL, as he has for many years. He’s part of a growing community of Code for America volunteers, former fellows, and staffers who are leading a civic tech culture shift from within municipal governments across the country, seeding and sowing the ideas of smart, user-centered digital design and open data for the common good.

“There’s been a steady transition to governments taking these ideas and then actually bringing in the people who were showing how it could be done,” says Alex Howard, a digital governance expert and open government advocate who previously worked for the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit focused on civic tech. “That’s a sea change in perspective that’s happened very quickly and under the radar. There’s a whole bunch of people all around the country, all around the world, the larger ‘Code for’ movements that are taking the idea of trying to help government work better and making it in their own molds.”
> # “The civic tech industry is not built for social justice these days, it’s built for capitalism.”

Butler is quick to point out that in the broader landscape of civic tech, the progressive work of Code for America brigade members is dwarfed by the activity of for-profit contractors peddling big-ticket, one-size-fits-all solutions that often don’t meet the needs of all. “The civic tech industry is not built for social justice these days, it’s built for capitalism,” he says. “A lot of players in civic tech promote themselves as these altruistic companies. They exist to make a profit, not to solve problems for free for poor people.”

Howard cautions against what he sees as the potential for civic tech projects — even the most altruistic — to only treat the problematic symptoms, not the systems that create them. He points to Code for America’s [GetCalFresh project](&lt;|url|&gt;), which has helped one million people across California access SNAP benefits. “It’s great that we can make it easier for people to stay on food stamps, but why are we continually enmeshing these people in a compliance culture instead of empowering them with enough food, housing, training, health care, and whatever they need to be back to being a fully functioning adult?” Howard asks. “My consistent concern in this civic tech space is the extent to which digitization actually bleeds urgency away from fixing the structural problem in a society.”

Butler and his staff are already well into the process of digital transformation of their little corner of St. Louis government — they’ve brought their website out of the late ’90s, are building the infrastructure for citizens to access their vital records online, and within a few years hope to create a vast, searchable archive of the millions of historical paper-based city records, documents, and images that currently live in the basement file cabinets of St. Louis city hall.

A couple of years ago, the St. Louis mayor’s office asked OpenSTL and others to tackle the [growing problem of blight](&lt;|url|&gt;) for the annual [National Day of Civic Hacking](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s a vital issue; in a city of 129,000 properties, some 25,000 sit vacant or derelict, and the most affected neighborhoods are in the predominantly black north side of town. Decades of neglect and disinvestment have reinforced the structural inequalities and injustices that sparked civil unrest in Ferguson in 2014 following the police killing of Michael Brown.

The eventual result of that hackathon, the [STL Vacancy Portal](&lt;|url|&gt;), combined the data of four city agencies — including data from Butler’s department — to create a public database to help track patterns and make more clear the debilitating consequences of urban blight. That transparency project has helped push the city to [demolish hundreds of derelict buildings](&lt;|url|&gt;) so far, with hundreds more to come down by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Butler’s staff has begun to analyze its property records data to uncover patterns of fraudulent and predatory transactions.

A team of college interns from Washington University has just begun working out of Butler’s department, digitizing and analyzing all historical documents related to restrictive housing covenants — those pernicious regulations that built segregation into U.S. cities and continue to shape modern redlining. “My main goal is that the data allows us to ask good questions,” says Butler.

For its first 10 years, Code for America had an underdog rallying cry: “No one is coming — it’s up to us.” They were the vanguard, the ones who showed that things could be done differently, a demonstration of what some called “[government 2.0](&lt;|url|&gt;).” At the recent annual Code for America Summit, founder Jen Pahlka took stock of how far things have come in a decade and offered up a new slogan to her troops: “Everyone is coming — and it’s still up to us,” she said.

Civic tech is now in its teenage years. The social justice and open government idealism of its infancy is alive and well in the work of the volunteers in Code for America brigades like OpenSTL and their city hall collaborators.

“The questions we’re all asking just come to us organically,” said Dacres. “It’s so natural, we don’t even think of it as civic tech.”<|endoftext|>

# Who Owns a Meme?

## A legal battle over Fortnite raises many questions without clear answers

![Photo by Greg Doherty/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo by Greg Doherty/Getty*

There is no legal precedent for Backpack Kid, aka Russell Horning, the teenager who turned heads as the backup dancer du jour in a [Katy Perry *Saturday Night Live *performance](&lt;|url|&gt;) back in 2017. His mesmeric rhythm and aloof expression immediately went viral, and today we call his dance “the floss.”

The floss is everywhere. [Ted Danson did it.](&lt;|url|&gt;) [Mark Ingram did it.](&lt;|url|&gt;) [A 96-year old World War II veteran did it.](&lt;|url|&gt;) And it’s in *Fortnite*, where a wide range of emotes, or character actions, are sold by developer Epic Games. *Fortnite *characters can also dance using the “fresh” emote, which directly cribs [from the “Carlton dance](&lt;|url|&gt;)” Alfonso Ribeiro made famous on the *Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, *or “swipe it,” a copy of 2 Milly’s [Milly Rock dance](&lt;|url|&gt;).

None of the creators of these dances see a cent from the game’s in-app purchases, which, in aggregate, reportedly led Epic to [$1 billion in revenue](&lt;|url|&gt;) midway through last year. So, naturally, the creators sued. And quickly hit a brick wall.

Three months after filing those suits, Horning, 2 Milly, and Ribiero [each temporarily dropped their cases](&lt;|url|&gt;) this week after the Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs can’t sue for copyright infringement until they have officially applied, and received, a copyright license on their dances from the U.S. Copyright Office.
> # “With the advent of technology, and the advent of social media, [cases like this] are going to become more common.”

That may be trickier than it sounds. Copyright law was conceived “[to promote the progress of science and useful arts](&lt;|url|&gt;).” The idea that, someday, a company could sell short dance movements — memes, essentially — adopted from short-form digital video would have been difficult to imagine when modern copyright laws were written more than 40 years ago.

“I’m pretty sure that the legislators didn’t think, ‘Oh, years from now there will be this thing called the internet, where someone can create a meme that produces copyrighted material in this matter,” says Merlyne Jean-Louis, a business and entertainment lawyer based in New York. “The law is reactionary. With the advent of technology, and the advent of social media, [cases like this] are going to become more common.”

By a strict reading of the law, the chances that Horning was ever going to collect residuals on the floss were slim. Still, the* Fortnite* dance lawsuits could be read as an effort to finally untangle property rights in the digital age. The history and norms of the internet are defined by a lack of jurisprudence when it comes to respecting each other’s ownership. Nobody has ever paid a tax for reposting a meme.

But in 2019, with the scrutiny that these cases have summoned, it looks like we’re on the road to an insurrection. Consider FuckJerry, aka Elliot Tebele, who for years has cribbed funny tweets from comedians while conveniently leaving out the names of the authors. Powerful entertainers and writers — people like [Patton Oswalt](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [*Vulture* comedy editor Megh Wright](&lt;|url|&gt;) — were moved to speak out against him earlier this year. Last month, FuckJerry apologized and promised to give creators proper credit moving forward, while also echoing a familiar refrain.

“In the early days of FuckJerry, there were not well-established norms for reposting and crediting other users’ content, especially in meme culture,” [Tebele wrote in his *Medium *post](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Instagram was still a new medium at the time, and I simply didn’t give any thought to the idea that reposting content could be damaging in any way.”

“No well-established norms for reposting.” Gabriel Gundacker knows that attitude well. He landed one of the most viral moments of 2018 when he posted a deliriously weird video of himself singing about the cast of *Smallfoot*, a middling animated flick. (The song was called “[Zendaya Is Meechee](&lt;|url|&gt;).”) There are dozens of [T-shirts](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [coffee mugs](&lt;|url|&gt;) bobbing around the internet emblazoned with his meme, with absolutely none of the residuals kicking back his way.


“The futility can be exhausting,” Gundacker tells *OneZero*. “Right now, a video I did on Tumblr a few years ago about the movie *Holes *is currently performing very well on some stranger’s meme page without any credit to me. It’s sad, but I don’t feel like spamming my current followers about trying to get this guy to edit his Instagram caption to include my handle. Asking someone to stop following a funny, faceless account that makes them laugh because of a complex moral obligation to uncredited creators is a lot to ask.”

Gundacker has taken some steps to solidify his content rights. He signed up with a service called Collab, which automatically scans YouTube to see if anyone has uploaded his videos without his consent. The service [automatically](&lt;|url|&gt;) finds any pirates and syndicates videos on compilation channels to drive revenue, which means that every month, Gundacker gets a stipend in his bank account. It’s like how Jerry Seinfeld has been living off royalties from his sitcom, but on a much, much, much smaller scale.

“It’s always a pleasant surprise, getting residual checks for short, dumb internet videos I made,” Gundacker says.

Copyright can only do so much to protect creators anyway. (*Aquaman *isn’t even out on home video yet, but if you wanted to, you could grab a 4K rip from a torrent that dropped last week.) Backpack Kid and Gabriel Gundacker are wrestling with the same fundamental problem: how to capitalize in an era when “art” can exist in the span of seconds and replicate across the internet in an instant.
> # “Asking someone to stop following a funny, faceless account that makes them laugh because of a complex moral obligation to uncredited creators is a lot to ask.”

“People a quarter of my age have figured out ways to monetize their talents that aren’t necessarily reliant on copyright,” Jonathan Band, a law professor at Georgetown specializing in intellectual property and internet regulation, tells *OneZero*. “In the olden days, you created content, you sold content, and that’s how you made your money. Now you create content and find other ways to make your money.”

“Most people don’t see the value of their work until it becomes viral. If you have the foresight in advance to see the value in your work, you should register it [at the Copyright Office] as soon as possible,” Jean-Louis adds.

Consider the first generation of memers: The [Numa Numa kid](&lt;|url|&gt;), [the *Star Wars* kid](&lt;|url|&gt;) — each pillaged for years without any recourse. A complete disregard of creator ownership may have been etched into the early days of internet culture, but it doesn’t have to stay that way.

“Until the people making this internet content are respected as entertainers, the general public won’t really care about them getting their just payments,” Gundacker says. “But as young people start to grow up with the people on their phone along with the ones on television, hopefully respect for those phone people becomes a given.”<|endoftext|>

# Star Wars’ Biggest Blunder Isn’t What You Think

## Star Wars’ Biggest Blunder Isn’t What You Think

### The most legitimate problem with the franchise is the one everyone’s forgotten

![Photo by Sascha Steinbach/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo by Sascha Steinbach/Getty*

To say that nerds had problems with *The Last Jedi* is a vast understatement. Many lamented that the 2017 film was “inauthentic” *Star Wars* and, almost a year later, [are](&lt;|url|&gt;) [*still](&lt;|url|&gt;)* [kvetching](&lt;|url|&gt;) about how anything it portrayed outside the boundaries defined in the original trilogy is simply unacceptable. This is dumb for about a hundred reasons, but one of the biggest is that the original three *Star Wars *movies had the most epic, most awful blunder in the entire franchise: Luke and Leia kissing.

And this sums up the biggest problem with grown-up nerds.

I’m talking specifically about those fans, primarily in their thirties and forties, who feel shortchanged by the newest installments, remakes, and reboots of the franchises they grew up with. These fans argue that modern-day renditions are not wholly faithful to and are therefore worse than the originals they’re modeled on. They hold dear what they watched and read and played with in the 1970s and ’80s and almost always find major flaws with any new version.
> # This sums up the biggest problem with grown-up nerds.

Because *Star Wars* fandom is so large, this subsection of nerds is accordingly bigger and thus more prominent, which is why the declaration that* The Last Jedi* was somehow wrong sounded so damned loud. Fans were aghast that the movie dared expand the Force and its powers. Some were traumatized to see their childhood hero Luke Skywalker transformed into a hermit (myself [included](&lt;|url|&gt;), although I liked the movie). Then there were the [nitwits up in arms](&lt;|url|&gt;) that women and minorities had speaking roles. Still, these fans all had two things in common: a sense of ownership over the franchise and a perception of *A New Hope*, *The Empire Strikes Back, *and* Return of the Jedi* as perfect, inviolate entities to which all new *Star Wars* movies must be compared.

In reality, the original trilogy is far from perfect. Any adult who watches the originals with fresh eyes can discern that these beloved movies have significant issues (and I bet most modern kids can, too). The dialogue frequently borders on painful, the timelines are a mess (Luke trained with Yoda for a week, tops?), and using the Death Star twice in three movies is lame as hell. When I was growing up, every *Star Wars* fan I knew hated the Ewoks with a passion; after the prequels and Jar Jar Binks, the warrior teddy bears have been forgiven and are as beloved as anything else from the *Star Wars* universe of 1977 to 1983.

The fact that the Ewoks have become retroactively great among older fans is proof enough that their complaints about the “correct” *Star Wars* are frivolous and futile. But there’s an even more damning example, because somehow we’ve all given a free pass to the fact that the heroic siblings Luke and Leia kissed. Twice.

I can already hear countless nerds typing furiously. And sure, I’ll grant you that Leia kissing Luke “for luck” in *A New Hope* before they swung through the Death Star chasm was a quick smooch, too fast to be considered romantic, so it probably shouldn’t count. And it could be argued — as people will argue after reading this — that their kiss in *The Empire Strikes Back* doesn’t really matter either, since Leia was only doing it because she was pissed at Han.

To hell with that. This is bananas, and it’s even more bananas that George Lucas decided to make them siblings retroactively. [Early scripts of *Empire](&lt;|url|&gt;)* not only included a second romantic kiss between the two, but also a scene where Luke discovered he had a twin sister named Nellith(!), hinting that Lucas didn’t make this bonkers retcon until *Return of the Jedi* was in production. So, not only was this unnecessary weirdness a problem that could have easily been avoided, but Lucas actually had to go out of his way to make it happen. This is some incredibly shoddy storytelling, to say the very least.
> # I can already hear countless nerds typing furiously.

But here’s the wildest part: Everybody is cool with two of the most iconic and beloved brother-sister heroes in pop culture smooching, because it happened when the people watching were simply enjoying it, not critically combing over it for anything that conflicts with their personal notion of “authentic *Star Wars*.”

Can you imagine how many people would lose their minds if these movies, with this revelation, had come out in the past five years? The internet would collapse under the shock, anger, and burning hot takes. Fans would be appalled and furious, and it would be a lot more justified than their niggling gripes over *The Last Jedi*’s minutiae.

I’m trying to think of some modern equivalent at the same level of pop culture dominance. All I can think of is if Ron and Hermione, after a half-dozen *Harry Potter* movies slowly positioning them as romantic partners, suddenly discovered after a couple late-night make-out sessions in the Gryffindor dorm that Mr. Weasley had cheated on Mrs. Weasley 16 years ago and that they were half-siblings. People would practically explode. Chaos would rule the land.

The forgiveness — no, the utter nonexistence — of what should truly be an uncomfortable moment for all *Star Wars* viewers is, to me, the perfect encapsulation of “nostalgia goggles.” The reason the adult nerds who have spent 2018 freaking out about the rules of space magic are cool with Luke and Leia’s kiss(es) is because they absorbed them as kids. One of these problems is bigger than the other, and here’s a hint: It’s not the one where Leia, daughter of and sister to two of the most powerful Jedi in the universe, has picked up a couple of Force powers over the past 30 years.

It’s very annoying that nerds are complaining merely because a new *Star Wars* movie is slightly different than the movies they enjoyed as a kid. But in a way, it’s also heartening to realize that the kids who are growing up with Rey and Finn and BB-8 now are simply falling in love with the movies, just as we did when we were kids. Of course, this possibly means that in 30 years, as adults, they’ll be complaining that* Episode 20* is completely unfaithful to the *Star Wars* canon, and the cycle will continue. If you find this more depressing than uplifting, there’s some consolation: At least there won’t be any more Skywalker family make-out sessions.<|endoftext|>

# Here’s What Brain-Stimulating Memory Enhancement Feels Like

## Scientists found that electrical brain stimulation improved memory among older adults in a recent study. I went to the lab to try it out myself.

![Photo courtesy of Robert Reinhart, Boston University](<|image|>)*Photo courtesy of Robert Reinhart, Boston University*

The moment the researchers start firing electricity into my brain, I feel a repetitive pinching sensation on the left side of my head. It’s prickly and annoying, just short of painful.

Robert Reinhart, a neuroscientist at Boston University who is demonstrating his research on me, assures me that the feeling will subside in about 30 seconds as the skin cells on my scalp get accustomed to the electric current passing through them. He’s right: The sensation soon downshifts to a persistent tingle — noticeable, but no longer irritating.

This makes it much easier to resume the memory test I’m trying to complete.

I’m sitting in a chair in a little room in Reinhart’s lab, [wearing a cap of electrodes](&lt;|url|&gt;) and holding a video game controller in both hands. On a table in front of me is a computer monitor that displays a series of images, each one flashed on the screen for less than a second. I am shown mundane objects such as a book, an abacus, a glass of orange juice, or, more incongruously, a creepy clown puppet. After a few seconds of whiteness, another image briefly appears. It’s either a repeat of the first object I was shown, or it’s the same object altered slightly. Perhaps the book’s pages are splayed or maybe there’s more juice in the glass. I’ve been instructed to hit buttons on the video game controller to indicate whether the object is just as I remember it from its first flash on screen, or whether it’s changed. I see a green check if I’m right and a red X if I’m wrong.

After a few minutes, another test begins. A series of lines appear on the screen, slanted either slightly to the left or slightly to the right. That image is instantly scrambled by a grid of squares, and I have to remember if the original set of lines slanted to the left or right.

These various tests are assessing my working memory, which is the ability to hold information in your mind over a short period of time. Reinhart compares it to a sketch pad. It’s how you keep the first part of a sentence active in your mind as you read the last part. When your bank sends you a one-time code to log on to your account, working memory lets you remember it five seconds later. You likely won’t recall the code five days later, however, because other information has occupied the scratch pad by then.

The tests in Reinhart’s lab aren’t difficult; I get correct answers most of the time. So do most people. But age appears to degrade performance. Reinhart and his colleagues [revealed](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a study published April 8 that test takers in their 20s got 90% of the answers right, while subjects in their 60s and 70s got 80%.
> # “It’s easy to criticize an emerging field before there’s standardization.”

But here is what’s remarkable: After the researchers began sending electricity into the heads of the older people in the trial, they started doing as well on the tests as the 20-year-olds. The improvement was still detectable almost an hour after the electrical stimulation ended.

I’m halfway between 20 and 70 — young enough to assume I don’t need an electric memory boost, but old enough to respond to the news of Reinhart’s research with a hopeful pang. Is this too good to be true?


On the surface, this research sounds familiar. Other scientists have found that mild and noninvasive electrical stimulation [improves memory](&lt;|url|&gt;) and learning. It’s being [tested](&lt;|url|&gt;) as a therapy for people who stutter. You can buy headbands and headphones that zap your brain with frequencies that purportedly increase your [neuroplasticity](&lt;|url|&gt;) or relieve [anxiety, depression](&lt;|url|&gt;), or pain.

It’s not clear, however, that those noninvasive methods work very well. They deliver much less energy than older (and more [controversial)](&lt;|url|&gt;) technologies such as electroshock therapy, and it’s debatable whether enough electricity gets through the skull to matter. Many promising findings from studies of noninvasive electrical stimulation [have not been replicated](&lt;|url|&gt;).

“I am not aware of any solid evidence base that suggests that noninvasive brain stimulation… really improves cognition,” says Joseph Devlin, an experimental psychologist at University College London. “I’ve even published [one of these papers](&lt;|url|&gt;) myself, so I’m not trying to be mean or disrespectful. After 20-plus years of working in the field, I’ve seen various trends come and go. This feels like one of those without staying power.”

Reinhart, a 39-year-old assistant professor, is well aware of this perception. He counters that many studies haven’t been sufficiently rigorous. Electrostimulation technology is cheap and easy to use, which means “anyone can just buy these things and start running [a] current and seeing effects,” Reinhart says. “Many of the findings are hard to believe.”

He’s designing his research to address those shortcomings. Reinhart believes neurostimulation is in much the same place where brain-scanning technologies such as EEGs and [functional MRI ](&lt;|url|&gt;)were decades ago — before they became accepted ways to detect what’s happening in people’s heads when they’re performing various activities or thinking about certain things. “You see the same thing: There’s no standardization of the field, there’s lots of criticism — because there are replication issues,” he says. “It’s easy to criticize an emerging field before there’s standardization.”

One of the ways Reinhart’s experiment differs from past research is that he’s using smaller electrodes. This allows him to exercise more control over how the electricity hits the prefrontal and temporal areas of the brain. He’s also using alternating current rather than direct current, which means he can adjust the frequency for each individual. In his most recent study, people first had their natural brain wave patterns measured.** **Then, when the memory test began, Reinhart and his colleagues tuned their equipment to provide the same frequency, in hopes of nudging different portions of the subjects’ brains into sync.

Some people get a placebo — “a sham current” that delivers the prickly sensation for a while and then subsides, without continuing to deliver electricity. But people who get the real electrical current receive it at the frequency that, at least theoretically, will align disparate portions of their brain on the frequency that’s optimal for them. People whose brains displayed tighter synchronization while being stimulated performed best on the memory tests.

In order to determine specifically what the electricity is doing to the brain, Reinhart’s group measured what happened when they flipped the current to push people’s brain waves out of sync. They discovered that the subjects did worse on the test. This indicates that working memory is directly affected by specific frequencies. “That’s really strong evidence,” Reinhart says.

[Several neuroscientists](&lt;|url|&gt;) have called Reinhart’s research an intriguing step forward. Dorothy Bishop, a professor of developmental neuropsychology at Oxford University, told me it was “potentially exciting.” But her use of “potentially” is key. In keeping with the elusive nature of this branch of science, everyone wants to see if the findings can be replicated and expanded to encompass more people, more memory tests, and longer observational periods before electrical tune-ups could even be considered as a therapy for the elderly.

“The study showed improvement in one specific memory task over the course of an experiment,” Bishop says. “There was no indication that this would generalize to everyday memory, or that the effects would persist over time.”

My own experience wearing the electrode cap differs from what subjects in Reinhart’s published experiment experienced. Neither I nor the researchers are “blinded,” in scientific parlance: We all know I’m getting a real current and not a placebo. He and his graduate students also didn’t measure the frequencies my brain is naturally using, so instead of getting a custom signal, I received one in the middle of a common range. That means I probably didn’t receive the maximum benefit and might not have gotten one at all.

Nonetheless, for whatever reason, something changes after they begin zapping me. Before the juice started flowing, the tests had been getting tedious. After only 15 minutes of staring at the screen, I was getting tired of focusing so intently. But with the current flowing, I felt absolutely locked in. I’d even performed a little better on the test, though that might have been due to all the practice I’d gotten by that point. The main difference was how easy it was to focus on the flashing images, even as I kept up a conversation with Reinhart.

As soon as Reinhart published his April 8 paper, he began receiving inquiries from investors and entrepreneurs who want to apply his findings to a memory enhancement product. He’s so far ignored them. Although he’s pretty sure he’s onto something, Reinhart says the brain is nowhere close to being a system that can reliably be hacked. In fact, his latest study has left him with even more follow-up questions.

“There’s a huge mismatch,” he says, “between what we know and what we wish to know.”<|endoftext|>

# The Machine Behind Twitter’s Strangest Promoted Tweets

## It costs $99, and we tried it

![Illustration: [Shira Inbar](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Shira Inbar](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

When Ryan Downey signed up to automatically promote his tweets, he thought he was doing himself a favor.

Downey, a freelance journalist who joined Twitter in 2007, had previously experimented with the platform’s traditional method of advertising: promoting specific tweets to a tailored audience. He mostly did so because he wanted to publicize his stories, but he found the traditional approach wasn’t particularly effective. And so, when he received an invitation in 2017 to try a service called Promote Mode—through which Twitter would automatically promote his tweets—he went along with it. He assumed the platform would know better than anyone which tweets to highlight.

That appears to have been a mistake.

“I think about canceling it at least 75% of the time I think about it at all,” Downey tells *OneZero*. “I’m never aware of what tweet is being promoted until I get a reply [from someone] that says, ‘Why is this a promoted tweet?’ Which happens regularly.” (After we spoke the first time, Downey followed up a few weeks later and said that he had, indeed, canceled it.)

At its core, [Promote Mode](&lt;|url|&gt;), which launched in 2017, is simple: Users pay to have their tweets automatically beamed into people’s timelines. Twitter calls it an “automated, always-on advertising solution,” intended for people who don’t have the money or time to devise an ad campaign but who want to build their brand or their company’s brand. In practice, this means paying $99 per month to send your first 10 tweets of the day to an audience that matches certain interests or locations. (Quote tweets, replies, or retweets aren’t included, and selected tweets must adhere to Twitter’s [quality filter](&lt;|url|&gt;).)

This simplicity can transmogrify into something deeply, hilariously, and wonderfully weird. Promote Mode, you see, doesn’t seem to be able to distinguish between tweets that are truly intended to further a user’s brand and tweets that are about, say, [irritating neighbors](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s like a toddler, thrashing around in the backyard, pulling up fistfuls of grass. Occasionally, it scoops up an errant piece of dog poop.






*The Ringer*’s Kate Knibbs memorably called these* *“[Weird Promoted Tweets](&lt;|url|&gt;),” and while they’re not as ubiquitous as traditional promoted tweets—think obvious ads from Secret or the *New York Times*—they’re common enough that there’s a Twitter account [dedicated to tracking them](&lt;|url|&gt;). Divorced from their proper context, the tweets are just awkward, like seeing your therapist in the grocery store. Though some bizarre promoted tweets are the result of people choosing to promote said tweets, Promote Mode, which is currently in beta, is another likely culprit.

“I was offered to join a beta, and at the time I thought it was a decent idea, so I gave it a try,” says Shane Andrews, who runs the popular [Repzilla ](&lt;|url|&gt;)YouTube channel. He ended up leaving after three months. “I was getting complaints from my own audience, some leaving, and a lot from random people. If Twitter is promoting what I had for lunch, and people think I’m being so frivolous with my platform, it looks bad and seems disrespectful.”

Benjamin Cole, an independent game developer, has been using Promote Mode for about four months. While he estimates he’s gained fewer than 50 followers from the program overall, he notes that, according to Twitter, his reach has increased between 23% and 62% depending on the month. “The set-and-forget angle is enticing—and why I chose to use this service [because] I have to do all my social media myself,” he says.

I was curious to delve into the inner workings of the service, so I signed up for the beta service myself. Mostly, I wanted to get a sense of how effective Promote Mode really was. I also wanted to see if people noticed. (My tweets, like many people’s tweets, are [extremely dumb](&lt;|url|&gt;).)

The good news: I was not mortified. But I was underwhelmed.



In the month I had Promote Mode running, my reach increased by a mere 4%. I gained 28 followers, but that’s fairly normal for me in a given month. I didn’t have to do anything special, which was nice, but the corollary was that nothing special happened either. To be fair, I may not have been the best test case; according to Twitter, it works best for accounts with fewer than 2,000 followers, and I currently have a bit over 6,400. That 2,000-follower threshold isn’t clear from [either](&lt;|url|&gt;) of [its](&lt;|url|&gt;) help pages, however. (In response to a list of questions, the company declined to comment on the record but offered some background information.)

![](<|image|>)

Twitter has been consistently [profitable](&lt;|url|&gt;) for the last few quarters, despite a drop in monthly active users. This profitability comes in part from its [advertising](&lt;|url|&gt;) [business](&lt;|url|&gt;). Promote Mode may be a way to skim a tiny bit of extra fat off the top, though at only $99 per month per user, it’s almost certainly a fraction of the company’s bottom line.

Of course, on the spectrum of profit-driven harms on social media, Promote Mode sits at the benign end. It’s not, for example, helping to [incite genocide](&lt;|url|&gt;), pushing [bunk science](&lt;|url|&gt;) on millions of people, or [hacking away](&lt;|url|&gt;) at the pillars of democracy with a gilded hammer—at least not at scale.

As the *Ringer* posits, far from being an annoyance, promoted tweets can be a welcome break from the monotony of faceless corporate ads. I’d further argue that in many ways they’re actually refreshing for our current performative internet epoch—that of corporate personhood, where Arby’s talks about its existential despair and Netflix traffics in grating self-awareness.

Still, with promoted tweets, you can see the unintended results of automation. Promote Mode sits in between regular advertising and real, unfiltered online behavior, and these strange nuggets are the result. In many ways, it glides right into our new internet reality: massive corporations that make decisions and leave their users to deal with the fallout.<|endoftext|>

# A Group of Microsoft Employees Is Fighting the Company’s Political Action Committee

## Employees say there’s no way to dictate how the PAC spends their money, even when it conflicts with the company’s progressive values

![Photo: NurPhoto/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: NurPhoto/Getty Images*

A group of more than 30 Microsoft employees is lobbying coworkers to stop donating to the company’s political action committee in an effort to starve the PAC of funds, multiple Microsoft workers with knowledge of the efforts told *OneZero*.

While Microsoft pitches itself as an [inclusive and progressive](&lt;|url|&gt;) company — especially during Pride Month, with [tweets](&lt;|url|&gt;) and donations to LGBTQ+ causes — employees who have donated to the PAC say they have no control over which candidates are being supported, meaning that they have no say when the PAC financially supports candidates whose views the employees don’t want to support. Microsoft employees who spoke to *OneZero* — on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals — say that the PAC doesn’t ask employees for input or supply avenues to suggest or control which candidates should be supported.

“Candidates that we dislike are those that advance policies contrary to the company’s stated policies of diversity, inclusion, and growth mindset,” one employee, who said they had persuaded about 10 others to stop donating to the PAC, told *OneZero*.

The PAC is a voluntary, opt-in fund that’s entirely supported by donations from more than 4,000 of Microsoft’s 140,000 employees, according to a 2015 [blog post.](&lt;|url|&gt;) The goal of Microsoft’s “MSPAC” is to “support and encourage the election to federal offices of persons who support the needs of business in a free and healthy economy,” according to its [website](&lt;|url|&gt;). In other words, the PAC exists to extend Microsoft’s political influence and serve its business interests. It also brings prominent speakers to campus for employees who donate to MSPAC, and occasionally opens those events up to nondonors.

[As is the case with many tech companies](&lt;|url|&gt;), Microsoft also [separately lobbies politicians](&lt;|url|&gt;), though at nearly 10 times the scale of the employee-driven PAC, according to [OpenSecrets](&lt;|url|&gt;).

MSPAC is run by Kelly Eaton, a Microsoft employee who previously worked at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise’s PAC, according to her profile on [LinkedIn](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # “I find the whole thing to be corrupt… As we begin our new fiscal year next month, we will launch new advisory councils to help inform these decisions.”

“Contribution decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and take into consideration a number of factors including the interests of our employees, and alignment with our public policy agenda,” a Microsoft spokesperson told *OneZero *after we reached out to Eaton about the PAC. “As we begin our new fiscal year next month, we will launch new advisory councils to help inform these decisions.”

The spokesperson wasn’t able to add more information about who would be on those councils, however.

”I find the whole thing to be corrupt,” another longtime Microsoft employee told *OneZero*. “How can Microsoft be pro-diversity and inclusion and still give money to Mitch McConnell? That makes zero sense to me.”

MSPAC did indeed donate $10,000 to the Republican Senate Majority Leader for his upcoming reelection bid. Since 1998, Microsoft workers have given a total of $39,000 to McConnell through the PAC, according to federal lobbying records analyzed by *OneZero*. This isn’t a huge amount compared to some of McConnell’s other fundraising efforts. The Kentucky senator received more than $225,000 from the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, in the last five years alone, and more than $26 million in total.

McConnell is also far from the top recipient of MSPAC funds. MSPAC has given Washington Congressman Adam Smith, a Democrat, $105,000 since 1998 — an average of more than $5,000 a year. While McConnell is the Senate’s top Republican, Smith is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, where last year he [appointed](&lt;|url|&gt;) Microsoft technical fellow Eric Horvitz to serve on the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. (Horvitz has never donated to the PAC, according to 20 years of FEC data.)

The political contributions of MSPAC have typically been a fairly even 50/50 split along Democratic and Republican party lines, according to OpenSecrets, a [website](&lt;|url|&gt;) built by the Center for Responsive Politics to track political lobbying. The one exception is the 2016 election cycle, when the MSPAC gave nearly $625,000 to Republican congressional candidates, almost twice as much as it did to Democrats, according to OpenSecrets.

Six of the top 10 recipients of MSPAC money over the last 20 years have been Republicans, including former House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte. Current House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, is also on the list of recipients, but has received only $34,000, a bulk of it before his ascension to chairman.

Goodlatte has sponsored bills that would have a direct impact on Microsoft’s business, including the Innovation Act of 2015, which the company [said](&lt;|url|&gt;) at the time would “provide new tools to deter abuses of the patent litigation system while protecting the value of patents and our innovation economy. “ Microsoft has 53,000 patents issued in the U.S. and internationally, according to its last annual [financial disclosure](&lt;|url|&gt;) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and has another 29,000 patents pending.

![](<|image|>)

MSPAC money is primarily spent supporting the campaigns of federal and state politicians, according to OpenSecrets. But funds are also used to bring speakers to campus. Previous speakers have included [Hillary Clinton](&lt;|url|&gt;), Republican Senator Marco Rubio, U.S. Digital Service head [Matt Cutts](&lt;|url|&gt;), and former KGB spy [Jack Barsky](&lt;|url|&gt;). A past [job listing](&lt;|url|&gt;) for an MSPAC coordinator suggested up to 40 speakers come to the Microsoft campus to speak to MSPAC members per year.

Employees feel there is little recourse to shape how funds are used and worry how the donations reflect on those who don’t contribute to the fund. One Microsoft employee who previously donated to MSPAC said that he had never been asked for input on which candidates MSPAC should support.

“The company needs to lobby to the government,” the employee said. “But don’t ask employees for money. And if you do, ask how to spend it. That’s not the case [with MSPAC].”

The employee further said that it felt duplicitous for Microsoft’s leaders to speak the language of progressive social causes — one corporate webpage [cites](&lt;|url|&gt;) the “transformative power of diversity and inclusion” — and then oversee an employee-funded PAC where roughly 50% of the money would go to [conservative candidates who often oppose those same measures on a federal level](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # One Microsoft employee who previously donated to MSPAC said that he had never been asked for input on which candidates MSPAC should support.

A group of employees tweeting from an account called Microsoft Workers 4 Good, independently verified by *OneZero* to represent Microsoft employees, tweeted earlier this year that the process of spending PAC money is opaque.

“There is no input from employees on where this money goes,” the workers wrote. “All decisions are made by a board, their elections are not open company-wide.“


The Microsoft workers also wrote that the PAC has the ability to send company-wide emails to advertise joining the PAC and the events that it puts on, something that other [employee-run groups](&lt;|url|&gt;) for black, disabled, or LGBTQ+ employees don’t have the capability to do. The PAC has also been discussed internally by employees on multiple threads on Yammer, the company’s internal social network, according to a Microsoft staffer reached by *OneZero *and [publicly available tweets](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Microsoft is far from the only technology company with a political action committee. Google and Amazon both have large PACs, each of which has donated more than $1 million each to federal candidates in 2018. Facebook’s PAC donated more than $450,000. Like Microsoft, these other tech companies tend to split money evenly between Democratic and Republican candidates.

As the *Daily Beast*’s Will Sommer [notes](&lt;|url|&gt;), some of Microsoft’s money flows to congresspeople who are overseeing antitrust investigations — including 15 Democrats on the antitrust subcommittee.

The tension between these vocal Microsoft employees and MSPAC is indicative of the growing pressure — often internal — for tech companies to prioritize social responsibility alongside traditional fiduciary responsibility to their investors. While the number of Microsoft employees actively speaking out against the PAC is far from a majority, their worries show that technology workers are increasingly comfortable publicly speaking out against the political dealings of their companies. Concerns with systemic harassment and climate have led workers at [Google](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Amazon](&lt;|url|&gt;) to even organize internally.

“MSPAC is antithetical to everything I love about @Microsoft’s culture and values,” one Microsoft employee wrote on [Twitter](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Knowing that this organization supports politicians who are actively attempting to subvert our democracy is infuriating.”<|endoftext|>

# The Engineer Using A.I. to Read Your Feelings

## Rosalind Picard wants to build technology that understands human emotion

![Credit: Rick Friedman/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Rick Friedman/Getty Images*

Rosalind Picard is an electrical engineer on a mission to engineer emotion into artificial intelligence. In the world of experts who speak in zeros and ones, Picard is schooled in the language of affective computing, which focuses on the importance of encoding emotional intelligence into our digital devices. She wants technology to recognize subtle changes in our mood and adjust what it does accordingly. Artificial intelligence, she says, should respect human emotions.

A tenured professor at MIT’s Media Lab, where she directs the Affective Computing Research Group, Picard likes to cite the provocation of Microsoft Word’s Clippy, the anthropomorphic paper clip that used to pop up on the screen with the message, “It looks like you’re writing a letter.” Clippy was meant to be helpful, but users were irritated by the smiling and winking paper clip bouncing across their monitor. “If that were a person, you would probably not invite them back to your office,” Picard says.

Picard’s work has led to new tools that sense changes in the body — namely, sweat and accompanying shifts in how our skin conducts electricity — that stem from changes in the brain. After an early start creating tools to help people with autism communicate, Picard eventually developed an FDA-approved device for predicting epileptic seizures and is now pursuing a more detailed map of the link between the brain and the body.

Her aim, she says, is to empower people through A.I. rather than simply create the next great robot. Picard wants to make wearables and other devices that contribute to people’s lives and “that we’ll feel good on our deathbed saying we helped create.”

*The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.*

### **OneZero: Much of your work has focused on building emotional intelligence into technology. What is your goal with these projects?**

**Rosalind Picard: **One of the biggest driving forces for me has been moving from just building machines to refocusing on helping people have better lives. My original vision for A.I. was to build something autonomous and intelligent. I argued that whatever we built had to be emotionally intelligent. You wouldn’t tolerate an annoying robot. Eventually, we built the MACH [[My Automated Conversation CoacH](&lt;|url|&gt;)], an A.I. system that could respond to nonverbal cues. Our focus had gradually shifted from creating “eye candy” A.I. to impress people to helping people. MACH was designed to sense and respond to nonverbal information and reflect it back to people so they could learn how they were coming across, so they could fix things before, say, going to that important interview.

### **How did your interest in emotionally intelligent A.I. bring you to work with people on the autism spectrum?**

People who have a hard time reading facial expressions motivated some of our early projects. Some individuals with autism asked us for face-reading software that could give them a real-time interpretation of the facial expression of the person they were speaking with. We installed a tiny wearable camera into eyeglasses and connected it to a computer equipped with a program that could scan the individual’s eyes, nose, mouth, and other facial features and categorize the expression as indicating confusion, interest, thinking, or other feelings that people subtly signal to each other in conversations.

### **You eventually created wrist sensors that could detect changes in the skin stemming from stress as a way to improve mental health. What is the underlying principle of these types of wearables?**

We created a device that measures changes tied to the sympathetic nervous system, the seat of our “fight or flight” responses. Specifically, the device measured electrical changes in the skin. The activation of our fight-or-flight system causes a whole bunch of changes, including opening sweat glands under the skin. Even if you’re not sweaty on the surface, the skin will start to conduct more electricity, which can be measured.

### **This device showed you something surprising about the connection between the brain and the body and led you to create devices for epilepsy. Could you describe what happened?**

Around 2007, an undergraduate student gave these wrist sensors to his brother, an autistic child around seven years old, to try out. The child’s electrical conductance went up very high, but only on one wrist. I had no explanation for this. I thought our sensors were broken. How can you be stressed on one side of your body and not the other? The sensors weren’t broken; they were working fine. And it wasn’t the brother’s biology, either.

I called the student to ask if he knew what had happened, because the data didn’t make sense. He’d been keeping a diary and had the exact moment written down. He told me that the response happened 20 minutes before his brother had a grand mal seizure. I didn’t know the child had epilepsy, which often accompanies autism.

It turned out that the body was behaving in a way I didn’t know it could behave. Our device had been designed to monitor what’s known as a general arousal response — your palms sweat, your armpits, it’s a general response. Nothing I had read or studied prepared me for the fact that you could sweat on the right wrist and not on the left, unless something was wrong with you.

I was not the first person to discover this. Neurologists and dermatologists knew this already. But it wasn’t generally known about in the literature on electrodermal activity. The dogma is that the response is general.

We started a more carefully time-synchronized study at a hospital and found that the signal the sensor registered on the wrist precisely coincided with the onset of unusual electrical activity in the brain — seizures. We published that work in [the journals] *Neurology* and *Epilepsia* in 2012. That work led to the creation of a wrist sensor for epileptics to wear that alerts them about the onset of a seizure.

### **What other details have you learned about this very specific link between the brain and the body?**

Given that a seizure in a particular part of the brain can cause a particular patch of skin to sweat or experience an electrical change, we wondered how much of this connection could be mapped out. So, say, if the right side of your amygdala is activated, maybe it changes one patch and not another. If we map those connections, then when the activity happens on the skin, we can infer something is happening in your brain that’s helpful to know about.

Sometimes this change in electrical activity can be detected using electrodes attached to the scalp. But sometimes activity deep in the brain, such as in the hippocampus, may not trigger something on the scalp but can be picked up on the wrist. When you start to understand how these things are connected, you can see that this part of the brain was activated even though you’re not measuring it directly.

We are conducting a study in which patients who are undergoing brain surgery for other reasons are invited to contribute data about what’s going on in their brains concurrent with information from a device that they wear on their wrists and other body parts during surgery. This study has begun at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, and we are awaiting approval at two other sites.

### **How renegade is this idea in the scientific community?**

It’s pretty wacky stuff. I would have written it off entirely if I’d heard of it. But many neurologists and psychologists are very open to recognizing that the brain influences the body in ways we are just beginning to understand. Many scientists used to consider the field of neurostimulation—triggering brain activity through electrical stimulation—as another wacky area, but it is very credible and respected now.

### **What does all of this have to do with your work on A.I. for more general use?**

All of this is related to our emotions, which play a powerful role in our lives. They’re connected to many health disorders. And, like seizures, they trigger changes on the surface of our skin.

Over the years of studying emotional intelligence in A.I., I began to wonder about the role emotions play in making us sick or healthy. And how do we enable each individual to have control over that?

Forecasting seizures had a big influence on this line of thinking. Knowing what’s about to happen gives you control. Uncertainty increases stress, which is very related to mental health. We want to give individuals something to help them do better, rather than just focusing on A.I. that only people in powerful positions have access to. We are working with positive psychologists to better understand how people who are already well stay well. It’s shifted our focus to not only working with people who are unhealthy but also figuring out how to keep people healthy.

### **How has this work changed your overall vision for A.I.?**

In the world of A.I., some of us are stepping back now and asking what we are doing to human health. What leads to true human flourishing and well-being? Are we enabling the kind of A.I. that gives wealth and power to a smaller and smaller number of people? Or are we enabling A.I. that helps people?

We’ve been doing a lot of reflecting to figure out how to build tools that will enable a better future for humans, not for machines. When we build technology that reminds people that they matter, that helps them achieve something they couldn’t do before, I just feel joy from head to toe.<|endoftext|>

# ‘Adult’ Products Are a Nightmare to Advertise on Social Media

## ‘Adult’ Products Are a Nightmare to Advertise on Social Media

### *A new white paper sheds light on inconsistent, and sometimes sexist, policies on platforms like Instagram*

![Photo: [Rafael Saes](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo: [Rafael Saes](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Starting a new business is never easy, and when Heather C. Montgomery first launched [PleazeMe](&lt;|url|&gt;), a social site devoted to giving women a comfortable and fun venue to talk about their sexual identities and desires, she anticipated a number of hurdles. Montgomery knew that battling our culture’s attitudes about sex would be an uphill battle. But one hurdle she wasn’t expecting? How difficult it would be just to advertise her website in the first place.

“I have been continually surprised at every turn how few of the normal resources that a regular business has that we can exercise,” says Montgomery, who has a background in health care marketing. Even an ad promoting an article explaining PleazeMe’s seven “sexual worlds” — they’re basically groups like Vega, for people interested in “extreme show and tell” — was universally banned by social media platforms. That included Twitter, which Montgomery notes is “supposedly the last, freest platform on the planet.”

As her team navigated the complex landscape of social media advertising, determining what was (and, more importantly, wasn’t) allowed in ads on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, they started to assemble a marketing bible, one they hoped would help them create an effective marketing plan while deftly navigating often confusing regulations. It’s a task, Montgomery reminds me, the fate of her business depends on. “If we do violate any of the terms of these agreements then we lose our method to share our mission with the world,” Montgomery says. “Social media is the cornerstone of most marketing plans.”

PleazeMe is hardly the only organization struggling to navigate the confusing landscape of social media advertising, and after over a hundred hours of research, Montgomery realized there might be some benefit from turning her private bible into [a more publicly available white paper](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Even as someone who’s well versed in the field of online censorship, I still found the document a compelling read. It is rare to see the advertising policies of every major social media site listed alongside one another; reading through the document, it’s almost chilling to see the same language and biased views of what counts as “adult” repeated from platform to platform.
> # The policies seem to impact ads targeting women more heavily than those aimed at men.

Most platforms ban explicitly sexual content like ads for porn or adult dating sites; sex toys are generally unwelcome as well. ([Tumblr](&lt;|url|&gt;) is the rare exception: ads can be sexual so long as they’re “tasteful, artistic, and high quality.”) But it’s not just porn companies and sex toys that are hampered by these rules. “Sexy” is a very broad and subjective term, as many companies whose ads have been labeled inappropriate have been dismayed to discover. Although contraceptive ads are generally considered okay when they’re marketed strictly as “health devices,” contraceptive ads that reference sexual pleasure are forbidden on Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest, according to the document.

And the policies seem to impact ads targeting women more heavily than those aimed at men. While erectile dysfunction drugs are widely acceptable, lubricant tends to be considered too risqué. “Some businesses have been allowed to mention lubricant in an ad if it is a part of a list of female health items alongside tampons; the majority have not,” PleazeMe’s guide explains, noting that lubricant seems to be deemed more prurient than Viagra — even though both products can help aging or infirm people achieve healthier, happier sex lives.

Of course, brands are able to post relatively sexy content to their social media accounts, where it can grow an audience organically — there’s nothing stopping Trojan from running [a guide about “clitoracy”](&lt;|url|&gt;) or PleazeMe from running [suggestive imagery](&lt;|url|&gt;) on their Instagram accounts — but without the lift from paid advertising, it’s much harder to build an audience. And with [Instagram’s new content policy](&lt;|url|&gt;), which prevents “sexually suggestive” imagery from appearing in the app’s Explore tab, some fear that even existing followers won’t see posts deemed too risqué.

One of the more surprising product categories to make the list of “adult” content in PleazeMe’s report? Lingerie, which seems to get roped in under bans on “excessive skin” (Facebook and Instagram) or “modeled clothing that is sexual in nature” (Twitter).

If your timeline feels inundated with ads for the underwear company ThirdLove, it may come as a shock to learn that lingerie companies face stigma and censorship when they try to advertise online. But these policies seem to be inconsistently enforced: Representatives at companies I spoke with said they’ve had similar marketing turned down by social media platforms. Many indie companies now see navigating censorship as a de facto part of their marketing plan, along with the unenviable task of struggling to determine, what, exactly, differentiates a “sexy” lingerie photo from one that’s just displaying the product.
> # “[Moderation algorithims] can’t distinguish between a video that is showing breasts as a sex thing and when you’re just attempting to demonstrate bra fit.”

Instagram, Pinterest, and Facebook did not immediately respond to my request for comment about their moderation policies, and Twitter simply referred me to its [ad policies page](&lt;|url|&gt;).

“[Moderation algorithims] can’t distinguish between a video that is showing breasts as a sex thing and when you’re just attempting to demonstrate bra fit — and nor can many of the manual reviewers. It’s like throwing darts and hoping you hit a surface they stick in,” says Catherine Clavering, founder of U.K.-based lingerie company [Kiss Me Deadly](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Other lingerie companies have felt similarly stymied in their attempts to advertise. “There seems to be very little rhyme or reason to Facebook’s policies on advertising,” says Anna Sampson, brand director of [Playful Promises](&lt;|url|&gt;). “We’ve had flatlay bra images be rejected for ‘cleavage,’ and images of swimwear also rejected” — despite the fact that none of these images involve anything more than shots of clothing.

Here’s an example of an image that Sampson says was rejected for promotion on Instagram:

![](<|image|>)

It’s frustrating enough that these regulations create extra work for these small companies with limited marketing budgets. “We never bother running any images that are actually risqué (such as open cups), but having to constantly try different images, and go through appeal processes, is frustrating,” Sampson notes.

But more troubling for some of the people I spoke with, the regulations also hamper their ability to showcase more innovative wares. “This year a brand we stock released leggings that has a diamond-shaped gusset, which is a huge comfort thing for many women,” Clavering says. She would love to run ads explaining why this design is superior. And yet, she tells me, “we haven’t even bothered to try because can you imagine how many weeks of arguing with moderators it would take to determine that crotch shots are not, in fact, inherently sexual?”

For some people in the lingerie space, the ad restrictions are punitive enough to make them give up on advertising entirely. “It’s a waste of time,” says Cora Harrington, author of [*In Intimate Detail: How to Choose, Wear, and Love Lingerie](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and founder of [The Lingerie Addict](&lt;|url|&gt;), an intimate apparel blog that treats lingerie as fashion and advocates for inclusive design. After finding herself rejected from most mainstream ad networks — and exhausted by the headache of figuring out what lingerie shots won’t be considered to show “excessive skin” by Facebook and Instagram — she’s given up on paid advertising entirely.

Social media companies love to tout their commitment to diversity, nominally supporting feminist progress and turning up at Pride events. But women who are trying to foment a feminist sexual revolution — whether by creating a space where women feel comfortable opening up about their sexual desires or offering access to lingerie that celebrates all bodies — aren’t getting any assistance in their mission from supposedly progressive social media companies.

And yet, even as these female-fronted companies are finding their message muted by overly restrictive advertising regulations, there’s another voice that has no problem making its crude and vulgar message heard. “We are still inundated by direct messages to our Facebook pages full of men writing badly spelled sexual content, unsolicited dick pics, and insertive-acts-of-actual sex gifs,” Clavering says. “All we can do is ban those people from our page. That’s it.”<|endoftext|>

# A Bill of Rights for the Age of Artificial Intelligence

## We should be concerned about the rights of all sentients as an unprecedented diversity of minds emerges

![Credit: Donald Iain Smith/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Donald Iain Smith/Getty Images*

In 1950, Norbert Wiener’s *The Human Use of Human Beings *was at the cutting edge of vision and speculation in proclaiming:
> [T]he machine like the djinnee, which can learn and can make decisions on the basis of its learning, will in no way be obliged to make such decisions as we should have made, or will be acceptable to us… Whether we entrust our decisions to machines of metal, or to those machines of flesh and blood which are bureaus and vast laboratories and armies and corporations… [t]he hour is very late, and the choice of good and evil knocks at our door.

But this was his book’s denouement, and it has left us hanging now for 68 years, lacking not only prescriptions and proscriptions but even a well-articulated “problem statement.” We have since seen similar warnings about the threat of our machines, even in the form of outreach to the masses, via films like *Colossus: The Forbin Project *(1970), *The Terminator *(1984), *The Matrix *(1999), and *Ex Machina *(2015). But now the time is ripe for a major update with fresh, new perspectives — notably focused on generalizations of our “human” rights and our existential needs.

Concern has tended to focus on “us versus them” (robots) or “gray goo” (nanotech) or “monocultures of clones” (bio). To extrapolate current trends: What if we could make or grow almost anything and engineer any level of safety and efficacy desired? Any thinking being (made of any arrangement of atoms) could have access to any technology.

Probably we should be less concerned about us versus them and more concerned about the rights of all sentients in the face of an emerging unprecedented diversity of minds. We should be harnessing this diversity to minimize global existential risks, like supervolcanoes and asteroids.

While we may not know what ratio of bio/homo/nano/robo hybrids will be dominant at each step of our accelerating evolution, we can aim for high levels of humane, fair, and safe treatment (“use”) of one another.

## Equality

What did the 33-year-old Thomas Jefferson mean in 1776 when he wrote, “We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness”? The spectrum of current humans is vast. In 1776, “Men” did not include people of color or women. Even today, humans born with congenital cognitive or behavioral issues are destined for unequal (albeit in most cases compassionate) treatment — Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease, Fragile X syndrome, cerebral palsy, and so on.
> # If robots don’t have exactly the same consciousness as humans, then this is used as an excuse to give them different rights, analogous to arguments that other tribes or races are less than human.

And as we change geographical location and mature, our unequal rights change dramatically. Embryos, infants, children, teens, adults, patients, felons, gender identities and gender preferences, the very rich and very poor — all of these face different rights and socioeconomic realities. One path to new mind-types obtaining and retaining rights similar to the most elite humans would be to keep a *Homo *component, like a human shield or figurehead monarch/CEO, signing blindly enormous technical documents, making snap financial, health, diplomatic, military, or security decisions. We will probably have great difficulty pulling the plug, modifying, or erasing (killing) a computer and its memories — especially if it has befriended humans and made spectacularly compelling pleas for survival (as all excellent researchers fighting for their lives would do).

## Radically divergent rules for humans versus nonhumans and hybrids

The divide noted above for intra–*Homo sapiens *variation in rights explodes into a riot of inequality as soon as we move to entities that overlap (or will soon) the spectrum of humanity. In Google Street View, people’s faces and car license plates are blurred out. Video devices are excluded from many settings, such as courts and committee meetings. Wearable and public cameras with facial recognition software touch taboos. Should people with hyperthymesia or photographic memories be excluded from those same settings?

Shouldn’t people with prosopagnosia (face blindness) or forgetfulness be able to benefit from facial recognition software and optical character recognition wherever they go, and if them, then why not everyone? If we all have those tools to some extent, shouldn’t we all be able to benefit?

These scenarios echo Kurt Vonnegut’s 1961 short story “Harrison Bergeron,” in which exceptional aptitude is suppressed in deference to the mediocre lowest common denominator of society. Thought experiments like John Searle’s Chinese room and Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics all appeal to the sorts of intuitions plaguing human brains that Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and others have demonstrated. The Chinese room experiment posits that a mind composed of mechanical and *Homo sapiens *parts cannot be conscious, no matter how competent it is at intelligent human (Chinese) conversation, unless a human can identify the source of the consciousness and “feel” it. Enforced preference for Asimov’s first and second laws favor human minds over any other mind meekly present in his third law, self-preservation.

If robots don’t have exactly the same consciousness as humans, then this is used as an excuse to give them different rights, analogous to arguments that other tribes or races are less than human. Do robots already show free will? Are they already self-conscious? The robot Qbo has passed the “mirror test” for self-recognition, and the robot Nao has passed a related test of recognizing its own voice and inferring its internal state of being, mute or not.

For free will, we have algorithms that are neither fully deterministic nor random but aimed at nearly optimal probabilistic decision-making. One could argue that this is a practical Darwinian consequence of game theory. For many (not all) games/problems, if we’re totally predictable or totally random, then we tend to lose.

What is the appeal of free will anyway? Historically, it gave us a way to assign blame in the context of reward and punishment on earth or in the afterlife. The goals of punishment might include nudging the priorities of the individual to assist the survival of the species. In extreme cases, this could include imprisonment or other restrictions if Skinnerian positive/negative reinforcement is inadequate to protect society. Clearly, such tools can apply to free will, seen broadly — to any machine whose behavior we’d like to manage.

We could argue as to whether the robot actually experiences subjective qualia for free will or self-consciousness, but the same applies to evaluating a human. How do we know that a sociopath, a coma patient, a person with Williams syndrome, or a baby has the same free will or self-consciousness as our own? And what does it matter, practically? If humans (of any sort) convincingly claim to experience consciousness, pain, faith, happiness, ambition, and/or utility to society, should we deny them rights because their hypothetical qualia are hypothetically different from ours?
> # The line between human and machines blurs, both because machines become more humanlike and humans become more machinelike.

The sharp red lines of prohibition, over which we supposedly will never step, increasingly seem to be short-lived and not sensible. The line between human and machines blurs, both because machines become more humanlike and because humans become more machinelike — not only since we increasingly blindly follow GPS scripts, reflex tweets, and carefully crafted marketing, but also as we digest ever more insights into our brain and genetic programming mechanisms. The NIH BRAIN Initiative is developing innovative technologies and using these to map out the connections and activity of mental circuitry so as to improve electronic and synthetic neurobiological ware.

Various red lines depend on genetic exceptionalism, in which genetics is considered permanently heritable (although it is provably reversible), whereas exempt (and lethal) technologies, like cars, are, for all intents and purposes, irreversible due to social and economic forces. Within genetics, a red line makes us ban or avoid genetically modified foods but embrace genetically modified bacteria making insulin, or genetically modified humans — witness mitochondrial therapies approved in Europe for human adults and embryos.

For “human subject research,” we refer to the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, keeping in mind the 1932–1972 Tuskegee syphilis experiment, possibly the most infamous biomedical research study in U.S. history. In 2015, the Nonhuman Rights Project filed a lawsuit with the New York State Supreme Court on behalf of two chimpanzees kept for research by Stony Brook University. The appellate court decision was that chimps are not to be treated as legal persons [since](&lt;|url|&gt;) they “do not have duties and responsibilities in society,” despite claims by Jane Goodall and others that they do, and despite arguments that such a decision could be applied to children and the disabled.

What prevents extension to other animals, organoids, machines, and hybrids? As we (e.g., Hawking, Musk, Tallinn, Wilczek, Tegmark) have promoted bans on “autonomous weapons,” we have demonized one type of “dumb” machine, while other machines — for instance, those composed of many *Homo sapiens *voting — can be more lethal and more misguided.

Do transhumans roam the earth already? Consider the “uncontacted peoples,” such as the Sentinelese and Andamanese of India, the Korowai of Indonesia, the Mashco-Piro of Peru, the Pintupi of Australia, the Surma of Ethiopia, the Ruc of Vietnam, the Ayoreo-Totobiegosode of Paraguay, the Himba of Namibia, and dozens of tribes in Papua New Guinea. How would they or our ancestors respond? We could define “transhuman” as people and cultures not comprehensible to humans living in a modern yet untechnological culture.

Such modern Stone Age people would have great trouble understanding why we celebrate the recent LIGO gravity-wave evidence supporting the hundred-year-old general theory of relativity. They would scratch their heads as to why we have atomic clocks, or GPS satellites so we can find our way home, or why and how we have expanded our vision from a narrow optical band to the full spectrum from radio to gamma. We can move faster than any other living species; indeed, we can reach escape velocity from Earth and survive in the very cold vacuum of space.

If those characteristics (and hundreds more) don’t constitute transhumanism, then what would? If we feel that the judge of transhumanism should not be fully paleo-culture humans but recent humans, then how would we ever reach transhuman status? We “recent humans” may always be capable of comprehending each new technological increment — never adequately surprised to declare arrival at a (moving) transhuman target. The science fiction prophet William Gibson said, “The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” While this underestimates the next round of “future,” certainly millions of us are transhuman already — with most of us asking for more. The question “what was a human?” has already transmogrified into “what were the many kinds of transhumans, and what were their rights?”

# An Expert’s Take on the Best Way to Do CES

## An Expert’s Take on the Best Way to Do CES

### *Ignore the noise*

![Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty*

CES, a massive consumer electronics event held in Las Vegas every year, doesn’t officially start until Tuesday. But if you’re a member of the media, it began weeks ago with a steady and unstoppable flow of entreaties to visit this or that booth and agreeing to keep an embargo on news that’s meant to be shared at a predetermined time. It’s the trade show’s version of pregaming but without the pleasant buzz.

Before CES officially opens, there’s a small sanctioned event called Unveiled that pools together all the gadgets, gizmos, and services you’re conditioned to care about. You can cover a lot of ground visiting that event alone, but it often misses the best of the show: the oddities and innovations collected in Eureka Park. The funky startup show at the Sands is packed full of entrepreneurs from countries around the world. The products are unusual, idiosyncratic, and always a highlight.

As you prepare to attend the 2019 show, or just read about the biggest announcements on tech sites, remind yourself that for all the spectacle of CES, some of the most worthwhile stuff is hidden away.

The big guns — Samsung, Sony, TCL, LG, and others — will open CES with press conferences, where they will sprint through tons of new products, services, and previews. Reporters will flow in and out of the room. But even though there are a few dozen press events set, a brief survey of the attendant scribes reveals that most are covering the same few announcements.
> # For the best experience, dig deep below the obvious and well-funded.

There will be the largest 8K TV, another intelligent vacuum, and lots of Amazon Alexa integration. There will be electric cars, autonomous technology, and appliances that know more about your cleaning needs than you do. Smart technology will be a given. Dumb gadgets and accessories that work like supplicants for the smart ones won’t get much play on those first heady days because the news coming out of the pre-show will be fast, furious, and exciting. By the time the exhibitor floors open on Tuesday, the torrent of news will have slowed to a steady drip of interesting discoveries.

But some of the most worthwhile things are the hidden gems buried in the show’s nooks and crannies — think the first floor of South Hall in the back, the North Hall, and Row Z at Eureka Park. For the best experience, dig deep below the obvious and well-funded.

The “official” days and nights of CES will be filled with events and experiences — like rides in autonomous cars and desperate attempts to cut the 45 minutes or more it usually takes to travel between the Sands Convention Hall and the Las Vegas Convention Center. Because sleep is optional, all of this will be supplemented by a pair of evening trade shows — one that’s CES-sanctioned (Showstoppers) and another not so much (Pepcom’s Digital Experience). They promise decent hors-d’oeuvres and a largely hit-or-miss collection of products from companies that worry they won’t get fair play on the main CES floors — or, in the case of Pepcom, want to avoid paying for official floor space altogether.

I’m sure we’ll find much to like and consider for the remainder of 2019 at CES, but don’t cheat yourself by thinking that everything that matters will be unveiled in the first 72 hours. Stick around until the end or at least until you run out of steam. There may be a few surprises in store.<|endoftext|>

# Why Gen Z Loves Closed Captioning

## Why Gen Z Loves Closed Captioning

### *Old technology finds a surprising new application*

![Credit: Towfiqu Photography/Moment/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Towfiqu Photography/Moment/Getty*

“Everyone does it.”

These were the words from my college-aged daughter when I caught her lounging on our couch, streaming *Friends *with 24-point closed captioning on. She has no hearing impairment, and I wanted to know what she was up to.

Does “everyone” do it? My wife and I turned to Facebook and a private, nationwide group for parents with near-adult children. “Anyone else’s college student (without a hearing disability) watch TV with the closed captioning on and insist that everyone does it?” my wife posted. Seven hundred responses (and counting) later, we had our answer.
> # “It helps me with my ADHD: I can focus on the words, I catch things I missed, and I never have to go back.”

Many parents expressed similar confusion with the TV-watching habits of their millennial and Gen Z children, often followed with, “I thought it was just us.”

I returned to my daughter, who had now switched to the creepy Lifetime import *You*.

“Why do you have captions on?” I asked.

“It helps me with my ADHD: I can focus on the words, I catch things I missed, and I never have to go back,” she replied. “And I can text while I watch.”

My multitasking daughter used to watch TV while working on her laptop and texting or FaceTiming on her phone. She kept rewinding the DVR to catch the last few minutes she’d missed because she either zoned out or was distracted by another screen.

Her response turned out to be even more insightful than I realized at first. A number of mental health experts I spoke with — and even one study I found — supported the notion that watching with closed captioning serves a valuable role for those who struggle with focus and listening.

“I do see this a lot in my practice,” said Dr. Andrew Kent, an adolescent psychiatrist practicing in New York and Medical Director of New York START, Long Island. “I believe auditory processing is more easily impacted upon by distractions, and that they need to read [captions] to stay focused.”

Closed captioning is a relatively recent development in the history of broadcasting, and it was designed with the hearing impaired in mind. According to a useful history on the [National Captioning Institute’s (NCI) website](&lt;|url|&gt;), the technology dates back to the early 1970s, when Julia Child’s *The French Chef *“made history as the first television program accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers.” Real-time captioning arrived later, with stenographers typing at a blazing 250 words-per-minute to keep up with live news and sporting events.
> # They use captions to focus more intently on the content.

If it wasn’t for the [Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010](&lt;|url|&gt;) and additional rules adopted by the [FCC in 2012](&lt;|url|&gt;), it’s unlikely my daughter’s IP-based Netflix streaming content would even have closed captioning options today.

While the NCI doesn’t explicitly acknowledge the [growing use](&lt;|url|&gt;) of closed captioning by those without hearing impairments, it does note that “closed captioning has grown from an experimental service intended only for people who are deaf to a truly global communications service that touches the lives of millions of people every day in vital ways.”

It’s certainly not just a phenomenon for young people. There are many people my age who admit to using them because they have some middle-aged hearing loss or simply need help understanding what the characters on *Luther *or *Peaky Blinders *are saying. They use captions to focus more intently on the content.

The need to read captions for what you can hear might even have a biological base. According to [Dr. Sudeepta Varma](&lt;|url|&gt;), a psychiatrist at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, some people may have trouble processing the audio from television.

“I believe that there are a number of individuals who have ADHD who may also suffer from undiagnosed auditory processing disorder (APD), and for these individuals… this may be very helpful,” Dr. Varma told me via email. Closed captioning can provide the visual cues that APD sufferers need to overcome their issues with listening and comprehension, she added.

APD refers to how the brain processes auditory information, and though it supposedly only affects around [5 percent of school-age children](&lt;|url|&gt;), there’s reportedly been a significant [uptick in overall awareness](&lt;|url|&gt;). As Dr. Varma pointed out, there may be a lot of people who don’t realize they have APD, but are aware of some of the [symptoms](&lt;|url|&gt;), which include being bothered by loud noises, difficulty focusing in loud environments, and forgetfulness.

There may be applications in the classroom, too. In a 2015 study of 2,800 college-age students on the impact of closed captioning on video learning, 75 percent of respondents mentioned that they struggle with paying attention in class. “The most common reasons students used captions… was to help them focus,” Dr. Katie Linder, the research director at Oregon State University who led the study, told me.

And even four years ago, there were hints that the use of closed captioning as a focusing tool would bleed outside the classroom.

As a [report](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the study put it, “Several people in this study also mentioned that they use captions all the time, not just for their learning experience. Captions with Netflix was mentioned multiple times. So, we know that students are engaging with them outside of the classroom.”

When the NCI first co-developed closed captioning technology some 50 years ago, they called it “words worth watching,” and it did transform millions of lives. Today, we may be witnessing — or reading — a similar revolution.<|endoftext|>

# When the Web Loses Its Memory

## As sites like Tumblr perform mass purges, archivists are fighting a losing battle to save disappearing parts of the internet

![](<|image|>)

[Diana](&lt;|url|&gt;) poured her passionate fandom into [Thorvaenn](&lt;|url|&gt;), her Tumblr account, for years. Marvel and Thor in particular became the primary focus for the GIFs she made, for her meticulous recommendations, and for the fanfiction she created involving Thor and Loki — a coupling known as “Thorki” — in various romantic situations for her 20,000-plus followers.

“My blog was super important to me and to my life,” says Diana, who asked to be identified by just her first name.** **“It was essentially there for me every waking moment. Any time I was bored or restless or wanted to take my mind off things, I could read something or go to one of my friends and chat about it. For as long as I can remember, I was *that* person, the one who was *into* something, who couldn’t just watch or read a thing and move on, but who had to be all deep into it.”
> # “I had that blog for seven years. I poured so much time into it, so much creative energy.”

Then, one day, it was all gone. On November 22, 2018, her blog was deleted without warning. Hundreds of hours of work and craft were gone in an instant. Tumblr erased the blog just before the company announced its ban on adult content, a move that affected huge parts of the site, because, well, Tumblr was home to a lot of kink. Diana maintains she didn’t post the kind of adult content the company was set on banning — [defined by Tumblr](&lt;|url|&gt;) as “adult content real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples, and any content [depicting] sex acts” — but Tumblr never replied to her appeal. “I had that blog for seven years,” she says. “I poured so much time into it, so much creative energy.”

As a heavily invested member of the [Harry Potter sections of LiveJournal](&lt;|url|&gt;), Eve Elizabeth Moriarty had a different obsession. She clearly remembers reading a piece of fanfiction when she was about 15, shortly after *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* came out in 2004, that took place at Sirius Black’s home after he died.

“It might have been the first fanfic I ever read,” says Moriarty, who’s now an academic researching fan studies at Swansea University. “I was sitting at my family desktop computer, which only had dial-up at the time, reading this fanfiction and for the first time realizing the extent of human misery. I went upstairs and cried for hours.”

But now? She can’t find it anywhere, and the same story goes for huge parts of that period of her online life. “That’s a seminal piece of my childhood I just can’t access,” Moriarty says. “Obviously, doing what I do now, it’s an academic concern, too — but for me personally, there’s a real sense of personal, emotional loss.”

Eve and Diana’s stories both illustrate how everything we make and consume online may be just one update away from vanishing forever. We’re not new to the idea of the ephemeral internet, of evaporating Snapchats or deleted social media posts. In fact, the recent push by social media platforms like Facebook into private messaging indicates consumers’ interest in not permitting everything to be retained by the public web. But mass deletions of entire volumes of internet history are something different — and far more significant.

The Tumblr “purge” is one recent example, but it’s not just Tumblr. After Yahoo sold Flickr, its new owner, SmugMug, decided to limit free accounts to 1,000 photos. Anyone who didn’t [buy a pro account](&lt;|url|&gt;) as of February 5 had their photos deleted. Then there’s the threat hanging over the Neopets site, swathes of which [rely on Flash](&lt;|url|&gt;) and will be killed off by Adobe by 2020. From the sudden loss of [everything uploaded to Myspace before 2016](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the sad little Photobucket icons littering sections of the early 2000s web, what might have seemed eternal when it was uploaded has proven to have a surprisingly brief life.

What do we lose when huge parts of what used to be central to our online experience are wiped out? Embarrassing Myspace photos aside, we lose crucial historical context to how we lived our lives online — which is why a number of institutions and groups have arisen to try to archive the web. Some are professionals; others are volunteers. But what they all have in common is a concern for the historical gaps these shuttered sites leave behind.

The world’s most comprehensive effort is the [Wayback Machine](&lt;|url|&gt;), run by the Internet Archive, a not-for-profit in San Francisco. The organization has been saving snapshots of the web since 2001. There’s also the volunteer-run [Archive Team](&lt;|url|&gt;), which describes itself as “a loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers, and loudmouths dedicated to saving our digital heritage.” The latter sprang into action when the [Tumblr purge began](&lt;|url|&gt;), with volunteers attempting to copy and preserve Tumblr’s NSFW blogs in just 14 days. Each volunteer installs a program on their computer that makes their computer part of a scraping network, archiving content onto the team’s servers. With an estimated 700,000 blogs at risk, it was a mammoth task, and they only managed to capture a portion of the total content in the short time they had.

In some countries, archiving pockets of online culture is done by arts and academic organizations. In the U.K., this includes [the British Library](&lt;|url|&gt;), which dates its origins to 1753. Jane Winters is a professor of digital humanities at the University of London, and [a big part of her work](&lt;|url|&gt;) is the annual snapshot of U.K. web domains that the British Library takes for its archive. “It’s got things like official government publications, individual blogs — a collision of different kinds of content all in dialogue with each other,” Winters says.
> # Once popularity and profit — or the future chance of profit — begin to wane, there’s just less incentive to sustain a service that’s shedding losers.

Essentially everything marked with the U.K.’s co.uk domain is archived by the British Library, although that means many pieces of content, like videos made by British YouTubers, fall outside the library’s remit because they are hosted under international domains such as .com. Libraries in other countries do similar work. The [National Library of France](&lt;|url|&gt;), for example, has archived tweets sent out at the time of terror attacks.

Social media sites in general, however, pose challenges to archivists. “Facebook is very difficult to archive and, I think, *makes* it very difficult to archive,” Winters says. That’s because every person’s Facebook feed is personalized and different, so there’s no** **definitive version to archive. “Lots of social media content is falling outside of this archiving activity.”

The companies that create and run these platforms seem to care little about the cultural significance of the content their users create. Sites get sold — like Tumblr to Yahoo in 2013 — or become less popular. Once popularity and profit — or the future chance of profit — begin to wane, there’s just less incentive to sustain a service that’s shedding users.

Some of Tumblr’s long-term users say the site was fading away before the porn ban, and even Diana admits she hadn’t been posting as much when the site was shuttered. “When I realized, after all that crap on Tumblr went down and I saw that this blog went down with it, I thought, ‘Thank god this didn’t happen a year ago, because a year ago it would have killed me.’”

Even so, she felt like her blog was a resource, a starting point for other people who were into that little subsection of Marvel fandom. “I consider fandom history important, and without sounding vain, my blog was a good point for many beginners to go to,” Diana says. “So, even if I wasn’t planning on posting, I wanted it restored.”

Diana has another blog now and mostly posts about the occult drama *Supernatural — *another show with a huge fan base on Tumblr. But it’s not the same, because she can’t help thinking: What’s the point in being emotionally invested in something if it could disappear tomorrow?<|endoftext|>

# Your iPhone Has A Hidden List of Every Location You’ve Been

## It’s called the Significant Locations list, and you probably didn’t know it existed

Hiding in not-so-plain sight, deep within the depths of your iPhone’s settings (seven layers deep, to be exact) is a level of location tracking that very few iPhone users are aware of and probably won’t feel comfortable with.

Sure, many of us know that our iPhone generally tracks us when we use certain apps to enable it to share personalized information like the local weather, coffee shop recommendations, and more.

But in a quick survey I ran with some friends, not one person (out of dozens of people that I surveyed) knew where or how to navigate to this specific screen that I’m talking about here. It’s called the [Significant Locations](&lt;|url|&gt;) list.
> # The Significant Locations list shows a minute-by-minute route history of my exact whereabouts in every location I’ve been over the past few years.

For what it’s worth, Apple says this data isn’t shared without your permission. According to a [support page](&lt;|url|&gt;) outlining the company’s privacy policies for location services, the data collected by the Significant Locations feature “is encrypted and stored only on your device and will not be shared without your consent. It is used to provide you with personalized services, such as predictive traffic routing, and to build better Photos Memories.” You don’t need to worry about the data being used for marketing, or about an Apple employee snooping.

Still, Significant Locations is a stark reminder of how much data you generate through the simple act of walking around with your iPhone. And it’s similar to data that could be leveraged by other services when you grant them permission to access your location.

Now, I am actually a huge Apple fan. I generally fall on the side of being more open about sharing data and personal information with tech companies so as to improve my overall customized user experience. I know why they want the data, and I’m alright with it.

But when I first discovered this hidden location list, I felt it was a bit much, to say the least. The Significant Locations list shows a minute-by-minute route history of my exact whereabouts in every location I’ve been in over the past few years.

## How to find your location history

**Step 1:** Open the Settings app.

**Step 2: **Navigate to the Privacy section (small white hand, blue background).

**Step 3:** Click on Location Services.

**Step 4: **Scroll *all the way* to the bottom and click on System Services.

**Step 5:** Navigate to Significant Locations.

At this point, you’ll need to log in with your passcode or Face ID.

Now, here’s where it starts to get interesting. You should see a list of cities. Underneath each location, there’ll be a number of locations and a corresponding date.

If you scroll to your hometown, there should be dozens (even hundreds, in some cases) of locations. For me here in New York City, my phone shows “136 locations” underneath New York, New York, accompanied by a date range.

**Step 6: **Click on your hometown.

You’ll see that “Home” is probably first at the top of your list. Here’s where it gets even more specific.

**Step 7:** Click on Home.

You are finally presented with a minute-by-minute list of your commutes to and from your home and your method of transportation.

Taking a step back for a moment, Apple does qualify this Significant Locations section by saying that these are encrypted locations and cannot be read by Apple. We’ll have to take their word for that part. But it’s not so much that they even qualify it like that. What’s most surprising to me is how clearly hidden this section is.

Anyone who has ever built a digital product knows that if you’re putting something seven screens away from the main screen with a series of scrolls, clicks, and nonobvious names, you’re actively trying to hide the content from the end user.

## Can I turn it off?

Remember: Apple says that this data is kept private. But if you’re uncomfortable with this list, you can simply move the Significant Locations switch to the off position. If you really want to wipe it clean, turn it on, scroll to the bottom of the history, and select Clear History.

This post is more of an FYI than a serious dig at Apple. At the end of the day, we are responsible for letting technology creep further and further into our lives, because we keep valuing its personalized benefits over the less useful but more private alternate universe.

Do some digging on your own to find out what settings are turned on and which you’ve turned off. Find out what settings you can control and what exactly they’re doing. You control your own tech destiny. This is just one quick PSA about an area of your iPhone you probably hadn’t explored too much. Technology’s ability to improve our lives in nearly all aspects is clear — but we as a society are healthiest as a whole when we fully understand the implications of how and why it all works.

# The Asymmetry of the Christchurch Shootings

## An act of terror by a few overshadows — online and off — a global youth protest against climate change

![Photo: Marty Melville/AFP/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Marty Melville/AFP/Getty*

On Friday morning in Christchurch, New Zealand, scores of students walked out of their classrooms. Inspired by the example of the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who last August began regularly staying out of school to demonstrate against inaction on climate change, the Christchurch students were among the first to take part in today’s Global Climate Strike, an international protest that will feature hundreds of thousands, even millions of students striking in more than 120 countries. At 1 p.m. local time, the students gathered in Christchurch’s Cathedral Square, where they sent out tweets and Instagram posts meant to publicize their message: climate action now. They were hoping to seize the attention of not just anyone who might be passing by their protest, but the entire world — through the power of the internet. Their natural habitat.

At 1:40 p.m. local time, less than two miles away from Cathedral Square, a gunman entered Christchurch’s Al Noor Mosque, where hundreds of worshippers were taking part in Friday Prayers. Another shooter reportedly entered the city’s Linwood Mosque at about the same time. They opened fire. By the time the shootings were finished, at least 49 people were dead, and dozens more were wounded. It was by far the worst mass shooting in New Zealand’s history, a larger death toll by population in this small country than the 9/11 attacks were for the United States.

Like the young climate strikers just a few miles away, the 28-year-old man who allegedly carried out the Al Noor shooting engineered his act for, in the [words](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the *New York Times* opinion writer Charlie Warzel, “maximum virality.” The shooter livestreamed 16 minutes of his attack on Facebook Live, and shortly before he entered the mosque, uploaded a long manifesto heavy with references to white genocide conspiracy theory and hate speech against migrants and Muslims, larded with winks at online far right-wing culture and internet memes. He called for people to support his attack online and to create more memes — to give his act of mass murder fresh life on the internet. His natural habitat.
> # The tragedy of today — beyond the lives destroyed in the shootings — is that we likely won’t remember March 15, 2019 as the day of the Global Climate Strike for Future.

In the hours and days to come, fresh attention will fall on what companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are doing — and what they’re failing to do — to prevent their services from becoming platforms for hate and death. Though the companies were quick to take down the video and the gunman’s ramblings, users were even quicker to download and disseminate them. Copies are available online in the internet’s darkest reaches, and will almost certainly remain so. The alleged shooter was evidently a man who understood — perhaps better than the people who run these companies do — how the internet works, especially the fungal subcultures where those he was trying to reach dwell. Their natural habitat.

On Friday, the Climate Strike moved west with the sun from a grieving Christchurch, to the cities of Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The young people who are taking part in it are far, far more representative of their generation, of the internet itself, than those who perpetrated an act of hate that took the lives of dozens of innocent people at worship. The students have come together to force the world to act on climate change, which is the true global crisis of our time — not the fevered, hateful dream of a global race war that apparently inspired the shooters. The student climate strikers are many; the killers of Christchurch and their repugnant online supporters are few. That was true before March 15 and it will remain true after.

But the tragedy of today — beyond the lives destroyed in the shootings — is that we likely won’t remember March 15, 2019 as the day of the Global Climate Strike. There is an asymmetry at work in terrorism, in the internet, in human psychology. The climate strike, like so many recent acts of protest, would never have been possible at this scale without the tools of the internet. It would have been difficult to organize, even harder to disseminate into the world. But it is hard, hard work to create positive and lasting social change, to move 7.5 billion people just one degree in the direction they need to go. It is hard work to build.

Destruction, though — destruction is easy. The weapons we have built enable one person to kill scores in a matter of a few minutes. The social media tools we have built enable those killings — and the hateful message of the killers — to go global, instantaneously. And our own brain wiring compels us to look. Most of us will react in revulsion; an abhorrent few will cheer. But the message will be out there.
> # Christchurch shows what it means to truly weaponize the internet.

New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern [called](&lt;|url|&gt;) Friday’s terrorist attack “an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence.” And it is, though not merely due to the numbers of killed and wounded. We’ve used the term before, but Christchurch shows what it means to truly weaponize the internet.

It will get worse. The weapons, for one — as much damage as a few murderers armed with rifles can do, there are things coming in the fields of biotechnology and autonomous weapons that could turn mass killers into global ones. The reach of social media only seems poised to grow; even the recent moves by Facebook to shift away from a public news feed towards private messaging would likely have been ineffective in the case of Christchurch. The asymmetry will deepen, and with it, the consequences. Destroying will get easier, while building will remain as hard as ever.

As I write this in New York, students are taking part in the Climate Strike, doing their small part to build a movement that will need to span oceans and decades. In Christchurch, trauma surgeons are working desperately to save the wounded. The kind of guns used in mass shootings like Christchurch can fire many rounds per second. When those rounds find human bodies, they can shred arteries and pulverize internal organs. The victims who survive the initial shootings — if doctors can keep them alive — will face months of recovery, lives forever changed by the split second of impact. Destroying is easy. Healing is hard.<|endoftext|>

# The Problem With Instagram’s Plan to Reduce ‘Sexually Suggestive’ Content

## The Problem With Instagram’s Plan to Reduce ‘Sexually Suggestive’ Content

### *It’s sexist*

![Photo by [Prateek Katyal](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Prateek Katyal](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Earlier this month, Instagram debuted [a new content moderation policy](&lt;|url|&gt;) focused on “reducing the spread of posts that are inappropriate but do not go against Instagram’s Community Guidelines” — or, to put it more bluntly, making it harder for users to promote and find content deemed by the platform to be violent, graphic, or sexually suggestive.

While the new policy may help reduce the spread of disturbing content within the app, it also has some users worried that they’ll find their posts, and potentially even their entire accounts, hidden away due to an overly broad application of the nebulous label “sexually suggestive.” While the policy won’t scrub content from the platform altogether, it will prevent certain imagery from surfacing in the app’s popular “Explore” tab, once called the “[realest place on the web](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

Will Ruben, Instagram’s product lead overseeing Discovery, [told *TechCrunch](&lt;|url|&gt;) *that* *these new guidelines will be implemented by machine learning algorithms. Human content moderators will reportedly train the system to identify posts that push the boundaries of good taste.
> # Different moderators may come to the project with wildly different ideas of what, exactly, “sexually suggestive” actually means.

Experts reached by *OneZero* voiced a number of concerns about the update, which seems destined to disproportionately affect women, especially body-positive influencers, women of color, and trans activists.

Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor at the University of Utah’s School of Computing, says there are multiple ways this sort of system could go wrong. Establishing consistent labels that an algorithm can learn and enforce is already a tricky task, and much more so when the label is something as vague and subject to debate as “sexually suggestive.” Different moderators may come to the project with wildly different ideas of what, exactly, “sexually suggestive” actually means, creating far more confusion than clarity.

“Is [the question] merely, ‘Is it suggestive or not?’ Is there more nuance than this?” Venkatasubramanian asks.

Venkatasubramanian pointed out that something like the MPAA’s film rating system offers context for why a film might receive a PG-13 versus an R. But absent such explicit guidance and guidelines, it’s likely that the algorithm will be informed by an aggregate of potentially conflicting standards set by the moderation team, leading to moderation that either casts an incredibly wide net or winds up with a standard that feels inconsistently applied. That’s something we’ve already seen with content moderation algorithms that [flagged](&lt;|url|&gt;) photos of Burt Reynolds’ famous *Cosmopolitan* centerfold as pornography or [failed to recognize](&lt;|url|&gt;) live videos of the New Zealand mosque shooting as violent content.

There are already some signs that Instagram’s moderation algorithm is going to be shaped by a biased idea of indecency—one that sets a far lower bar for women than for men. *TechCrunch *obtained sample photos about the moderation effort, including two images that could be considered sexually suggestive. One featured a fully clothed, headless man grabbing at his crotch; the other, a woman in lingerie seated on a bed. You could interpret this to mean that men are deemed to be sexually suggestive by virtue of their actions, while women gain that status simply by having a body that someone else deems sexually attractive.
> # “We want to be transparent with the community about these guidelines, and we’re thinking through the best way to do that.”

Instagram declined to offer *OneZero* more information about how its algorithms would be trained. A spokesperson says, “We’re not sharing that level of information at the moment, because we don’t want people to game the system. We want to be transparent with the community about these guidelines, and we’re thinking through the best way to do that.”

It’s not just erotically themed accounts that stand to be affected by this policy. Anna Lauren Hoffmann, an assistant professor with the Information School at the University of Washington, explains that there’s “a legacy of conflating women’s bodies… with deviance, or lewdness, or distraction, or, directly, inappropriateness,” one that Instagram’s content guidelines appear to be drawing from. Notably, it’s a legacy that does not affect all women equally. As Hoffmann reminds me, our cultural ideas of appropriate appearance and behavior tend to “have particular consequences for particular kinds of women,” such as women of color, disabled women, trans women, fat women, and other women whose bodies are frequently labeled “inappropriate” merely for having the audacity to exist.

Laura Delarato, a body image activist and creator of the newsletter [1-800-HEYLAURA](&lt;|url|&gt;), which offers readers a space to explore their feelings about sex and their bodies, uses Instagram to provide body-positive inspiration to her thousands of fans. She has found that, as a fat woman, she’s subjected to stricter scrutiny than her skinny or male counterparts.

“Men can just walk seamlessly into this Instagram world without bias, because their bodies are already deemed as the norm,” Delarato says, noting that someone like plus-size male model [Zach Miko](&lt;|url|&gt;) can pose half-naked without being deemed sexually suggestive, in part due to Instagram’s long controversial stance that male nipples are more socially appropriate than their female counterparts. In contrast, women — and particularly marginalized women — are presumed to exist primarily for male consumption, their images sexualized simply by virtue of their existence.
> # Men are deemed to be sexually suggestive by virtue of their actions, while women gain that status simply by having a body that someone else deems sexually attractive.

“We have this internal understanding that women are ornaments,” Delarato says. The idea of women exposing skin for reasons beyond titillation is unfathomable to many people, even as women regularly post scantily clad photos as a way to put out [a message of body positivity](&lt;|url|&gt;), [normalize being a cancer survivor](&lt;|url|&gt;), [document their fitness achievements](&lt;|url|&gt;), or even [celebrate a bond with an infant](&lt;|url|&gt;). And Instagram — a company that, Hoffmann reminds me, is ultimately overseen by a man who launched his tech career with a website devoted to [ranking the appearances of Harvard women](&lt;|url|&gt;) — seems ill-prepared to incorporate such a nuanced view of women, and women’s bodies, into its new moderation policy.

Social media sites like Instagram launched with the promise of giving a platform to everyone, from every background, enabling individuals to express themselves and marginalized voices to be heard. And yet, with its new content policy, Instagram seems set to remove all nuance, intention, and cultural context from its users’ posts, subjecting everyone to a single, biased definition of “sexually suggestive.” It’s a strategy that dehumanizes users, robbing them of their ability to assign their own meaning and message to the content they post — and it’s a strategy that is likely to cause the most harm to some of the platforms’ already marginalized users.<|endoftext|>

# Twitter’s Suspension Bots Are Out of Control

## Twitter’s Suspension Bots Are Out of Control

### **An innocent account gets caught up in a bot purge, with no explanation why**

![Photo: [Matt McGee](&lt;|url|&gt;)/[CC BY-ND 2.0](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo: [Matt McGee](&lt;|url|&gt;)/[CC BY-ND 2.0](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

WinObs was gone. Snapped away like a Thanos victim with no forwarding address. My long-time Twitter pal [Rich Hay’s Twitter account](&lt;|url|&gt;) was gray, though not quite dust.

Hay and I met nearly a decade ago at an early NASA Tweetup to celebrate and witness one of the last Space Shuttle launches. We bonded over our love of space and, later, a somewhat shared Windows expertise. Hay’s operating system insights are levels above mine—he’s a member of the Windows Insider program, Microsoft’s open-software testing program—but as someone who covers the platform, I appreciated the knowledge he brought to the topic on his website [Windows Observer](&lt;|url|&gt;) and the associated Twitter account WinObs.

Hay’s name had come up in association with a project I was working on, so I decided to contact him on Twitter. And that’s when I discovered that WinObs—an 11-year-old account with 22,000 followers, 500,000+ tweets, and nothing but good, clean, techy content—had been suspended.

Twitter has spent a lot of time developing extensive platform rules, spelling them out in exhaustive detail [on this page](&lt;|url|&gt;). Violating any of these rules can put you on the path to account suspension, but that is usually a last resort. Violators are first warned, mostly via email. That message can include the offending tweet or thread. Sometimes the email arrives at the time of suspension, but with the promise that if the offending Tweet is removed, they could be reinstated. From Twitter’s [enforcement options page](&lt;|url|&gt;):
> Unless a violation is so egregious that we must immediately suspend an account, we first try to educate people about our Rules and give them a chance to correct their behavior. We show the violator the offending Tweet(s), explain which Rule was broken, and require them to remove the content before they can Tweet again.

At least that’s how it’s supposed to work. But I knew for a fact that Hay didn’t fit any of the typical Twitter troll or bot profiles. Like its creator, the WinObs account is observational, inquisitive, wry, smart, friendly, and above all else, helpful.

Over the course of the next few days, I tried repeatedly to access the WinObs account, to no avail. I also soon realized that I had no other way to contact Hay. In all the years we’d known each other, including times we connected IRL at trade shows, we’d never traded emails or phone numbers. Our frayed Twitter connection was the account suspension’s collateral damage.

More than a week later, Hay finally popped up in my DMs. WinObs was back and he had a tale to tell.

It took eight days for Hay to get his account reactivated. He suspected he was suspended not because of anything he did, but because his account was swept up by Twitter’s anti-bot algorithms. If so, it wasn’t the first time that had happened to him. Hay told me that his account was suspended without warning last fall for the better part of a day. Using Twitter’s appeal process, he was able to get it back. This time was different.
> # “They’re going at it like a traffic cop with a quota.”

I looked at the [last tweet](&lt;|url|&gt;) Hay sent before suspension and a dozen or so before that. Nothing jumped out at me as a suspension trigger. Perhaps Hay was operating in a bot or spammy way that set off the Twitter bot-catching algorithm. WinObs’ nearly half million tweets is a lot, but Hay explained that his account is a combination of automated tweets and handmade ones. What he tweets is “never duplicates, never spam,” said Hay. “It’s genuine tech related news/tidbits from the 125 or so RSS feeds I track in Feedly [a news-feed aggregation service].”

Hay puts news items in a “save for later” bin, and then they’re picked up by an If This Then That (IFTTT) app and sent to Buffer, which schedules them out roughly four times per hour. I don’t see that as any spammier than someone tweeting 10 times an hour or using scheduled Tweets in Tweetdeck—something I’ve certainly done.

In the days following the suspension, as Hay frantically tried to get the company’s assistance—or at least its attention—he started to do a little research on Twitter suspensions. Reddit is, naturally, a popular destination for people to commiserate about everything, and Twitter is no exception. There’s a vibrant [Twitter subreddit](&lt;|url|&gt;), and it is filled with people talking about the origins of their Twitter suspensions.

As I looked through the subreddit, I saw many former Twitter account holders who simply didn’t understand the rules or how to comport themselves on the platform and spread foul language and abuse. They clearly deserved suspensions. But there was also an equal number of confounded Twitter users who had [no idea why](&lt;|url|&gt;) they were suspended. They understood the rules and knew they hadn’t broken them, but they were suspended, often without any communication from Twitter. In trying to characterize the way Twitter suspends accounts, one Redditor put it this way: “They’re going at it like a traffic cop with a quota.”

Twitter’s ongoing efforts to scrub the system clean of millions of fake, spam, and bot accounts is not new. Six years ago, Twitter estimated that 5% of its user base was fake and the *Wall Street Journal* reported that [20 million fake accounts](&lt;|url|&gt;) were for sale. At the time, Twitter re-engineered its system to prevent users from following and unfollowing users in bulk—a fairly obvious anti-bot move. More recently, Twitter adjusted down the number of accounts you can follow in a single day from [1,000 to 400](&lt;|url|&gt;).

It’s not clear those original efforts did much, and by the 2016 elections, it was obvious that a new kind of Twitter bot was on the rise. Socialbots, often backed by sophisticated A.I., were extremely busy in the waning days of the [2016 presidential election](&lt;|url|&gt;). They could steer users and sentiment in waves that helped or hurt particular candidates.

With the understanding that the platform they built to help connect the world and encourage a global conversation was being abused in geopolitically damaging ways, Twitter took far more aggressive action. It was a slow process that, initially, didn’t bear much fruit, but in late 2018, huge swaths of Twitter bots began disappearing from the services. Many users, including yours truly, began to notice a precipitous decline in followers. It happened so fast and so effectively that even those with the largest number of followers took notice. President Trump was so upset about it that he assumed Twitter was [targeting him](&lt;|url|&gt;). (There was no evidence it was.)

While there are many cases where Twitter will have humans decide, based on other users reporting bad Twitter behavior, to suspend or remove an account, most of the bot removal work is done algorithmically. Those who understood the challenge Twitter faces applauded the company’s efforts, especially as it became clear that the purge would surely damage Twitter’s [quarter-to-quarter growth numbers](&lt;|url|&gt;). But this weed-whacker approach is increasingly sweeping up accounts like WinObs, which have never broken a Twitter rule, but seem to have some profile element that triggers the bot trimmer.
> # Sweeping up people like Hay in a bot-driven mass purge and treating them as collateral damage isn’t fair, and it isn’t smart.

Another side effect of suspending accounts at this speed and scale is that Twitter support can’t seem to keep up with notification and adjudication. Hay never received a warning notice from Twitter, and many of the Reddit posters had no idea why they were suspended. They had no idea what to do.

Hay, though, was fortunate. He plays a relatively important role on Twitter for Microsoft. He’s been a member of the Windows Insider program for five years, an Insider MVP for four, and actively helps share information inside and outside the MVP network. So after eight days of zero answers and communication from Twitter, and despite filing an appeal, Hay turned to the Windows community for help.

Dona Sarkar, who leads Microsoft’s Windows Insider Program, [tweeted to TwitterSupport](&lt;|url|&gt;):
> It’s been over a week since you suspended of our of most important[ #WindowsInsiders](&lt;|url|&gt;) community leader’s account[ @winobs](&lt;|url|&gt;). He’s done the necessary paperwork to reinstate and still nothing. We’d really appreciate it if you could investigate.

“I was so shocked when his Twitter account got suspended,” Sarkar told me later. “He’s never been the type to get even a little rude. Some get snappy or saucy on Twitter. He never does that. He’s just a good person on Twitter.”

Sarkar’s tweet quickly generated hundreds of likes and retweets and soon WinObs was back online—albeit without so much as an explanation or an apology from Twitter. But in a situation like this, noted Sarkar, “If you don’t have a friend who has a checkmark [verified] you’re kind of screwed.”

As effective as Twitter is at removing spam and bot accounts, there are many situations where accounts exhibit spam, trolling, and worse behavior [without getting suspended](&lt;|url|&gt;). Often, though not always, these are verified accounts. Clearly, a verified account is usually not a bot, but it should be held to the same rules of Twitter conduct if it acts in a manner seemingly indistinguishable from a bot.

I wanted to ask Twitter, among other things, if the banning rules are different for verified accounts. (Hay’s account is not verified.) But Twitter wouldn’t speak to me on record and simply pointed me to its [pages](&lt;|url|&gt;) on enforcement philosophy and policy.

Twitter’s effort to rid its service of spam, bots, and trolls is admirable, and neither Hay nor I would ever recommend they stop. But Hay and others like him are the pure, beating heart of Twitter; people who joined early when the platform barely made sense and have used it in the best way possible: to connect with like-minded people and share important information. Sweeping up people like Hay in a bot-driven mass purge and treating them as collateral damage isn’t fair and it isn’t smart. Being off Twitter for eight days reminded Hay of how much he needs the social media platform, but Twitter needs him too and should learn how to treat the WinObs account and others like it with care and respect.<|endoftext|>

# Live, Die, Repeat — How Time Loops Took Over Video Games

## Gaming has always involved players doing the same thing, over and over, but now designers are experimenting with circling time as a narrative device

![Screenshot: [Elsinore](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Screenshot: [Elsinore](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

There is tragedy in the Danish palace: the untimely deaths of the entire royal family, the king’s advisor and both of his children, and the prince’s friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. But for Ophelia, the advisor’s daughter, death is not the end, as she awakens in her bedchamber four days in the past. With the knowledge of what is to come, she attempts to avert this Shakespearean tragedy. Again and again and again.

This is [*Elsinore](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a new video game released this year from a team led by American writer [Katie Chironis](&lt;|url|&gt;). She has described it as *Groundhog Day* meets *Hamlet*, though, she noted: “If they’re under age 35, they give me this blank stare because they don’t know what *Groundhog Day* is.”
> # “I thought about what it would look like if we were to empower a player to step into the role of somebody in *Hamlet* and say, ‘Hey, you think that this situation could have been avoided easily? Go ahead and try, see what happens.’”

Time-loop narratives, in which characters are forced to knowingly relive the same period of time, are so strongly associated with this 1993 movie that the exhaustive pop culture website TV Tropes calls them “[*Groundhog Day* Loops](&lt;|url|&gt;).” The team behind *Elsinore* pulled the trope from anime, where it has been popular since the 1980s. But in the six years it has taken to develop the game, time loops have come around again in the West: the 2014 movie *Edge of Tomorrow*, this year’s TV series *Russian Doll*, and video games — over and over.

Many games already contain loops of repeated failure, albeit ones in which only the player — not the character they may be playing — retains the knowledge necessary to break the cycle. And as academics have [pointed out](&lt;|url|&gt;), time loops are often a problem-solving process, so it’s unsurprising they should find their way into video games. But why are time-loop games so popular right now?

[*Outer Wilds](&lt;|url|&gt;)* (2019), whose art director Wesley Martin also worked on *Elsinore*, began life as creative director Alex Beachum’s master’s thesis while he was at USC. He wanted to play with natural systems, and thought it would be more fun for players to experience them over and over again if time travel was part of the narrative. Over the next few years, his team built an entire solar system of planets that change over the course of 22 minutes — one collapsing into a black hole at its center, one filling another with sand — before the sun goes supernova. And his sister, Kelsey Beachum, helped write a story that encourages the player to explore that system.

![Screenshot from Outer Wilds / Alex Beachum via [Creative Commons](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Screenshot from Outer Wilds / Alex Beachum via [Creative Commons](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

In the upcoming game [*12 Minutes](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a thriller from the same publisher as *Outer Wilds*, the idea for the time loop also came first, before the story was developed. Director Luis Antonio wanted to explore causality, and said he made all the design choices accordingly, as if they weren’t really his choices at all. He shrunk the space and time so that players could understand how their actions interacted. To make them care, he made it intimate: in *12 Minutes*, the player takes on the role of a man who knows that a cop will come to his home to accuse his pregnant wife of murder.

*Elsinore*, of course, already had a story. As a writing major, Chironis studied Shakespeare and tragedies in which characters try to make good choices to no avail. “I thought about what it would look like if we were to empower a player to step into the role of somebody in *Hamlet* and say, ‘Hey, you think that this situation could have been avoided easily? Go ahead and try, see what happens.’” While the first loop of *Elsinore* is pretty faithful to the text, the team has made some changes, most notably expanding and diversifying the cast beyond white men (and a couple of white women) to help make what Chironis calls a timeless story more accessible to a modern audience.

All three of these games are approached like mysteries. The goal is understanding, because all that remains between loops is knowledge, whether stored in an in-game log or just represented by increased dialogue options. One design challenge is managing the pace at which that knowledge is obtained, to motivate the player without overwhelming them. “Every loop, I need to leave you two or three breadcrumbs,” explained Antonio.

But since the game scenario resets, the designer has limited control over the order of those breadcrumbs. “No two players are likely to experience the exact same path through the story,” said Kelsey. *Elsinore* has the longest loop, with the events of the play condensed down to four days, so pacing is even more important. “It feels unnatural if it’s just high-octane all the time,” said Chironis. As anyone familiar with the play will know, there has to be room for Hamlet to mope.

To enable Ophelia to rewrite this story armed only with foreknowledge, *Elsinore* required a complex social simulation. As engineer Kristin Siu explained: “The idea is that you can talk to anybody, at any point in time, with any piece of information that you have, and that may or may not have an effect on this ongoing world tragedy simulation around you.” This complexity left Chironis with overlapping narrative arcs to juggle and Siu with bugs to squash if, for example, a character popped up where they shouldn’t be.

Video game players crave these kinds of complex simulations that offer so much choice, but they’re really only possible in games with a narrow scope. “People are sick, overall, of games that are super wide but shallow,” said Alex, pointing to the commercially successful open-world games such as the *Assassin’s Creed* and *Grand Theft Auto* series, with their exhausting to-do lists.
> # “What experiences are valuable in the face of certain death?”

*12 Minutes* is perhaps the clearest example of this refined and in-depth alternative: three nameless characters in one apartment with maybe a dozen objects. Antonio credits this minimalist approach to his background in visual arts, where every color and shape has a purpose: “I try to only say what I need to say in order for you to be able to have enough breadcrumbs to communicate with this interactive experience. Everything else was removed.”

![Screenshot: [12 Minutes](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Screenshot: [12 Minutes](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Another benefit of time-loop games is the lack of long-term consequences: the designer doesn’t have to write them, and the player doesn’t have to worry about them. This encourages a more playful approach; while time-loop movies and television shows force you to follow the protagonist’s pre-written actions, in a game, you have the agency to take more risks. You can give your wife a weapon, or jump into a black hole, or have Ophelia sleep with Othello. (Chironis added a few characters from other Shakespearean plays to *Elsinore*.)

And what choices the player makes in these moments can encourage introspection. As Chironis puts it: “It’s like, ‘Norway is going to invade this country in four days and everyone is going to die. So what are you going to do in the meantime?’” *Outer Wilds*, with its dying star, is even more existential. “Is it still worth it to explore and learn new things in the face of Armageddon?” Alex asked. “Yeah,” added Kelsey. “What experiences are valuable in the face of certain death?”

People have [written](&lt;|url|&gt;) that *Outer Wilds* can help with death anxiety. With the climate crisis in the news, apocalyptic thinking is on the rise. As the mistakes of our past threaten our future, perhaps it’s no wonder that people are drawn to stories about attempting to break free from a negative cycle. “When Trump got elected,” said Chironis, “A lot of people joked, ‘We’re living in the worst time line.’ And I still think that’s sort of how many people my age perceive the world. It’s not just the way things are and the way things will be. It’s: ‘We have a choice, and we made the wrong choice.’”<|endoftext|>

# Stop Putting Humans in Transformers Movies

## Stop Putting Humans in ‘Transformers’ Movies

### The case for movies exclusively about giant robots fighting each other

![Credit: Transformers/Paramount](<|image|>)*Credit: Transformers/Paramount*

Please imagine what *Star Trek: The Next Generation* would be like if Wesley Crusher had been the main character. Or if *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom *followed only his sidekick, Short Round. Or *Friends*, seen entirely through the eyes of Marcel the Monkey. None of these sound good or even make sense, right? So why are the stars of the *Transformers* movies humans instead of, you know… Transformers?

If you only know the franchise because of Michael Bay’s five incredibly popular yet truly awful films, which all have humans in the leading roles, it might never have occurred to you to consider a *Transformers* movie without a bankable Hollywood lead like Mark Wahlberg or Shia LaBoeuf (okay, well, previously bankable) as the main character. In fact, I bet some of you are trying to imagine Bay’s movies without the human characters in them and having a hard time figuring out how the movie would be more than 45 minutes or so.

This would be true, but it doesn’t have to be. The Transformers don’t take the back seat in their own movies because they are inherently bad characters. It’s because Michael Bay has never understood or even particularly liked the Transformers, and thus has made them the supporting cast in their own movies. The decisions of the human characters dictate their actions almost entirely. Compared to the two-dimensionality of Bay’s main characters, like Spike (LaBoeuf), Cade (Wahlberg), or Mikaela (Megan Fox), the Transformers are one-dimensional dots, with only enough room for a single word to sum up their entire personality (for example, “[samurai](&lt;|url|&gt;)” or “[evil](&lt;|url|&gt;)”). Many of them never get any speaking lines, and some never transform into humanoid robots at all. There’s no Transformers-centric version of the Bechdel test that I know of, but someone once made a compilation of all the scenes in the first three movies — which total more than seven hours of what is technically cinematic entertainment — where giant robots actually fought each other instead of human characters. That compilation ended up being [just over 20 minutes long](&lt;|url|&gt;).

That is messed up, since giant robots fighting each other is essentially the entire idea of the *Transformers* franchise — or a least what it’s supposed to be: the heroic Autobots fighting the evil Decepticons. Even if a few humans tagged along for the ride — the original Spike Witwicky in the 1980s cartoon was one of these, one of those tacked-on kid characters who spend most of their time getting kidnapped or messing things up — they were supporting characters to the main cast of Optimus Prime, Megatron, and the other robots between whom the story’s actual conflict exists.
> # The Transformers don’t take the back seat in their own movies because they are inherently bad characters.

If you’re looking for drama because the idea of giant robots fighting doesn’t appeal to you, well, 1) what are you doing watching *Transformers* in the first place, but 2) the fact is that the Transformers themselves are perfectly capable of delivering compelling drama, because they are compelling characters — or at least they *should* be. If you look back to virtually any of the more than 20 *Transformers* cartoons that have aired since 1985, most prior to Michael Bay’s first film, these giant robots that turn into cars and jets and assured nonsense also have personalities and hopes and fears and interests.

They aren’t Shakespearean in complexity by any means, but if you go back and look at the glut of action figure–based ’80s cartoons (and you know I have), the main cast of *Transformers* is easily the most three-dimensional compared to *He-Man, G.I. Joe, ThunderCats*, and the rest. This is admittedly not a high bar, but these characters had personalities and relationships and lives outside the action scenes. And those action scenes were built out of a war between the Autobots and Decepticons that genuinely had some complexity to it. The evil Megatron was primarily fighting to get his people home to Cybertron; he just didn’t care about the cost to Earth’s native population. The Autobots were fighting for humanity instead of themselves, and these good guys could often find Megatron’s goal — if not his methods — seductive. Characters on both sides could question their leaders’ fitness, their decisions, and even their mental states.

I am not saying the cartoons were some kind of masterpiece — there was an episode where [a robot fell in love with a mermaid](&lt;|url|&gt;) — but I am saying there’s zero reason why Transformers couldn’t have been the starring characters in their self-titled films. Because if nothing else, then we could have been spared these movie moments Bay inflicted upon audiences that will haunt my dreams for all eternity:

* John Turturro gets [pissed on by a robot](&lt;|url|&gt;) (the original *Transformers*).

* Shia LaBoeuf [goes to Transformer heaven](&lt;|url|&gt;) (*Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen*).

* Mom talks to son Spike in public about the size of his genitals and the importance of vaginally pleasuring a woman (*Transformers: Dark of the Moon*).

* A 20-year-old character brings a copy of Texas’s age of consent law so he can let her father and the audience know [he is legally fucking the man’s 17-year-old daughter](&lt;|url|&gt;) (*Transformers: Age of Extinction*).

* Anthony Hopkins reveals that abolitionist and statesman Frederick Douglass was [a member of a secret society that protected the Transformers](&lt;|url|&gt;) (*Transformers: The Last Knight*).

These are by no means the only problems in Michael Bay’s *Transformers* movies — they can be [leeringly](&lt;|url|&gt;) [sexist](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [shockingly racist](&lt;|url|&gt;), and neither Bay nor the characters seem to have [any sense of object permanence](&lt;|url|&gt;) — and robots, some of which [have visible testicles](&lt;|url|&gt;), are part of the problem. At least the upcoming *Transformers* spinoff movie *Bumblebee*, about the theoretically most loved (and definitely most marketed) Autobot of the same name and a girl (Hailee Steinfeld), which is very much not directed by Bay, appears to be a movie based on kids’ toys that kids can actually watch. But lest you think the Transformer might actually be a co-lead, [*Variety*’s recent review of the film](&lt;|url|&gt;) assures that Bumblebee is “basically the best *pet* any teenager could hope for.”

I understand the thinking behind adding humans to these movies, I really do: It’s as the audience surrogate, to give viewers a character or characters to identify with, to see the action of the movie through their perspectives — the same reason the original Spike was added to the ’80s cartoon, as a vessel for kids to project themselves onto, to feel like they were hanging out with these cool giant robots. But it’s not humans of any age that viewers need in *Transformers* — it’s compelling characters, and those can be anybody or anything. I mean, *Wall-E* didn’t need a human to pal around with for the entire first act of his movie, and he couldn’t talk or violently murder other robots. Crazy but true!

Let me put it one final way: For nearly 35 years, kids have bought Transformers toys and imagined being giant robots that turn into cars, jets, boom boxes, animals, and more, fighting an endless war between good and evil for the fate of the Earth. No one has ever bought a Spike Witwicky action figure and pretended to be [sexually assaulted by a robot](&lt;|url|&gt;) wearing an extremely short dress.

At least, I hope not.<|endoftext|>

# New Apple TV App Finally Kills the Middle Man

## Finally, the frictionless peak-TV experience we’ve always wanted

![The Apple TV app’s new interface. Image courtesy of Apple](<|image|>)*The Apple TV app’s new interface. Image courtesy of Apple*

I was thrilled when Apple first introduced [single sign-on](&lt;|url|&gt;) for cable channels in its Apple TV app. Finally, I could access content from services like HBO, Showtime, and NBC through my Apple TV after linking it to my cable provider — no more signing into different apps!

Except it didn’t work out that way.

Whenever a channel app updates, I have to go through the authentication routine again, which means I need that damn authentication code. You know the one: the special code that you can only get by visiting a cable channel’s website — usually via a desktop computer that, of course, isn’t in the same room as your Apple TV — and that you have to enter back into the app interface on Apple TV. For some services, this is a monthly exercise. So much for the promise of frictionless TV consumption.

But Apple promises to end this small but recurring nightmare with its new Apple TV channels, part of the redesigned Apple TV app launched on Monday. Unlike separate cable channel apps, Apple TV channels are fully integrated into the Apple iCloud sign-on ecosystem.
> # Apple TV will display shows you can watch through your various subscriptions, but it will also display aspirational content — stuff you can’t watch unless you sign up for a service.

In a recent demo I saw, it took exactly two steps to add the HBO channel: Find its listing within the new Apple TV interface, and click a large “confirm” button. Whatever updates or changes HBO might make to its channel interface will never prompt another sign-in or request for a code. And family members can use Apple’s integrated family sharing to view, for example, HBO channel content. This is progress.

Apple also convinced HBO to do something it has never done before: offer all archival content for download and offline viewing. It’s a strategy that’s done very well for Netflix Originals.

(If, by the way, you already have an HBO Now app subscription, the Apple TV channel update won’t affect it, nor will the system push you to abandon the app and switch to the HBO channel under Apple TV.)

Obviously, Apple TV’s big update is not just about channels — which is good, as there’s a limited number of partners at launch. They include HBO, Starz, Showtime, Smithsonian Channel, and Epix. Aside from CBS All Access, networks like ABC, NBC, and Fox are not yet among the channel list, nor are there any options for local TV network apps.

Here’s what else you can expect.

## **The new face**

This Apple TV update, which arrives in tvOS and iOS months ahead of [Apple’s TV+](&lt;|url|&gt;) planned original offerings and offers no hints of what’s to come in that regard, is still very recognizable. The cosmetic changes — a darker background, more curves — are less important than the reorganization. The store is gone, in favor of Movies and TV Shows sections pulled from iTunes, and there’s a new Kids tab.

The Watch Now section still dominates, giving you quick access to the newest stuff in your orbit. *Game of Thrones* watchers, for instance, will see the latest episode listed, along with content from other networks and apps depending on their level of integration within the TV app.

Apple TV’s ability to be channel agnostic and simply offer you everything you want in one consolidated interface, or through Siri’s universal search, is one of my favorite features. Holding the Siri button on your Apple TV remote and saying something like, “I want to watch something with Angelina Jolie,” will bring up a wide array of Jolie content from across the platform.

![](<|image|>)

Category shelves with shows or movies are now redesigned with cards that include large autoplaying trailers. A simple swipe to the right sends you to the next show on the shelf. It’s a pretty smooth vehicle for content discovery.

The more you use Apple TV, the more your system knows about you, and like many of Apple’s other devices, it uses local machine learning to help you find additional movies and binge-worthy content that might appeal to you without sending personal information to the cloud. It’s all listed in the For You section. Even though the listings are automated, Apple employs editors who work on the descriptions. The descriptors they settle on can help determine if a show will end up in your curated feed. For example, if you like dark shows (see *Game of Thrones*), the program might pull in other dark shows, defined as such by the editors.

Those editors are also filling up the New and Noteworthy queue, but if you’ve made it that far down in the interface, perhaps Apple TV hasn’t done a good enough job showing you what should appeal to you.

In general, Apple TV will display shows you can watch through your various subscriptions, but it will also display what I’d call aspirational content — stuff you can’t watch unless you sign up for a service.

## **iTunes and kids**

Apple’s also integrating the iTunes movie and TV library into the new Apple TV app, which means TV app curation will recommend a much wider swath of content — there are more than 100,000 movies and TV shows available on iTunes.

![The new Kids section. Image courtesy of Apple](<|image|>)*The new Kids section. Image courtesy of Apple*

The new Kids section is as kid-friendly as you’d expect, full of well-known titles and a lot of curated, family-friendly fare. While you can use parental controls and Screen Time to apply child-friendly usage settings like “ask to buy,” there’s no way to set the Kids tab as the default or the only screen a child sees when they open the TV app.

## **Apple TV everywhere**

I also got a look at a pair of third-party hardware devices that now integrate the Apple TV app — a major shift for Cupertino, which used to insist that consumers buy a separate Apple TV box.

First, there was the Samsung HDTV. (Some 2018 models and all 2019 Samsung HDTVs will support the new Apple TV app and iTunes content.) It lists the Apple TV app right next to competitors like Netflix. Once inside, it’s almost indistinguishable from the experience on Apple TV hardware. However, there are some differences. For instance, if you have the Hulu app integrated in the Apple TV app on other platforms, like your iPhone, content from Hulu won’t appear within the experience on your Samsung TV. And the third-party version of Apple TV app does not include the App Store.

But the experience is fuller than you might expect. We used an iPhone and AirPlay 2 to control the app on a Vizio TV, commanding Siri to play *Mission Impossible*. The Vizio instantly powered on and started playing the movie from the integrated Apple TV app. The virtual remote let us control volume and playback, though we could also use Siri to “go back 15 seconds,” exactly as you would if you were using an Apple TV remote. If I wanted, I could also play Hulu content on my iPhone’s Apple TV app and then use the mirroring feature to stream a full-screen version to the Vizio TV.

## **When to grab it**

The software update will arrive on Monday as a tvOS update for Apple TV 4K and HD devices. The third-generation Apple TV will get the update, but no App Store features. It will, however, support the new channels, as well as the iTunes TV and movie library integration.<|endoftext|>

# What Happens When You Google “Gay Child”

## Tech platforms have purged apps that promote discredited gay conversion therapy, but organic search results can still steer users to anti-LGBTQ groups

![Photo: Christian Wiediger/Unsplash](<|image|>)*Photo: Christian Wiediger/Unsplash*

Growing up in Athens, Georgia, Jon Bozeman knew he was gay from a young age, but also knew his community would never support him. So after leaving home for college, he tried to get ahead of the problem by seeking “counseling” at Exodus International. Exodus, founded in 1973 — the same year the American Psychological Association stopped classifying homosexuality as a pathology — described itself as a “worldwide Christian organization” that worked to restore “sexual wholeness to men and women who desire to overcome their homosexuality.”

Bozeman’s counselor told him that he should do things like snap a rubber band against his skin when he thought about men in a sexual way, and also told him that his parents were to blame for his “same-sex attraction.” Bozeman finally left Exodus in 2004, after meeting another young man in conversion therapy and starting a relationship with him. Exodus itself shut down in 2013, after many of its own leaders had come out as LGBTQ.

Professional medical organizations have been [denouncing conversion therapy](&lt;|url|&gt;) since 1993, and [a 2018 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) showed that it increased suicide attempts in teens by up to fivefold. Despite this, around 700,000 U.S. adults have received conversion therapy from licensed practitioners, according to a [2018 UCLA study](&lt;|url|&gt;), which also predicted that 20,000 children will eventually receive conversion therapy in states where it hasn’t yet been banned for minors under 18 or under 21, depending on the state.

In the year since that study was published, the battle against conversion therapy has been successful on many fronts. Since then, the practice has been banned for minors in [seven more states](&lt;|url|&gt;), bringing the total to 18. A further 14 states have similar legislation pending, and a [federal bill](&lt;|url|&gt;) has been introduced that would bar conversion therapy practitioners from receiving Medicaid funding.
> # Organizations like Focus on the Family rank high in Google web searches, allowing their message to reach more people.

LGBTQ advocacy organizations, including the [Human Rights Campaign](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Truth Wins Out](&lt;|url|&gt;), where Bozeman now works as a video producer, have [successfully campaigned](&lt;|url|&gt;) for big tech companies to remove conversion therapy apps from their stores. Yet tech companies are still inadvertently helping anti-LGBTQ groups to promote their messages. Organizations like Focus on the Family — which was connected to Exodus before it shut down — rank high in Google web searches, allowing their message to reach more people. “I see our entire fight as mainly a tech fight,” says Wayne Besen, founder of Truth Wins Out. “You have a young person coming out, their parents freak out.” Once this happens, the parents will probably go online, where they are highly likely to find these groups. “So we’re in a big tug of war right now with misinformation versus accurate information.”

In March, [Google caved to pressure](&lt;|url|&gt;) from groups including Truth Wins Out and the Human Rights Campaign, removing an app from its app store made by Living Hope Ministries that claimed to help people change their sexuality, but this was only after Amazon and Apple had both taken the app down in December 2018. Anti-LGBTQ groups had likely [manipulated Google-owned YouTube’s algorithm ](&lt;|url|&gt;)in 2018 so that hateful ads would play before LGBTQ YouTubers’ content. [YouTube has since addressed this problem](&lt;|url|&gt;), although the platform has more recently has [come under fire ](&lt;|url|&gt;)for failing to ban YouTubers who repeatedly target LGBTQ people for harassment. (At the Code conference on June 10, YouTube CEO Susan Wojicki [apologized](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the LGBTQ community, but defended the decision not to take down such videos.)

But even now, if a parent searches Google for information about a child they suspect might be LGBTQ, it’s likely that Focus on the Family will be in their top five results. When I Googled “gay child” on June 7, 2019, two of the top three results were from Focus on the Family, including an article entitled “When a Loved One Says, ‘I’m Gay’: The Stages of Grief.” When I Googled, “I think my child is gay,” the fourth ranking result was another Focus on the Family article, “Parent Suspects That Child Might Be Gay.” This page included a link to a pamphlet, also created by Focus on the Family, that stated “Men become men by doing the ‘things that men do**,’** including… engaging in physical activities, creating, working to prevail, leading, and relating to other men,” and that “… for boys who fail to properly internalize masculinity ‘struggles with identity and sexuality will almost always follow.’”

Both the pages above refer parents to Focus on the Family’s “Christian Counseling Network,” which counselors and therapists can join only if they “have personal values matching Focus On The Family’s.” Focus on the Family states repeatedly on its website that children and adults alike will benefit from trying to temper their “same sex attractions” and live according to what they see as God’s universal plan for heterosexual marriage and children. Many of the counselors who belong to the Christian Counseling Network list “teenagers,” “children,” and “homosexual issues” among their specialties.

Google did not respond to a request for comment. The company has [previously asserted](&lt;|url|&gt;) that its algorithmic search** **results reflect the diversity of content on the web, and that results don’t reflect Google’s company position on political or social issues.
> # “I see our entire fight as mainly a tech fight.”

Focus on the Family is using search engine optimization (SEO) strategies to boost its ranking on search sites, and is listed as a client of an SEO firm called Trinet Internet Solutions. “The content we’ve created over the years is designed to help answer or address the most asked questions concerning the topic,” said Paul Batura, VP of communications at Focus on the Family. “As such, the material contains lots of keywords and relevant topics and as a result, will show up high in Google searches.”

Doug Pierce, who runs the Hong Kong-based SEO agency [Cogney,](&lt;|url|&gt;) says the main reason that Focus on the Family ranks highly is because so many other websites link to it, which is known to be a key determinant of Google’s ranking algorithm. Of the top websites that “backlink” to Focus on the Family, Pierce says, two were affiliated websites, two were other Christian groups, and the fifth highest ranking site was actually the *New York Times,* from an article about Vice President Mike Pence’s history on conversion therapy.

“Those first four sites are closely related with Focus on the Family so that’s why they link to them, but the fifth one, the *New York Times*, is interesting because they link to Focus on the Family just in passing reference, not as an editorial endorsement like the other sites that link to them — but nonetheless it still helps Focus on the Family rank better,” says Pierce.

Living Hope Ministries, the group that created the “conversion therapy” app that’s been banned from all platforms, also ranks highly in Google searches, and according to Pierce it’s because of the intense media coverage of their app. “Lots of mainstream media sites mentioned it and linked to [Living Hope Ministries] which only made [Living Hope Ministries] stronger on Google.” Pierce created a list of all the top ranking sites that backlink to Living Hope Ministries, and most of them were news websites that had written stories about the app.

Pierce says there’s an easy way to discuss these issues online and link to these websites without boosting their Google ratings. “There’s a piece of code they can add to their links called “[nofollow](&lt;|url|&gt;)” that would prevent this,” he says. “It’s a really simple one line addition to the code. Basically it’s due to technical ignorance on these mainstream sites that leads to proliferation of scientific ignorance in the search results.”

Google has begun to respond to increasing consumer awareness about the bias and prejudice reflected in its algorithms. When the UCLA researcher Safiya U. Noble [wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2012 about how the top results for “black girl” on Google were fetishistic porn sites, Google [altered its algorithm.](&lt;|url|&gt;)

Yet, in the past, the company[ has also scoffed](&lt;|url|&gt;) at the idea of “search neutrality,” or the idea of prioritizing results solely based on reliability and relevance. And without a specific policy against prioritizing websites with misleading or harmful information, it will be up to users to report dangerous content — shifting responsibility for the safety of the LGBTQ community directly onto users.<|endoftext|>

# The New Breathalyzer for Keto Dieters

## Keyto says it analyzes your breath to tell you how much fat you’re burning. But does it actually work?

![Image: Keyto](<|image|>)*Image: Keyto*

At a glance, the palm-sized breathalyzer could easily be mistaken for a vaping pen. But Keyto, a handheld breath sensor with an accompanying mobile app that [announced its retail launch](&lt;|url|&gt;) earlier this month, isn’t designed for partiers. Instead, it’s a diet-tracking device for disciples of keto, a restrictive low-carb, high-fat diet that drives the dieter’s body into a metabolic state of ketosis, during which the body burns fat for fuel rather than carbohydrates.

Keyto co-founder and CEO Dr. Ray Wu, a former vice president of product management at Weight Watchers, also claims that it’s the most accurate device of its kind on the market.

“It’s a really great mechanism for getting feedback on your food choices,” says Wu. “You breathe into the device and the app will tell you your keto level in real time, seconds later.”

The company, which sells its breath sensors for $99, raised [more than $1 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) and pre-sold 12,000 devices during the Indiegogo campaign it launched in December. Keyto is part of a wave of so-called digital wellness services that have proliferated in recent years, including meditation, ancestry, and fertility apps.

And** **no one is regulating them. Of course, that’s no accident.

“Active FDA oversight would provide little to no public health value while unnecessarily delaying patient access to potentially beneficial technologies,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, then-head of the Food and Drug Administration, wrote in an op-ed on medical app regulation that he [co-authored in JAMA](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year. In other words, Gottlieb believes regulation would slow down and hinder innovation.

In 2016, the FDA codified its hands-off framework in a [guidance it issued on mobile health](&lt;|url|&gt;), which was part of the [21st Century Cures Act](&lt;|url|&gt;), a law intended to speed up the development of innovative medical products.

An FDA official reached by *OneZero *explained that, similar to medical devices, if an app carries a low risk to patients — the digital equivalent of a toothbrush or a Q-tip — the FDA doesn’t get involved. Higher-risk apps — the digital equivalent of a pacemaker — require more oversight.

The impetus is on the company to determine whether their product is of low risk or high risk to consumers, but the FDA offers informal and formal opportunities for companies to get guidance about which bucket they fall into, the official said.

“We talked to expert FDA consultants, at length, who advised that Keyto fits squarely under the FDA General Wellness Policy,” Wu says.

Miscategorizing a high-risk device as low-risk could eventually subject a company to fines, recalls, or other punitive action from the FDA. Still, the agency’s standards mean that wellness products like Keyto remain unregulated in a literal sense, putting a higher burden on consumers to gauge whether they’re safe and effective.
> # “It’s hard to know whether an app is good or bad, unless it makes headlines.”

“There’s no way to regulate or evaluate these apps, other than the user ratings,” says Jody Lyneé Madeira, a professor who teaches torts, law and medicine, and product liability at the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University in Bloomington.

“It’s hard to know whether an app is good or bad, unless it makes headlines,” adds Scott Thiel, director of life sciences at the consulting firm Navigant. At a glance, Thiel says Keyto appears to be ticking all the classic boxes for a wellness app, because it isn’t making any medical claims. As with low-risk medical devices, which are similarly unregulated, the risk of being hurt by a wellness app is slight.

“You don’t hear much about toothbrush and sunglass companies coming under fire by the FDA,” Thiel says.

So, Keyto won’t hurt you. But will it do what it promises?

Wu claims that it’s the most accurate keto breath sensor on the market, and he may be right. Blood and urine keto tests have been available to consumers for years, and studies, including those [conducted long before Keyto was conceived](&lt;|url|&gt;), indicate that breath acetone, which the Keyto device measures, can be a reliable indicator of ketosis.

“In the development stage, we did thousands and thousands of tests and compared Keyto to blood- and pee-based tests,” Wu explains.

Some companies may choose to forgo rigorous studies up front until they’re more established. Thiel says he has clients who develop products and bring them to market under the wellness umbrella to generate cash flow and collect real world evidence. Later, they conduct studies and earn medical device clearance — which was really their plan all along.
> # Breath acetone, which the Keyto device measures, actually can be a reliable indicator of ketosis.

Still, “the accuracy side is like the black hole,” counters Arthur Caplan, the founding director of New York University’s Division of Medical Ethics. “They can claim anything they want, but I would like to see some studies or laboratory results from independent labs.”

“The nature of scientific, peer-reviewed studies is that they take awhile,” Wu says. “We have them in the works.”

But as we know from Elizabeth Holmes’ Theranos debacle, trusting a team of doctors, engineers, and scientists to conduct internal research and development isn’t a substitute for peer-reviewed studies or clinical trials. Independent scientific evaluation has the added benefit of oversight and transparency, and allows for outside experts to critique the science behind why devices and apps work.

When Keyto users blow into the breath sensor, the app spits out their keto level, a number between 1 to 8. “We tell users that at level 5 and above, you are in a state of ketosis,” Wu says. “At these levels, you can expect to see results.”

Similar to other wellness apps, such as the Apple Watch’s activity competitions, Keyto is set up like a game. “People love talking about their Keyto levels,” Wu says. Indeed, a [video on Keyto’s Indiegogo page](&lt;|url|&gt;) depicts pairs of friends using their breathalyzers while cooking together and checking their Keyto mobile apps while ordering food at a restaurant.

While the app may not explicitly encourage users to achieve keto level 8, Madeira worries that consumers might make reaching the top keto level their diet goal. “There might be some people who stay healthiest when they just reach ketosis, at 5,” she explains, noting that athletes, who don’t have much fat to begin with, harness energy from carbohydrates more efficiently than they do from fat.

Madeira suggested that Keyto could avoid liability problems by having an expert design a scientifically validated test to determine whether the keto diet is right for potential users. That test could weed out athletes or people with disordered eating patterns, and guide users as to “whether they should blow an 8 or whether they should be content with a 5,” Madeira says.

Wu says it’s an idea he’d be willing to consider in the future.

But despite the proliferation of wellness devices and apps like Keyto, Caplan doesn’t think that nutritionists or doctors are likely to begin recommending them to patients anytime soon.

“In terms of technology, I think a scale is your number-one purchase,” he says.<|endoftext|>

# Meet the YouTube Community Dedicated to Reviewing Fake Swag from China

## Teens are flocking to the ‘Amazon of China’ for knockoff sneakers

![Illustration: [Seth Thompson](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Seth Thompson](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Sneakers of comically hefty proportions are having a moment, and Balenciaga’s Triple S is, to quote the [streetwear site Highsnobiety](&lt;|url|&gt;), “the king of chunky sneakers.” With their wavy detailing and thick soles, [certain models](&lt;|url|&gt;) evoke elaborate desserts: a pavlova, or a pineapple and strawberry sundae from Dairy Queen. Unlike a Dairy Queen treat, though, one pair of Triple S’s can go for $950.

But you don’t have to pay that much to “get the look,” so to speak. It’s easy to find a [pair of sneakers](&lt;|url|&gt;) that closely mimic the Triple S on DHgate, a Chinese online marketplace that sells everything from seeds that grow into blue strawberries to kitchen blowtorches. Labeled “Hot!!2019 Fashion Paris 17FW Triple-S Sneaker Triple S Casual Dad Shoes for Men’s Women Beige Black Ceahp [sic] Sports Designer Shoe Size 36–45,” they cost less than $60, in similar colorways and with the same silhouette as the original. Minus, of course, the Balenciaga logo.

DHgate, which is almost as easy to navigate as Amazon, has become a favorite resource for shoppers looking for “replicas.” Thanks to the site and other similar international e-commerce platforms, it’s easier than ever to get your hands on knockoffs and counterfeits, which means fakes are on the rise: The value of counterfeit high-end consumer goods [reached an estimated $1.2 trillion](&lt;|url|&gt;) globally in 2017.
> # “People think: ‘Oh, you’re buying this because you want people to think you have money.’ But honestly, it was just because of my love of sneakers.”

Legitimate businesses are complaining, and governments are taking notice. This past April, the Trump administration announced its intention to [curb the online sale of fakes](&lt;|url|&gt;), likening the market to the Wild West. The trafficking of counterfeit goods has serious implications: In addition to depriving brands of sales, it [helps fund terrorist organizations](&lt;|url|&gt;), according to Alastair Gray, brand protection manager at Tommy Hilfiger parent company PVH.

For shoppers, though, it means cheap and accessible fashion that looks practically as good as the real thing. That market, in turn, is fueling a digital community of amateur experts dedicated to sourcing quality reproductions and doing the legwork to get the best fakes possible.

On the lively [FashionReps subreddit](&lt;|url|&gt;), community members ask each other to vet the quality of knockoff clothing and accessories before they make a purchase via Chinese sites like AliExpress and Taobao — both owned by the e-commerce giant Alibaba — and DHgate. (Neither DHgate nor Alibaba responded to requests for comment for this story.) Sneakers and streetwear, [massive industries](&lt;|url|&gt;) powered by rabid fandoms, are particularly active. YouTubers have racked up hundreds of thousands of views on replica unboxing videos, in which they detail the buying experience and the product’s flaws, ranging from the obvious (stray glue) to the more nuanced (a shade of blue that’s slightly too purple). One video titled “[Do’s and Don’ts To Wearing Fake Shoes!](&lt;|url|&gt;)” has more than 390,000 views.

YouTuber Midnight Choi, who declined to use her real name, was in high school when the first Yeezys came out, and she fell in love. Stymied by the price tag, she bought a look-alike pair on ebay, but when they arrived in the mail, they were all wrong. Choi scoured the internet for an alternative source and caught wind of DHgate. After vetting her chosen DHgate seller as best she could, she placed an order — and this time, they were spot on.


Now 21, Choi has been reviewing DHgate versions of Adidas Ultraboosts and Yeezy sneakers since 2017, first on Instagram and later on YouTube. Though she has less than 1,500 YouTube subscribers, her most popular video ever, [a review of nine pairs of Adidas replicas](&lt;|url|&gt;), has racked up 97,000 views. Choi studies authentic sneakers online and in real life (some of her friends own Yeezys) in order to get granular about the defects of replicas, which tend to decrease as the price tag goes up.

There are three tiers of replicas, according to Choi: Anything $60 or less guarantees multiple flaws, the $80 to $100 range will usually bring one noticeable flaw, and $150 will buy you a nearly perfect shoe. Replicas can be incredibly precise these days; Bryson Honjo, who resells authentic shoes on his own website, says that unless a fake pair is sitting side by side with the real thing, you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.

Choi sees her replica reviews as a service to consumers like herself, who love sneakers but can’t afford to spend hundreds of dollars on them.
> # “If someone comes up to me and asks if they’re fake, I’ll be honest with them.”

“I didn’t buy it for the hype,” she says of her first pair of replica Yeezys. “That’s what people think: ‘Oh, you’re buying this because you want to make yourself look cool, you’re buying this because you want people to think you have money.’ But honestly, it was just because of my love of sneakers. I love the design, I love the colors… If it was cheap, I’d buy all of it for real.”

Tyler Bachik has a similar story. He got into sneakers in high school, couldn’t afford the models he wanted, and decided to buy a pair of fake Yeezys on DHgate. He started making DHgate review videos about a year ago, after throwing one up on his channel and noticing the audience attention that followed. While Bachik says that replicas are becoming more accurate all the time, to the point where they’ve become increasingly difficult to distinguish from the originals, he’s not a “fake flexer.”


“If someone comes up to me and asks if they’re fake, I’ll be honest with them,” he says.

In Bachik’s experience, the replica community is a close-knit one. They’ll sell to each other, swap stories, and offer advice on purchasing decisions; Bachik even says he’s made friends locally through the online replica world. Choi buys sneakers on behalf of her followers — when, for instance, they don’t have a credit card and can’t convince their parents to use a site like DHgate — and sells them at cost. She’s so ingrained in the community that she now cuts out DHgate out of the deal, buying shoes directly from sellers in China — either factory owners or middlemen themselves — with whom she’s established relationships.
> # She’s so ingrained in the community that she now cuts out DHgate out of the deal, buying shoes directly from sellers in China.

Choi says she’s gotten her share of hate for knockoff video reviews, which, unsurprisingly, don’t have a great reputation in the sneaker world at large. Chris Danforth, Highsnobiety’s footwear editor, says that he understands the impulse to shop on DHGate, but believes that people who have educated themselves about sneakers would be less likely to buy replicas. Authentic sneakers arecultural identifier: For those immersed in the sneaker world, shoes are a status symbol, sure, but they’re also a way of connecting with each other. Websites like [StockX](&lt;|url|&gt;), a reselling platform that authenticates sneakers, cater to [shoppers seeking legitimacy](&lt;|url|&gt;). YouTuber and Instagrammer [Yeezy Busta](&lt;|url|&gt;) has gained a massive following for calling out celebrities and influencers for wearing fake sneakers and streetwear.

Honjo, who lives in Hawaii and started reselling sneakers as a side job because of the state’s high cost of living, says that there’s a definite stigma surrounding replicas. Some people see them as a mockery of the Jordans and Yeezys they love, he says, while others feel that fakes devalue status sneakers by making them seem common. Honjo steers clear of replicas in his own sneaker resale business.

“I have probably had about 100 companies from Asia reach out to me about promoting their replica sneakers but I could never bring myself to accept those partnerships,” he writes in an email. “While I never personally belittle anyone who wears replicas, I also can’t bring myself to endorse the product itself. If I did, I would lose my credibility as a sneaker reseller and no one would buy my products because they would assume its fake.”

Despite the callouts and disparagement, it’s clear that people who buy replicas do consider themselves part of sneaker culture. Some people admit that they buy them as a flex — a way of jockeying for social status — but others admit it’s all they can afford.

And there is a certain artistry and moral code in selling fakes. Choi says she appreciates shoes that come with noticeable enough flaws to protect people from unintentionally buying fakes when they wanted a real pair. That’s one reason why she prefers to review DHgate products — she finds that sellers there aren’t credibly trying to pass off their goods as authentic.

“That’s when I’m like, this is not right,” she says. “Those people worked hard for their money to get the real deal.”<|endoftext|>

# How Apple Missed Its Chance to Fix Credit Cards

## The ‘Everything Card’ could have been the ‘Everyone Card’

![Credit: Michael Short/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Michael Short/Getty Images*

Apple announced a credit card last month. Credit cards are my jam—they’re unique tools in every company’s arsenal to [acquire data](&lt;|url|&gt;), lock in users, and ultimately churn out cash. But despite my affinity for Apple products and most credit cards, the entirety of the Apple Card offering feels stuck in mediocrity. Not because the card itself is bad, but because Apple could have done so much better.

Let’s go through the new features, one by one:

### “You can sign up directly on your iPhone”

American Express, Discover, Chase, Bank of America, and Barclay each have mobile-friendly credit card applications on their website, but sure, it’s a new native application on your iPhone.

### “You don’t have to wait days to get your card. It’s immediately live in Apple Pay, no plastic or metal needed.”

This is nifty, but also not new. You can get instant card numbers right now with:

* The entire American Express suite of cards (e.g., Amex Platinum)

* The Bank of America [co-branded Alaska Airlines card](&lt;|url|&gt;)

* [Capital One Venture Rewards](&lt;|url|&gt;) card and [Capital One Savor Cash](&lt;|url|&gt;) card

* The Citi/AAdvantage [Platinum Select World Elite](&lt;|url|&gt;) Mastercard

It is a step in the right direction for the industry, but I’m not sure the three-five business days we have to wait for some of our new credit cards every few years is really the massive issue many seem to think it is.

### “You can see exactly how much you’ve spent, when it’s due, and your payment scheduling options in our clean, easy-to-use dashboard”

Below are screenshots from Amex, Capital One, and Chase’s mobile apps:

![](<|image|>)

Each of these apps clearly display the total balance (what’s due) and the payment date (when it’s due) on the first screen when you log into their app. Is a slightly cleaner banking display really the cutting-edge design, innovation, and technology we’ve come to expect from Apple? I hope not.

The interest rate slider and bimonthly payment schedules are helpful, absolutely—any dense stack of credit card statements can be intimidating—and are a clear step in the right direction for empowering consumers.

### “If you have a question about your card, you can just text us directly in iMessage and ask questions”

You can [text Chase](&lt;|url|&gt;) directly at 24273. You can [text Bank of America](&lt;|url|&gt;) at 692632. While banks today offer text-first tools for checking your account balance, Apple is the first I’ve seen to integrate customer service into this channel. A gold star for them, I guess. I’m really trying here.

### “We use ML and Apple Maps to accurately tag your purchases with real store names and categories”

This is the first actual cool thing. About half of all [credit card fraud claims](&lt;|url|&gt;) are due to “unrecognized charges”—many of which are actually just people forgetting what they’ve purchased because they don’t recognize how it’s listed on the bill. Mint.com and dozens of other finance trackers have attempted to categorize spending data, but it all sucks.


Apple has a clear opportunity here to differentiate their card from other providers. I’m honestly surprised it didn’t launch a budget tracker alongside its new credit card. If you’re already categorizing the transactions (which is very hard), why not add a “goal” for each category?

### “2% cash back on Apple Pay transactions, 3% back at Apple, 1% back on everything else from the titanium card.”

This is just… fine? Flat cash back on a wide variety of categories, combined with Apple’s privacy-first ethos that disqualifies the sale of any of the spending data to data brokers or other tech companies and incentivizes daily use for every category all means Apple wants to be your “Everything Card.” But if Apple actually wants to be your everything card, why not actually compete with the other everything cards?

* [The Uber Barclaycard](&lt;|url|&gt;) offers 4% back on restaurants, 3% on travel, and 2% on online purchases (including Uber rides). What do you spend money on that doesn’t fall into one of these three categories? It also comes with no annual fee.

* [The Capital One Savor card ](&lt;|url|&gt;)offers 4% back on restaurants, 2% back on grocery stores, and 1% on everything else. The card offers no annual fee for the first year, and $95 a year after that.

* [The Chase Freedom Unlimited](&lt;|url|&gt;) offers 1.5% back on everything, no use of Apple Pay required. The Freedom Unlimited also comes with no annual fee.

Maybe I over-optimize for credit card points. Maybe it’s all a sick, twisted game we credit card churners play, reading through subreddits and blogs to squeeze out an extra percentage back on a $20 dinner. But asking mostly affluent, financially-savvy people to give up their beloved Amex Platinum or Chase Sapphire Reserve for the “best Everything Card” is a tough ask, especially when the perks and social status associated with having an elite credit card [made the *New York Times](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

## It didn’t have to be this way

Apple had the unique opportunity to completely destroy the entire credit card industry, and it looks like it’s about to blow it. Credit cards—and the banking system at large—are inherently racist and regressive, holding back millions of Americans from financial freedom. [African Americans](&lt;|url|&gt;) are given worse credit ratings than white people; [26 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) “credit invisible” U.S. citizens are ignored by banks their entire lives because their parents couldn’t afford to co-sign their first credit card.

Credit cards hide racism in their rewards programs. The credit cards used by the financially privileged—the Amex Platinum, Chase Sapphire Reserve, to name a few—charge higher interchange fees to businesses in order to be able to afford generous cash-back programs for their mostly white users. People who use cash, debit cards, or less-exclusionary credit cards—the least financially privileged among us—cost businesses less money. The interchange fees on these cards can be [as little as 25%](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the more expensive cards (or nothing for cash). When accepting thousands of dollars every day, these interchange fees add up quickly, to the point where businesses are forced to [increase prices for everyone](&lt;|url|&gt;) to support the privilege of the few.

Credit cards are a regressive sales tax on society, fueled by financial illiteracy. Apple had the opportunity to wipe this practice out, offering the same perks—2% cash back, a fancy metal card—to the many millions of financially impoverished people in the United States. Unfortunately, while a number of the Apple Card features, like no late fees, clearer interest payment scheduling, and a competitive cash back rewards program, are certainly are a step in the right direction, not a single second of the 15-minute announcement was dedicated to the process that Goldman Sachs and Apple will use to approve users.

My guess: It’ll be more of the same, with Goldman Sachs excluding users based on credit scores and [opaque algorithms](&lt;|url|&gt;). Apple hasn’t given any indication it’ll play a role in deciding which applicants are approved. Its advertised “low interest rates” are essentially industry standard.


Apple and Goldman Sachs built an Everything Card; 2% cash back on Apple Pay purchases and 1% back on purchases with the card is fine, and you can expect millions will use their Apple Card to charge all their purchases. But even with the resources of the world’s second-most valuable company, Apple didn’t do a great job.

Apple could have built the Everyone Card, democratizing access to the financial privileges of the elite.

Apple could have designed the entire card around a savings and budgeting product designed to educate users about investing for retirement.

Apple could have launched a credit card debt refinancer, bringing everybody’s debt under one roof with a lower interest rate paid off with one straightforward payment every month.

Apple could have offered to support cash and check deposits directly in Apple Wallet, killing the predatory payday loan industry and helping bank the tens of millions among us that don’t qualify for a traditional bank account. [Cash App](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Simple](&lt;|url|&gt;) are already working toward this.

Apple could have announced that any iPhone owner would be eligible for the card, regardless of their credit score, using secured deposits on your Apple Pay as collateral for lines of credit to those society has deemed “unworthy.”

Apple could have broken the regressive tax of credit card rewards, locking everybody into an iPhone for life in the process.

Don’t get me wrong; some of these product decisions are certainly a step in the right direction, but for one of the world’s most valuable companies, it feels like Apple’s attempt fell short at the hands of fear. Fear of what exactly, I don’t know.<|endoftext|>

# Snapchat Has Created the Next Evolution in Photography

## Snapchat Is the Next Evolution in Photography

### The company’s Landmarkers feature seamlessly melds the real and the imagined

![Photo by [Thought Catalog](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Thought Catalog](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Snapchat is back, and it’s doing just fine. That’s the message the company wanted to get across when it held a flashy event on April 4 in Los Angeles, unveiling a ton of new and quirky ideas designed to lure users back to its app.

The presentation could have been mistaken at first for a yellow-tinted Apple event, but the company showed off a bunch of creative new ideas, from an in-app gaming platform to Snap stories coming to outside apps like Tinder. But the standout was a new feature called Landmarkers, which allows you to remix the world around you with augmented reality filters in real time.

![](<|image|>)

If you’re visiting a famous landmark, like the Eiffel Tower, tapping and holding within the camera will reveal special new filters. Tap a filter, and Snapchat will layer another reality on top of it, seamlessly blending the real and virtual worlds together. The demo teased the Eiffel Tower vomiting rainbows, New York’s Flatiron Building covered in 3D pizza, and other psychedelic possibilities like buildings growing eyes and long necks.
> # The camera is now the app.

These new “filters” are driven by the community — any user can invent one using [free software](&lt;|url|&gt;) — allowing creators to make a mark on the physical world by intimately tying it with the digital one. Landmarkers is a genius move, not because it’s weird or perfectly targeted to millennials’ sensibilities — though it is — but because Snapchat wants to redefine the way we think about cameras. The camera is now the app.

My initial reaction to the feature’s demo was one of confusion: Why would Snapchat build this? But that confusion quickly morphed into a realization that I was watching the beginning of the next wave of photography: the intersection between what’s real and what’s invented.


To understand why Landmarkers might change photography, we have to zoom out.

Cameras have always been driven by trends, with the format evolving in time with the march of technological progress. Changes in format — black-and-white film to color, analog to digital — redefined the way users saw the world. As smartphone photography surged and put cameras online, anywhere and everywhere in the world, entire new subgenres of picture-taking emerged, evolving faster than ever before.

When smartphones were in their infancy and offered consistently awful quality, mobile photography was weirder* *within those technological limitations.* *A generation grew up layering on thick filters before sharing photos online. It’s easy to forget that filters were so popular that we [read into their meanings or tied our emotional state to them](&lt;|url|&gt;), and we got excited when Instagram [added new ones](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Today, it’s hard to remember if I used filters because I liked them or if it was just a great way to cover up how terrible those photos really were. The miniaturization of camera sensors and lenses was an incredibly complicated feat that took years to perfect, but when smartphone cameras got about as good as a point-and-shoot, filters began to disappear. Still, they defined mobile photography as a format for years.

As always-on 3G connectivity and better-quality cameras became ubiquitous, the next wave arrived. Stickers, layers, text on images, vertically shot videos, and ephemeral content that self-destroyed after a few hours all became the new normal, even though they were unimaginable just a few years ago. Snapchat pioneered a lot of these ideas, which we now consider a basic component of social media.

Since 2009, Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and other smartphone makers have battled to create the “best” mobile camera every year. We’ve finally reached the inflection point where phone cameras are so good that we’re left to argue over tiny, incremental differences in quality — differences that really don’t matter anymore. What does matter is that billions of people around the world now have incredibly capable cameras in their pockets, and anyone can shoot a great photo with little effort.
> # Landmarkers is a bet that the company can define an entirely new category for experiencing the world from a different perspective — invisible to the naked eye.

Photography, in the way we traditionally think about it, has reached a turning point: It has become exponentially more difficult to squeeze notable technical innovation out of the hardware every year. We can see this in the latest batch of smartphones: [Google focuses on software in its latest Pixel devices](&lt;|url|&gt;) to push its cameras to new heights, with features like night mode and a single-lens portrait option that employs machine learning, not superior lenses, to generate better shots than ever before.

That prompts new questions: What is a photo, anyway? Is using software to create a better photo cheating, or is it a natural evolution of the art?* *The answer, clearly, is that photography has always been fluid and always will be — and that there’s no going back from here.

Which brings us back to Snapchat’s new features. Landmarkers is a bet that people want new ways to use their cameras and that the company can define an entirely new category for experiencing the world from a different perspective — invisible to the naked eye. Ingeniously, Snapchat’s existing interactive selfie filters helped us grow familiar with the idea of combining the real with the virtual; applying them to the world itself is a logical next step in evolution.

![](<|image|>)

Landmarkers uses Snapchat’s vast data set of photos — literally thousands of them are added to public stories of landmarks every day — to build an accurate understanding of the physical world’s dynamic shapes, lighting, and viewpoints. Snap used millions of publicly shared photos from its service to create rich 3D maps of famous buildings, but it’s easy to imagine Landmarkers eventually working on any building or place in the world. All of this makes the feature incredibly difficult for competitors to clone—an important advantage as the company tries to win you back from Instagram.

Augmented reality has long promised similar ideas, but they have never really arrived, because the complexities of location combined with object recognition and spatial tracking is difficult without a lot of data. Access to incredibly precise phone sensors and high-quality photos from every vantage point imaginable was not the expected solution to that problem, but Snapchat was able to quietly build the most powerful understanding of the world around us while we were just sharing photos with friends.

This is the intersection of the raw computing power in your phone, the precision sensors that power makes available, and the sheer ubiquity of mobile photography. Snapchat is well placed to own that format shift entirely and offers a look at where photography goes when we’re not engaged in a race to the bottom for the best camera specifications. We start looking beyond the format’s rules entirely for the first time, toward something radically different.

Snap has struggled to build a convincing case for users to come back since it went public and Instagram began to steal its audience, cloning its features one by one. [The company lost users](&lt;|url|&gt;) for the first time in 2019, after years of incredible growth. Snap needs to win them back — and, perhaps more important, the company needs to convince investors it can do so. Landmarkers is a way of proving the company still has it, while building a moat it can finally defend against copycats. Whether or not users pay attention is another question.

Before we know it, though, I suspect we’ll be layering our photos with 3D animated objects that aren’t really there, remixing the buildings around us in psychedelic ways, and blurring the lines between what’s real — or isn’t — even further. And it’ll be completely normal.<|endoftext|>

# Why Adults Need to Stop Complaining About How Kids Use Technology

## Their habits simply mirror ours

![Photo by [Alexander Andrews](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Alexander Andrews](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Doors slam quickly when I return home after picking up my 11- and 14-year-old sons from school. They’re not angry or depressed, but they seem to crave some time alone on weekday afternoons. I guess they need opportunities to be liberated from the social stress of the everyday school routine. And their preferred way to do that is online. I sympathize, but I also can’t help but be annoyed.

Within minutes, I can hear the muffled sound of YouTube videos blasting from my sons’ smartphones. After a while, they transition out of the spectator role, and I cringe hearing them scream into their headsets as they play multiplayer games with friends from school. Their overly enthusiastic conversation mimics the exclamations, trash-talk, and humor they regularly hear from the web’s most popular video-streaming stars. I roll my eyes.

I’m typically sitting at my desk, settled into my comfortable Steelcase swiveling chair, trying to respond to emails and finish the day’s work. But my kids’ pubescent voices are distracting. Their use of slang, idioms, and inside jokes is downright irritating. Also, I’m tired of screaming at them to “watch the profanity.” So, I pull on my Sony WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones and launch [Pzizz,](&lt;|url|&gt;) an app that creates an ambient soundscape, algorithmically engineered to encourage focus and productivity. Sometimes, I just need solitude; I need ways to ignore the children.
> # When kids concentrate on screens for hours at a time, parents worry. But this is precisely what we consider to be good professional behavior.

Almost everything about adolescent gaming culture annoys me. But my kids and I have a lot in common and I see the irony in our parallel habits. First, the consumerism: my chair and headphones — purchased after reading so many online product reviews — are no different than YouTube star PewDiePie’s branded Clutch Throttle Series gaming chair and his cat-ear Razer Kraken headset. Then, there are the many hours they spend each day staring at a screen. I can criticize my kids, but ultimately, their behaviors look a lot like mine. When kids concentrate on screens for hours at a time, parents worry. But this is precisely what we consider to be good professional behavior.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently voted to approve the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), a global standard for diagnosing, reporting, categorizing, and researching health conditions. A lot of media attention has focused on WHO’s decision to include “[gaming disorder](&lt;|url|&gt;)” in the revised manual, and there’s been considerable [coverage](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the ICD-11’s inclusion of work-related “[burnout](&lt;|url|&gt;).” These two classifications are not the only changes made in the new ICD, but they have gotten the most attention. Why? Because they reflect our anxiety, confusion, and misconceptions about the relationship between digital technology, work-life balance, and psychological well-being.

According to the ICD-11, “gaming disorder” is defined as spending so much time playing video games that it “takes precedence over other interests and daily activities.” “Burnout” is what happens when folks are so stressed at work that they experience “feelings of negativism or cynicism” and “reduced professional efficacy.” In other words, gamers spend too much time with screens, while burnouts are so distanced and depleted that they can’t use their screens well. When our kids concentrate on screens, we worry about their health. But in fact, adults exemplify this sort of behavior on a daily basis.

[According to](&lt;|url|&gt;) the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, by 2020, 75% of jobs will require computer use. And some of the most desirable jobs in the U.S. require especially heavy computer use. [*U.S. News and World Report](&lt;|url|&gt;)* listed “software developer” as the #1 Overall Best Job in 2019. Many of the list’s other frontrunners could be characterized as heavy screen time professions: information security analyst, IT manager, statistician, accountant, marketing manager, etc. The ranking is based not only on salary, but also it considers work-life balance, stress level, growth prospects, and other factors related to overall job satisfaction. We are very fond of jobs that require extensive screen time. So, why do we complain so much about our kids’ screen time? Are we trying to preserve our children’s innocence? Is it about protecting them from the indecency of adult labor? Perhaps. But if that’s the case, it represents a strange shift in attitude.
> # Are we dissatisfied with the monotonous busywork of a screen time economy? Or are we perfectly content with the way we’ve designed our professional lives?

Traditionally, we’ve encouraged our children to engage in make-believe work, partially because it prepares them to live well-adjusted professional lives within specific economic and technological contexts. We give kids toy doctor’s kits, cash registers, toolsets, and tractors. Barbie has [held many different careers](&lt;|url|&gt;) over the years, each one appropriate to its specific historical era — she’s been an astronaut (1965), a surgeon (1973), a UNICEF ambassador (1989), an art teacher (2002), a presidential candidate (2004), a TV chef (2008), and more.

Over the course of the 20th century, chemistry sets [became popular](&lt;|url|&gt;) toys, marketed to boys at a time when plastics and atomic energy were poised to transform our economy. The first was Chemcraft, designed by John J. Porter* *in 1914. In a society that celebrated superstar chemists like Louis Pasteur and Otto Hahn instead of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, parents presumably imagined that providing their kids with early, aspirational exposure to innovative new technologies would set their offspring firmly on a trajectory toward lucrative employment and elite social status. In the 1960s, girls [were encouraged](&lt;|url|&gt;) to practice their domestic skills using Suzy Homemaker’s Miniature Appliances or Hasbro’s Easy-bake Ovens. Of course, nowadays most people object to the way toys like these reinforce problematic assumptions about gender and equality, evidence that we recognize imaginative play’s capacity to normalize our children’s expectations and attitudes about how adult life should be lived.

But how do we think adult life should be lived? Often, our actions betray our rhetoric. Grown-ups love to tell kids to spend more time outside, grumbling that no child will ever reminisce about their great summer of sending and receiving text messages. But parents spend more time indoors than children. Sure, we love to post about hiking and outdoor adventures on Instagram, but on average, [Americans spend](&lt;|url|&gt;) about 90% of their time indoors — an amount that seems to have stayed consistent over the past few decades (the time for which we have data).

A great deal of our indoor time is spent at workstations that look just like the desks where my sons play video games and watch YouTube videos (adults tend to remain seated for about [6.4 hours each day](&lt;|url|&gt;)). That’s no accident; offices were intentionally designed to encourage the peak productivity and concentration that we associate with a healthy, well-adjusted, and successful grown-up life. First, Frederick Winslow Taylor famously used a stopwatch to collect precise data about workplace efficiency. Then, Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Larkin Administration Building in 1903, introducing architectural innovations engineered to maximize productivity and reinforce corporate culture. And in the 1960s, Robert Probst invented the “Action Office” — the original “workstation,” intended to provide the autonomy, independence, and privacy necessary to accomplish “knowledge work.” Nikil Saval, author of *Cubed: The Secret History of the Workplace, [*explains](&lt;|url|&gt;) that Probst’s “original cubicle was about liberation.” People needed spaces that kept them separate from their colleagues.

When you walk into almost any office today, you find most employees in a space that looks just like the desk at which my boys engage in digital play. And although many parents complain that our children seem isolated — they think online interaction can’t possibly provide the kind corporeal and effective feedback that promotes positive social skills — remember that grown-ups are constantly expressing their hatred of face-to-face meetings. According to a survey in the [*Harvard Business Journal](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, 71% of senior managers said that “meetings are unproductive and inefficient.” Most of us prefer to get lost in a cocoon of solitude and we’ve designed our adult lives in order to make this possible.

The similarities between my digital behavior and that of my kids are ostensible: Slack is comparable to Discord*. *Most of my meetings now take place on Skype or Zoom*, *and* *I wear a headset, with the webcam making me look just like a YouTuber. In-between long periods of intensely isolated focus, I toggle through my browser tabs, checking social media and hoping to feel the dopamine rush that comes with finding a notification. Then, I read the news for a few minutes to make sure I haven’t missed any good video clips of Donald Trump or Nancy Pelosi: memes for grown-ups. I feel very satisfied with this professional life, and don’t really have any desire or motivation to change my daily routine.

Sure, it sometimes seems like the source of parental screen time anxiety is that we don’t like the way our children mirror our own behaviors — it’s easier to scapegoat video games than to take a long hard look at ourselves. But it’s not really that simple, is it? Because even when we do look at ourselves, we’re confused by what we see. Are we dissatisfied with the monotonous busywork of a screen time economy? Or are we perfectly content with the way we’ve designed our professional lives? Things get even more confusing when parents are told: look at your own relationship with digital technology and think about how to set better examples for your children. But we love our own digital behaviors just as much as we love to hate them.

So maybe, what my boys really need is more screen time — more practice developing strategies to stare at screens all day without experiencing “burnout.”<|endoftext|>

# No One Knows How Dangerous Boeing’s 737 Max Actually Is

## A faulty automated system leaves lingering questions

![](<|image|>)

After a Lion Air 737 Max crashed in Indonesia last October, killing all 189 people aboard, Boeing anticipated that the plane’s flaw would be relatively straightforward to fix. A faulty sensor had caused an automated system to kick in and push the plane’s nose down; the startled flight crew struggled against the system and eventually lost control. Boeing set about rewriting the control-system software, so it wouldn’t misbehave in the same way again, and issued a directive telling pilots how to deal with such situations in the meantime.

When an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max went down less than five months later under similar circumstances, killing all 137 people onboard, it caused a worldwide furor—and ultimately the grounding of the entire 737 Max fleet. But Boeing still stood behind its plane. The assumption was that the Ethiopian Airlines pilots had lacked the skills and training to follow Boeing’s advice. (Much was made of the [pilot’s “panicky” voice](&lt;|url|&gt;) during the incident.) “The 737 Max is a safe airplane that was designed, built, and supported by our skilled employees who approach their work with the utmost integrity,” the company said in a [prepared statement](&lt;|url|&gt;) the day after the crash.

While the twin catastrophes were embarrassing in the short term, Boeing hoped that a few quick tweaks to the faulty automated system would suffice to win back public trust in the plane. These tweaks, however, may not account for the sheer complexity inherent to the software underlying the 737 Max. Lingering problems could slip by regulators and put passengers at risk.

Developments over the last few days have already undermined the notion that Boeing has the problem under control. Ethiopia’s Ministry of Transport released its [preliminary accident report](&lt;|url|&gt;) yesterday showing that, based on analysis of black box data, the pilots in fact had done just as Boeing’s directive had suggested, but to no avail. Ethiopian Airlines issued a [statement](&lt;|url|&gt;) declaring that its pilots “followed the Boeing-recommended and FAA-approved emergency procedures to handle the most difficult emergency situation created on the airplane. Despite their hard work and full compliance with the emergency procedures, it was very unfortunate that they could not recover the airplane from the persistence of nose diving.”
> # Aeronautics experts say that complex control systems like those incorporated into the Max can interact in ways that are difficult to predict.

The fact that Boeing’s advice didn’t work raised questions about whether Boeing really has a firm grasp on the problem. So too did the fact that it had recently pushed back the estimated delivery date on its software patches. Back when the 737 Max fleet was grounded, Boeing said that it would have the control system fixed by the first week of April. On Monday, the FAA [announced](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the company would need several more weeks.

Even that prognosis, however, assumes Boeing finally understands the extent of the 737 Max’s troubles. Aeronautics experts say that complex control systems like those incorporated into the Max can interact in ways that are difficult to predict. “There are so many possibilities you’d have to model,” says Shem Malmquist, a 777 captain who teaches aeronautics at the Florida Institute of Technology. “There are a lot of opportunities for bad outcomes.”

The origin of the problem lies in Boeing’s attempt to create a state-of-the-art airliner by updating the venerable 737, a model that first flew in 1967. In order to maximize the plane’s fuel efficiency, Boeing needed to equip the plane with bigger engines, and to make them fit, it had to mount the engines further forward on the wings. This caused the plane to be dynamically unstable, meaning that under certain conditions—such as might occur during takeoff—the nose would pitch up strongly. To address the problem, Boeing added an automated system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) that would kick in if a sensor detected that the nose was too high.

The system works by engaging a motor to turn a jackscrew in the tail that cranks the movable horizontal part of the tail called the stabilizer. This is normally set so that the plane flies with its nose at a desired angle relative to the horizon, a position called the “trim.” A pilot can then adjust the angle of the nose up or down from its trimmed position by moving the plane’s control yoke, which is connected to a smaller control surface on the back of the stabilizer called an elevator. In the case of the Ethiopian Airlines accident, when MCAS unexpectedly commanded the stabilizer to trim nose-down, the pilots shut the system off, then used the yoke to command an opposite elevator movement to try to get the nose back up. The two control surfaces were essentially at odds with one another, a situation called “mistrim.”

The procedure that Boeing had recommended in the wake of the Lion Air crash, and which the Ethiopian pilots attempted to carry out, was to then manually crank a handle that would return the stabilizer to a neutral position. But former Boeing flight-controls engineer [Peter Lemme](&lt;|url|&gt;) has made the case on his blog that aerodynamic forces on the mistrimmed tail were so strong that it was difficult or impossible for the Ethiopian Airlines flight crew to manually trim the stabilizer. In desperation, they turned the malfunctioning system back on, but it only made the situation worse, putting the plane into a nosedive.
> # Boeing’s lack of awareness about its own lack of awareness raises an inevitable question: What else don’t they know?

The software changes that Boeing is now working on will partially address the system flaws that triggered the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes. For one thing, the updated system will less aggressively trim the horizontal stabilizer down. And, presumably going forward, Boeing will use the newly reported findings to further refine their changes to minimize the chances that the exact same scenarios will unfold in the exact same way ever again.

What Boeing will never be able to erase, however, is the fact that it was taken by surprise not once but twice by previously unknown failure modes. And it insisted all the while that its planes were fundamentally sound.

Boeing’s lack of awareness about its own lack of awareness raises an inevitable question: What else don’t they know? What other failure modes have they failed to anticipate?

Elsewhere, [I’ve faulted the FAA](&lt;|url|&gt;) for gradually shifting responsibility for certification away from government regulators to the manufacturer. But Malmquist says that given the complexity of modern aircraft, there really is no alternative. “When you’re looking at a system that has 30 or 40 million lines of code, there is no way that you can spot-check like a police officer giving traffic tickets,” he says. “The only way a regulator is going to fully understand what’s going on would be to have someone working in the program office five days a week, year-round.”

Of greater concern, Malmquist says, is the fact that the procedures established for certifying airplanes were developed during the many decades when aircraft systems were electromechanical in nature. Such approaches can’t handle the huge number of ways that computerized systems can interact with one another.

And complexity is only going to increase. Aircraft designers are increasingly handing over responsibility to automated systems whose sophistication allows them to perform robustly, but which can also open up all sorts of possibilities for unexpected behavior. In trying to anticipate what problems might arise, engineers are limited by their ability to imagine all the possible outcomes. When designing MCAS, for instance, it seems that Boeing contemplated what would happen if the system stopped working, but didn’t game out all the consequences of it running away.

What can’t be imagined can’t be planned for. Failure modes that engineers don’t consider when designing aircraft aren’t going to be anticipated in flight testing either—or in subsequent crew training. “So you have a triple whammy going on,” Malmquist says, “and there’s no good way to escape.”

The problem isn’t limited to airplanes. As automation continues its breakneck expansion, we’re going to see more and more accidents that take place not because something breaks but because humans and complex machinery react in ways that we didn’t—and maybe can’t—expect. “We’re seeing the same accidents happening across different domains,” Malmquist says, from self-driving cars to the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe. “There are a few differences, but in the end, these accidents are almost identical from a systems-theory point of view.”

In a [statement](&lt;|url|&gt;) made on Thursday after Ethiopia’s release of the preliminary accident report, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg acknowledged that software played some role in the disaster. “As pilots told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment. It’s our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it.”

The sheer complexity of those automated systems, however, makes it unclear whether Boeing or any company knows enough to eliminate the risk. Safety experts have begun developing new approaches better suited to the automated world. So far, unfortunately, their uptake hasn’t matched the rate at which these systems are spreading into every corner of human life.<|endoftext|>

# Your Phone’s Camera Isn’t as Good as You Think

## Software — not a better lens — is where the real innovation is happening

![Photo by [Gift Habeshaw](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Gift Habeshaw](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

At this point, nobody needs to tell you that your smartphone is a pretty great camera. That is, as long as you don’t look too closely at those pixels. Once you zoom in on your phone’s screen, give the photo a crop, or make a large physical print of your favorite shots, things start to get a bit fuzzier. You might notice that images aren’t quite as in focus as you thought, the group shot from the bar last night is actually pretty grainy, or there just isn’t as much detail as you had imagined.

Making your pictures look great on bigger screens isn’t as simple as slapping a “better” camera on the back of your phone. The biggest limitation, according to photographer Jeff Carlson, is that as smartphones continue to get thinner and lighter, fitting a larger sensor and lens into a shrinking frame becomes more difficult. Because the sensor and lenses have to be so small, they aren’t able to capture as much light as, say, a high-end Canon or Nikon DSLR, which means the camera draws in less data. And that erodes the sharpness of your shots.
> # This usually results in a pretty image that looks fine on Instagram, but it still presents problems if you want to view your picture on a larger screen or print.

This won’t change overnight, but photographer Erin Lodi notes that mirrorless cameras like the [Sony α6000](&lt;|url|&gt;) have dramatically decreased sensor size compared to old-school DSLRs.

“Some of these tiny mirrorless cameras and even smaller DSLRs aren’t that* *much bigger than a smartphone,” Lodi tells *OneZero*. “I’m sure they’ll keep getting down further in size.”

Size is only part of the problem. To get around the pesky limits of physics, companies like Apple and Google have started employing algorithms in their camera apps that fill the gaps left by these smaller cameras. Instead of just snapping a single shot when you click the shutter button, most modern smartphones will capture a series of images a few milliseconds apart and stitch parts of them together to construct what the software thinks will be the “best” picture.

This usually results in a pretty image that looks fine on Instagram, but it still presents problems if you want to view your picture on a larger screen or print. When you zoom in on an enlarged image, you’ll notice that the edges of your subject won’t be as clearly defined as with a traditional camera, and the overall image won’t be as crisp. “That’s mostly because those software features are sort of mixing and blending and making guesses about what the final image should be,” Carlson says. “It fudges and tries to do its best, but it’s not going to completely accurately represent what was there, so it fills things in.”

While that fudging will generally give you a more than passable image, Carlson says each frame is usually shot at different exposures to capture different aspects of the scene you’re photographing. That inevitably results in some shortcomings. “Where they blend, it mixes tones so you don’t get this Frankenstein patchwork of these different exposures,” he says.

The final image isn’t perfect, but it is consistent, and most people will be perfectly satisfied with the quality of their pictures. While physics puts a limit on the lenses smartphones can use, the camera’s software is getting better and better, and improvements aren’t showing any sign of slowing down.

“As more data gets fed to the algorithms and the algorithms get better, there will be more options,” Carlson says. “So, when you take a picture, the sensor or server or processor will be able to see what’s in the image, identify them, and know what color and exposure the items should be.”

It’s not only smartphone camera apps that employ this kind of machine learning. Adobe Lightroom’s [Auto Tone](&lt;|url|&gt;) feature performs a similar function on existing photographs. By pulling from its database of anonymously sourced photos, the software is able to identify objects and settings in the photo to determine how to adjust the exposure and tone. Some phones do this by default to some degree, but Carlson expects vast improvements in the coming years.
> # To get the best resolution out of your phone’s camera, opt for shooting panoramas instead of traditional shots.

But you don’t have to wait for smarter smartphone cameras. Photographer Austin Mann, who does an annual [review](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the latest iPhone’s camera, says there are a few things you can do right now to spruce up your photography game.

To get the best resolution out of your phone’s camera, opt for shooting panoramas instead of traditional shots. On the latest iPhone models, panoramas pack a whopping 63 megapixels into each shot, which should be plenty for that landscape photo you want to mount over the fireplace.

That won’t work as well for shots with moving subjects. In those cases, Mann suggests shooting in RAW format, which captures more data than the standard JPEG format. You’ll need a dedicated app for this, like [Manual Camera](&lt;|url|&gt;) for Android or [Halide](&lt;|url|&gt;) for iOS, plus a good understanding of how to manually control a camera’s exposure. Mann also recommends Photoshop’s [resampling feature](&lt;|url|&gt;), which can increase an image’s size and pixels per inch while minimizing the drop in quality.

If all of this isn’t good enough, well, the next upgrade is right around the corner.<|endoftext|>

# Meet the Man Who Wants to Fix Dating With the Blockchain

## Meet the Man Who Wants to Fix Dating With the Blockchain

### *‘We want to take dating and bring it back to being consensual, respectful fun.’*

![Photo by [DESIGNECOLOGIST](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [DESIGNECOLOGIST](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

It’s a general truth that if there’s a social problem in the news, someone will propose a technological solution to it. Enter the UK-based [Consent Tracker](&lt;|url|&gt;), which is seeking beta testers now and promises a “safer dating experience” by enabling users to “[build] consent throughout your date.”

And yes, before you ask — it is built on the blockchain.

Consent Tracker isn’t the first app to promise a technological solution to the problem of sexual assault; [it’s not even the first to use the blockchain to that end](&lt;|url|&gt;). But unlike some of its predecessors, Consent Tracker is not exclusively focused on sex. It encourages users to make use of the app long before they even meet each other. But it’s still shaped by the same assumptions that underlie every other consent app — namely, that digitally logging what we say or do can somehow create a safer, more consensual relationship.

I wanted to know what drives a person to make this sort of app, to ignore years of pushback and other failed attempts, and convince themselves that they’d truly tapped into something innovative. So I reached out to founder Jason Maskell, who was inspired to found Consent Tracker after a late night epiphany about the power blockchain might have to stop sexual assaults that result from online dating.

*This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.*

### **How does Consent Tracker work?**

The whole idea is, you’re on a dating app, or you meet someone in a bar or restaurant or whenever you’re out, and you go, yeah, contact me. That person has to fully verify their ID by uploading an ID that’s checked with a profile picture, so we know they are who they say they are. They can use whatever username they want, but their real name is safely secured in the blockchain for later.

You then say, “Alright, let’s arrange a date.” Both people agree. [The app] will then start creating a smart contract in the blockchain. You can then arrange to meet, have a drink, go out for coffee, whatever you want to do. And by interacting in the app, you start to build up this consent and respectful relationship, so that you actually know you’re both on the same wavelength.

A few weeks ago, I was with one of my friends. We were chatting away and suddenly heard the phone ping. It’s a message from one of the guys she’s met, and she’s like, “Oh, this guy won’t go away. I said to him that I’m not interested and don’t want to go any further. He just won’t take no for an answer, and keeps texting me.” If you’re in a secure app [like Consent Tracker] you can say, “Sorry, I don’t think we’re right for each other, I don’t want to take it any further.” Bang, it’s logged.

Then, if that other person doesn’t accept that, and carries on messaging and messaging and messaging — you can then build up this log where you said no. So if there ever is a problem, you can take this to the authorities, to the police, and show them this log and say, “I said ‘no’ there, and they carried on.” It’s really to make sure that both parties understand that respect is respect — it’s got to be done consensually.

If you are someone who wants to take advantage of someone else, you’re going to think twice about it, because you know that your real name, and all your details are logged securely within the app and can be used when required.

### **How is this different from me having a log of text messages with someone where I tell them to leave me alone?**

Right, well the first thing is you had to give them your phone number. On this app, you’ve got the chat feature in the app — if you don’t feel you want to give your phone number out straight away, you don’t have to. If you said “no” in the app, and they keep pestering you, you can block them. They don’t have your phone number. You don’t have to worry every time your phone pings that someone’s got your real number.
> # “If you are someone who wants to take advantage of someone else, you’re going to think twice about it, because you know your real name, all your details, are logged securely within the app.”

### **How is it different from just chatting on an OkCupid message, or a Tinder message where you can also block someone and don’t have to give out your phone number? What is blockchain bringing to this that a standard messaging app through a dating site doesn’t?**

There have been problems with sites being hacked and information taken out of them and changed before. By putting it into the blockchain, we know it’s secure.

All these other apps, they’re not fully verifying people’s IDs. With us, the idea is that you can be fully verified. It’s to weed out those people that just want to take advantage of someone. If you’ve handed over your ID, you’re going to be a little bit more respectful. You’re not going to be so much of a time waster.

### **You said you were surprised that people thought this was an app about sexual consent. You’re looking to do something different.**

Totally different. If people want to go down that route — that’s fine. There will be [the ability to say], “You want to take it to an intimate level?” But we want to take dating and bring it back to being consensual, respectful fun.

The other thing in the app — we want to have it tracking where you’re going. We have looked at the worst case scenario on both sides, on the male and female side. Say you’re a woman, you’ve met someone for a couple of drinks, and the next thing you know, you wake up in another part of town, in another apartment. You go, “How did I get here?” In your app, you’ve agreed to two drinks, but suddenly, you’ve seen on your tracker that it’s two o’clock in the morning and you’ve been driven around, and you have no memory of it. That’s [information] we can log and give back.

On the male side, there’ve been reports of women accusing men of rape — if everything’s been logged, then they can actually come back and say, [there’s the log]. We’ve seen cases where it’s gone to court, and then the information’s come out when the police have gotten hold of all the phone records, all the text message records, and they found that it’s clearly not rape. There was consent there. We’re trying to bring that in, so both parties will have that level of protection.

### **So, it sounds like you can indicate in the app that you’ve consented to sex.**

If you’re still using the app at that late stage in the date, then yes, there will be an option for that.

### **What if two people are using the app, and they initially say, “We consent to sex.” And they start having sex, and one of the people does something to the other person that was not consented to? If it becomes a nonconsensual experience? The person who was raped is now in a position where someone else says, “Well, you consented, you can’t do anything about it.”**

I appreciate that. That would be a worry of anyone; it’s “he said/she said.” There will be statements [on the app] that say consent can be removed at any time, you agree to this, no means no. It’s not saying you agree to have sex and you can do whatever you want. You initially agree to it, but that can be removed at any time by either party.

### **And how would that be removed?**

If people say they want to remove it in the app, they can go in and say, “I’ve now said no,” and it pings a message to that person. So, they can create that statement and log it within the app as well.

### **I guess I’m just curious, have you talked to anyone from the sexual assault prevention space when creating this app?**

I’ve talked to people in online dating, I’ve talked with some relationship experts and put the idea over to them, and they deal with lots of people who are having sexual relationship problems… I have discussed this with people within those spaces. When they discussed with me… how we want to layer the procedure of the date, they agree that yes, [the app] can be used as a tool.

This is not an app to control your life and tell you what you do on a date and what you don’t do on a date. This is to be used as a tool to see if a person is the right person for you. It’s to stop the people who want to take advantage of others by making them think twice about loading up their ID.

### **Why do you think loading in your ID would be a deterrent? With online comments, there was the idea that if you use Facebook comments, people will have their real name and then they’ll be better behaved. And that wasn’t the case. There are plenty of people who get sexually assaulted by people they’re married to. I’m just not totally clear on why somebody who wants to commit sexual assault is going to be deterred by the fact that somebody knows who they are.**

If they’re going out purely to pull someone in, they’re going to want as little information [out there] as possible. “My name’s John, I’m from Birmingham” — when they’re clearly not.

It’s to give that extra level of reassurance that we’re trying to do something that will benefit people in the long term, and make people think a little bit more.
> # The other thing in the app — we want to have it tracking where you’re going.

### **You started this by talking about how online dating is connected to sexual assault, but it doesn’t sound like you’ve actually talked to anybody in the sexual assault prevention space to see what they think would actually be useful in terms of reducing rates of sexual assault.**

We’ve got people coming [in] as we’re starting to build the app out — before we go to full beta-testing mode, we have plans to run it through a selection of some of the people we’ve spoken to so far, and some people we haven’t spoken to so far to get their feedback. We really want a semi-working model to see where that goes.

### **There are a lot of misconceptions about what leads to sexual assault, who is most likely to commit sexual assault. There is this idea that it’s all about strangers. But when we look at the data, it’s much more likely that people are being assaulted by people they know, or when they are in a relationship. I’m just not clear on how this works to prevent that. I’m not clear on how this would help anyone.**

Like I said before: This is a tool, and we want people to use it to build consent up and build a more respectful relationship. Hopefully by building something a bit more respectful — where it’s agreed, it’s discussed, it’s opened up a lot more — this will help people realize what is acceptable and what isn’t acceptable.

We can’t control everyone’s life. If you’re using the app, and it’s six months down the line, you’re maybe not using it anymore because you’re in a relationship. And then they assault you — can the app change that? I don’t know, you’re no longer using it. But it’s there to maybe refocus people initially, and hopefully if it’s been refocused on what is respectful, later down the line, those thoughts will still be there.<|endoftext|>

# A Male Birth Control Pill Won’t Change Society

## A Male Birth Control Pill Won’t Change Society

### Science is close to giving us effective male contraceptive, but it won’t matter unless men are willing to use it

![Credit: meltonmedia/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: meltonmedia/Getty Images*

*In I/O, columnist Lux Alptraum explores how technology intersects with sexuality and relationships. I/O will embrace the uncertainty of our future and help us craft a better tomorrow, together.*

For several decades, reversible male contraception has been the cold fusion of sexual health innovation: always 10 years away. But recently, that “10 years” figure has started to seem a little more realistic. Vasalgel, a much-hyped method from the startup Revolution Contraceptives, blocks sperm from leaving the body with an injectable plug that can be dissolved with a second injection and has been working its way toward [human testing](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Other methods, like a topically applied combination of [Nestorone gel and testosterone gel](&lt;|url|&gt;) that reduces sperm production to infertility levels, are already being tested for contraceptive efficacy in human subjects. And in March, an entirely different method — a pill currently known as 11-beta-MNTDC, which functions similar to the Nestorone/testosterone gel combo — passed safety tests conducted at the nonprofit scientific research organization LA BioMed and the University of Washington. That puts a male birth control pill on the path to additional tests that will confirm its viability as a contraceptive and potentially land it on pharmacy shelves within the next decade.

For Christina Wang, MD, lead researcher at LA BioMed, the promise of male contraception — whether it’s 11-beta-MNTDC, Vasalgel, the Nestorone/testosterone gel combo, or some other method entirely — is clear. Once a workable version of male contraception is introduced, it will open the door to a new era of fertility management. Wang envisions a world where heterosexual couples can alternate responsibility for birth control every few years, with the female partner taking a break from her pill as the male partner starts taking his. It would be a world where anyone — male or female — could enter a sexual relationship feeling fully in control of pregnancy prevention, regardless of how well they know their partner.
> # It’s not enough to simply invent male contraception; we have to be in a place where men are willing to commit to taking a prescription medication to regulate their fertility.

It’s a beautiful vision of a sexually egalitarian world, one where the burden of preventing unwanted pregnancy is more evenly distributed than it is today. But I’m not so sure it’s a reality we’ll be seeing anytime soon.

Although many of us assume that the introduction of a new technology is sufficient on its own to change society, the reality is a bit more complex — particularly when it comes to advancements related to sex and sexual health.

The invention of the birth control pill wasn’t immediately followed by mass adoption. In the years following Enovid’s approval as the first hormonal contraceptive in 1960, the United States saw a sweeping set of legal changes and cultural shifts that made birth control pills a more accessible and appealing option. In 1965, the Supreme Court case *Griswold v. Connecticut* established that married couples had a right to access contraception. Seven years later, *Eisenstadt v. Baird* extended that right to unmarried couples. Though the pill is often credited with sparking the sexual revolution, in many ways, it was the sexual revolution — or at least the relaxing of social mores that enabled it — that led to the increased use of the pill.

Even as legal barriers to contraceptive access have fallen away, social ideas about sex have prevented other advances in sexual health tech from taking hold in society. Internal condoms — also known as female condoms — have been on the market for 26 years, and yet as a result of [restrictive regulation](&lt;|url|&gt;) and social discomfort, they’ve never come close to being competitive with penile condoms. Similarly, the HPV vaccine has been an effective way to prevent cervical cancer for more than a decade, but [vaccination rates are still low](&lt;|url|&gt;) due to distrust of the product and fears that early age vaccination will encourage youth sex.

It’s not enough to simply invent male contraception and bring it to market; we have to be in a place where men are willing, even eager, to commit to regularly taking a prescription medication to regulate their fertility — and where women feel confident and trusting enough to cede responsibility for reproductive management to a partner. Wang believes that we’ve finally reached a place where we, as a society, are ready for male birth control. “It’s changed so much in the past 50 years,” she says. “Men feel responsible for family planning and reproductive health, not only for themselves, but for their female partners.”

Yet Wang’s assessment seems overly optimistic. Despite some significant cultural shifts, pregnancy is [still largely viewed as a uniquely female experience](&lt;|url|&gt;). The responsibilities of being pregnant are assumed to be solely borne by the person who gets pregnant — a worldview that sets up couples to have uneven stakes in pregnancy prevention and uneven levels of motivation when it comes to adhering to their contraception.
> # Technical innovation alone isn’t going to make pregnancy prevention egalitarian.

More disturbingly, [persistent rates of nonconsensual condom removal](&lt;|url|&gt;) suggest that many men don’t prioritize pregnancy prevention to the same degree as their female partners. If men are comfortable eschewing barrier birth control methods even when they know their partner wants to use them, why are we so confident that men will be that much more compliant with a daily pill? And if they aren’t compliant, the burden for regulating fertility will once again be borne by women, despite technological change.

Expanding birth control options is an important mission, and everyone, with every type of body, should have access to a product that enables them to easily control their own fertility without uncomfortable side effects. But technical innovation alone isn’t going to make pregnancy prevention egalitarian.

Until we create a society where the burden of unintended pregnancy is borne equally by all parties, regardless of their anatomy, we’ll never have a society where everyone has the same incentive to comply with a contraceptive regimen. And until we create a society where men feel the same imperative to regulate their fertility that many women do, male contraception is likely to remain a fringe concern — regardless of how many new methods hit the market in the next 10 years.<|endoftext|>

# CRISPR Pioneer Jennifer Doudna on the Future of Disease Detection

## The co-inventor of the groundbreaking gene editing technology talks to OneZero about a world where illness could be diagnosed in minutes

In 2012, scientists Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier published a [seminal study](&lt;|url|&gt;) describing a tool called CRISPR that could be used to make cuts in DNA. Since then, CRISPR research has taken off, and its ability to edit genes has made it a tantalizing approach to treating disease at its root cause. But CRISPR’s other major trait — searching for a particular genetic sequence — could also make it a breakthrough for detecting disease.

Currently, diagnosing infectious diseases relies on outdated testing methods that can take days to render a result. For cancer patients, new tests that decode the genetic makeup of a tumor can help guide treatment, but these diagnostics are expensive and not always covered by insurance. Doudna, a biochemist at the University of California, Berkeley, thinks CRISPR could be a quicker and cheaper way to diagnose a variety of different medical conditions and thus help patients get treated faster. She’s co-founded a biotech startup in San Francisco called Mammoth Biosciences, which is developing portable, paper-based tests that could be used in hospitals, in doctor’s offices, and even at home to instantly provide a readout — it’s akin to a pregnancy test but for diseases like the flu, Ebola, and more.

Doudna spoke with *OneZero *about CRISPR’s promise for disease detection. And in case you missed it, [here’s our story](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Mammoth and its competitor, Sherlock Biosciences of Boston, which also details how CRISPR works.

*This interview has been edited for length and clarity.*

### ***OneZero:* How could CRISPR-based tests change the way medicine is done?**

**Jennifer Doudna: **I think it comes down to having the capacity to get a very quick detection of infectious RNA or DNA molecules or RNA or DNA that is associated with disease. Imagine if it were possible to get a yes or no answer about the presence of those kinds of molecules in a doctor’s office without requiring waiting overnight or longer to understand whether an infectious agent is present. I think this is very exciting because it would reduce the cost of diagnosis, and it would give doctors and patients the ability to react much faster to the presence of disease-causing molecules. Also, in the future, we could imagine a time when one could purchase over-the-counter diagnostics that are able to predict the presence of infectious agents in patient samples. That would give people a much better handle on their own health. They could interact directly with the diagnostic tool without having to go to a doctor or another intermediary.

### **Your company, Mammoth Biosciences, is also developing CRISPR-based tests for cancer. How would those be used?**

Imagine that it would be possible to detect the presence of DNA or RNA molecules that are associated with early tumor development. This is the kind of application of diagnostics that could be very beneficial for people. It could put health monitoring in the hands of patients and not require a direct intermediary to get information about your state of health.
> # I think when there are multiple companies in a space, it can lead to interesting opportunities to develop the technology.

### **Could CRISPR also be used for prenatal genetic testing?**

It’s hard for me to say right now. I think that will boil down to two things. One is the ability of [CRISPR] to be able to detect extremely low levels of molecules associated with birth defects and other kinds of outcomes of pregnancy. The other thing is ensuring that any kind of diagnostic detection of DNA or RNA molecules that are associated with a pregnancy outcome are being carefully monitored and that people could get accurate help in understanding the outcomes of a diagnostic like that. That could potentially lead to very important decisions that need to be made on the part of the parents involved.

### **What kinds of ethical concerns arise when we’re talking about giving people the ability to test themselves at home for diseases or disease risk?**

Clearly, these kinds of tests would need to be monitored carefully and, like any diagnostic, vetted for accuracy and efficiency. Beyond that, if we’re talking about a kit purchased over the counter, there has to be careful thought given to how a person using that kit could get information about the outcome the test so that they could make decisions in a responsible way about their health.

### **How accurate are CRISPR tests right now?**

So far, my experience with CRISPR and its utility for diagnostics is strictly in a laboratory research setting. In principle, there’s an opportunity to detect very low concentrations of molecules in patient samples that could be useful in a point-of-care diagnostic setting.

### **Are you planning any clinical trials to test these diagnostics on real people?**

That will be done by the team at Mammoth Biosciences. One of my goals in founding that company was to provide an organization that would be able to do the sort of testing that will be essential to vet these tools as useful diagnostics.

### **What does the regulatory pathway look like for CRISPR tests?**

Clearly, these sorts of tests need to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The team at Mammoth has been in close discussions with the FDA to ensure that they move these tests forward with an eye toward collecting the kind of data that will be used for FDA approval.

### **Another company, Sherlock Biosciences, is also developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tests. Do you think there’s room for two companies to be in the same space?**

I think when there are multiple companies in a space, it can lead to interesting opportunities to develop the technology. The teams are different, and the way they’re working on these systems is different. I think it will be interesting to see how this develops. I think the opportunities right now for diagnostics are very exciting, and I look forward to seeing how these groups are able to move this field forward.

### **Will CRISPR diagnostics be on the market before CRISPR therapies?**

That’s a great question. It’s very hard to answer. I certainly hope so, because I suspect it will be a number of years before we see approved therapies using CRISPR-Cas for genome editing in the clinic. But it’s always hard to know. I think it will boil down to the effectiveness, the accuracy, and the sensitivity of these kinds of tests.<|endoftext|>

# The Forgotten Risk of Fitness Trackers

## Fitbit launched a new personal fitness tracker for employees and members of health care plans—what are the downsides?

![Photo: Neil Godwin/T3 Magazine/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Neil Godwin/T3 Magazine/Getty*

Fitbit recently launched a new personal fitness tracker that you won’t find in any store. The [Fitbit Inspire](&lt;|url|&gt;) is aimed at the corporate market—companies that want to help their workers maintain a healthy lifestyle and health insurers who understand the bottom-line benefits of members who don’t get sick.

On the surface, it’s a win-win move for Fitbit and their customers. Yet despite the promise of health, wealth, and well-being that the Inspire and similar technologies promise, this could all too easily come at the expense of consumers who find their personal data being misused.

![The new FitBit Inspire. Source: FitBit](<|image|>)*The new FitBit Inspire. Source: FitBit*

The Inspire is part of a growing trend of [businesses](&lt;|url|&gt;), [insurance companies](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [health care providers](&lt;|url|&gt;) using personal health devices to track and monitor employees and members, and even to reward or [penalize](&lt;|url|&gt;) them based on their data. If this sounds creepy, it is. There are benefits users potentially get out of wearing personal fitness devices tied to an employer, insurer, or health care provider, but they may come at the expense of handing over control of your life to someone else.

This may be as seemingly benign as handing out or withholding workplace perks predicated on your personal fitness tracker results. But it can just as easily mean potentially losing your job, or paying hefty medical bills, all on the basis of what a wearable personal fitness tracker says about you.

Law enforcement could even use your data [in criminal prosecutions](&lt;|url|&gt;) by accessing your previous locations and physical state. And you don’t even want to think about how vulnerable you might become if your personal health data was hacked and used to derive information that you’d rather keep private. This is all the more concerning given that Fitbit was hacked [back in 2016](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Despite these potential risks, the use of personal fitness trackers and other internet-connected wearables [continues to grow](&lt;|url|&gt;), in part because consumers are easily seduced by the promise of new tech.
> # It’s increasingly important that consumers ask critical questions about the risks as well as the benefits of the technologies they are being encouraged to embrace.

In spite of how seductive these technologies can be, it’s more important than ever that developers learn how to think about what might go wrong with these products, so that potentially hidden risks are revealed and avoided. These are “[orphan risks](&lt;|url|&gt;)”—risks that don’t seem important or are easily overlooked but can come back to bite.

These risks could be as seemingly obvious as not being aware of emerging regulations or not being plugged into the changing landscape around tech governance. Other risks may be more subtle, such as the risk of users feeling threatened by how their data might be used against them.

Personal fitness trackers certainly have their fair share of orphan risks, and their beneficial and ethical use will ultimately depend on these risks being taken seriously by manufacturers and providers. It will also depend on consumers becoming increasingly savvy about the cons of these devices as well as the pros, as they balance possible benefits against potential downsides.

Yet many consumers seem happy to trust new tech like personal fitness trackers and leave the difficult questions to others. But this leaves end users wide open to being abused by manufacturers and providers. And, ironically for the businesses selling and promoting the use of these devices, trust from consumers can lead to its own orphan risk of public backlash if those users end up feeling exploited. These kinds of risks aren’t a one-way street.

This is where it’s good for manufacturers and providers to listen to and engage with their users early on—before it’s too late to change course. And it’s increasingly important that consumers ask critical questions about the risks as well as the benefits of the technologies they are being encouraged to embrace.

Of course, engaging openly and honestly with consumers comes with its own risks. Consumers may begin to see the reality beyond the hype surrounding the latest tech as they better understand its advantages and limitations. But as a manufacturer or provider, it’s far better to deal with potential pitfalls early on than to simply cross your corporate fingers and hope for the best.

My own work shows that creative media like science fiction films can be [surprisingly effective](&lt;|url|&gt;) in helping make sense of the opportunities and challenges associated with new technologies—as long as they’re accompanied by a trustworthy guide. The reality is there are remarkably few places for consumers to get trustworthy and relevant information on the benefits and risks of technologies that are increasingly affecting their lives. And this is a problem if the ultimate success of technologies like personal fitness trackers depends on informed users.

This brings us back to the Fitbit Inspire. As potential users are offered this device by employers, health insurance providers, and insurers, they need to know about the possible downsides as well as the benefits. How will their personal data be stored and used? Will they be tracked and held accountable for their movements? Will their employment, insurance, or health care depend on device-documented lifestyle choices? And what are the chances of data from their device being used in a court of law?

These and similar questions reflect potential risks that are easy to overlook but could have serious consequences if not addressed. They form part of an increasingly complex risk landscape that sits between the potential benefits of personal fitness trackers and whether benefits will be realized by manufacturers, users, and third parties alike.

The good news is that learning how to navigate this landscape could be a win-win for both Fitbit and their customers. Personal fitness trackers may, if used responsibly, increase wellness and help prevent illness. But unless manufacturers and providers get serious about these risks, and users become aware of them, it’s a technology that could easily do more harm than good.

If companies like Fitbit and their partners are serious about doing good with their technology, they need to dig deep into what it means to [innovate responsibly](&lt;|url|&gt;), to develop and use technologies [in the public interest](&lt;|url|&gt;), and to navigate an [increasingly complex landscape](&lt;|url|&gt;) around risk.

If they do, there’s every chance that the Inspire could live up to its name.<|endoftext|>

# Scientists Are Using CRISPR in Attempts to Restore Vision, Cure Blood Disorders, and More

## New clinical trials are underway to treat human patients with CRISPR, a technique that edits DNA in cells

![Photo: picture alliance/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: picture alliance/Getty Images*

The vast majority of existing medicines only treat symptoms of disease, rather than the root cause of them. But gene-editing technology, which allows scientists to tweak DNA, could lead to outright cures in the not-so-distant future.

At least that’s the promise of CRISPR, a powerful gene-editing tool that could revolutionize medicine. In 2013, scientists published the first study using CRISPR to [cut and paste DNA in living human cells](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a lab. Now, biotech companies are putting that idea to the test in human patients. A handful of clinical trials using CRISPR are in progress in the United States, Europe, and China.

Likened to molecular scissors, CRISPR’s power lays in its ability to snip out errant bits of genetic code, or replace genes altogether. In the first clinical trials, scientists will attempt the former. Swapping out nonworking genes for new ones is a more complicated undertaking, one that will likely take a few more years of lab and animal testing before it’s tried in people.

Companies have been eager to commercialize CRISPR, with a slew of startups springing up over the past six years, including CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, and Intellia Therapeutics. But despite the fervor around CRISPR, these initial human studies demonstrate the abundance of caution with which these companies are approaching gene editing in human beings. They’ll start out treating small numbers of patients. And CRISPR will only be used in the eye, or on cells outside the body at first. That’s to make sure the treatments are safe and won’t wreak havoc on other parts of the genome.

### **Restoring vision**

Genome-editing company Editas Medicine, and pharma partner Allergan, announced in July that they will soon test CRISPR on patients with an inherited form of blindness, called Leber congenital amaurosis 10. People born with this condition have severe vision loss that starts in early childhood, and some of them go completely blind. A mutation in the *CEP290* gene causes their photoreceptors — the light-sensing cells that make vision possible — to deteriorate over time.

Editas’ experimental treatment uses CRISPR to snip out the mutation in the *CEP290* gene. The therapy will be injected into each eye behind the retina. The company thinks this approach will repair the remaining photoreceptors and restore vision.

The trial will be the first so-called in vivo use of CRISPR in humans — meaning the therapy will be injected directly into the body. In a [company press release](&lt;|url|&gt;), Ben Yerxa, CEO of the Foundation Fighting Blindness, called it a “potentially life-changing medicine.”

The eye is a good starting point, since it demands a very small dose. There’s also little risk of the therapy traveling anywhere else in the body. That’s important, because one of the clearest risks of CRISPR is that it could inadvertently make edits in a part of the genome it’s not supposed to — what are known as off-target effects.

Editas had planned to seek permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017 to move ahead with human testing but didn’t do so until 2018. The company cited manufacturing issues as the reason for the delay. Now, the highly anticipated trial is finally [getting underway](&lt;|url|&gt;). Editas and Allergan say they are enrolling 18 patients from age three to adulthood in the initial trial.
> # CRISPR will only be used in the eye, or on cells outside the body at first. That’s to make sure the treatments are safe and won’t wreak havoc on other parts of the genome.

### **Curing blood disorders**

While the Editas therapy will attempt to directly edit cells in the body, another company is editing cells outside the body in a lab, then putting the modified cells back into patients in hopes of effectively curing them.

CRISPR Therapeutics, which has partnered with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, kicked off its first [human trial in Germany](&lt;|url|&gt;) last August. This trial aims to treat a blood disorder called beta thalassemia. Earlier this year, the company began another trial in the United States to treat sickle cell disease, a related blood disorder. So far, the company has treated one patient in Germany and [one in the United States](&lt;|url|&gt;). About 15,000 people in Europe have beta thalassemia, and an estimated 100,000 in the United States — most of them African American — have sickle cell.

Beta thalassemia patients rely on regular blood transfusions that can be as frequent as every two weeks. In a [July press release](&lt;|url|&gt;), the company says the beta thalassemia patient in Germany hasn’t needed a blood transfusion in the four months since the treatment.

Both diseases can be life-threatening, and both are caused by errors in the gene that makes hemoglobin, a crucial protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Typically, a person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene — one from mom and one from dad — to have symptoms. In beta thalassemia, the body doesn’t make enough hemoglobin. In sickle cell disease, the body makes an abnormal form of hemoglobin that gives red blood cells a sickled shape. These sickled cells stick together and clog blood vessels, which blocks oxygen flow and causes pain episodes.

CRISPR Therapeutics is attempting to treat both diseases in the same way. Everyone is born with a fetal hemoglobin gene that gets shut off after birth. In both clinical trials, scientists are using CRISPR to delete a piece of genetic code, which will turn that fetal gene back on in a person’s blood stem cells. The company’s therapy is similar to a bone marrow transplant — which replaces unhealthy blood stem cells with healthy ones from a donor — with an extra step added. And instead of using stem cells collected from a donor’s bone marrow, scientists at the company are extracting stem cells from a patient’s own bone marrow. They will then edit them with CRISPR in a lab and transplant the modified cells back into the patient. The idea is that the edited stem cells will travel back to the bone marrow, where they will begin to make healthy red blood cells.

“Our goal is to provide patients with a potentially curative treatment option — a dramatic reduction or elimination of symptoms,” says Samarth Kulkarni, CEO of CRISPR Therapeutics. “This could be a one-and-done, but it’s still early days.”

Scientists think this approach will help minimize any potential risks of CRISPR. By editing cells outside the body, they can observe whether the edits were effective before reintroducing those cells into patients.

The [sickle cell study](&lt;|url|&gt;) is recruiting patients in New York, Philadelphia, Houston, Nashville, and Memphis, as well as in Canada, Germany, and Italy.
> # The vision trial will be the first so-called in vivo use of CRISPR in humans — meaning the therapy will be injected directly into the body.

### **Supercharging T cells against cancer**

Philadelphia-based startup Tmunity is testing a CRISPR therapy for certain types of cancer that have recurred. The company is conducting a [clinical trial](&lt;|url|&gt;) at the University of Pennsylvania. In May, the first two patients — one with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, and one with sarcoma, which occurs in the bones and connective tissues — received the Tmunity therapy. No further patients have been treated yet, though there are expected to be up to 18 participants in the trial. The company has yet to provide an update on the conditions of the treated patients.

Tmunity’s approach also uses CRISPR to edit cells outside the body. In this case, scientists are drawing blood from patients and extracting T cells — a type of immune cell — from the samples. They then use CRISPR to remove two genes from the T cells and turn on a third one, essentially supercharging them against cancer. The cells will then be infused back into the patients.

The procedure is similar to CAR T-cell therapy, which involves modifying a patient’s T cells in the lab so that they will attack cancer cells. Two CAR T-cell therapies, Kymriah and Yescarta, are already approved by the FDA, but neither uses CRISPR to modify patients’ T cells.

Tmunity was spun out of Penn by star scientists Carl June and Bruce Levine, who have pioneered CAR T-cell therapy. The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, founded by tech billionaire Sean Parker in 2016, is also funding the study. The trial took more than two years to get off the ground while it addressed concerns posed by the FDA.

CRISPR Therapeutics is also beginning a trial to use the gene-editing tool to treat certain types of cancer. In China, at least a half-dozen trials using CRISPR for cancer are starting or ongoing.

As promising as the CRISPR trials are, it will likely be months or years before we know for sure whether any of these therapies are effective and long-lasting. And before CRISPR can be used more broadly in medicine, scientists will need to do a lot more testing to make sure the gene-editing tool is truly safe.<|endoftext|>

# Buying an Apple Product Will Always Hurt

## Why the best thing Apple can do is confuse the heck out of you

![Illustration: [Richard Chance](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Richard Chance](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Our ancestors knew the pleasure of leaves crunching underfoot. We know the delight of peeling the plastic from a new iPhone.

Eventually, that new-gadget feeling fades. The time comes to buy a newer, better product. For those in Apple’s ecosystem in particular, the process can become a blur of comparison shopping. There are eight modern iPhones to choose from if you count the Plus models and last year’s iPhone X; four Apple Watch options; five iPads; and seven Macs before you even start to adjust their specs.

Though the rate at which people replace their old phones has [slowed](&lt;|url|&gt;), they’re still upgrading within two years on average, and Apple sold more than [216 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) iPhones last year. The dizzying cost-benefit calculation happens all the time.

“It is very hard to know that the ‘best’ is, and this drives maximizers to look at what others have,” says Barry Schwartz, author of *The Paradox of Choice *and a professor of social theory at Swarthmore College.

Those “maximizers” are all about identifying the best of available options, particularly when it comes to products [that say something about the person who owns them](&lt;|url|&gt;) — luxury goods like the iPhone, for example. Schwartz says his research has shown that being confronted with many appealing and comparable choices makes consumers more likely to be dissatisfied with whatever choice they ultimately make.

Enter Apple.

The least expensive iPhone on the company’s site is the 32GB iPhone 7, which costs $449. Of course, the iPhone 7 doesn’t have all of the latest features, like Face ID, a dual-lens camera, or a giant screen — which has become the defacto symbol of the latest and greatest in smartphone technology. The other extreme is the 512GB iPhone XS Max, at $1,449.

Consumers who want something between the least and most expensive models are faced with a ton of confusing options. Do you want to pay $749 for the tricked-out iPhone 8, or just $50 more for the 128GB iPhone XR? Apple plans these options carefully to guide consumer behavior. Consider a [2014 analysis](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the iPhone 6’s storage options: The not-quite-enough 16GB model existed, in part, to drive consumers to a more expensive storage tier the next time they upgraded. Apple’s brand is engineered to be aspirational — by setting price points strategically, the company encourages people to move up to nicer models and spend more money when they decide to upgrade.
> # Apple knows that its customers are willing to play ball, because what we’re all after when we turn to the company is ultimately not the absolute perfect camera to take selfies.

Decisions don’t get any easier when it comes to Apple’s laptops. The latest iteration of the 13” MacBook Air improves on its predecessor with Touch ID, a fancier Retina display, a more powerful processor, and less weight. Is that worth paying $200 more than the older MacBook Air, which also has an arguably superior keyboard design? If you decide it is, maybe you should shrug and cough up $100 more for the powerful 13” MacBook Pro or the 12” MacBook, which, for some reason, is lighter than either of the Air models.

With its pricing structure, Apple creates a pre-purchase crisis of value. Adding or subtracting $100 — not a whole lot, given how expensive these devices are — can drastically transform the options in front of you, though the impact isn’t always clear. For example, this year’s iPhone XS is close to identical to last year’s iPhone X, which you can still buy from mobile carriers. One of the only [technical differences](&lt;|url|&gt;) between the two is the camera’s lens, which has shifted its focal length by [2 millimeters](&lt;|url|&gt;) this year. Is that worth more money, and would you even know how to decide?

“It’s easier to justify the higher price when you are going to use it every day for the next, at least, two years,” says Daniel Ladik, an associate professor at Seton Hall University who focuses on marketing strategy.

Of course, Apple doesn’t do this for sport. Options are a great way to make money — and it’s [better](&lt;|url|&gt;) at that than any other corporation on this planet. Don’t forget: Apple was the first company to ever reach a [$1 trillion valuation](&lt;|url|&gt;).

As Thomas Husson, a market analyst and vice president at Forrester Research, explained to me in an email, part of that valuation is due to Apple’s ability to put a premium on the devices they do sell, leading to an increased overall average selling price, or ASP. Though people have started to hold onto their devices longer, Apple has started to earn more revenue via services like the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple Pay.

“They are pivoting toward a service model, and what matters is high usage among a significant active installed base,” says Husson, who added that the company’s ability to manage prices over a product’s life span also helps Apple keep profits high. For example, the iPhone 7 retailed for $650 when it debuted in 2016, while today it sells for $450. Both prices still offer the company generous returns for a product that reportedly costs [$238](&lt;|url|&gt;) to manufacture.

That initial premium also boosts demand for these luxury products down the line. As analyst Neil Cybart recently explained on his blog [*Above Avalon](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, more and more customers are coming into the Apple ecosystem via “gray market” iPhones — those devices sold refurbished or secondhand.

“As the gray market for refurbished iPhones continues to expand, Apple will face less pressure to come out with lower-priced iPhones with fewer features in developed markets,” writes Cybart. Consider the iPhone 7: The device was marketed as nothing less than miraculous when it originally released in 2016 to justify its $649 asking price, and now you can get one for $250 on eBay. Apple doesn’t have to make a “budget” iPhone, because every new model will eventually sink to an affordable price point.

Customers looking for low-priced iPhones have the gray market to turn to, which is fed by mobile carriers’ and Apple’s own iPhone Upgrade Program. That Upgrade Program allows customers to pay a monthly fee on iPhones rather than one lump sum, and they can exchange their devices for a new one after a year, though it would normally take 24 months to pay the entire thing off. Those exchanged devices aren’t tossed into the garbage: they’re refurbished and resold, essentially giving Apple two bites of the, well, you know.

“While it may seem counterintuitive, a healthy iPhone gray market can boost sales for higher-priced flagship iPhones,” Cybart writes. “As the number of iPhone users take advantage of these upgrade services, Apple sees a growing stream of annual iPhone upgrades,” and the older devices can be resold when they’re returned to Apple.

As Ladik said, the structure plays off on an individual’s desire to have the very best of the options available to them. Do you really need a telephoto lens, and if so, do you need the wider aperture on the iPhone XS compared to the iPhone X? Who can say? It’s only $100 more, so maybe you just pull the trigger.

Apple knows that its customers are willing to play ball, because what we’re all after when we turn to the company is ultimately not the absolute perfect camera to take selfies — you [might](&lt;|url|&gt;) get a Pixel 3 for that — or the optimal processing power to scroll mindlessly through Instagram.

What consumers are after is the feeling that comes with holding that new product in your hand. It’s more than just euphoric superiority, although it is a lot of that. It’s a sense of reassurance, a guarantee that in this ever-advancing world, you’re not getting left behind. Apple has mastered this modern sensation. And it’s going to make you pay dearly for it.<|endoftext|>

# How Cutting-Edge Tech Is Empowering Ancient Archaeology

## Lidar, drones, and more are helping field researchers uncover hidden worlds

![Illustration: [Daniel Zender](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Daniel Zender](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Neal Spencer likes to travel light. Spencer is an archeologist and [keeper of the Egypt and Sudan department](&lt;|url|&gt;) at the British Museum, and he makes regular trips to Sudan in northeast Africa. His current dig is at the site of an ancient walled town occupied by Egypt’s pharaohs from around 1500 to 1070 B.C. For these expeditions, he usually packs trowels and brushes, notebooks, cameras, water filters, laptops, and mosquito nets. Oh, and a lightweight camera drone.

“These days, it’s hard to imagine life without it,” he told me when we spoke recently. “And things are so much better when you can fit everything in your hand baggage.”

The legendary archaeological excavations of the late 19th and early 20th centuries operated on an almost immeasurably bigger scale. When German archeologist [Heinrich Schliemann excavated](&lt;|url|&gt;) the ancient city of Troy, now in northern Turkey, in the 1870s, he employed teams of up to 160 laborers working over three years. These digs were destructive, too. Schliemann himself resorted to using dynamite, and [scholars later accused him](&lt;|url|&gt;) of causing even more damage than the 12th century B.C. Greek invasion.

Where once archeologists excavating ancient ruins had little more than oral texts, haphazard plans, and aerial photographs to guide them, an archeological revolution has been under way over the last 15 years — and technology is almost entirely responsible. When a sprawling [Mayan megalopolis was uncovered](&lt;|url|&gt;) in northern Guatemala in February 2018, archeologists used a low-flying aircraft equipped with a lidar camera (light detection and ranging) that allowed researchers to see through dense jungle canopy. They located some 61,000 ancient structures hidden deep beneath the soil, then plotted them onto a virtual 3D environment. No digging necessary — and definitely no dynamite.

“The tech we’re using has really transformed our way of looking,” Spencer said.
> # On the ground, “remote sensing” technologies such as ground-penetrating radar and magnetometry can peer deep beneath the earth, building up images of ancient subterranean structures.

Drones have been the true game changer. Instead of mounting large-scale survey expeditions and manually plotting sites inch by inch, Spencer and his colleagues can now send up a flying camera and create a three-dimensional digital model on their laptops. These reveal where walls once lay, where wells were dug, where field boundaries were laid down — detailed, granular information that helps target further analysis, all in a matter of hours.

On the ground, “remote sensing” technologies such as [ground-penetrating radar](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [magnetometry](&lt;|url|&gt;) can peer deep beneath the earth, building up images of ancient subterranean structures. Even a consumer SLR camera can be adapted: By swapping its sensor for one with infrared sensitivity, it can detect [the telltale, copper-based pigment](&lt;|url|&gt;) known as Egyptian blue, which is invisible to the naked eye. Long-hidden inscriptions can be revealed.

“That modification cost about £60 [$75],” Spencer explained. “The drone might be £200 [$250]. Archeology is a shoestring operation.”

Borrowing from innovations created for wealthier industries such as oil exploration and medicine, Spencer and his colleagues have passed [ancient mummies through CT scanners](&lt;|url|&gt;), searching for objects buried within wrappings or even hieroglyphic carvings just a few millimeters deep.

By taking ground samples and examining them under polarized light, [a technique known as micromorphology](&lt;|url|&gt;), it is possible to see how water splashed and pooled on a floor thousands of years ago alongside other deposits. Archaeologists can see evidence that a room was a kitchen or that another one was used to house herbivorous animals.

“It looks like a mud floor, but when you analyze it, you see dozens of events,” Spencer said. “We see how space was actually used. It’s very bottom-up; you can draw implications from really tiny things.”

Spencer is particularly excited about another technique called [strontium isotope analysis](&lt;|url|&gt;). Much like carbon dating of organic materials, examining the buildup of strontium in human or animal remains — particularly in teeth — enables archeologists to plot migration patterns. If bodies in a graveyard have a strontium signature markedly different from ambient readings (or those of nearby remains), it likely indicates they originated from elsewhere. A picture of how migration or trade operated in the society in question begins to form.

Even better, many of these techniques are noninvasive, enabling archeologists to scroll back hundreds or thousands of years without disturbing anything in the present. “These days, when we do dig, we know what we’re digging for,” Spencer said. “We’re not digging to find things; we’re digging to find out about things.”

Precision scanning of classic structures has a role for more recent historical work. In 2015, a pioneering architectural historian at Vassar College named Andrew Tallon [made laser scans](&lt;|url|&gt;) of Notre Dame’s interior, accurate to within a millimeter. After the devastating fire that gutted the cathedral in April, those images could now be used to help rebuild it.

Among other firms, the [Oakland-based nonprofit CyArk](&lt;|url|&gt;) specializes in scanning large cultural and historical sites, working on projects as diverse as Angkor Wat, Pompeii, and the Stonewall National Monument in New York City. Using state-of-the-art laser scanners, surveyors create complex 3D “point clouds” — a hyper-accurate digital survey that can pick up every fissure in a wall or subtle indentation on a ceiling.
> # The major issue used to be lack of information — is that shallow barrow a religious site or something else entirely? Now the discipline is drowning in information.

The data can show how a structure is degrading over time or how it was constructed. For medieval or earlier buildings, it’s rare for construction plans to survive (which makes Tallon’s scans of Notre Dame especially valuable). By chance, CyArk happened to scan three of the Buddhist temples at Bagan in Myanmar [shortly before they were hit](&lt;|url|&gt;) by a 6.8-Richter-scale earthquake in August 2016. The data they collected is being used to help restore the 11th and 13th century temples.

If you’re trying to create a rough-and-ready survey, you don’t even need a specialist firm: These days, many archeologists simply download a 3D-scanning app to their smartphones and do it themselves. “It really does change the way we go about what we do,” said Spencer. “Low-cost imaging is the most incredible research tool.”

So what does the future hold for those obsessively trying to document the past? Likely next steps are more sophisticated uses of the rich data that’s now being collected. CyArk has made many of its surveys [freely available online](&lt;|url|&gt;), hoping to build a digital library of historic structures across the world. Spencer is fascinated by the potential of “[virtual autopsies](&lt;|url|&gt;),” a medical technique that combines CT and MRI scanning to provide a forensic, noninvasive analysis of how someone died — even if that someone happened to die several thousand years ago.

Ironically, Spencer pointed out, the danger for archeologists may now be too much data. The major issue used to be lack of information — is that shallow barrow a religious site, a living space, an empty burial pit, or something else entirely? Now the discipline is drowning in information: When every square millimeter of soil can reveal its secrets, it can be hard to know where to stop. Or even where to start. “If you’re not careful, you can get completely flooded,” Spencer said.

“It’s about finding ways to manage that,” he added, with a trace of a sigh. “Not seeing the wood for the trees, that’s the next big problem.”<|endoftext|>

# The Socialist Case for Automating Our Jobs Away

## Let robots do the drudge work. Give workers a basic income.

![Credit: imaginima/E+/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: imaginima/E+/Getty*

For decades, you’ve been told to [fear](&lt;|url|&gt;) automation. Robots are stealing factory jobs; self-checkouts are gutting the service sector; artificial intelligence will replace even the most skilled laborers with whip-smart algorithms. The economy will grow, but you’ll be out of work.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thinks it doesn’t have to be that way. “We should be excited about automation,” Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic Socialist and one of the sponsors of the Green New Deal, [told](&lt;|url|&gt;) an audience at the South by Southwest conference in March. “The reason we’re not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don’t have a job, you are left to die. And that is, at its core, our problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez represents a growing number of socialists bucking the conventional wisdom — crystallized in a [bevy](&lt;|url|&gt;) of new books predicting a robot takeover — that automation should be feared. For these thinkers, sometimes united under the slogan “Fully Automated Luxury Communism,” automation need not kick workers to the curb. In a world where people do not need to work to live, mechanization could actually prove a boon to workers, relieving them from toil, and freeing them up for more satisfying tasks.

But for automation to live up to such promises, it must accompany a transition away from the current model of waged work — a model that squeezes workers out of well-paying jobs, makes work precarious, and condemns the unemployed to poverty, anxiety, and death.

Enter socialism.

Socialist proposals, including a Universal Basic Income (UBI), ultimately aim at replacing the wage system with a more humane economic arrangement geared towards maximizing social well-being instead of profit. Such an arrangement would enlist machines to produce the goods people need, while guaranteeing those without work the means to live decently.

Utopian? Perhaps. But not new. Writing in the 19th century, Karl Marx [observed](&lt;|url|&gt;) that employers tend to replace laborers with machines that work faster and for less. When British manufacturers installed power looms in their factories, workers lost their jobs, and the unemployed masses, desperate for work, dragged down wages for everyone. Those who remained, produced more in less time, earning greater profits for their bosses even as wages slipped. Mechanization simply meant workers spent a greater fraction of their day producing value for someone else. While technology has made U.S. factories [safer](&lt;|url|&gt;) and produced some extremely useful things (like [MRI devices](&lt;|url|&gt;) and iPhones, say), bolting machines to the factory floor has often been a bid to juice profits.

In response, labor has mostly raged against the machines. Two centuries ago, Luddites destroyed mechanical looms to protest automation in the textile industry, fighting to return to factories William Blake called [“Satanic mills.”](&lt;|url|&gt;) And through the 1970s, unions in the U.S., fearing layoffs and [deskilling](&lt;|url|&gt;), made controlling automation a key feature of [collective bargaining agreements](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Marx thought automation could* *be good for workers, but only if laborers were able to take the extra time they were working for bosses and spend it working for themselves. While automation tends to increase exploitation, Marx wrote, “this tendency creates the conditions for labor emancipation by opening the possibility of increased leisure time.”
> # In a world where people do not need to work to live, mechanization could prove a boon to workers, relieving them from toil, and freeing them up for more satisfying tasks.

Some Marxists now see “the possibility of increased leisure time” as the great promise of automation, and the best case for socialism in the U.S. Kathi Weeks argues in [*The Problem with Work](&lt;|url|&gt;)* that automation creates the conditions for a “post-work society” where machines produce basic goods, and anyone whose labor isn’t needed receives a “sufficient, unconditional, and continuous” basic income that frees them up for more fulfilling activities. For Aaron Bastani, and other proponents of [“fully automated luxury communism,”](&lt;|url|&gt;) the post-work society is already here. Even when official unemployment is low, the number of people in low-wage, Uber-type jobs remains persistently high ([a third](&lt;|url|&gt;) of U.S. college grads are underemployed). Let machines do the drudge work, Bastani proposes, and give workers a UBI.

Beyond giving cash to workers, UBI has another advantage: It decouples income from work, limiting bosses’ power to compel people to labor for a wage. The less workers depend on employers to live, the more they can bargain over pay, conditions, and hours. While not “revolutionary,” robust welfare policies, like UBI and universal healthcare, are steps toward socialized production, where people, empowered to work on their own terms, can redirect the economy towards new goals: promoting human health and well-being, building rich social and cultural lives, and guaranteeing environmental sustainability.

There are hang-ups, of course. Not least among them is how workers might make such ambitious proposals a reality. [Strategies](&lt;|url|&gt;) abound, and socialist policies are[ gaining favor](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the U.S. But the best road map for automated socialism remains the simplest: [worker organizing](&lt;|url|&gt;). The more power people have in their workplaces, the more power they have to make automation work for them.

Then there’s the inevitable question: Who will do the work that can’t be automated? “Much of the socially necessary labor consists of reproductive activities,” like caring for the sick and elderly, [writes](&lt;|url|&gt;) Silvia Federici, a Marxist writer and professor emerita at Hofstra University. “This work has proven not to be easily replaced by mechanization.” [Care work](&lt;|url|&gt;) will continue to fall to underpaid women and people of color (nearly [90%](&lt;|url|&gt;) of care workers are women, and their wages are [declining](&lt;|url|&gt;)) until it commands social respect, and compensation, commensurate with its value. For jobs too unpleasant or dangerous to attract volunteers, [Sam Gindin](&lt;|url|&gt;), a labor organizer and researcher, has [proposed](&lt;|url|&gt;) an inverted incentive structure: the worse the job, the more you make.

Fossil fuels, too, pose a problem. Machines require energy, and accelerating automation will require more fossil fuel, barring a rapid transition to renewables. To avoid destroying the planet, socialism cannot accommodate every “automated luxury” of the fossil-fueled world, [according to](&lt;|url|&gt;) eco-socialists like John Bellamy Foster. It will require planners to rethink production altogether, and prioritize decarbonization along with human welfare.

Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg [also back](&lt;|url|&gt;) UBI as a response to automation. But unlike these billionaires, socialists locate the problem not in the rapid clip of technological development, but in the ceaseless hunt for profit, and make the latter their target.

Machines don’t replace workers; bosses do. And bosses don’t just swap workers for machines. Immigrants, women, people of color — and an Uberized workforce made up of all three — have all been enlisted to slash wages, break unions, and make companies more flexible. The social problems arrayed under the banner of automation have less to do with natural laws of technological advancement, and more to do with our economic system’s drive to whip up greater profits by paying less for labor.

Mechanization isn’t inevitable, nor is it driven by technological development in the abstract. The key questions surrounding automation — how, where, why, and for whom it works — are up for people to debate.<|endoftext|>

# The Scariest Thing About DeepNude Wasn’t the Software

## The Scariest Thing About DeepNude Wasn’t the Software

### Though the creator pulled the app, a deeply sexist culture persists

![A screenshot taken on June 28, 2019 of the Twitter account and logo of the DeepNudeApp — an application that allegedly used A.I. to undress women.

At the end of June, [*Motherboard *reported on a new app called DeepNude](&lt;|url|&gt;), which promised — “with a single click” — to transform a clothed photo of any woman into a convincing nude image using machine learning. In the weeks since this report, the app has been [pulled by its creator](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [removed from GitHub](&lt;|url|&gt;), though open source copies have surfaced there in recent days.

Most of the coverage of DeepNude has focused on the specific dangers posed by its technical advances. “DeepNude is an evolution of that technology that is easier to use and faster to create than deepfakes,” wrote Samantha Cole in *Motherboard*’s initial report on the app. “DeepNude also dispenses with the idea that this technology can be used for anything other than claiming ownership over women’s bodies.” With its promise of single-click undressing of any woman, it made it easier than ever to manufacture naked photos — and, by extension, to use those fake nudes to harass, extort, and publicly shame women everywhere.

But even following the app’s removal, there’s a lingering problem with DeepNude that goes beyond its technical advances and ease of use. It’s something older and deeper, something far more intractable — and far harder to erase from the internet — than a piece of open source code.

Fake nudes have a long history. Before DeepNude, there was Photoshop; before the internet, there was *Screw.*

In the 1970s, the porn magazine *Screw* fired shots at feminist Gloria Steinem with a nude drawing of the *Ms. *founder, surrounding her image with penises and encouraging readers to play a game of “Pin the Cock on the Feminist.” Two decades later, *Spy Magazine* undressed then First Lady Hilary Rodham Clinton, [presenting her in bondage gear on the cover of their February 1993 issue](&lt;|url|&gt;). Indeed, DeepNude’s status as merely the latest iteration in a longstanding trend has already been invoked by some of its defenders. “What you can do with DeepNude, you can do very well with Photoshop,” the program’s creator told *Motherboard *in an interview.
> # “Women don’t sit around alone in their bedrooms writing technology that objectifies men”

While technology may aid in the mission of men like DeepNude’s creator, who goes by the name Alberto, the app isn’t actually a project about the potential of machine learning and A.I. Alberto has cited gadgets like supposed X-Ray specs — which he saw ads for in the backs of magazines from the 1960s and 1970s — as the inspiration for DeepNude. The desire made manifest by the app’s code is one that we’ve seen over and over in pop culture, a desire for control over women’s bodies and sexuality, and a willingness to shame women who step out of line by offering their bodies up for public consumption.

Andi Zeisler, co-founder of Bitch Media, was equally affected by those X-Ray spec ads, though in a different way than Alberto. “The idea of the invasion of privacy was just wildly upsetting to me,” she says, noting that it wasn’t just ads in the backs of comic books that conditioned her to expect this treatment. Movies like *M*A*S*H*, *Fame*, and *Revenge of the Nerds* all feature scenes of men spying on women undressing or in the shower without their knowledge or consent. “That was such a trope,” Zeisler says — one that sent the message that women’s bodies are intended for male consumption. Those who resist this “natural” state of affairs are to have their bodies, and their image, wrested from their control by force.

“Women don’t sit around alone in their bedrooms writing technology that objectifies men,” says Adam MacLean, founder of [PostShame](&lt;|url|&gt;) and #PostShame, a social media campaign that encourages aspiring leaders to move past the shame associated with personal indiscretions and sexual behavior in order to focus on fixing the real issues facing our nation. And when men are publicly undressed, it rarely becomes the talking point that women’s naked bodies do. Jennifer Lawrence’s leaked nude photos defined her public image for years; Kanye West’s leaked nudes barely made a blip on the radar. Our society is set up to weaponize women’s sexuality against them — and that, more than A.I. or easy image manipulation, is what makes a program like DeepNude so dangerous.

The scariest thing about DeepNude may not be the software itself: It’s our unwillingness to see DeepNude, and other faked nude images, as the technological vanguard of a larger campaign of harassment and abuse of women. Forcibly undressing women or circulating nudes without consent are broadly recognized as abhorrent, even criminal acts, but the law is less evolved on this kind of emerging A.I. technology.

“The biggest difference with deepfakes [is] about how the laws deal with them,” says Carrie Goldberg, a Brooklyn-based lawyer whose [firm](&lt;|url|&gt;) specializes in providing support to the victims of revenge porn. “Most current revenge porn laws only criminalize the distribution of real images, not fake ones.” Laws that focus on copyright and ownership of one’s image provide limited support to people whose harassment comes courtesy of an entirely manufactured image.

So long as our discussion focuses on who owns the images that are being distributed, or how they were created, rather than the harm they are being used to cause, the abuse and bullying of women will continue: with or without advanced tech and A.I.

Back in January, newly inaugurated Congress member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez found herself mired in a nude photo scandal — not because someone had leaked a private picture, or spent time and energy manufacturing a fake nude, or even took the two seconds to transform a clothed pic into a nude using machine learning and A.I. Ocasio-Cortez made the news because [a naked photo of someone else entirely](&lt;|url|&gt;) had been circulated with her name attached.

To her credit, Ocasio-Cortez refused to be cowed by the photo. Instead, she shifted the conversation from probing questions about her body and her sex life to the abusive nature of circulating naked images, both real and fake, without the subjects’ consent. We should all take inspiration from that response. Because as long as we continue to uphold our society’s toxic beliefs about women and sex, treating women as objects for public consumption whose sexuality simultaneously defines and dehumanizes them, we’ll continue to give power and ammunition to the misogynists eager to shame and humiliate women like Ocasio-Cortez.

Fully recognizing women as complex human beings who are entitled to both privacy and rich, complicated sexual lives — giving women the same sympathy, respect, and understanding we give men — is a far more effective tactic than calls to halt the progress of technology, or whack-a-mole-like attempts to get ahead of the next iteration of DeepNude. Unfortunately, it’s also a strategy that takes a lot more work.

“There has to be an absolute paradigm shift in how we understand women’s roles and how comfortable we are with… any sexuality that does not privilege men at the center,” says Zeisler. “It seems like a much more sci-fi prospect than any kind of technology.”<|endoftext|>

# Why Stellar Research Remains Under the Radar

## The pressure to publish may be averting researchers from pursuing out-of-the-box, groundbreaking science

![Illustration by [Deborah Lee](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration by [Deborah Lee](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

In 1985, Oxford University diabetes researcher David Matthews [published a study](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the journal *Diabetologia *about a computerized mathematical model that could determine blood glucose and insulin levels. For more than two decades, the paper attracted little attention. But something changed in 2008, and in the 11 years since, the paper has been cited more than a thousand times each year, adding up to just under 20,000 citations. That makes Matthews’ study one of the most highly-cited pieces of research published in 1985.

Matthews’ study is what is known as a “sleeping beauty,” a paper that awakens from its dormant state of attracting little to no attention to suddenly become a major body of work. Though the number of such papers was on the increase in medical literature until 1998, they have since remained at a constant level, according to a [recent analysis](&lt;|url|&gt;) of 230 million citations from seven million papers published between 1980 and 2017. The trend holds true when the authors account for the fact that scholarly literature has exploded in the last few decades, with the global scientific output [roughly doubling every nine years](&lt;|url|&gt;).

This is likely due to the fact that scholarly literature has become easier to find due to the rise of open access policies, which require journals to make papers free to read, according to Ton van Raan, a bibliometrician at Leiden University in the Netherlands who co-authored the analysis. But it could also be that researchers are conducting less of the sort of risky, out-of-the-box science that can create such sleeping beauty papers, due to increasing academic pressures to publish more and more research.

“The huge pressure to publish means many researchers often cut corners and fail to do a proper systematic review before starting their research,” says Adrian Barnett, a statistician and metascience researcher at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who was not involved with the new analysis.
> # “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”

Academia’s publish-or-perish culture is often thought to [drive researchers to cut corners ](&lt;|url|&gt;)to produce as many journal papers as possible, which, in turn, can be used to win grant funding and professional advancement. This means scientists often lack the time and incentives to pursue unusual research that may not directly result in journal papers and contribute towards future grant applications.

It’s still unclear why some studies that eventually become so prominent initially go unnoticed. Barnett’s hunch is that many of these studies offer radical ideas which are highly controversial when they are first proposed, but eventually become more widely accepted as old influencers in the field die. As the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Max Planck [once said](&lt;|url|&gt;): “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”

Barnett thinks there are now fewer “princes” in literature, which are new studies that start citing older sleeping beauties to wake up them up from their slumber. “The explosion in papers over time has also made systematic reviews harder to do because, in general, researchers have to do far more work today than 20 years ago in terms of reading and summarizing the previous work,” he says.

The amount of time sleeping beauty papers remained under the radar was considerably longer in the 1980s than it is now, however. The longer a study remains in the literature without being cited, the more unlikely a paper will be frequently cited. In other words, the longer a potential sleeping beauty is asleep, the less likely it will ever be awakened.

In recent years, it has also become more likely that sleeping beauties will be cited in patents, even though they aren’t yet frequently cited by other studies, according to the analysis. “This phenomenon is most probably related to two important developments: the increasing number of patents and the increasing number of patent citations to scientific publications,” van Raan explains.

For Barnett, the analysis highlights the importance of sheer good fortune — beyond quality or originality — in whether a scientist’s work will eventually earn prominence. “Some great papers need that lucky break of being read by someone who really understands their importance and is able to influence the field by commenting on the paper or using it to further their own research,” he says.

Although access to research is becoming easier worldwide, sleeping beauties aren’t going away, argues Qing Ke, who studies complex computer networks at Northeastern University in Boston. “Scientific discoveries can be made before their implications are realized by the scientific community, and such lag could be decades long,” he says. Ke and his colleagues [previously sifted through](&lt;|url|&gt;) 22 million scientific papers to find sleeping beauties, and in the process spotted a now-famous [1935 quantum mechanics paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen that was hiding in plain sight for several years.

Barnett says analyzing sleeping beauties is necessary, since “missing or ignoring important papers can create serious research waste.” Perhaps most importantly, scientists need to move away from judging researchers solely on how many citations their work accumulates. “The more we measure and reward the careers of scientists based on citations,” says Barnett, “the more we introduce luck into our reward systems.”<|endoftext|>

# Sex With Robots Was Never the Point

## Sex With Robots Was Never the Point

### *Why are we so obsessed with screwing machines? Notable sci-fi writers weigh in.*

![Alicia Vikander in “Ex Machina.” © Universal Pictures International](<|image|>)*Alicia Vikander in “Ex Machina.” © Universal Pictures International*

Whenever I mention that I write about sex and technology, I wind up in a conversation about sex robots. Over the past few years, digital assistants like Siri and Alexa have become fixtures in our daily lives, acclimating many of us to the idea of intimacy with a virtual intelligence. And as movies and TV shows like* Her*, *Ex Machina*, and, of course, *Westworld* have explored what an intimate relationship with a robot might look like, it has become easier to believe that it’s only a matter of time until robot sex is de rigueur.

But as commentators eagerly launch into debates about [the ethics of it all](&lt;|url|&gt;), they tend to neglect some important points. For starters, the technology that would make realistic humanoid droid lovers a reality is still out of reach. Perhaps more significant, the sci-fi canon depicting future relationships with robotic lovers was never meant to be taken literally.
> # Stories about sex with robots were “a way to think of women’s rights and what it would mean to have sex with a woman who wasn’t your slave.”

Although recent advances in robotics and A.I. can make digitally enhanced sex feel like a particularly timely topic, the reality is that writers have been exploring what a future filled with nonhuman sex partners might look like for quite some time — well over a century, in fact. In stories like [*R.U.R.](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and [*The Clockwork Man](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, both published in 1923, robots weren’t intended to be literal machines, but rather a metaphor for societal change. Like, for instance, the liberation of women.

In the early days of sci-fi writing, stories about sex with robots were “a way to think of women’s rights and what it would mean to have sex with a woman who wasn’t your slave or your property or wasn’t some kind of possession,” says Annalee Newitz, a science journalist and author of *Autonomous*, explaining that *The Clockwork Man*, the novel that invented the concept of a cyborg, is also deeply concerned with how men might adapt to a world filled with suffragettes. “If you can’t imagine what a liberated woman looks like, you can just imagine a robot” — and use that artificial being as a way to explore what futuristic relationships might look like, she explains.

Society has evolved past those early visions of robot sex — and so, too, have the anxieties and cultural shifts that we’re exploring through stories of tech-augmented sex. “A lot of portrayals that we’re seeing nowadays reflect this deep-seated anxiety and uncertainty about the future,” says Jeph Jacques, creator of the webcomic *Questionable Content*. “When people are worried about what having sex with a robot means for humanity, they’re really worried about what people no longer having jobs means, because it’s all automated.”

“We’re scared that technology is going to make sex less meaningful or less rewarding emotionally or spiritually, that it’s going to take us away from the fundamentals of sex,” says Charlie Jane Anders, author of *City in the Middle of the Night*. She adds that, for some of us, these tropes aren’t a manifestation of our anxieties, but a form of wish fulfillment. “Sex is kinda scary. Everybody is scared we’re not good at it, or that we’re not going to be able to do it at all, or that there will be some negative consequence, like pregnancy or STDs. The idea of removing all of that from the equation is tantalizing,” and stories that replace the human elements of sex with something more predictable, more technological, can offer us a fantasy of sex that feels under our control.
> # “Gender-bending stories are the reason why I knew, in a small town in Alabama growing up, that I was not alone.”

But as we’re panicking over — or eagerly anticipating — the supposedly imminent arrival of sex that feels more mechanical than human, many of us overlook many of the other predictions sci-fi authors have made about sex. Equally as prevalent as these visions of technologically augmented sexual experiences are stories of futures where sex is less monogamous, more queer, and organized in ways that are wildly different than the exclusive heterosexual partnerships that many of us are taught to see as the default. The sci-fi classic *Stranger in a Strange Land* envisions future sex as a polyamorous free-for-all unburdened from the restraints of monogamous marriage. Octavia Butler’s *Lilith’s Brood* imagines humans blending with a race of aliens to form blended families led by three parents. Numerous books (including Joanna Russ’ *The Female Man *and Lois McMaster Bujold’s *Ethan of Athos*) have offered visions of worlds where queerness, rather than heterosexuality, is the default.

Why do these stories fail to dominate mainstream conversation the same way that [male-catering](&lt;|url|&gt;), gadget-heavy sex does?

“I think the gadgets don’t threaten anybody,” says Meg Elison, author of *The Road to Nowhere* series. Stories about sex robots may be a way to work through our anxieties about what the future has in store for us, and they’re a safe way to explore that fear, because these fantasy technologies are firmly lodged in the distant future or explicitly impossible.

But stories that envision a reworking of the social order, a shake-up of what sorts of sex is considered socially acceptable? These narratives truly have the power to shape the future of sex.

“Science fiction was very influential on me understanding that queerness was an option,” says Alex White, author of *A Bad Deal for the Whole Galaxy*. “Gender-bending stories are the reason why I knew, in a small town in Alabama growing up, that I was not alone.”

In their writing, White incorporates queer themes and narratives to help other readers feel similarly seen. And the potential sci-fi has to make people with nonnormative sexualities and gender identities feel seen, understood, and capable of envisioning a future for themselves is far more worthwhile than fantasies about when we’ll all be boning robots. It’s through these stories that sci-fi truly has the power to help us envision — and create — a better future.<|endoftext|>

# Flickr’s Big Change Proves You Can’t Trust Online Services

## Flickr’s Big Change Proves You Can’t Trust Online Services

### *Here’s a scary warning for anyone who puts their photos in the cloud*

![Image: bagotaj/Getty](<|image|>)*Image: bagotaj/Getty*

I need a digital moving van.

I have 60 days to relocate more than 2,100 images from their home on Flickr to another safe digital haven. The once popular photo-sharing destination [announced](&lt;|url|&gt;) this month that it’s limiting free membership accounts to just 1,000 images. If you want unlimited storage, you’ll have to pay $50 a year. Don’t pay up? The service will delete old photographs until you’re at the 1,000-image limit.

I already pay almost $40 a year for iCloud storage and another $99 a year for the 1 Terabyte (TB) of space that comes with my Office 365 account. I’ll skip the extra bill.

Some might call me cheap, but Flickr’s policy change highlights a larger concern for anyone storing their files on someone else’s servers, i.e. the cloud.* *What you understand and trust about their terms of service could change at any time. Free now — looking at you Google Photos — might not mean forever. The uncertainty around the future is reason to reevaluate the services you use in the present.

Two years ago, Flickr’s former parent Yahoo, the once powerful online giant, agreed to a [$5 billion acquisition deal with Verizon](&lt;|url|&gt;). It now lives alongside another online cautionary tale, AOL, which was acquired by Verizon in 2015.

The telecom giant has spent months consolidating and cleaning house, which included quietly selling Flickr to the photo-sharing tchotchke company [SmugMug](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s a testament to how things have changed for Flickr, once the yardstick for all digital image activities. Flickr was how we first understood the meteoric rise of smartphone photography. It was the original Instagram, the place we shared and commented on photos.

Ironically, even as [one of the most popular ](&lt;|url|&gt;)cameras used on Flickr became “iPhone,” Flickr, like much of Yahoo, [failed to ride](&lt;|url|&gt;) the mobile wave. Today, it’s a destination for those who care deeply about the craft of photography, excellent [NASA images](&lt;|url|&gt;), and royalty-free images via [Creative Commons](&lt;|url|&gt;). According to one report, the service still has [90 million monthly active users](&lt;|url|&gt;) across 63 countries.

I joined Flickr 12 years ago and have driven almost a quarter of a million views to the service. Like everyone else, I stopped posting photos on Flickr and shifted my digital photography and art activities to the higher engagement of Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, but that doesn’t mean I don’t care about my existing Flickr images.

Over the years, Flickr had slowly but consistently raised the price of my pro account to the point where it no longer made financial sense for me to continue. But to limit existing free accounts to 1,000 photos isn’t fair. Most of us have built our Photostreams up over the course of years. We’ve invested time and emotion into each image and helped build the still vibrant Flickr community. Our thanks is, “Get your stuff off our digital lawn!” A community-driven service like Flickr should, even as it changes, work to honor its existing community.

At the very least, Flickr should grandfather existing accounts and only apply this rule to new members. Let the non-pro members keep any number of existing photos on the service. If existing Flickr members want to add more images or access any other “Pro” features, then charge them. Asking people to remove thousands of images, especially when not everyone will have a secure place to store them, is wrong. I might even call it “smug.”

Perhaps you’re not on Flickr and figure this isn’t your problem. But viewed from the perspective of data storage on any platform, Flickr’s decision is deeply concerning.

## **Nasty surprise**

I’m confident that almost every person reading this has their data stored on someone’s cloud. Most likely, you use a service owned by Apple or Google. A growing percentage also use Microsoft’s OneDrive. Some consumers store their photos with Amazon.

It’s a smart move: Cloud services are distributed and redundant, which means your data is more protected than if you kept it all on one local hard drive.

But as more of our digital memories move online, we’ve put our histories in the hands of companies that act capriciously or lose control of their own narrative. Facebook has struggled with data breaches and a significant loss of consumer confidence. It’s still massive and unlikely to go anywhere anytime soon, but there is no guarantee of permanence for the service or your data. As Facebook is pressured to change how it makes money — currently, it sells access to our anonymized data to drive ad-targeting — the company may be forced to find new ways to monetize the [2.5 billion people](&lt;|url|&gt;) who use its products.

Companies could very well do as Flickr has done and change the rules of the game by shrinking storage space and raising prices. I know the trend, at least with Apple and Microsoft, has been more space for less money, but how long can that last?

Or let’s say prices don’t rise. What about the other scenario: Going out of business. Perhaps this isn’t a concern for the Four Horsemen — Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon — but it’s certainly possible for smaller services like Flickr.

These are obviously nightmare scenarios. But the specter of updated terms that evict your data, files you perhaps forgot about or neglected but still care about in some vague way, is real. I have 60 days to download, store and, maybe, repost thousands of images from Flickr. It’s a big chunk of data that I don’t know if I can fit in my iCloud, Google Drive, or OneDrive accounts.

I guess I could start paying $9.99 a month to upgrade my iCloud to 2 TB a month. That’ll work, until I fill it up.<|endoftext|>

# What the 1990s Microsoft Case Tells Us About Regulating Big Tech

## Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple are facing increasing government scrutiny over competitive practices. They’ll fight back, but there is precedent to take action.

![Bill Gates at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on March 3, 1998. Photo: Douglas Graham/Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Bill Gates at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on March 3, 1998. Photo: Douglas Graham/Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images*

In 1998, the U.S. Justice Department and attorneys general from 21 states brought an antitrust monopolization lawsuit against Microsoft. At that time, Microsoft controlled how most consumers and businesses worked on their desktop computers. Its Windows operating system provided the connection between all sorts of software and the central processing units of our PCs, and its Office software was critical for the majority of office workers.

The core of the complaint against Microsoft was that it used practices that deliberately strangled an upstart competitor called Netscape, then in its infancy. Netscape’s new “browser” software allowed desktop PC users to access goods, services, and information through the web. In 1995, Bill Gates saw that Netscape posed a challenge to the Windows operating system and predicted an “[internet tidal wave](&lt;|url|&gt;)” of competition that threatened to sideline Microsoft’s products. In response, Microsoft launched its Internet Explorer browser, triggering what became known as the browser wars and eventually attracting the lawsuit that ended Microsoft’s abusive practices and nearly resulted in the company’s breakup.

One might have thought that the suit against Microsoft — without which the success of companies like Google might never have been possible — would have been the beginning of an effort to control the tactics and growth of big tech companies. It was not. In 2011, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the FTC, our other federal antitrust enforcement agency) opened an investigation of Google. But after two years of work, it decided to bring no charges and instead accepted an informal agreement from Google to change some of its practices.

Meanwhile, Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon continued to grow through acquisitions of other companies as well as by expanding their core businesses. By 2017,** **these five companies had become the largest firms in the United States by stock market value. A decade before, only one technology company had been in the top five: Microsoft.

Spurred by increasing public and [governmental concern](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the power these tech firms wield, U.S. enforcement agencies have now decided to pick up the slack. The Justice Department will be responsible for Google and Apple, and the FTC for Facebook and Amazon. In addition, a number of state attorneys general are reportedly looking into whether to bring suit, although in a curious twist, Microsoft does not seem to be a target.

I can’t say definitely that there are good antitrust cases to bring against any of the four companies. But what I can offer are some lessons we learned from the earlier Microsoft litigation.

### **It’s a heavy lift**

Taking on Microsoft consumed substantial enforcement resources. Before the Justice Department filed suit, the FTC investigated Microsoft twice, and commissioners eventually deadlocked on whether to sue. Then the Justice Department stepped in, and its investigation proceeded for five years before a suit was brought in 1998 that featured a number of lengthy settlement negotiations. Microsoft vigorously contested the charges at trial and on appeal; that process consumed another three years, which was relatively quick as these things go. The parties subsequently settled, but the remedy proceedings lasted almost another 10 years.

All in all, the Microsoft case lasted 21 years, finally ending in 2011. Now multiply this effort by four. Ultimately we will be able to judge the seriousness of the government’s investigations by the budgetary resources the Justice Department and the FTC are given to deal with these cases.

### **They can’t do everything**

The enforcement agencies will need to focus their efforts. In the Microsoft case, they could have investigated both Windows and Word. Both were monopoly products, and it was hard to see which one was more critical. At one point, both products were part of the case against Microsoft, but there was a limit to what can be litigated in a single case before a single judge. So the case against Word was dropped.
> # The political pressures that will be brought to bear if the agencies seriously go after any one of these companies — let alone all four of them — will be intense, particularly in today’s hyperpartisan political atmosphere.

Major tech companies often have linked monopoly products — Google Android and Google Maps/Waze, for example — but sprawling cases are hard to manage and understand for both judges and litigators. At some relatively early point, the agencies need to decide what’s most important and what can be jettisoned.

### **The agencies will need political and industry support**

Antitrust litigation against major corporations is not just fought in court. Before the Justice Department filed suit against Microsoft, the department had the support of key political players such as Sen. Orrin Hatch, who held a well-publicized hearing critical of Microsoft. Some of the companies that were victims of Microsoft were willing to come forward and testify; others, like Dell, stayed on Microsoft’s side and made their own efforts to stop enforcers from bringing suit. In the midst of the litigation, Microsoft lobbied Congress to cut the Justice Department’s budget, but the department had enough support to block that effort.

The political pressures that will be brought to bear if the agencies seriously go after any one of these companies — let alone all four of them — [will be intense](&lt;|url|&gt;), particularly in today’s hyperpartisan political atmosphere. They will emphasize First Amendment concerns; national security and trade issues may get involved. The agencies now appear to have some political support for taking action against these companies, and they need to embrace that support.

### **They must play nicely together**

The Microsoft litigation required federal and state enforcers to cooperate. It didn’t always go smoothly and finally broke down at the remedy stage. The agencies will need to do better this time, finding ways to coordinate investigations and assign responsibility.

Recently, though, there seems to be a worrying lack of coordination. Ten states just filed a case to block the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile without waiting for the Justice Department to reach an enforcement decision. And the Justice Department has attempted to intervene in a case that the FTC is litigating against Qualcomm, arguing that the FTC wasn’t paying careful enough attention to the remedy it was seeking. Both actions were unprecedented. It’s concerning that the agencies could end up fighting each other rather than focusing on their investigations.

### **Agencies should worry about the remedy earlier**

The hardest problem in the Microsoft case was not the law — though that wasn’t exactly easy — but the remedy. Although the agencies discussed solutions, a full remedy plan was not put together until after the government won the case. It is wise not to fix on a remedy too early in an investigation because enforcers learn from their investigation. In Microsoft’s case, part of the learning was that the company’s practices were more pervasive than originally thought. But the sooner enforcers can figure out what they want to get out of the litigation, the sooner they can structure the litigation to achieve that goal.

### **Don’t worry about the speed of technological change**

Microsoft at the time of the case seemed to develop new products so quickly that it was challenging for the government to keep up. Observers said Microsoft was operating on “Internet Time” while the government was on “Legal Time,” the implication being that this made it impossible to stop what the company was doing. That turned out to be wrong because although versions came and went, the basic products at issue — operating systems and browsers — are still important today, 20 years later.

In fact, what really makes these tech companies problematic is their durability. Facebook hasn’t been vanquished by a new MySpace; Google hasn’t been replaced by DuckDuckGo; parents are still buying diapers on Amazon even though Diapers.com is long gone. Legal processes can cope.

### **The election is coming**

Looming over the Microsoft litigation was the prospect of a change in the national administration in 2001. Microsoft correctly predicted that if it could delay resolution of the litigation until after the election, the incoming George W. Bush administration would be more friendly than the Clinton administration. The new leadership in the Justice Department eventually accepted a settlement with Microsoft that many criticized as inadequate.

A presidential election will also happen during the investigation or litigation of the current cases, although it is hard to predict how that might affect particular cases against particular companies — nor can we predict whether there will actually be a change of administration. But those managing these cases will have to at least consider how presidential elections will affect their own efforts.

### **It’s better to resist settlements**

If there is one big lesson that emerges from Microsoft it is that we, the public, are better off because government agencies resisted strong pressure to settle the case before litigating it to resolution in the trial court and getting an important legal victory in the court of appeals. There is an important benefit from litigation — it brings the defendant’s practices to light and creates legal precedent.

I view this as one of the most important benefits of the suit against Microsoft because the legal principles the court of appeals applied in its decision have been followed in a number of other lower-profile monopolization cases. It will be tempting to settle any of the current group of cases, often for plausible reasons. But if there are competition problems, the government needs to make the point that we are going to do something serious about them.

There is one more key lesson to be learned: None of these companies is exactly like Microsoft. Each presents particular and challenging problems, and Microsoft can’t possibly provide a complete roadmap to the challenges ahead. There really are new things under the sun — and on the internet.<|endoftext|>

# These Are the 3 Questions About the ‘Game of Thrones’ Finale That Matter

## These Are the 3 Questions About the ‘Game of Thrones’ Finale That Matter

### Despite the show’s happy ending, the future of Westeros is still dark and full of terrors

![Photo: HBO](<|image|>)*Photo: HBO*

Whether you loved or hated the *Game of Thrones* finale, there’s no argument that it was a surprisingly happy ending for a place where, to paraphrase Ramsay Bolton, you shouldn’t expect happy endings. From the army of the dead to the dragon queen, all the major threats to the realm have been vanquished. The monarch is now a quasi-elected position, and no one evil is in charge of anything.

But there are still three major issues the series failed to address, which means things aren’t looking nearly as good for the Seven Kingdoms as the finale would have us believe. These are the questions that are haunting me — and they should be haunting you, too.

## **What was up with the Red God?**

There are a few religions in the *Game of Thrones *universe, although only one should really exist. That’s because [R’hllor, aka the Lord of Light, aka the Red God](&lt;|url|&gt;), the power worshipped by the priestess Melisandre and various peoples of the east, seems to be the only 100% actual deity of in the *Game of Thrones*. We know this because he literally gives his worshippers powers — like resurrecting the dead. He can put prophetic visions in fires for anyone to see, like the Hound, who saw the Wall coming down in the flames of a fireplace [during season seven](&lt;|url|&gt;). And since his priests and priestesses can resurrect nonworshippers, R’hllor seems to have at least some degree of power over everyone on the planet no matter who or what they worship.

Although the Lord of Light had a very clear agenda for defeating the White Walkers, R’hllor is no benevolent god. He was also happy to give Melisandre the power to murder the people Stannis Baratheon wanted dead, either by [shadow baby assassin](&lt;|url|&gt;) or [royal blood–filled voodoo leeches](&lt;|url|&gt;). Melisandre also burned Stannis’ daughter Shireen alive to save his weary, hungry troops [back in season five](&lt;|url|&gt;). It didn’t work — R’hllor is powerful but not omnipotent, apparently — but for the most part, the Lord of Light held up his end of the bargain.

This raises many other questions. Are the Seven worshipped by most people in Westeros real? If so, why couldn’t they be bothered to lift their seven damn fingers to save their followers from the White Walkers? Why would anyone in Westeros continue to worship the Seven when not only is the existence of R’hllor demonstrably true, but he’s also the one who managed to save humanity from becoming ice zombies? And most important, why was the Lord of Light so interested in saving Westeros anyway?

I think the reason he saved all those nonfollowers is because he’s planning to convert them all. By the end of King Bran the Broken’s reign, there could be hundreds of shadow baby assassins running around King’s Landing.

## **What happened to the White Walker baby?**

I don’t think the White Walkers are actually extinct. We know for a fact there was at least one White Walker left up north when the others broke through the Wall and headed south — although I guess he’s technically a White Toddler at this point. (I’ll just call him “[the Ice Ice Baby](&lt;|url|&gt;)” from here on out.) Back in season four, in one of *Game of Thrones*’ creepiest moments, the Night King took the baby Craster the wildling had left out as a sacrifice, carried it to White Walker HQ, placed his finger on it, and [turned it from a regular human into the Ice Ice Baby.](&lt;|url|&gt;)

Now, you might think that when the Night King died and all the other White Walkers he created exploded, the Ice Ice Baby would die, too. (Congratulations, you’ve just imagined a baby exploding. I hope you feel good about yourself.) But that may not be true. Unlike Daenerys’ fallen dragon, which the Night King resurrected for his own nefarious purposes, the baby was transformed while he was still alive. Plus, the Night King created it during some sort of special ritual where the baby was placed on a pedestal in what seemed to be an icy Stonehenge, which just screams powerful White Walker magic juju. I think it’s certainly plausible the Ice Ice Baby’s transformation was special — perhaps special enough for him to avoid the fate of his brethren.

If you’re unconvinced, that’s fine, because this is only a theory. But let me ask you this: Why would the Night King create the Ice Ice Baby when he knew he would be leaving to invade the land of the living? Why make him and not bring him… unless he was meant to serve some other purpose? What could this reason have been other than using the Ice Ice Baby as a fail-safe, a way to make sure a White Walker survived, just in case they were defeated, so they could survive for another Long Night? Guys, I think the Night King saw a problem, and [yo, he solved it](&lt;|url|&gt;). (Now check out the hook while [DJ Hodor revolves it](&lt;|url|&gt;).)

## **Was “the wheel” actually broken?**

Tyrion seems to think so, but as Tyrion accurately points out in the finale, he is very often wrong. (Acknowledging that he was usually wrong was about the only thing Tyrion — once considered “the cleverest man alive” by Sansa Stark — got right from seasons six to eight.) However, a king chosen by an electoral college of Westeros’ various lords and ladies is a step in the right direction. After all, as Tyrion notes, a bloodline has no bearing on whether someone would be a good ruler, which is why Bran’s inability to have children is one of his best selling points.

Over the course of eight seasons, the show gave us plenty of examples of murderers (Ramsay Bolton, Joffrey Baratheon) and morons (Viserys Targaryen, Robyn Arryn) with noble blood who had no business being put in charge of a houseplant, let alone a continent. So electing the best candidate for king based on their merits is a huge improvement, which Tyrion says will break that metaphorical wheel in which horrible rulers crush the poor smallfolk underneath.

But you know what’s still ruled by inheritance instead of merit? Literally everywhere else in Westeros.

It’s all well and good that Bran’s in charge, but eventually some of these various lords and ladies will die, and some of their sons and daughters will gain these titles, and some of them will inevitably turn out to be shitheads. These shitheads will inevitably torment the smallfolk they rule over, just as they always have, because they just don’t care whether poor people live or die. No one broke the damn wheel at all. They just removed one of the spokes.

Eventually one of these shithead nobles — or maybe more — might start thinking that they should be ruling Westeros instead of some magic raven boy, and will start a war over it. It will be a war in which the smallfolk die, either as soldiers or victims, and an elected king won’t change how wars are fought, or who they make suffer. Worse still, an election doesn’t make that king any more immune from being overthrown; if anything, it makes them more vulnerable, because they no longer have royal blood to fall back on. All it would take is one competent shithead to start a rebellion and the wheel will be completely repaired.

## **Bonus: Is Podrick Payne really going to deprive Westeros of his amazing sexual prowess?**

Okay, this probably won’t affect the future of Westeros as much as gods, ice babies, and the unending suffering of the proletariat, but it’s still a bummer for many in the Seven Kingdoms. One of the last reveals of the show was that [Podrick Payne](&lt;|url|&gt;), Brienne’s quiet squire, had not only been knighted but had become a member of the [Kingsguard](&lt;|url|&gt;), the band of elite knights who guard the monarch of Westeros. Like the Night’s Watch, the Kingsguard has draconian rules about what its members can’t do: own land, get married, or father children.

This is a tragedy, because as we learned in season three, Podrick Payne is Westeros’ utmost sex dynamo. In [season three](&lt;|url|&gt;), Tyrion and Bronn took him to a brothel so he could lose his virginity — to three prostitutes, one of whom was a contortionist — and the women were so enraptured by Pod’s lovemaking that [all three returned the money](&lt;|url|&gt;) Tyrion had paid them. Let’s make this very clear: Podrick — a young man with no prior sexual experience — managed to pleasure three presumably very experienced women in a single session of lovemaking with such talent, skill, and who knows what else that they felt they could not in good conscience accept their rightful wages for doing their jobs.

But now his fucks are over, because Lord Commander Ser Brienne is definitely a stickler for the rules, and there’s no way she is going allow members of her Kingsguard to break that particular vow — especially her former squire. It’s heartbreaking to realize that after all that the people of Westeros have suffered, the comfort and relief of the Podrick Payne Sexperience has been denied to them as well.<|endoftext|>

# America’s Favorite Door-Locking App Has a Data Privacy Problem

## Great for landlords. Not so great for you.

![Credit: Latch](<|image|>)*Credit: Latch*

[Latch](&lt;|url|&gt;) is on a mission to digitize the front door, offering apartment entry systems that forgo traditional keys in favor of being able to unlock entries with a smartphone. The company touts convenience — who wants to fiddle with a metal key? — and has a partnership with UPS, so you can get packages delivered inside your lobby without a doorman. But while it may keep homes private and secure, the same can’t be said about tenants’ personal data.

Latch — which has raised [$96 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) in venture capital funding since launching in 2014, including $70 million in its Series B last year — offers three products. Two are entry systems for specific units, and one is for lobbies and other common areas like elevators and garages. The company claims [one in 10](&lt;|url|&gt;) new apartment buildings in the U.S. is being built with its products, with leading real estate developers like Brookfield and Alliance Residential now installing them across the country.

Experts say they’re concerned about the app’s [privacy policy](&lt;|url|&gt;), which allows Latch to collect, store, and share sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) with its partners and, in some cases, landlords. And while Latch is far from the only tech company with questionable data practices, it’s harder for a tenant to decouple from their building’s door than, say, Instagram: If your landlord installs a product like the keyhole-free [Latch R](&lt;|url|&gt;), you’re stuck. The issue of tenant consent is currently coming to a head in New York City, where residents of a Manhattan building are suing their landlord in part over privacy concerns related to the app.
> # “[Latch’s] privacy policy allows some uses I would urge them to reconsider.”

“Smart locks can be a great convenience and even privacy-enhancing for residents by allowing them to change codes when they wish or to allow one-time entry by a service provider, but they need strict privacy design and information governance to ensure they don’t cause more harm than good,” Jules Polonetsky, CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit advocating for principled data practices in support of emerging technologies, tells *OneZero*. “[Latch’s] privacy policy allows some uses I would urge them to reconsider.”

Latch CEO Luke Schoenfelder declined to be interviewed on the record for this article, but in a statement pointed to the fact that the company provides three methods of entry — unlocking through a “door code,” a Bluetooth-smartphone connection, or a physical keycard — as evidence of how it accommodates varying sensitivities to the technology. But he also said in the statement that these different options are “at the discretion of each building’s policy,” so all three methods aren’t guaranteed in every building. And where they are, it’s still difficult to avoid using a smartphone. The door codes are obtained through the Latch smartphone app and keycards require jumping through additional hoops. The Latch website instructs users interested in obtaining one to contact their property manager for their building’s policy on keycards.

In addition to collecting, storing, and sharing information like a user’s age and “profile,” Latch’s privacy policy states the company may receive, store, and process information about users’ location, including general information (e.g. IP address or zip code) and more specific GPS-based information. Latch also captures and stores photos and videos of those who interact with the hardware. The privacy policy gives an example of how the physical systems installed in buildings could record a video clip when a tenant’s guest enters with a code or their smartphone.

And though the privacy policy explicitly states that Latch “may receive, store, and process” a user’s location information, Schoenfelder said in his statement that the app doesn’t actually “capture, store, or use” that info, explaining that some Android devices require GPS to use Bluetooth functionality that Latch relies on. He also said Latch “does not share users’ personal data with third parties for marketing purposes, and we do not make any revenue from data sharing.”

Of course, privacy policies — and a company’s business model — can change, to which Schoenfelder says, “We are currently revising our privacy policy to remove any possible ambiguity and to make our strong record of privacy protection crystal clear.”
> # “[The privacy policy] gives the impression that it’s there to protect privacy, when it really provides broad leeway about what information can be collected and how it can be used.”

The CEO confirmed landlords can see data regarding access events for systems in common areas. This is one of the main grievances raised in the lawsuit currently unfolding in a rent-regulated building in the Hell’s Kitchen area of Manhattan, where tenants say Latch is tracking them as part of a pattern of harassment by the owners to push them out of their apartments so they can rent them at market rate.

“Once I come into the building using Latch, the landlord is immediately notified,” Charlotte Pfahl, one of the five plaintiffs, told the* [New York Post](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

Additionally, if a building is sold, the new owner “may” automatically receive the data collected. The privacy policy doesn’t explain why this data would be transferred, but goes on to say the new owner “may continue to use your user information (including PII).”

Amie Stepanovich, the U.S. policy manager for digital rights organization [Access Now](&lt;|url|&gt;), says the system is “invasive” and that “Latch’s privacy policy fundamentally rejects basic tenets of privacy.”

“The entire system is coercive and carries huge risks for abuse, discrimination, and serious harm, which of course will hurt the most vulnerable populations the most,” she says.

But this is not obvious to tenants. The worrying information about data usage is buried in the company’s 3,000-word privacy policy, which, like many similar tech terms of service, is long, vague, and difficult to read.

“[The privacy policy] gives the impression that it’s there to protect privacy, when it really provides broad leeway about what information can be collected and how it can be used,” Stepanovich says. The policy also explains that while third-party companies are involved, Latch assumes no responsibility for their practices and encourages users to read those third parties’ similarly long, jargon-filled privacy policies. Other than the financial transaction provider, the policy gives no insight into the types of third-party companies that may be involved.

After building an industry on exploitative data practices, tech companies are increasingly coming under fire for how they use customer data — and the lack of transparency around those uses. The issue has been front and center at least since Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress in April 2018, and now the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [announced](&lt;|url|&gt;) it plans to investigate technology companies’ collection and use of consumer data. On a recent earnings call, Facebook [said](&lt;|url|&gt;) it expects to spend between $3 billion and $5 billion to settle the FTC’s ongoing investigation into its handling of user data, which shows how potentially massive such penalties could be. Other tech giants, from [Amazon to Google](&lt;|url|&gt;), are also feeling the heat as [2020 candidates make tech regulation a central policy debate](&lt;|url|&gt;).

“Technology is really great at solving some problems, but its use in certain situations carries intolerably high risks, all of which are exacerbated by the fact that the United States still does not have a comprehensive data privacy law that could provide necessary safeguards for the collection and use of data,” Stepanovich says.

Unlike Facebook, Google, or Amazon services, though, Latch represents an opportunity to look at data privacy through something tangible: the barrier between yourself and your home. By forcing you to sign a privacy agreement to open your front door, Latch helps us see how the [internet of things](&lt;|url|&gt;) has brought bad data policies off-line, normalizing invasive technology. It’s a new perspective on what’s really at stake when we sign that dotted line.<|endoftext|>

# Could A.I. Help Get Homeless Youth Get Off the Streets?

## By identifying patterns in successful rehousing, a research team in L.A. is working to make the housing system more efficient

![Credit: Frederic J. Brown/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Frederic J. Brown/Getty Images*

In Hollywood, nestled between a strip mall and a recording studio where bands like the Rolling Stones have recorded, the residents of a small homeless encampment greet passers by with a friendly “Hi, hello, how are you doing?”

Some people respond in kind; others seem nervous and terse. But according to one of the most outgoing people here, Cedric — who didn’t want to give his last name — they simply hope that if their neighbors see them as friendly and nonthreatening, they won’t call the cops and have their tents removed. [L.A. police and the Bureau of Sanitation](&lt;|url|&gt;) have become increasingly strict about the “cleanup” of homeless encampments, even though most residents here have nowhere to move to.

Los Angeles has the second largest homeless population in the U.S. after New York, with an estimated [52,765 homeless individuals](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2018. The numbers are compiled by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), a city agency that helps get people off the streets — and LAHSA says the number of people experiencing homelessness [for the first time](&lt;|url|&gt;) is increasing.

In an initiative started in January 2018, LAHSA is now sharing data from the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) with researchers at the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society (CAIS) at the University of Southern California. The researchers are using the data to build a system that can identify behaviors and outcomes, and allocate the type of housing with the greatest statistical chance of long-term success, while also reducing racial discrimination in the system. The project — Housing Allocation for Homeless Persons: Fairness, Transparency, and Efficiency in Algorithmic Design — brings together researchers from both the engineering and social work schools.

The project is informed by a 2018 [study](&lt;|url|&gt;) by two CAIS leads — engineering professor Phebe Vayanos and Eric Rice, a professor at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work — which examined the efficiency and fairness of housing allocation programs. They analyzed national data on homeless youth, aggregating information on rapid rehousing (schemes that provide money and moving assistance to get people off the streets quickly) versus permanent housing (long-term accommodation, often with support and subsidies), and looking at whether those young people became homeless again. They then devised a theoretical model to allocate housing more fairly and efficiently across the country, estimating that this system would allow 16% more youth to [successfully exit homelessness](&lt;|url|&gt;) within a year, and reduce the race gap — the percentage of white compared to minority youth who permanently leave the streets — by 72%.
> # “I can’t sleep around a lot of people — I get paranoid. And I’m actually you know, slow — special ed. So it’s hard for me to do the steps or follow-up on my own. But I’m getting better at it.”

In order to make the system transparent and easy to understand for the administrators who allocate housing, the team devised a policy that would assign a score to youth based on characteristics including age, the reason for homelessness, and where they were sleeping. In the L.A. model, Vayanos says the algorithm would assess candidates based on all of these factors, as well as on the statistical likelihood that the allocation will lead to a permanent exit from homelessness.

The team hopes this theoretical model can be expanded into a live, working system for L.A. That could help change the life trajectory for someone like Lulu, who also lives in the small cluster of tents near the recording studio in Hollywood.

Lulu says he’s been homeless since he fell out with his father when he was 15, some two decades ago. He has tried to get housing from the city throughout his youth and adulthood, but found it difficult to go through a process which can include moving between shelters and temporary housing, as well as a lot of paperwork. “I don’t get along with a lot of people,” he says. “I can’t sleep around a lot of people — I get paranoid. And I’m actually you know, slow — special ed. So it’s hard for me to do the steps or follow-up on my own. But I’m getting better at it.”

According to LAHSA data, out of 5,034 youth who received assistance from LAHSA’s [Coordinated Entry System ](&lt;|url|&gt;)in 2018, [only 1,344 ended up in some kind of permanent housing, ](&lt;|url|&gt;)while closer to 2,000 spent time in interim housing. Race is also a factor: A LAHSA study [revealed ](&lt;|url|&gt;)that although housing allocated through the L.A. city system is fairly assigned among different ethnic groups, African Americans were more likely to become homeless again. **T**he study showed 14.2% of black people would be homeless again with a year, compared to 8% of Latinx and 7.2% of white people.

Peter Lynn, the executive director of LAHSA, says that this is down to “American institutional structural racism” which manifests in employment discrimination, housing discrimination, and disproportionate law enforcement towards black people. While he’s supportive of the CAIS project, he cautions that it would need to go through an intensive “community engagement process” before being deployed so that it had the trust and support of the community.

There are other concerns, too, reflected in recent scandals about poorly engineered automated services based on [biased data](&lt;|url|&gt;). From insurance and job applications to school admissions, algorithms are increasingly being used to make decisions that affect people’s lives. So what safeguards can CAIS put in place to make sure that the vulnerable people being assessed by its system are represented fairly?

[HMIS](&lt;|url|&gt;), which provides information technology to agencies like LAHSA, has strict requirements regarding the privacy and consent of its clients. Homeless people are required to give [informed consent](&lt;|url|&gt;) for LAHSA to use their data, and LAHSA operates under an agreement to protect clients’ privacy or have its [access to HMIS suspended](&lt;|url|&gt;). Getting any data on homelessness presents a challenge in itself. Since volunteers have to individually compile data on homeless people one by one, it’s very possible that these counts miss people — possibly [by as much as half](&lt;|url|&gt;), according to some experts.
> # “This algorithm isn’t going to solve homelessness in Los Angeles. Is it going to put a dent? For sure.”

Vayanos says the team is trying its best to create a system that is prepared for the possibility of inaccuracy. “We are actively working on an algorithm that does account for inaccuracies in the predictions and in uncertainty in the arrival times of housing resources and homeless persons in the system,” she says. “We want the system to perform well, even if things turn out to be different than expected — for example, if particular individuals turn out to be less successful than expected when placed in a particular type of housing resource.”

Rice understands that the process to develop the system and win the understanding of the community will take time. A.I.-driven work in the real world must happen at real-world speed, “not at the pace of computer science, which is a much faster moving animal,” he says. Rice has worked on a variety of tools to help the homeless, including an A.I. tool that helps select peer facilitators to [prevent HIV](&lt;|url|&gt;) in homeless youth, and tools that [assess the vulnerability](&lt;|url|&gt;) of homeless youth that are now used nationwide. He knows from experience the long effort could be well worth it.

“This algorithm isn’t going to solve homelessness in Los Angeles,” he says. “Is it going to put a dent? For sure. Because if you think about, if we can improve the efficiency by even 5% or 6% , that translates into hundreds, if not thousands, of people getting housing that’s better for them.”<|endoftext|>

# Microsoft Failed Developers — and Now It Has a Plan to Win Them Back

## Microsoft Failed Developers — and Now It Has a Plan to Win Them Back

### *So long, MacBooks. Hello, Linux!*

![Credit: Sean Gallup/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Sean Gallup/Getty Images*

If you walked into any coffee shop in San Francisco five years ago, you would’ve been hard-pressed to find a single Windows laptop in a sea of glowing Apple logos. The MacBook was the default for startup culture — not just because of its sleek looks, but because the device was so great at web development.

Over the last few years, Microsoft has tried to flip the narrative and win coders back. Last week, its master plan culminated in a major announcement: [Microsoft will include Linux as part of the Windows 10 operating system](&lt;|url|&gt;), starting this summer.

Hell has officially frozen over. This would have seemed impossible just a few years ago — but this is the new Microsoft. Years of hard work to redefine its business may finally pay off as developers are finally able to access a slate of modern tools to do their work on Windows.

The seeds for all of this were planted some time ago. Microsoft has technically included a form of Linux in Windows since 2016, when it announced [a technology called “Bash on Windows”](&lt;|url|&gt;) that makes it possible to run Linux apps, like the popular Node.js server, as if they were on a full Linux computer.

Bash wasn’t quite a full experience, though. It technically “virtualized” software that wasn’t running natively — with quirks that simply wouldn’t appear if you ran the same programs on a Mac.

That should be solved when Microsoft brings the Linux kernel to Windows later this year. Developers will now be able to easily switch from their Mac or Linux computer, because rather than virtualizing the software through a handcrafted layer, Linux will fully exist within Windows. And that might be the key for Microsoft to worm its way back into those coffee shops.

## How Microsoft missed a generation of the web

The problems for Microsoft began when it completely missed a shift in the way people build web apps. Over the last decade, developers around the world have turned to new web development languages like Node.js and Ruby on Rails. As that shift happened, it became increasingly difficult to be a web developer on a PC.

The people behind new coding languages — like David Heinemeier Hansson, who created the popular Ruby on Rails technology — exclusively used Apple’s OS X, which made it difficult, or outright impossible, to develop for those languages on Windows. The issues snowballed as developers moved from Microsoft-created, paid technologies like the SQL Server to free tools like MySQL, which run natively on Linux or macOS. Windows users were, in essence, iced out.

As the world shifted to open-source software, a revolution arrived in the form of hundreds of millions of free, easy-to-install pieces of code available through tools like the [npm package manager](&lt;|url|&gt;). Npm allows JavaScript developers to search a huge library for specific functions — like “sort numbers by date” — and find a drop-in solution that’s already made, solving problems without requiring anyone to write a new line of code.

![*Linux options within Windows. Credit: Microsoft*](<|image|>)**Linux options within Windows. Credit: Microsoft**

Package managers, which are now used [by over 90%](&lt;|url|&gt;) of JavaScript developers according to some estimates, drastically reduce the amount of time and money it takes for developers to implement an idea in code. Alongside the rise of the package managers, front-end development frameworks — like Angular, React, Vue, and others — exploded in popularity, which led to more problems for Windows users.

The tools needed to build and run Node-based web apps, for example, were sometimes only partially functional on Windows, if they worked at all. To get npm and Node running correctly was a complicated task that [drove developers to near insanity](&lt;|url|&gt;). None of the people who created the most relevant development tools did so on a Windows machine.

Complicating this further, while anyone can easily install Windows on a Mac via Boot Camp, Apple doesn’t allow OS X to be installed on any third-party hardware. That meant Windows-based developers were forced to either install open-source Linux operating systems on their machines or use slow, “virtual” servers on top of their existing computer to get work done.

## Turning the tide

While Windows still dominated market share at big companies — and probably your office — it was widely considered a terrible platform for this new wave of web development, and startups refused to use it.

Microsoft, looking for new ways to make money after Windows 10 became a free update, focused heavily on cloud hosting and enterprise with a service called Azure, which allows developers to host servers, or even just their own code, in Microsoft data centers around the world.

The company made another appeal to developers when it revealed an open-source development tool, Visual Studio Code, in 2015. Not only was it incredibly fast and infinitely customizable, it was also* *entirely free. The tool was embraced by surprised developers, and is now the most popular coding app in the world, [with more than 50% of coders using it](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # Microsoft has, in the space of just a few years, completely redefined itself as a company that cares about developers.

Microsoft truly opened the floodgates in 2016. It released Bash on Windows, that first crack at Linux, it [open-sourced the .NET programming language](&lt;|url|&gt;), and it announced that it had [acquired ](&lt;|url|&gt;)the popular cross-platform coding framework Xamarin for millions of dollars. Later, Microsoft [gobbled up](&lt;|url|&gt;) GitHub, the most popular open-source platform, [abandoned](&lt;|url|&gt;) efforts to build its own browser engine in favor of Chrome, and even [open-sourced the Windows calculator](&lt;|url|&gt;). Hey, why not?

All of this is to say that Microsoft has, in the space of just a few years, completely redefined itself as a company that cares about developers. The announcement that it will ship Linux in Windows is the coup de grace, because it’s the component that will bring the entire thing together.

Native Linux on Windows makes it so straightforward for developers to consider switching for the first time that thousands will probably try it again (after writing the operating system off a decade ago). Given that Microsoft has already captured the attention of millions of developers who use tools like Visual Studio Code, it won’t have to do much work to convince them.

The timing couldn’t be more perfect: Apple has recently paid [zero attention](&lt;|url|&gt;) to fostering its developer ecosystem on macOS, focusing instead on getting people to build iOS apps.

Combined with the [ongoing MacBook keyboard disaster](&lt;|url|&gt;), developers are looking beyond the Mac for the first time when they need to buy a new laptop. Windows machines finally look like a viable, even superior option for once.

It’s somewhat ironic that Microsoft may win developers back to Windows by integrating another operating system, Linux, but it’s a smart move: Choice is good. If you’re still skeptical, that’s fair enough given the company’s past. But you can’t deny that Microsoft has, year after year, shown that it’s willing to shed its skin to build something new.

I’m a web developer, too, so when my MacBook Pro keyboard broke, I [switched from macOS to Windows](&lt;|url|&gt;). It was much more difficult to make the move back then, and friends in the industry were skeptical it would work out. I’m still using my PC, and two years in, as Linux finally arrives, I can finally say that my workflow is better here than it would be anywhere else.<|endoftext|>

# The Huawei Disaster Reveals Google’s Iron Grip on Android

## Open source isn’t as open as you think

![Credit: John MacDougall/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: John MacDougall/Getty Images*

Google’s Android is pitched as the open, free-for-everyone alternative to the iPhone. However, to comply with [a recent order from the U.S. government](&lt;|url|&gt;), Google pulled the Chinese tech company and smartphone manufacturer Huawei’s license to use the proprietary Google software that sits on top of Android. In doing so, Google quietly exposed the powerful control it has over its supposedly open phone ecosystem.

Most Android manufacturers — including Huawei — are what’s known as [Google hardware partners](&lt;|url|&gt;). This relationship lets them build their phones around a collection of Google products, from apps like Google Maps and Assistant, to under-the-hood tools like location services or push notifications. While Google gives off the impression that Android is open and available to everyone, these services represent a quiet control that the company doesn’t often enforce over its hardware partners — though, as it has now proven, it certainly can.

With the recent order, the U.S. government forced Google’s hand. The U.S. Department of Commerce put [Huawei on the “Entity List,”](&lt;|url|&gt;) which blocks it from buying technology from U.S. companies without government approval. Huawei and Google now [have three months](&lt;|url|&gt;) to send updates to existing users. For new phones, Huawei [may be able to](&lt;|url|&gt;) use the open-source version of Android, but it can’t be a Google partner.

The distinction between using Android and being a Google partner seems messy from the outside, but “Android” technically refers to the core operating system that covers basic things like making phone calls or using the camera. The freely available version of Android is called the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and a company doesn’t have to be a partner to use it.

Most manufacturers like Huawei, however, do choose to become a Google partner. That means Huawei agrees to only make devices that use a collection of Google apps known as [Google Mobile Services](&lt;|url|&gt;) which includes things like Gmail, YouTube, and the Google Play Store. Under this arrangement, Huawei can’t, for example, make a phone that ships with Microsoft’s Bing and Edge instead of Google Search and Chrome.
> # Manufacturers generally have little choice but to play by Google’s rules, because the costs of doing otherwise are tremendous.

Partners also have to meet certain security and compatibility conditions. In exchange, they get access to all of Google’s apps and infrastructure, making their phones much more appealing to customers worldwide than they would otherwise be. This arrangement is usually free, though manufacturers who sell in the EU [pay a fee](&lt;|url|&gt;) and are [exempt from the all-or-nothing condition](&lt;|url|&gt;) for [complicated legal reasons](&lt;|url|&gt;).

According to Bryan Pon, PhD, [mobile platform researcher](&lt;|url|&gt;) and co-founder of the data analytics firm [Caribou Data](&lt;|url|&gt;), this gives Google a lot of control over its platform. “Consumers are attached to the Google products and services that sit on top of the operating system,” explains Pon. “Google has very strong proprietary control over those, and in that sense wields tremendous power, irrespective of the operating system.”

Additionally, Huawei, and Google’s other partners, have to include a collection of developer tools called [Google Play Services](&lt;|url|&gt;). These background tools let app developers easily do things like create push notifications, embed maps in their apps, or get a GPS location. Most Android apps distributed through the Google Play Store rely on some of these tools to provide features that are too expensive or difficult for every developer to build themselves.

As Pon explains, some of these tools are crucial features that would normally be part of an operating system. “They’re actually taking functionality out of the core platform,” Pon says. “They’re leaving Android open source, more and more, just a shell. And that core functionality is now part of just proprietary Google services.” Google does this to make it easier to update important features without waiting for a big Android update, but the result consolidates Google’s power over its platform.

Without Google Play Services, Huawei would have to build these tools itself or leave developers to do it. The company has created its own version of some of these features — like a [push notification service](&lt;|url|&gt;) — but developers still have to add support for Huawei’s version of the tools to their apps in order for them to work on non-Google phones. Huawei is building [its own app store alternative](&lt;|url|&gt;), but it could take a long time to build everything else that developers and users are accustomed to getting from Google.

Manufacturers generally have little choice but to play by Google’s rules, because the costs of doing otherwise are tremendous. One of the few companies to opt out of Google’s system was Amazon with its series of Fire Tablets. If you buy a Fire, you’ll have something similar to an Android experience, but with hardly a trace of Google. Instead, you’ll use the Amazon Appstore. You’ll talk to Alexa instead of the Google Assistant. You’ll use Amazon’s Silk Browser instead of Chrome. Under the hood, all your apps will be using Amazon’s version of key features, like notifications or GPS. The approach works fine enough for a tablet, but when Amazon tried to make a phone, [it failed miserably](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Samsung tries to walk a middle ground, offering parallel versions of almost everything Google makes, from [basic email apps](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [its own voice assistant](&lt;|url|&gt;), without breaking away from its partner agreement. But if Samsung were to find itself in Huawei’s shoes, even that might not be enough. “I think to some extent, Samsung has to tell itself that it… has a plan B,” says Pon. “But I think, realistically, if they get turned off, like Huawei might get turned off, then they don’t have any good options.”

Under normal circumstances, this symbiotic relationship benefits everyone involved and lends credibility to Google’s claim that Android — unlike the iPhone — is “open,” while still letting the company maintain as much control over Android as possible. If a company like Amazon wants to build its own alternative from scratch, it can. For companies like Samsung and Huawei that can’t afford to or aren’t willing to go that far, they can leverage Google’s massive resources to make a variation of Android that consumers will want, without deviating too far from Google’s master plan.

Now, barring relief in the brewing China-U.S. trade war, Huawei has been forcibly pushed into going the much harder Amazon route. Huawei can’t use Google apps, it can’t support the push notifications or location services most apps use, and it even has to wait longer for security updates before it can push them to users. Existing users [won’t be affected for now](&lt;|url|&gt;), thanks to the temporary license granted by the U.S. Commerce Department, but future plans look grim. It took Amazon years to build its own version of Google’s services. Huawei’s CEO says [the company has a plan](&lt;|url|&gt;), but it’s unclear how long that plan could take to unfold.

Fortunately, for Huawei, it’s not all bad news. The Google Play Store has been [banned in China for years](&lt;|url|&gt;) due to [the country’s Great Firewall](&lt;|url|&gt;) that censors many foreign sites and services including Google search, Facebook, or YouTube. Losing them is of little importance in the Chinese market, which makes up [52% of the company’s overall revenue](&lt;|url|&gt;). Outside China, on the other hand, Huawei stands to lose quite a lot. Globally, it’s hard to sell an Android phone without Google services.
> # Google can reaffirm its commitment to being “open” and “free” all it wants, but ultimately it’s still a gatekeeper.

Beyond Huawei’s problems — and beyond the reality that geopolitics will play an increasing role in the tech business — this situation reveals a truth that Google has downplayed for years. While Android — the stripped down, open-source operating system — may be available to everyone, all of the Google pieces that make most Android phones worthwhile are locked behind a partner program. Google might let almost everyone into its exclusive club, but it reserves the right to kick them out.

Even if we could assume the best about Google’s intentions to keep Android as open as possible — and Google did not respond to a request by *OneZero* for comment — the Huawei order demonstrates that Google’s control can be abused by other entities. If the U.S. were in a trade war with South Korea instead of China, Samsung phones — still the most [popular](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the world over — could face a similar fate. Google can reaffirm its commitment to being “open” and “free” all it wants, but ultimately it’s still a gatekeeper.<|endoftext|>

# Google Is Finally Copying Apple’s Approach to Privacy

## New features will help keep your data on your device

![Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty*

Few companies are as enthusiastic about analyzing your data as Google. Yet the data giant also wants you to know it cares about your privacy. How can it reconcile these contradictory stances? By taking a page out of Apple’s playbook.

If you were watching [Google’s I/O keynote](&lt;|url|&gt;) this week, you heard one phrase repeated over and over: “on your device.” This easily overlooked phrase marks a subtle but important shift in philosophy for a company that’s spent years collecting massive troves of user data. Instead of sending every bit of information about you to a far-off server farm, Google is following [Apple’s example](&lt;|url|&gt;) of analyzing data on your phone, supposedly without ever sharing it with the company.

This comes at a time when the search giant is trying to change its image as an invasive, rather than helpful, steward of your data. [In an editorial for the *New York Times](&lt;|url|&gt;)* — published the same day I/O kicked off — Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that “privacy cannot be a luxury good.” An apparent snipe at Apple, even as his company uses some of the same models and features for protecting your privacy that Apple employs.

That’s not to say that Google will stop gobbling up your personal data altogether, but it wants to do so in a way that’s less invasive. Not for nothing, keeping that data out of Google’s hands may also help the company avoid repeats of the [$57 million fine it received under Europe’s new GDPR law](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Android’s [default keyboard](&lt;|url|&gt;) is a prime example. Google explained during its keynote that it uses a machine learning process called Federated Learning to analyze your typing patterns directly on your phone. If the company were to do this kind of analysis in the cloud, it would require uploading everything you type onto Google’s servers, which would be a massive privacy risk. Instead, the keyboard only uploads the results of your phone’s analysis, and then combines that analysis with everyone else’s. Then it distributes what it learned from everyone back to all the phones that use the app.

The process is extremely technical — you can read [more about it here](&lt;|url|&gt;) — but the result is that your phone’s keyboard can learn that the sentence “Let’s yeet this…” should end with “[wheat](&lt;|url|&gt;)” even if you’ve never typed those words in that order before. Those new predictions come from other people’s phones, all without ever uploading what anyone actually typed to Google’s servers.

If that approach sounds familiar, it’s because [Apple made a similarly big deal about it](&lt;|url|&gt;) a couple years ago when it launched the iPhone X. While other companies snatch up your data, [the promise went](&lt;|url|&gt;), Apple will give you that same A.I. power while protecting user data. Incidentally, Google has been [using Federated Learning since 2017 as well](&lt;|url|&gt;), though the company is well-known for analyzing large amounts of user data in the cloud as well.
> # That’s not to say that Google will stop gobbling up your personal data altogether, but it wants to do so in a way that’s less invasive.

According to Professor Jon Festinger of the [Centre for Digital Media](&lt;|url|&gt;) — a joint graduate institute between several Canadian universities specializing in new media — this is a step in the right direction. “These are very positive steps, stepping away from the cloud,” he says. “That precedent of being on device, that’s fantastic.”

Google is also implementing more Apple-like privacy controls that users can see. For example, [the next version of Android](&lt;|url|&gt;) will give users the ability to only let an app use their location a single time, instead of giving it permission forever just because you wanted to order a pizza. iPhone users have had this for a couple years, but Google’s just now getting around to it. With Android updates [as notoriously slow as they are](&lt;|url|&gt;), it may still be a few more years until most users have this option.

Of course, Google won’t kick the big data habit just yet, but it is giving users more control over the data they do collect. The company is rolling out the familiar Incognito Mode from Chrome to more apps, including Maps, YouTube, and Search. You can also set your [Web & App Activity](&lt;|url|&gt;) history — which includes things like the sites you visit or the things you search for — to auto-delete when it’s anywhere from three to 18 months old. Later, Google will roll out a similar feature for your location history.

While this is a good feature to have, Jennifer King, director of consumer privacy at Stanford’s Center for Internet and Society, says it might not mean much if consumers never figure out they can delete their data in the first place. “Some of this stuff is really complicated for consumers,” she explains. “The skeptic in me would always say… Why isn’t the location history deletion feature set to 18 months by default?”

King was speaking hypothetically, since the location history feature is not available yet. However, a similar feature to delete your web activity currently defaults to saving your data forever. If you want to automatically delete older data, you’ll have to dig through [your Activity Controls page](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Still, Google clearly wants to earn some trust back. The company announced an [A.I. research tool called TCAV](&lt;|url|&gt;) to combat bias in machine learning systems by examining how they came to their conclusions. Google used the example of an image recognition system — like the kind [used in Google Photos](&lt;|url|&gt;) — that’s given pictures of mostly male doctors and inaccurately concludes that it should only identify a picture as a doctor if the subject is male.

In such a situation, though, only a human could teach the machine that being male shouldn’t be a criterion for identifying doctors. “I don’t know how you correct for those things without explicitly having humans review and add input for those models,” King says. While TCAV is designed to see how neural networks are thinking in an abstract way without examining raw consumer data, it’s hard to know whether this presents new risks.

“The problem of reverse engineering identity, we don’t know enough about that,” says Festinger. “So we don’t know how susceptible these devices are, and it’d be interesting to hear from Google about it.”

Google did not respond to a request for comment about its new features.<|endoftext|>

# Beyond-Outdated Internet Laws Are Ruining Lives

## We need a new weapon in the fight to stop trolls from spreading harmful footage

![Credit: Aitor Diago/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Aitor Diago/Getty Images*

In 2015, Alison Parker, a journalist, and Adam Ward, a photographer, were [murdered on air](&lt;|url|&gt;) by a former employee of the TV station where they worked. The shooter recorded the killings with a camera worn on his chest and later uploaded the footage to Facebook. Now, more than three years after Parker’s death, her father, Andy Parker, is still engaged in a Sisyphean feat: [trying to scrub the footage of his daughter’s death from the internet](&lt;|url|&gt;), where it regularly appears as part of conspiracy theories claiming that the deaths were staged. His weapon? Copyright laws.

After obtaining the rights to the TV station’s footage of the shooting — simply by [asking](&lt;|url|&gt;) station owner Gray Television for them — he now tries to force companies like Google to remove content showing the shooting by alerting the companies that users are stealing his digital property when they post the footage without his consent.

Parker is not alone in his strategy. Victims of revenge porn, doxxing, and conspiracy theories are frequently becoming de facto copyright experts, using a legal theory first codified in the 1700s to combat the very 21st-century problem of what to do when the worst moments of your life are spreading across the internet in increasingly mutated and offensive forms, uncontrolled and SEO-optimized. In fact, entering the world of intellectual property law is such a standard part of the survivor experience that a bereaved web developer father from Sandy Hook started[ HONR Network](&lt;|url|&gt;), an organization that helps victims and survivors fight to remove unwanted videos and images from the internet using copyright claims.

Why are we stuck relying on centuries-old copyright laws to control how painful and harmful information spreads on the internet? The short answer is that law on the internet hasn’t caught up to the digital era, leaving many questions at the intersection of free speech, commerce, and communication unresolved. The longer answer is that the internet, as it currently stands, is a microcosm where embedded neoliberal and libertarian ideologies overshadow ethical or humanitarian concern.

Our laissez-faire approach to regulating the internet was cemented in the 1990s when Congress ultimately decided that the World Wide Web should be protected as a free marketplace. Under the premise of market fundamentalism, both economic and social problems are swept away by Adam Smith’s invisible hand.

In 1995, the New York Supreme Court found that an internet company that operated a “computer bulletin board” could be held liable for defamatory posts made by users. After the decision, internet companies panicked: If companies could be liable for content posted by users, there was a huge disincentive to let people post freely on their sites. Congress, concerned that companies’ fear of litigation could stifle the burgeoning new online marketplace, swiftly codified [Section 230](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet service providers from liability for content posted by users. The written purpose of Section 230 is to defend the “vibrant and competitive free market” for “Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.”

Section 230 arguably allowed the internet to become what it is today — if companies were worried about being liable for user postings, we may never have been able to chat about our crushes on AIM, post jobs on Craigslist, or unload political rants on Facebook or Twitter. Companies would self-police content to limit their liability, which in turn would have made the “vibrant and competitive free market” of the internet void of much user-generated content at all. But more than 20 years later, we’re still struggling with[ what we want the internet to be](&lt;|url|&gt;), and how closely [online companies](&lt;|url|&gt;) should be regulated.
> # Taking your business away from companies who traffic in the spread of unwanted photos and videos or inaccurate information would mean leaving the internet entirely.

For victims and survivors, Section 230 means that they often can’t take companies directly to court to force them to take down offending posts. Under market fundamentalism, the solution to social problems faced in the “vibrant and competitive free market” is not litigation. Instead, consumers can take their business away from companies that engage in problematic practices like permitting the proliferation of conspiracy theories or revenge porn and instead patronize responsible companies that don’t engage in such practices. This freedom to take your business elsewhere theoretically disincentives bad corporate behavior.

There’s only one problem: It doesn’t work. Taking your business away from companies who traffic in the spread of unwanted photos and videos or inaccurate information would mean leaving the internet entirely. And even if you left, the fact remains that companies like Google would continue to [make money off even the worst content people publish on their platforms](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Instead of giving up on the internet, victims found a way to use another mainstay of market-based ideologies: the importance of private property as protected by copyrights. Copyright law is designed to help people participate in the market by protecting their “original works of authorship.” If you write a book, take a photo, or film a video, copyright law protects your work from being stolen or monetized by others without your consent.

But rather than using copyright to protect what we traditionally think of as a work of art or authorship, victims of online harassment are using it to try to scrub the internet clean of content being used to harass or humiliate them. Many of the videos and graphics used and shared by conspiracy theorists include pictures of victims, the kinds of snapshots every family takes: smiling photos from the first day of school or get-togethers. In the case of revenge porn, many of the disseminated pictures and videos are selfies, taken by the victim but usually only intended for an audience of one — not the entire internet. And although you may not think of a photo of your kid blowing out birthday candles or a bathroom mirror selfie as a work of art or an “authorship” of some sort, in the market-based world of internet law, you can only control your story if you think of it as a product that only you have the right to sell and distribute.

If a conspiracy theorist, troll, or random stranger uses copyrighted material without permission, including those family photos and videos, a victim can submit a copyright takedown notice to the company hosting the content alleging that it contains copyrighted materials owned by the complainant. In many cases, the company then blocks the offending content.

So why does an online company worry about liability for a copyright violation but not for publishing false or defamatory content? While the Communications Decency Act limited liability for ISPs, it was followed in 1998 by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which included the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act to provide clarity and some amount of insulation to online companies when it came to copyright infringement. To protect itself from claims infringement, a company must comply with specific “notice and takedown” procedures, which means that when a company, an individual, or a group like HONR complains that a conspiracy theory video is unlawfully using copyrighted material in the form of family photos or videos, the hosting company might not face liability for the underlying defamatory or false message, but they could face liability for failing to comply with the notice and takedown procedures under copyright law.

While grieving and hurting individuals may be savvy enough to use market-based solutions to tackle the problem of offensive and unwanted content, this isn’t an effective solution. The process is unwieldy and cumbersome, usually requiring a new takedown request for each video that resurfaces. And more fundamentally, it is a stark reminder that we value private property like photos or videos more than the people they depict or the survivors they left behind. And for survivors whose worst moments are captured by media they don’t own? It’s unlikely there’s much they can do to remove the content at all.

It doesn’t have to be this way, but the only way it can change is by moving away from the idea that market forces are all that is needed to control the internet. The EU, for example, is in a protracted battle to navigate a changing digital landscape just like the rest of us. But instead of hoping the market will smooth tensions through supply and demand, it is taking on the much messier task of navigating what responsibility government and tech companies have when it comes to the internet.

In 2014, the European Court of Justice found that search engines, including Google, were [required to remove links upon request](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the subject, so long as they meet certain requirements. The law, which allows users to request that out-of-date or inaccurate links about themselves be removed from search results, has been controversial, with everyone from lawyers to philosophers weighing in on what content should be preserved. The EU has also enacted a bevy of other regulations intended to rein in big tech, from restrictions on how companies store and utilize users’ personal data to antitrust challenges designed to intervene in the monopolistic pushing of specific goods and services through ads.

The EU’s attempts to regulate the internet are far from perfect, but at least they’re trying. And until we start to grapple with the question of whether we should really allow the internet to continue being an example of mostly unregulated neoliberalism, victims will continue to try to fix the internet, video by video, meme by meme, one notice and takedown request at a time.<|endoftext|>

# How to Prevent the Next 737 Max Disaster

## As technology becomes more complex, so must troubleshooting

![Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images*

Officials are [still struggling to understand](&lt;|url|&gt;) how the Boeing 737 Max — a plane model built with the latest, most advanced technology, one that has been flying commercially for [less than two years](&lt;|url|&gt;) — could have failed so catastrophically so early in its career. Two of these airliners crashed in the span of five months, killing 346 people in total. But while much of the focus has fallen on a faulty sensor, the underlying cause appears to involve the way complex subsystems on the plane interacted with one another, a dynamic that has played out in other recent catastrophes, ranging from Deepwater Horizon to Air France 447.

While complexity’s hazards have become all the more apparent with the 737 Max crashes and the difficult development of self-driving cars, they have long been an object of intense interest for MIT aeronautics professor Nancy Leveson, who nearly 40 years ago began studying what she calls “software-intensive, complex, tightly coupled systems.”

Back then, Leveson was a newly minted computer science PhD trying to figure out how to fix a torpedo for the U.S. Navy. The Mark 48 Advanced Capability (ADCAP) simply wasn’t working — a major problem given that the weapon was intended to defend the United States against Russian subs and the nuclear missiles they carried.
> # Things can go catastrophically wrong even when every individual component is working as designed.

“[Navy officials] were just tearing their hair out,” Leveson says today. “They’d never used so many computers in these weapons systems before.”

Leveson realized that technology had advanced to such a point that the routine problem-solving methods engineers had long employed would no longer suffice. A new methodology needed to be developed.

To avoid disasters, engineers have traditionally identified which individual components in a system might fail and how. The most minor parts can make a huge difference. A classic example is the space shuttle *Challenger*, which blew up in 1986 during liftoff because a single O-ring failed to provide an adequate seal due to unusually low temperatures on the day of the launch. If you can avoid this kind of flaw — if you can guarantee that every component will perform as intended — you can eliminate any risk of failure.

At least in theory.

What Leveson realized is that as complexity increases within a system, this approach loses its effectiveness. Things can go catastrophically wrong even when every individual component is working precisely as its designers imagined. “It’s a matter of unsafe interactions among components,” she says. “We need stronger tools to keep up with the amount of complexity we want to build into our systems.”

Leveson developed her insights into an approach called system theoretic process analysis (STPA), which rapidly spread through private industries and the military. Among those adopting it today are the Air Force, most U.S. car makers — and Boeing.

“She’s literally invented a new approach to safety,” says Shem Malmquist, a professor of aeronautics at the Florida Institute of Technology. As technology becomes increasingly complex and automated, the type of accident STPA was developed to address will become more prevalent and the need for Leveson’s approach more urgent.

Leveson cites an incident that took place in 1993, when a [Lufthansa Airbus A-320 overran a runway in Warsaw, Poland](&lt;|url|&gt;), killing two and injuring 68. The plane’s engines were equipped with thrust reversers that were intended to slow down the plane during landing. But there was a catch. Because reversing thrust would be catastrophic if it occurred in air, the system was designed so that it wouldn’t engage unless both wheels were on the ground. This was an important safety feature, and normally this arrangement worked well. But on the day in question, the airport was buffeted by unusually strong winds.

Anticipating that the air would be pushing him sideways, the Lufthansa pilot followed standard procedure and came in to land with the plane rolled to one side to counteract the lateral drift. This resulted in the plane setting down on just one of its two main landing gears. Since the other landing gear didn’t touch down until the plane was halfway down the runway, the thrust reversers didn’t deploy until it was too late, leaving the pilot helpless to stop the plane in time. Everything worked the way it was supposed to, but the Lufthansa plane was destroyed, and two people died.
> # “The old paradigm is ‘prevent components of the system from failing.’ So it has changed from a reliability problem to a control problem.”

To prevent this kind of disaster from happening in the future, STPA calls for engineers to enumerate the control loops embedded in a system and understand how they are connected together. This requires a paradigm shift.

“The old paradigm is ‘prevent components of the system from failing,’ while STPA says ‘enforce constraints on behavior,’” Leveson says. “So it has changed from a reliability problem to a control problem.” The essence of STPA is to “look at what is the worst case that could happen and how we can prevent that from happening.”

In reviewing the Lufthansa accident, for example, Leveson was struck by the fact that the A-320’s designers had felt so confident about the automatic system’s operation that they had left the human pilots with no way to override it. “Reliable operation of the automation is not the problem here,” she wrote in a [later analysis](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Instead the issue is whether software can be constructed that will exhibit correct appropriate behavior under *every* foreseeable and unforeseeable situation and whether we should be trusting software over pilots.”

While the machines that surround us are becoming more complicated — “cars today have [100 million lines of code](&lt;|url|&gt;) in them,” Leveson points out, compared to the [400,000 lines of code](&lt;|url|&gt;) used on the original space shuttle — that complexity is just part of the picture. People, with all of our psychological quirks and organizational oddities, can both reduce risk and increase it.

Leveson sees a red flag, for instance, in the current state of semiautonomous vehicles. Manufacturers constantly remind consumers that their nascent self-driving systems are not capable of handling all possible situations that could arise, so drivers must stay alert and focused at all times. But Leveson believes this is unrealistic.

“No human can just sit there and not do anything and then be ready when an emergency occurs,” Leveson says. The problem of inattention was on display when a self-driving Uber car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona last year. A safety driver was behind the wheel but not paying attention to the road when [the vehicle collided with a woman](&lt;|url|&gt;) crossing the road. Nor does it help when tech entrepreneurs like Elon Musk boldly predict that fully self-driving cars will be available within a couple years, as the Tesla CEO [did on Monday](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Leveson will not publicly address the factors underlying the crash of Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air 737 Max planes, explaining that Boeing is one of her clients. Nevertheless, these crashes and other similar catastrophes have driven home to the public the realization that complex systems can produce unexpected behavior and that the human operators of those systems can struggle to respond effectively. We expect that as technology advances, it will necessarily become safer — and, for the most part, that’s been true. (More than twice as many people died in aviation accidents 20 years ago, even as the number of people flying has vastly increased.) But better technology comes with greater complexity, which can generate dangers all its own.

And that’s why STPA is an idea whose time appears to have come. “It’s spreading like mad,” Leveson says, “which is keeping me very busy.”<|endoftext|>

# We Need to Slow Down Communication

## From autocomplete email to algorithmic news feeds, technology has turbocharged communication, but meaning and signal is being lost along the way

![Illustration: [Nicole Ginelli](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Nicole Ginelli](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

*Co-authored with [Clive Thompson](&lt;|twitter|&gt;)*

At *One Zero*, we recently discussed the “efficiency delusion” in tech — the mistaken belief that removing “[effort, steps, and hassle](&lt;|url|&gt;)” always makes things better. We’re continuing the conversation here by talking about communication. The main question on our minds is this: When should communication be slowed down?

*The following is an edited excerpt that captures the flavor of a recent dialog.*

**Evan Selinger**: You recently said something that’s very interesting about how things have changed during the transition from your last book, [*Smarter Than You Think: How Technology is Changing Our Minds for the Better*,](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the new one, [*Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. “[The problem is that nobody cares whether or not tech is making us smarter. What they care about is whether tech is making us better — morally better](&lt;|url|&gt;).” Where is this discussion happening?

**Clive Thompson**: When I’m giving talks now, people are always asking ethical questions about our comportment towards one another. For example, how is social networking impacting behavior? Folks don’t want to talk about issues like intelligence and cognition. They just really want to know if digital technology is creating a generation of assholes.

Early on, people were concerned about their individual attention spans and whether they’d be able to read as much. But with the growth of highly algorithmically determined feeds architecting the attention of the civic sphere, people started worrying more about larger civic and ethical issues. Are people becoming more nakedly partisan? Are they more likely to be rude to one another? Are young people immersed in a coarser culture than they should be?

**ES**: Ah, so the issue is where our collective attention is going.

**CT**: Yes. Take Facebook’s news feed. As a design principle, it worked well in the short term. But long term, it’s been a catastrophe. That’s because speeding up our ability to see what’s going on around our friends is perfectly fine. But since Facebook optimizes the news feed for compulsive engagement, it’s been a slide to madness through metabolic overload. Algorithms select content that makes us laugh, sob, and drives us nuts with partisan rancor. With extreme content comes a flood of car crash level emotions.

**ES**: Was this predictable?

**CT**: Certainly some thinkers have been worried about the side effects of accelerating everyday communications, and have been warning about it for decades — centuries, actually. But I don’t think I took seriously enough the dangers of the marketplace motivations for hyper-accelerating connections at an immense scale.

**ES**: Well, then, what do you think of my prediction from a few years back that Apple’s predictive text messages were just the beginning of a [powerful trend in automating personal communication](&lt;|url|&gt;) — that once algorithms in consumer communication technology started inferring what we might say the functions would become deeply embedded in the digital DNA?

**CT**: It’s funny. I remember when you first said to me, “I’m worried that under the aegis of speeding up communications by predicting a word or two that we’re moving towards an ideal of reducing communication to clichés of things we’ve already said.”

At the time, I had two thoughts. One was huh, that’s a really interesting point. But I also was like, is that really a trap that we would let ourselves fall into?

Thinking about it now, a few years later, I’ve become less optimistic. In fact, you nailed it. I can see myself auto-filling an entire sentence in Gmail. Starting with “Dear so and so, I would like to,” letting it suggest the rest of the damn sentence, and, by the end, I accept a quickly composed note that’s 70% written by a bot.
> # **“**The more we give into nudges to speak robotically, the easier it will become for us to go on autopilot and spew [personalized clichés](&lt;|url|&gt;) in conversations that we actually care about when the same option is available.”

**ES**: The sad thing is that if I’m being honest, I’m even worse. When I’m in the moment, as opposed to when I think globally about the importance of communication, I’m inclined to want an A.I. intermediary that could determine what my reaction would be to an unimportant note and ghostwrite a response in my name so that I wouldn’t even need to bother reading it.

Of course, this is an unrealistic fantasy. In our everyday experience, lots of conversations are hard to classify as either being important or unimportant. Sometimes, only time will tell whether a conversation is valuable.

More poignantly, automating communicating will have spillover effects. The more we give into nudges to speak robotically, the easier it will become for us to go on autopilot and spew [personalized clichés](&lt;|url|&gt;) in conversations that we actually care about when the same option is available.

**CT**: The problem with removing friction reminds me… Do you use the [Nextdoor](&lt;|url|&gt;) app?

**ES**: No, but my wife does.

**CT**: As you know, then, it’s a neighborhood social network. People can talk about community events, ask for recommendations for everything from restaurants to house painters, and all that kind of stuff.

But did you know that in its early phase, Nextdoor had a crime reporting feature, something like a neighborhood watch? If you saw something suspicious you could file a little report in a box and it would go out to all of your neighbors.

Unfortunately, the feature [catalyzed a lot of racism](&lt;|url|&gt;). You’d get these homogeneous neighborhoods that were very white and if a single person of color walked down the block, someone would file a report saying, “Oh my god! An alarming looking stranger is in the neighborhood.”

**ES**: I heard about this. Weren’t changes made to counteract the problem?

**CT**: Yes, it got redesigned so that users can’t make a report without giving several pieces of information. Now they have to clarify specifics, like how tall the person is and what brand of shoes the person was wearing. Putting some grit in that machine helped a little bit, because it slowed people down somewhat. It made it harder for them to act impulsively on racist bias. In comparison, in the parts of Nextdoor where they don’t have anything to slow down posts, like in their forums, there’s still a ton of racist comments.

**ES**: This type of concern is why organizations like the ACLU have criticized Amazon’s [patent ](&lt;|url|&gt;)for installing facial recognition into Ring, a smart doorbell system.

It’s easy to sell people on wanting to protect their home. Who doesn’t want to live in a safe one? But this would be a dangerous surveillance product. Innocent people might be labelled suspicious and get coded this way in law enforcement databases.

**CT**: That’s why I’m encouraging coders to create software that gets us to pause and slow down a little bit. This can be hard for nose down computer science majors to appreciate. The people who get it right away are the weirdos who came to coding through the back door after wanting to be an artist, musician, or writer. As a writer, maybe I’m being a little biased in seeing things this way. But these fields do encourage people to see what they’re doing in a broader context.
> # “It’s that all the ad supported ‘free stuff’ tends to go off the rails. Why? Because anything that’s supported by ads wants you to do more and more and more of it because that’s how you get ad impressions.”

**ES: **Okay, but is this sensibility compatible with what industry is looking for?

**CT**: That’s a hard question to answer. One thing we know from looking at the last 15 or so years of software development and the rise of software that scales quickly and becomes woven into everyday life, is that it’s all the ad supported “free stuff” tends to go off the rails. Why? Because anything that’s supported by ads wants you to do more and more and more of it because that’s how you get ad impressions. And that just creates enormous hazards in design that encourages people to overuse a service.

This is a subset of a larger problem in the marketplace. There’s a reason why so much money in venture capital goes towards startups that have an idea that will marginally speed up or automate something or make something that’s more efficient. It’s because the great trick of capitalism is to find something being done, make it so it’s easier to do, and skim off the excess that you’ve created as profit. Capitalism has so loved software for the last 50 years because it’s extremely good at reaching into every nook and cranny of our activity.

**ES**: I’m sympathetic to the idea of looking for different incentive structures. In [*Re-Engineering Humanity](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, Brett Frischmann and I raise, as a thought experiment, the possibility of the BBC running a social network. Can you imagine one that either came out of the government or the nonprofit sector?

**CT**: I think you could imagine nonprofit one. A governmentally sponsored one, at least in the United States, would run into massive free speech issues. But you could definitely try to develop something so delicious, wonderful, creative, and fun outside of the commercial market that people would really want to use it. And there won’t be a need for metastatic growth that develops the problems we’ve been discussing.

Obviously, there aren’t any major social networks that operate this way. But it would be damn interesting if a new one emerged.

# The Climate Commencement Speech Our College Grads Deserve

## We’ve handed our children a nightmare, and it’s time to tell them the truth

![Photo: Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty*

Good afternoon to the graduating class of 2019! Wow. You did it.

To the administration and faculty, to the parents and friends, and to the many distinguished guests joining us today, thank you so much for being here.

As you may have heard, Colorado College booked Oprah Winfrey for commencement this year. Wayne State had Jack White. Bard got Jamaica Kincaid.

You guys… Well, you got me. Sorry. Welcome to the real world.

In any case, here you are. You worked hard, wrestled with new and challenging ideas, made lifelong friends. You overcame formidable obstacles. You formed study groups, crammed for finals, pulled all-nighters, and when the going got really tough, you dipped into your roommate’s Adderall. You did what you had to do, and in the end, you pulled it off, making you part of the [roughly 60%](&lt;|url|&gt;) of American college students who manage to graduate. And now, here you sit. Congratulations!

Let’s hear it for the parents, too. Give it up. Candidates, I hope you appreciate these folks. Just think about what they did to get you here. Many of them, I know, scrimped and saved for years. Some hired tutors. A few maybe skirted the law — who knows? Most of them took out expensive student loans. By the way, some of those loans were in your name, and you’ll be paying them off for a long time.

But I have to be honest with you. And you’re college graduates now, or almost, so I know you can handle it. The truth is that these loans are the least of your worries.

Let me back up. It hit me just over a week ago. I was sitting more or less where your parents are sitting right now, watching my own daughter graduate from college. Our phones were fully charged, and we were all set to shoot some blurry shaky-cam video of our oldest child walking across the stage for a quick handshake with the dean.

Our daughter’s alma mater pulled a pretty high-powered commencement speaker this year: New York Senator Charles Schumer.

Admittedly, I’m not a big fan of Schumer’s. I disagree with many of his policies, and I consider his political tactics to be deeply misguided, if not embarrassing. So when he began speaking, I was skeptical. Schumer mostly prattled on about his own college experience: how he was so devastated when he failed to make the Harvard basketball team — an outcome anyone who’s seen him get regularly dunked on by Mitch McConnell might expect — that he decided to quit school. He was packing his bags to leave when a fellow student invited him to canvass for the Democratic presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy. He agreed, and thus a political flame was kindled that led him to a top leadership position in the Democratic party.

This sounded like bullshit to me. The idea that anyone would ditch Harvard over failing to make the basketball team was plainly made up. And yet, by the time Schumer was finished telling the story, I was crying. Not like a little misty. Big, ripe, fulsome tears were leaking from my eyes, streaming down my cheeks. Of course, I hadn’t thought to bring tissues, so I just stood there, wet-faced, hoping nobody would notice.

Why was I crying? I wasn’t quite sure. But as Schumer congratulated the class one last time, wagging his fists limply in the air the way he always does, it hit me.

Despite all the hard-won wisdom offered by the senate minority leader, as well as the class valedictorian and the various other speakers, the heartfelt wishes, the stirring rhetoric about how my kid and her classmates should be true to themselves, and hold on to their friendships as they make their way through the world, supporting each other through the good and bad times to come, and how they should stand up for what’s right, and honor their best selves, and become lifelong learners, and never, ever let anyone tell them they “can’t,” the plain fact is that my kid is utterly screwed, as is everyone in her class.

And so, dear candidates, are you.

It’s not your fault. It’s ours. Mine, your professors, your parents, your grandparents. All of us. We let you down.

And not just a little bit. We totally, and perhaps irrevocably, blew it. I’m not sure there’s an actual phrase strong enough to convey just how bad it is, the hell storm you’re about to waltz into. But it may not be an exaggeration to say that, in aggregate — globally speaking — we fucked you over harder than any generation has ever fucked over their kids since the very dawn of humankind.
> # The plain fact is that my kid is utterly screwed, as is everyone in her class.

Your elders inherited a pretty okay planet overall — not perfect by any means, but halfway decent. Totally workable. And a few decades later, it’s time to pass on this glorious birthright, a precious heirloom handed down century after century since time immemorial, and, um, what can I say?

You kids are in some real trouble.

A lot of you are thinking about what comes next, about how you’ll find your purpose in life. Unfortunately, that’s not going to be a problem. Your purpose is about to find you.

As I look out there at your shining faces, your bright eyes so full of innocence and hope, I wish it were otherwise. You have your whole lives ahead of you. The possibilities should be endless, as they were for me and my class a few decades ago.

Instead, you’re about to confront a set of challenges my generation couldn’t even conceive of, or more accurately, simply preferred not to.

Scientists [have been telling us](&lt;|url|&gt;), roughly since the ’70s, that our behavior, our way of life, based in large part on the burning of fossil fuels and other CO2-emitting activities, is altering the world we live in in devastating ways. We didn’t just hear about this last week. We knew.

True, most of us don’t feel the effects yet, but that’s not an excuse. Every day we fail to act simply means more chaos, more upheaval, more tragedy laid at the feet of your generation and the ones that will follow. The amount of plant and animal life on Earth has [plummeted](&lt;|url|&gt;) by 20% in the last century. One million species are at serious risk of extinction. The world has warmed by a [whole degree Celsius](&lt;|url|&gt;) so far, and if we don’t act dramatically to alter the trajectory, we’ll lose the chance altogether.

Scientists are now telling us we have a dozen years to pull that off. To put that in perspective, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, the last book in the series, came out a dozen years ago. It’s not a lot of time. A few of you Potterheads may remember a spell called *Meteolojinx Recanto, *which reverses atmospheric charms and other strange weather occurrences. You could recite it every day, and you’ll still be doing more than our elected officials in Washington.

So what happens if we do nothing, as the Trump administration, which is actively [undermining its own scientists](&lt;|url|&gt;), seems to want? For starters, we’ll be dealing with more insane wildfires, more 100-year floods, more superstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, snowpocalypses. Then figure on deadly new pandemics, plagues supercharged by the warming atmosphere. The oceans will continue to heat up, with devastating impacts on marine life, including the coral reefs that have long provided habitats for the fish we rely on for food. Agricultural yields could fall by double digits in the coming decades due to drought, even as a ballooning population vastly increases the demand for food. Famine, catastrophic weather, coastal flooding, and water shortages will force entire populations to migrate, increasing the likelihood of conflict and social unrest.

The late Anthropocene will make the biblical plagues seem tame. Hail? Bring it on. Flies, lice, boils, frogs? We should be so lucky. We’ll have all that and more. The polite nomenclature — climate change — is already passé. Lately, we’ve begun calling it a climate emergency. A climate crisis. Soon “climate holocaust” may not be an exaggeration.

Looks like the dean is getting antsy. Don’t worry, I’m wrapping up.

So, kids, what can I tell you? [We knew](&lt;|url|&gt;). Sure, oil companies funded misleading studies, created a false debate, and bought off politicians, so they could suck a few more gazillion gallons out of the ground. But we knew what they were up to, and we let them get away with it, because it fueled an economy we all enjoyed. Even the supposed environmentalists, dutifully separating our recyclables and carrying our reusable totes to the store, we didn’t really act, not in any meaningful way.
> # It’s not your fault. It’s ours. Mine, your professors, your parents, your grandparents. All of us. We let you down.

Now it’s clear we should have been blocking the streets, not driving down them. We should have been holding [national strikes](&lt;|url|&gt;), walking out of our offices arm in arm, bringing the whole fragile edifice to a halt. We should have found the economic choke points — shut down highways, occupied corporate lobbies, hobbled interstate trade, got ourselves arrested in such numbers they would never be able to process us all. We should have put the business community on notice. It wouldn’t have taken much, just a few weeks of concerted effort.

But I’m a Gen Xer. We’re not really into effort. As a generation, we sort of hung back. We critiqued things. We elevated eye-rolling into high art and substituted disdain for struggle.

And so here’s the kicker. Even as we lay this mess at your feet, we mock you relentlessly. We ridicule your safe spaces, denigrate your work ethic, malign your toasts of avocado. We handed you participation trophies and then needled you for accepting them. One day, I suspect, we’ll look back on all our well-tuned irony, the smugness of it, and we’ll see it for what it was: laziness, timidity, self-reproach projected onto everyone else.

The truth is that we’re jealous of you and we always have been. We’re jealous of your openness to the world, your faith in one another, your ability to take good selfies. We’re jealous of your knowledge, because not only do you seem to get every reference we throw at you, you have your own references we can’t Google fast enough. We envy your honesty. Your passion. Your intelligence. Your creativity.

And I suspect that one day, we will come to envy your courage. We will look on with awe as you lead the rest of us in facing up to an overwhelming challenge. We will watch with wonder as you confront the disaster we’ve helped bring about, and do it with grace, and humility, and wisdom, and empathy. And as grim as the challenge is, I think you may also find joy in it. It will bring your lives meaning of a sort most of us have never felt.

I’m sure you’d rather do just about anything else than fight this war. Like every generation before you, you just want to live your lives — feel pleasure and maybe some pain, take pride in your work, fall madly in love, bring new creatures into the world and bask in their innocence. But it’s not going to be that simple for you. I wish it were.

I think that’s why I was crying so much at my own daughter’s commencement. The grief was complicated. It was manifold. I was crying for your sweetness and how we took it for granted. I was crying for myself, and for all of us, who wanted so badly to protect you and failed, and who still, in that moment, were pretending that everything was going to be okay. I was crying tears of mourning and tears of apprehension and, most of all, tears of shame, which are the worst ones.

Your parents sitting here, beaming with pride as they watch you graduate, they didn’t mean any harm. They’re good people.

# Facebook Is Eroding Trust in Two-Factor Authentication

## The latest privacy scandal goes beyond the platform

Two-factor authentication, 2FA for short, is billed as the best way to keep your account secure even if a hacker nabs your password. Users are told that they must — must! — enable 2FA if it’s an option, which an increasing number of websites now offer. The most popular, though [least secure](&lt;|url|&gt;), 2FA uses SMS, whereby a company texts a short code to your phone number after you enter your password. This means you have to trust the company in question with your phone number in order to gain that extra bit of security. But it turns out that Facebook may not be worthy of that trust.

Last year, [TechCrunch revealed](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the social network abused phone numbers that users had uploaded to enable 2FA by allowing advertisers to target content against them. And this week, Emojipedia founder [Jeremy Burge discovered](&lt;|url|&gt;) that Facebook also allows other users to find you by typing in the phone number you uploaded for 2FA purposes. There is apparently no way to turn this feature off. If you want the added security benefit of 2FA using your phone number, you have to allow the social media giant to share that number.

The troubling revelation kicked off a week in which Mark Zuckerberg [published a long essay](&lt;|url|&gt;) detailing his new vision for “privacy-focused” social networking. The 2FA news indicates that Facebook has some work to do on that front. The company has not responded to multiple requests for comment.

In our testing, *OneZero* found that entering your phone number in [Facebook’s 2FA setup wizard](&lt;|url|&gt;) would immediately make it visible to your friends on your profile. On other services, like Twitter, uploading your phone number for 2FA doesn’t add it to your profile or link it to other services. If you want other Twitter users to find you by your phone number, you have to enter it separately.

![](<|image|>)

According to security engineer Dennis Stewart, Facebook’s actions could damage 2FA’s overall reputation, giving users a reason not to use an important security feature, which could then expose them to more hacking. If you want your phone number to be kept private, using SMS for authentication on Facebook isn’t a viable option.

“They’re creating an anti-incentive where people who may not really know a ton about security now view a negative factor attached to two-factor where there really shouldn’t be,” Stewart says. “I’m worried about them poisoning the well.”
> # For Facebook, there’s no difference between adding your phone number to your account for security purposes and uploading it to share with friends.

Privacy concerns aside, the SMS option isn’t the best way to employ 2FA anyway because cellphone numbers aren’t always secure. Attackers can [intercept text messages](&lt;|url|&gt;) as they travel over the cell network, someone can [convince your carrier](&lt;|url|&gt;) to turn over your account, or someone with access to your laptop could find texts via iMessage. Fortunately, companies like Google, Apple, and — yes — even Facebook allow you to use authenticator apps like [Google Authenticator](&lt;|url|&gt;) or [Authy](&lt;|url|&gt;) to generate 2FA codes directly on your phone. These are never sent over the cell network and expire every 30 seconds. Unlike SMS, the only way to get these codes is to have your device in hand.

Facebook and Google also support physical 2FA keys [like YubiKey](&lt;|url|&gt;). These devices are small USB keys that you plug into your computer or tap to your phone when you want to login to a site. These perfectly fulfill the “something you have” requirement of 2FA since you can only access your account if you possess this specific device. Google requires all 85,000+ of their employees to use them. As a result, no Google employees have been successfully phished (tricked into turning over personal information via fake login pages) [since 2017](&lt;|url|&gt;). Incidentally, Facebook has a [similar policy for its own employees](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Still, SMS codes remain the most popular option for 2FA for regular users. [On some services](&lt;|url|&gt;), like Airbnb, Venmo, or LinkedIn, they’re the only option. Meanwhile, a [global survey of Office 365 users](&lt;|url|&gt;) by Specops Software found that only 20 percent of organizations bothered using 2FA at all. Of those that did, the majority favored SMS codes. According to Stewart, this isn’t much of a surprise.

“Most people who use two-factor authentication are sort of pressed into it,” Stewart says. “And, I mean, they should be; it’s definitely better. But I think they’re going to use whatever’s easiest.”

With [large-scale data breaches](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the rise — from [Equifax exposing data](&lt;|url|&gt;) on 143 million Americans to [Yahoo losing data](&lt;|url|&gt;) on all 3 billion of its accounts — 2FA will only become more vital to internet security. The technology is so powerful that it could eventually make passwords obsolete, which is great because [we’re bad at making secure ones](&lt;|url|&gt;). As Stewart says, “Microsoft is [offering passwordless accounts now](&lt;|url|&gt;) where you don’t have the password; you just have the two-factor going into it.”

That future will be harder to achieve if Facebook’s actions cause users to distrust 2FA across the board. It may be possible [to quit Facebook](&lt;|url|&gt;), but it’s a lot harder to quit the entire internet. It’s where you manage your finances, play your games, and communicate with relatives, friends, and coworkers. SMS-based 2FA may not be ideal, but it’s much better than nothing.

At a time when passwords are less secure than ever — and when Facebook is trying to prove that protecting your information is a priority — squandering trust in two-factor authentication is something the internet can’t afford.<|endoftext|>

# Meet the Alien Whisperer

## Meet the Alien Whisperer

### How an astrophysicist uses dolphin and whale communication to prepare for possible alien contact

![Photo: by wildestanimal/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: by wildestanimal/Getty Images*

When astrophysicist Laurance Doyle was six, his father presented him with a map of the solar system and said, “The stars are other people’s suns.” The line sparked Doyle’s interest in space, and he’s been studying outer worlds ever since.

In the past, Doyle has worked on discovering exoplanets with NASA’s Kepler mission. Today, he’s leading a project that could be equally groundbreaking: building a framework for understanding alien languages.

Since 1987, Doyle has worked at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute, where he is a principal investigator on an assignment to imagine how another intelligent civilization might communicate. Of course, there are no known alien languages available to study today — if they even exist in the first place — so Doyle is using intelligent animal languages as a guidepost.

To do this, Doyle and his colleagues have collected a range of sounds made by dolphins and humpback whales. They currently have 180,000 dolphin whistles that they use to analyze the sea creatures’ syntax, the same way a linguist would for human sounds.

Unlike other intelligent animals, like monkeys, Doyle says, “humpback whales and bottlenose dolphins depend upon signals that are acoustic,” whereas other creatures can also rely on body language cues. “Therefore, we can obtain and classify the different units of their signaling systems and [be] sure that we’re getting all of them, because humpback whales generally don’t gesture or smile.”

Humpback whales happen to be one of the most socially complex animals on earth. “[They] form long-lasting relationships based on profession, just like humans,” Doyle says. “They’re the only other species known to do that.”

To break the code of aquatic animal communication, Doyle and his team use what are called intelligence filters, which help measure a language’s complexity. The filter they rely on most often is called Zipf’s law.
> # Doyle says the complexities of long-distance communication in the ocean also applies to space.

Named after 20th-century linguist [George Kingsley Zipf](&lt;|url|&gt;), the law is a mathematical pattern that all human languages share. To discover this pattern, Zipf had his students count the letters in James Joyce’s *Ulysses*. The most commonly used letter was E, followed by T, and then A, and so on. They did the same for more books in different languages.

Zipf’s law says that the most frequent letters and words in a language occur exponentially more often than a language’s least common letters and words. Plotted out on a graph, all human languages look the same for this reason. The communication of bottlenose dolphins and humpback whales meet or come close to this pattern as well. Even human infants and dolphin babies share communication patterns, Doyle has found.

“We could mathematically show that dolphins babble when they’re born and have to learn their language just like humans,” Doyle says.

How might these learnings translate into understanding an extraterrestrial language?

Should such a language become available for study, Doyle says the team “would analyze the entropic structure and see how complex [the language] is. This may be a direct measure of their societal complexity.” Doyle also wants to understand how communication might happen over time and space, another spot where sea creature communication comes in handy.

“Humpback whales send messages to each other across long distances,” Doyle explains. “They wait, maybe for hours, for a reply.”

Water is a great conductor of sound, and humpback whales can call out to each other as loudly as 190 decibels—on par with a jet engine. The complexities of long-distance communication in the ocean also applies to space, Doyle says. When NASA sends commands to spacecrafts in deep space, the agency deals with one-way light-time communication. NASA sends a command and has to wait for the response.

Blue whales specifically used to have regular communication between the North and South poles, but when oil supertankers became more prevalent at sea, these communications became less frequent. Scientists believe it is because blue whales sent these signals at five hertz, which is the same frequency of sound that supertankers put out, so communication was disrupted. The whales are still able to communicate, but not as effectively.

“Say a blue whale wants to meet another blue whale, and one’s starting from the South Pole–ish, around Antarctica, and the other’s starting from the Bering Sea, near the North Pole,” Doyle explains. “It’s going to take them several weeks to a month to even meet. We wonder: How do they handle a communication system? How do they communicate one way?”

By attempting to answer these questions, Doyle and his team hope to increase their ability to both identify an incoming message from another civilization and understand it. For now, they will continue to study the complex conversations that happen at sea, while the sounds of the cosmos remain a mystery.<|endoftext|>

# An A.I. Pioneer Wants an FDA for Facial Recognition

## Erik Learned-Miller helped create one of the most important face datasets in the world. Now he wants to regulate his creation.

![Image: University of Massachusetts, Amherst](<|image|>)*Image: University of Massachusetts, Amherst*

Erik Learned-Miller is one reason we talk about facial recognition at all.

In 2007, years before the current A.I. boom made “deep learning” and “neural networks” common phrases in Silicon Valley, Learned-Miller and three colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Amherst released a dataset of faces titled Labelled Faces in the Wild.

To you or me, Labelled Faces in the Wild just looks like folders of unremarkable images. You can [download them](&lt;|url|&gt;) and look for yourself. There’s a picture of Alec Baldwin pointing at someone off camera. There’s Halle Berry smiling at the Oscars. There’s boxer Joe Gatti, gloves raised mid-fight. But to an artificial intelligence algorithm, these folders contain the essence of what it means to look like a human.

This is why Labelled Faces in the Wild, often abbreviated as LFW, is so important. It’s cited in some of the most impactful facial recognition research in the past decade. When Google and Facebook were competing in 2014 and 2015 on facial recognition accuracy, the common test was performance categorizing LFW images, which exist in an unchanging database. LFW has been cited [nearly 3,500 times](&lt;|url|&gt;), by researchers at Microsoft and Stanford, computer scientists in China and Hong Kong, and by Geoff Hinton, the guy responsible for neural networks in the first place.

It’s a big deal.

But now that artificial intelligence is also big business, Learned-Miller is thinking about ways to rein in the technology. His prevailing idea right now: Regulate A.I. the way the FDA regulates the medical device industry. He doesn’t have an official name for it yet, but one idea he’s mulling: the FDA 2: the Facial recognition and Detection Agency.
> # Learned-Miller is thinking about ways to rein in the technology. His prevailing idea right now: Regulate A.I. the way the FDA regulates the medical device industry.

One problem is that facial recognition doesn’t work as well as it should. Research has shown that facial recognition used in the real world has problems with bias: It performs significantly better on people with lighter skin than people with darker skin and is better classifying males than females. This is attributed to biases in the data that algorithms analyze to learn the differences between faces. LFW, for instance, features mostly white males, so it’s not surprising that algorithms trained on the dataset have trouble with faces that fall outside those parameters.

The technology landscape in 2019 is a lot different than it was in 2007, when LFW was first released. Artificial intelligence as we know it today was mostly research, and only a few schools, like NYU and the University of Toronto, were interested in so-called neural networks. Today, artificial intelligence [can and is being used](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the real world. Internet-connected cameras can send images to data centers to use facial recognition in real time, and smartphones — like newer iPhones with FaceID — commonly use the technology as a security feature. Government agencies have taken a keen interest in facial recognition as well. The FBI has used facial recognition based on driver’s license and passport photos for law enforcement with little oversight for years, which Congress recently [questioned](&lt;|url|&gt;) during a House Oversight Committee hearing. What was research 10 years ago can now be carried in the palm of your hand.

For Learned-Miller, that research started in the 1980s and ’90s from a simple idea: Humans are really, really good at recognizing faces. Replicating that ability would be an important step for bettering artificial intelligence as a whole, since the human skill of recognizing millions of different face patterns could be used for other computer vision tasks.

“From a science point of view, people’s ability in face recognition has until very recently been considered just mind-blowingly good,” Learned-Miller tells *OneZero.* “It’s only our massive exposure to human faces, and the importance of recognizing properly, that causes us to have evolved and learn to differentiate amongst them. It’s an incredibly interesting capability.”

Learned-Miller tells a story about how, when walking down the streets of San Francisco, he recognized someone he hadn’t seen in 25 years. Even after their face had changed due to age, and even though Learned-Miller had seen millions of faces seen in the years between, his brain was still able to recognize the person and remember who it was.

He says computer facial recognition just didn’t work anywhere close to human level in 2007. Before bias was even an issue, researchers just wanted to make facial recognition work at all.

Inaccurate facial recognition can lead to problems of varying severity. On the milder end, perhaps a certain smartphone won’t recognize darker-skinned faces as well for features like portrait lighting. On the other end, a product like Google Photos might associate black people with the keyword “[gorilla](&lt;|url|&gt;).” Or poor facial recognition could lead to law enforcement identifying the wrong person as a suspect in a crime.

This puts Learned-Miller in an uncomfortable position: The technology is already out in the world, but not the way it should be. He says he’s been offered grants to produce another big facial recognition database but turned them down in order to continue research on how to build facial recognition datasets that are more equitable and compliant with new data laws like Europe’s GDPR.

“You might say the easy way out is to stop doing research, but that’s actually not an easy way out anymore, because we have unfair [datasets] out there,” Learned-Miller says. “We’re in this crazy kind of bind where it looks like there’s no good direction to go, but we’re not in a good place either.”

Learned-Miller’s FDA 2 solution isn’t to abandon the research, but to regulate how it’s used. His idea is to emulate the FDA’s clearance process for medical devices. Since the limitations of medical devices can literally mean the difference between life and death, the FDA mandates exhaustive tests on the situations in which everything from catheters to surgical tools will and won’t work. It’s called 510(k) clearance.

“I used to be in the medical device industry, so I’ve authored these things myself, and they’re huge documents that give you results of studies and all these other things,” Learned-Miller says. “There’s so many aspects of this which are a good fit with face recognition. One of the big ones is intended use and the data that you have support that intended use.

“And the opposite is, of course, the counter-indications: ‘Look, we’ve never tested this software on nighttime images; therefore, you should not use the software on nighttime. We never tested this with children under 15, and therefore you shouldn’t use it for children under 15,’ and so forth,” he says.

Labelled Faces in the Wild isn’t going anywhere, and it’s not changing. It can’t — one of the most important aspects of LFW is that it stays constant. It’s a benchmark, one where people can test their algorithms on the same level playing field.

But it could use disclosures. Learned-Miller says the dataset wasn’t intended to be employed as a test to clear an algorithm for use in the real world.
> # Just as a drug might come with a warning… so could a facial recognition system be labeled with do’s and don’ts that clearly outline what users can expect.

“I may do this soon, put up a little disclaimer on the LFW site that says, ‘Look, just because you did well on this database doesn’t mean that your software is ready for deployment,” he says. “This is not a golden check mark that says your face recognition is ready for anything. I think most people understand that, but some don’t. It doesn’t look at kids. It doesn’t look at really old people. There are not that many women in it.”

This brings us back to Learned-Miller’s FDA 2 idea. The FDA exists to ensure a supplement on the drugstore shelf won’t kill you, but there’s no such oversight for facial recognition at the moment, even though it, too, could have fatal consequences if used incorrectly. Just as a drug might come with a warning that those taking it shouldn’t drink or work heavy machinery, so could a facial recognition system be labeled with clear do’s and don’ts that outline what users can expect.

“These are all big standard mechanisms that dramatically improve the efficacy and safety of a drug,” Learned-Miller says. “Nobody would think about going back to the days when we didn’t have [the FDA]. So I think it’s doable, but it’s going to take time.”<|endoftext|>

# Are Man-Made Glaciers the Answer to the Himalayas’ Melting Ice?

## How one man’s plan to irrigate the Ladakh desert is drawing inspiration and critics

![All photos courtesy of Adam Popescu](<|image|>)*All photos courtesy of Adam Popescu*

LADAKH, INDIA — In a region with scant water — less than 4 inches of annual rainfall — Sonam Wangchuk, a mechanical engineer by trade, has taken it upon himself to irrigate the mountainous desert of Ladakh, a sprawling Himalayan region that borders China and Pakistan. Ladakh translates to “land of high passes,” and with mountains that average about 20,000 feet, it’s no exaggeration. This combination of isolation and hostile environment has made this region imperiled and in many ways a fool’s errand. Wangchuk believes it’s an opportunity for true climate change.

He’s built a dozen man-made glaciers which he says release 2.6 million gallons of runoff to thousands of struggling farmers in the area. His designs collect ice in winter and then slowly melt that ice to hydrate parched summer fields.

![Sonam Wangchuk](<|image|>)*Sonam Wangchuk*

Wangchuk’s man-made glaciers are 90-foot high domed structures shaped like traditional Tibetan Buddhist mounds. It’s so cold in Ladakh that when glacial stream water is pumped into the air, it solidifies around the wire or tree branch frame to form conical, temple-like glaciers. Known colloquially as [ice stupas](&lt;|url|&gt;), Wangchuk uses plastic piping and sleeping bags donated by the army which are wrapped around the pipes to provide insulation at a minimal cost. Situated in mountain valleys where runoff feeds adjacent villages when these glaciers melt, the runoff feeds community crops.

“It’s a leap of faith,” admits Wangchuk, 52, in an office-bedroom at his [experimental, environment-friendly school](&lt;|url|&gt;), just outside Leh, the capital of Ladakh.

The idea to build man-made glaciers was born in 2013 when Wangchuk was walking through Ladakh and noticed that a massive chunk of river ice lasted into summer. A year later, [with the blessing of the Dalai Lama’s deputy](&lt;|url|&gt;)— His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche — and the help of student volunteers, Wangchuk raised $[125,000](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Indiegogo and built a prototype. In 2016, he received a $100,000 Rolex Award for Enterprise. The prize money went to help grow the project and his schools, which he says are geared towards students who fall through the cracks.

![](<|image|>)

Most locals here are farmers, and with almost no rain, they’re understandably edgy when it comes to where they get their water from. Around here, that means runoff from glaciers which melt in the summer months. But Wangchuk’s model could be, at least partially, a larger solution to changing environments. Seventy percent of the earth’s surface is covered by water, though a mere 0.75% of that is freshwater and available for human use since most is locked in permafrost or glacial ice. Most of the water we rely on is subterranean groundwater. If water is a proxy for life there may not be a more apt analogy than in these mountains.
> # “Anytime someone brings a new idea, it takes time for change to be accepted.”

Stretching 2,000 miles and eight countries, glacial runoff from the Himalayas and adjacent Hindu Kush mountains gives birth to 10 major river systems. Ranging across China, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan, these glaciers feed the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, and Mekong rivers, supplying nearly half the world with food, energy, clean air, and incomes. Nearly a third of the 250 million people in this trans-border landscape live on less than $1.90 a day. Over 30% don’t have enough to eat, and half face malnutrition.

Even if the carbon cuts called for in the 2015 Paris agreement are met, [a third of these glaciers will disappear](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the end of the century.

The loss of this “Third Pole,” the biggest frozen store of water outside the Arctic and Antarctic, means no ice on iconic areas like Mount Everest. It also means widespread food shortages and famine which could threaten the nearly 4 billion people living in the Indian subcontinent, South Asia, and China.

In some places in the range, like Ladakh, receding glaciers mean sustained drought and [glacial melt](&lt;|url|&gt;) that accelerates desertification, causing an increase in erosion and occasional flash floods, a cycle that also limits prey capacity and threatens wildlife like plants, another essential piece of this economy as ecotourism grows. (2.5 million tourists come to Ladakh annually.)

![A village in Ladakh and its surrounding areas.](<|image|>)*A village in Ladakh and its surrounding areas.*

A generation earlier, another Ladakhi engineer had a similar idea: [Chewang Norphel](&lt;|url|&gt;), also known as the “Ice Man,” developed a way to divert glacial melt into constructed canals and embankments where those shallow pools froze. In winter, ice accumulated, a process called glacier grafting. It’s still practiced, but the glaciers are high in the mountains and the ice doesn’t last long since it’s not very deep. Wangchuk’s designs are in the villages. And now they’re spreading.

There’s at least one similar stupa in Pakistan and a few in the Alps. In Switzerland, where retreating glaciers have hit the ski economy, Wangchuk’s stupas have been used in the [village of Pontresina](&lt;|url|&gt;), though locals there admit they’re more of a tourist attraction than a true fix for the receding Morteratsch Glacier.

Wangchuk’s glaciers fit into his strategy of developing large-scale innovations to combat the changes his fellow Ladakhis deal with on a daily basis. He’s also building a [high-altitude university](&lt;|url|&gt;) to serve as a test center for climate issues that is located just a few miles from SECMOL, the Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh school where he lives and teaches. The campus features organic farming with composted soil and reclaimed water, apple orchards, solar pumps, bricks formed around plastic water bottles, and 40-foot shipping containers reconfigured as dormitories. In 2017, he won a [Global Award for Sustainable Architecture](&lt;|url|&gt;) for these very designs, a formula [copied by the Indian army](&lt;|url|&gt;) at 21 winter bases spread throughout Ladakh.

This work has made Wangchuk quite famous in India, so much so that his [stupas were placed on a national postage stamp](&lt;|url|&gt;). But the man himself is quite polarizing. In Ladakh, some communities that are downstream from diverted waterways say they’re losing out. Last year there were other village disputes over water rights. Farmers in Phey, a stone’s throw from Wangchuk’s school, claim they’re being deprived of water they would normally use in winter.

![](<|image|>)

The concept of seeding a now-irrigated desert with trees, dubbed Green Ladakh, is another part of the plan that some locals say doesn’t suit the climate. “I don’t understand the logic for the stupas,” says David Sonam, a co-owner of [Snow Leopard Lodge](&lt;|url|&gt;), a small hotel in the Ladakhi village of Ulley. “How much water can it give? There’s no reason for a Green Ladakh. Ladakh doesn’t need trees. Ladakh doesn’t need to be green.”

Wangchuk claims local fears are unfounded, and that his designs freeze water that would otherwise be lost. In late spring, the stupa melt is collected in large tanks and distributed onto fields via drip-irrigation. “Anytime someone brings a new idea, it takes time for change to be accepted,” he explains.

Yet the conflict over the glaciers is becoming increasingly complex. Phey’s village head, Tsering Motup, and a group of other families are lobbying local officials to shut it down. Meanwhile, representatives from a village further downstream, Phyang, argue they are, in fact, benefitting from the runoff. Wangchuk has said the stream in question has about 100 million cubic meters of water flowing annually and that both villages only use a tenth of that during the five-month farming season.

“If we channelize the rest of the wasted water into large lake-sized reservoirs along the hillside on the Phyang desert, then roughly 6 million cubic meters can be stored for later use,” Wangchuk recently wrote in a letter to officials, adding that his project is the only way to restore groundwater.

A government body was formed to investigate, but months later, the stupas remain. They’ve even been turned into a sort of tourist attraction: you [can climb one](&lt;|url|&gt;) and get a coffee in another — inside an[ ice cafe](&lt;|url|&gt;).

So is Wangchuk’s project real or pipe dream? “I don’t imagine that the ice stupas will work everywhere, because they need a specific combination of steep terrain, cold air, and streams that still run through the cold part of the year,” says Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the head of the [Oceans Melting Greenland Project](&lt;|url|&gt;), which measures the continent’s ice cap. That said, Willis believes the stupas do have local value. “The rough terrain and the reliably cold winters in the Himalayas make this a very elegant solution for these remote villages.”

[Martin Truffer](&lt;|url|&gt;), a University of Alaska glaciologist, disagrees. “This is more a publicity stunt than a meaningful way forward,” he says. “If you created an artificial pond of the same volume as the ice stupa, you would also store water and the release of the water would be more controlled than in the case of just letting it melt.”

A few weeks after my time in Ladakh, I met [Dr. Mandira Shrestha](&lt;|url|&gt;), a water resource specialist at the [International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the intergovernmental body that recently published a landmark report on the Himalayan glacial melt — in Kathmandu. Dr. Shrestha knows Wangchuk and she says even something as seemingly small and gimmicky can “help disaster risk reduction.”

“We live in a multi-hazard environment: drought, floods, landslides, storms, they’re all cascading impacts, one leading to another,” says Dr. Shrestha. Projects like this are an incremental step to preventing those future problems. “We need to be adaptable. And I’m hopeful.”

Wangchuk’s plan may be an incremental step forward at most, but it may also represent the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that’s needed. Without it, we may have already lost.<|endoftext|>

# The Progressive Case for Cashless Stores

## Everyone should be concerned about unbanked populations losing access to an increasingly cashless economy

![Credit: FatCamera/iStock/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: FatCamera/iStock/Getty Images Plus*

Last year on November 26, Elgin Brack and his uncle Scott sat in an idling car outside of a Duane Reade in the New York borough of Queens. Around 3:30 a.m., Elgin got out of the car and allegedly entered the store with a gun, where instead of robbing the store of its cash, he reportedly got in an argument with the cashier and [shot him in the head](&lt;|url|&gt;). Elgin and his uncle allegedly went on to rob four more stores at gunpoint.

Two days later, New York City Councilman Ritchie Torres [introduced legislation](&lt;|url|&gt;) requiring all stores and restaurants in the city to accept cash.

Councilman Torres’ bill—one of [several similar efforts](&lt;|url|&gt;) in states and cities—is trying to solve a real problem. Cashless stores and restaurants like Sweetgreen and Dos Toros are becoming increasingly common, but they theoretically discriminate against people who don’t have access to cashless payment methods like debit and credit cards, a group that is poor and disproportionately black and Hispanic. Most debit and credit cards require consumers to have a bank account, and with [14 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) unbanked adults in the U.S.—people who lack a checking or savings account—that isn’t a reality for everyone. By requiring all stores and restaurants in New York City to accept cash, Torres hopes to ensure the unbanked won’t be effectively banned from these stores.

Unfortunately this new policy unnecessarily exposes front line retail and restaurant workers—a group that is also [disproportionately poor and people of color](&lt;|url|&gt;)—to the risks of carrying cash, burdens the businesses that employ the people Torres hopes to help by forcing them to take on the operational costs of cash, and fails to address the larger problem of unbanked people being unable to access the online economy.

Instead of trying to resist the transition away from using cash, we should be focused on making sure that unbanked people have cheap or free access to cashless payment methods to ensure that everyone can participate in the full economy—both physical and digital.

## The unbanked problem

Everyone should be concerned about unbanked populations losing access to an increasingly cashless economy. In the United States, [6.5 percent](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the population is unbanked, including 16.8 percent of black people and 14 percent of Hispanic people. Over 50 percent of those who are unbanked said they don’t have enough money to have a checking account.

While the unbanked population has been steadily decreasing (from [7.7 percent in 2013](&lt;|url|&gt;) to 6.5 percent in 2017), ensuring that this disadvantaged population continues to have access to the market should be of concern to both government leaders and the businesses that unbanked people should have access to.

![Source: [FDIC](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Source: [FDIC](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

To this point, [many](&lt;|url|&gt;) [people](&lt;|url|&gt;) [have](&lt;|url|&gt;) pointed out that brick-and-mortar retailers that don’t accept cash discriminate against unbanked people. So far, it appears the problem of access to brick-and-mortar businesses right now is mostly theoretical. In a February 2018 [article in *Eater](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, Christine Gianakis, the spokesperson for the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs, acknowledged that cashless establishments aren’t “something the DCA has received many complaints on.” The reality is that cashless businesses cater to customers who can already afford $5 coffees and $15 salads and, therefore, are unlikely to be unbanked to begin with.
> # Do we try to keep the status quo and force businesses to accept cash and its downsides, or do we work to accelerate giving unbanked people access to the cashless economy?

Still, just because a problem doesn’t currently exist does not mean it won’t in the future. Nor should we excuse a discriminatory condition even if it doesn’t appear to be currently causing harm. The question is, do we try to keep the status quo and force businesses to accept cash and its downsides, or do we work to accelerate giving unbanked people access to the cashless economy?

Unlike cases where unbanked people can’t buy things at cashless stores, examples of violent robberies of restaurants and stores are not hard to find. There’s the Target in Manhattan where robbers forced the manager to hand over more than [$45,000 at gunpoint](&lt;|url|&gt;). Or the Sweetgreen (now a cashless store) in Union Square where Johnell Turner [allegedly pulled out a gun](&lt;|url|&gt;) and said, “You really don’t want to die for Sweetgreen.” Or the Baltimore cafe that went cashless after being robbed [five times](&lt;|url|&gt;) in four months.

In 2018, retail businesses in the United States experienced [5,753 robberies](&lt;|url|&gt;), 57 percent of which were armed robberies; [488 people died](&lt;|url|&gt;) violent deaths that year as a result. Many of the people who died were retail sales workers, cashiers, and store managers—people who are often paid at or near minimum wage.

Until recently, cash was a required part of a functioning economy, and the crime surrounding it was an inevitable side effect. For most businesses, this remains the reality. But with a cashless economy, we have an opportunity to reduce the risk that retail workers are put in every day, and forcing businesses to accept cash would be an unmitigated step backward in improving the safety of retail workers.

Perhaps the most obvious case against cash is that it has become a relatively slow form of payment. It requires manual counting by both the customer and the cashier and the shuffle of giving change and putting it away. Chef Nelson German, owner of San Francisco restaurant AlaMar, estimates that transactions without cash are [seven seconds faster](&lt;|url|&gt;) than those without.

It may not seem like much, but for high-volume restaurants and retail stores, those few seconds can significantly impact their business. Sweetgreen estimates that since going cashless, it’s able to serve up to [15 percent more customers](&lt;|url|&gt;) per hour. When a business depends on the lunchtime rush to meet its revenue plan, this can have a huge impact on its ability to survive and grow.

The reality is that the cashiers, dishwashers, and food preparers who work at restaurants are [disproportionately poor and people of color.](&lt;|url|&gt;) The more customers you can serve, the more staff you need. The more successful your stores, the greater your ability to expand and hire (and promote) even more workers. Any policy that negatively affects these small- and medium-sized businesses risks unintentionally harming the people who work there.

## Cash isn’t digital

Amazon, Wish, Brandless, and the New York City government are all online experiences that require debit or credit cards. When looking at the disadvantages faced by unbanked people, the largest problem is that the modern economy is rapidly shifting online, where cash cannot be accepted at all. The inability to shop at discount stores like Amazon, Overstock, and Wish limits access to goods that are often cheaper than those in brick-and-mortar stores. Additionally, there is now a class of products that aren’t even sold in stores: a new breed of businesses like Dollar Shave Club, Everlane, and Brandless are offering superior products for less by skipping retail altogether and selling their goods directly online.

Government services themselves are increasingly being provided over the internet as well. In New York City, those of us who have a debit or credit card can conveniently [pay parking tickets online](&lt;|url|&gt;). If you’re unbanked, you’re required to take the trip to pay your ticket in person, taking away valuable time people could use supporting themselves or their family.
> # While requiring stores and restaurants to accept cash certainly can’t hurt unbanked people, it seems unlikely to actually help them and risks distracting from solving the real problems they face in accessing the online economy.

Between a lack of access to cheap products, products that aren’t sold in stores, and government services provided online, it’s clear that the unbanked are increasingly being excluded from our economy in a much more significant way than not being able to buy a $12 burrito at Dos Toros.

Requiring cash acceptance at restaurants to combat unfair treatment of unbanked people is like putting a Band-Aid on a broken arm. While requiring stores and restaurants to accept cash certainly can’t hurt unbanked people, it seems unlikely to actually help them, and it risks distracting from solving the real problems they face in accessing the online economy.

Debit and credit cards issued by banks aren’t the only way that someone can make cashless transactions. Prepaid debit cards and other alternatives provide an easy and widely distributed alternative to traditional checking accounts. Many convenience stores already stock Visa and American Express gift cards that can easily be used in cashless transactions. Better yet, new services like [Bluebird by American Express](&lt;|url|&gt;) allow for anyone to have many of the benefits of a traditional debit card without the need for a permanent address or a social security number. In fact, this is already starting to happen: 26.7 percent of the unbanked population is already using prepaid debit cards of some kind.

While we’re still in the early stages of a transition to a cashless economy, policy makers like Councilman Torres should focus on ensuring unbanked people have access to the cashless economy. This could come in many forms: requiring cashless businesses to have vending machines for free prepaid debit cards, subsidies for access to debit card alternatives, or requiring banks to offer products that reduce or remove the barriers unbanked people are facing. By increasing access to cashless payment methods, we will both solve the problem of discrimination in cashless stores and address the much larger problem of access to the online economy.

What doesn’t help progress is a well-intentioned but misguided policy that solidifies our dangerous and inefficient reliance on cash and doesn’t actually address the core issues creating the disenfranchisement of unbanked people.<|endoftext|>

# Your Itchy Dog May Need a Poop Pill

## Just like their owners, cats and dogs are becoming more allergic to their environments

![Credit: John McKeen/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: John McKeen/Getty Images*

Belle was a wreck when Rhianna Mathias adopted the dog from a rescue organization in St. Louis a few years ago. The five-year-old pit bull had a range of health problems, with heartworms being the most serious. But allergies seemed to bring Belle the greatest misery. She could not stop scratching her inflamed, ravaged skin.

[Studies](&lt;|url|&gt;) indicate that the rate of allergy diagnosis in humans has spiked during the last 50 years. But now there is reason to believe our pets, like Belle, are increasingly suffering from allergies as well. Banfield Pet Hospitals, one of the largest chains of pet clinics in the world, puts out regular reports on the state of the health of the 2.5 million dogs and 500,000 cats it treats. According to the organization’s [2018 report](&lt;|url|&gt;), flea allergies have surged 67% in cats and 12% in dogs over the past 10 years. Environmental allergies (for things like dust mites and pollen) have gone up 30.7% in dogs and 11% in cats.

Apart from Banfield’s reports, however, there’s relatively little data on increases in autoimmune problems in dogs and cats over time. And just as in humans, it’s difficult to parse how much of the spike in allergies is a result of better diagnosis, notes Leah Isaacson, a veterinarian in California. “The itchy dog 30 years ago isn’t the same itchy dog of today in terms of the length that we’ll go to and the things that we can do to make them feel better,” she says.

One possible reason for the uptrend in dog and cat allergies—and human ones for that matter—is the so-called “hygiene hypothesis.” The theory attributes the rise of allergies and autoimmune problems in [wealthier countries](&lt;|url|&gt;) to a lack of exposure to microbes and parasites that humans have long evolved to live with. Without these regular interactions—which have become rarer as overall hygiene has improved—our immune systems are prone to overreacting, sparking allergies.

“Our pets have experienced the same shift in their ecology that we have,” says Thomas Sharpton, an assistant professor at Oregon State University and co-author of a [study](&lt;|url|&gt;) looking at how a dog’s unique mix of gut bacteria—known as a microbiome—is associated with aggression.

“That shift in our ecology over evolutionary time scales has affected the kinds of microbes we are exposed to, “ he says. ”We’re really only beginning to understand the implication of that shift for own physiology, much less our pets.”

And just like in humans, says Jan Suchodolski, a veterinary researcher at Texas A&M, the wide use of antibiotics could be [exacerbating](&lt;|url|&gt;) autoimmune problems by disrupting the gut microbiome in a way that sets off a hypersensitized immune [response](&lt;|url|&gt;) throughout the body.
> # Think of your gut as a jungle ecosystem: a single plant, or bacterial species, won’t make much of a difference. But a stool transplant is like dropping a new jungle on top of an old one.

“The normal gut microbiota help maintain a proper immune system,” says Suchodolski, who studies animal microbiomes. A microbiome disrupted by antibiotics could potentially create conditions like skin allergies.

Similar to their owners, treatments for pet allergies range from antihistamines, to immune-suppressing drugs like prednisone, to special diets. But some pet owners are seeking out even more radical methods, including stool transplants. Fecal transplantation involves taking the screened poop of a healthy organism and transferring it to a sick one, either orally or rectally. It may sound gross—and it is gross—but it works so well in humans that it’s an approved treatment for people suffering from certain gastrointestinal conditions. Think of your gut as a jungle ecosystem: a single plant, or bacterial species, won’t make much of a difference, if it even survives the journey to the jungle. But a stool transplant is like dropping a new jungle on top of an old one.

“It’s the easiest way to shift the microbiome back into a balanced state relatively quickly,” says Holly Ganz, a microbiologist who co-founded Animal Biome, a company that offers microbiome tests and stool pills for pets.

Fecal transplants for animals aren’t new; they were pioneered by vets a century ago to improve the health of livestock, notes Ganz. Ganz launched a crowdfunding campaign to test the microbiome of cats in 2015. She promoted her “kitty biome” Kickstarter through Twitter and managed to raise almost $25,000 through a sizable contingent of contributors looking for help for their cats’ chronic digestive problems. She started Animal Biome in 2016 in response to those pet owners.

In an unpublished pilot study of over 100 of Animal Biome’s dog and cat clients, more than 80% saw improvement in their symptoms for chronic diarrhea and vomiting—conditions that can be related to autoimmune problems—after taking the poop pills.

Donor poop is carefully screened for pathogens and parasites and Animal Biome tries to source the poop from animals that are both physically and mentally healthy, which is harder than you might imagine. Ganz has been working with consumers, vets, and pet food companies to develop the poop pills and future “microbial cocktails.”

Isaacson, who serves on the board of Animal Biome, used poop pills to treat her own cat, who had loose stools when he was a kitten. He’s been “right as rain ever since,” says Isaacson. But fecal transplants aren’t always so effective. She and Ganz emphasize that treatment plans for pets need to be holistic and include diet changes as well as addressing the source of a potential allergy. “Behavior, the gut flora, the food that they eat—all that stuff. It all is linked,” says Isaacson.

It’s been more than four years since Belle was adopted by Rhianna Mathias, and the formerly lethargic dog is now peppy and free of allergies. “She’s just a big goofy normal dog now, with no issues” says Mathias. Belle’s allergy treatment included a special diet and prednisone, and in time, her skin allergy subsided. And although she never received a fecal transplant, Mathias says, “She totally eats her own poop.”<|endoftext|>

# Apple Should Bring Back the Clickwheel iPod

## It’s time to change everything… back

![Illustration: Noah Baker. Source Photo: Science & Society Picture Library/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Illustration: Noah Baker. Source Photo: Science & Society Picture Library/Getty Images Plus*

We need fewer things that do everything.

The [iPod Touch](&lt;|url|&gt;)—which is ultimately an iPhone without the phone—is a device without a clear purpose. Its cohort is large and, it seems, endlessly growing: 12 years after the [LG Prada](&lt;|url|&gt;) arguably launched the smartphone as we know it, we’re drowning in rectangular, internet-connected screens with apps that let you do the same thing over and over. Even your fridge can have a big tablet grafted to the front, and yes, you can[ watch TV](&lt;|url|&gt;) on it.

So, we certainly don’t need a new iPod Touch. But Apple is [rumored](&lt;|url|&gt;) to be developing one anyway.

Let’s ignore for a second the thing that most demands our attention—a literal heap of [electronic-waste](&lt;|url|&gt;) that grows with each new gadget shipment—and think about the situation in terms of pure utility. The iPod Touch exists more for the company than it does for you: As *AppleInsider *has [pointed](&lt;|url|&gt;) out, it’s a relatively inexpensive ([$199](&lt;|url|&gt;)) way to get an iOS device to customers and, therefore, a route to funnel money into services like Apple Music and iTunes—services that are [increasingly valuable](&lt;|url|&gt;) to Cupertino.

The device doesn’t exist in a vacuum, of course. The iPod Touch launched in 2007, six years after the [introduction](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the first iPod and shortly after Steve Jobs stepped on stage with the iPhone. “This changes everything,” he said. And it did. As smartphones and wireless internet spread, it seemed that everything with a screen should in fact have a touchscreen and that the availability of apps should be taken as a given whenever possible. Today, the Nintendo Switch has Hulu despite its junky display, the Google Home Hub has Crackle and Deezer, and your Michael Kors smartwatch can run iHeartRadio while you text from it. Touchscreens, internet, and apps are the three ingredients in the techno-molasses that has trapped us all.

Because our telephones are now essentially appendages linking our fingers and minds to the ever-growing expanse of the World Wide Web, we expect some continuity of service when we move from device to device. If you start a movie on your iPhone, you should be able to finish it on your PlayStation, and you should be able to stream *Fortnite *to Twitch with your Xbox for someone to watch on their Kindle Fire. The seed of the modern internet now has roots shooting through uncountable nodes, and any new device should strive to maintain those connections. Or so we’ve been told.

![The iPod Touch is, essentially, an iPhone without the phone. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*The iPod Touch is, essentially, an iPhone without the phone. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Plus*

The problem is that no one asked for this, exactly. Any app or service may be great on its own, but the connected universe of apps and services, with its constant din of notifications and distractions, has become overwhelming. It’s no big surprise that a debate around “[screen addiction](&lt;|url|&gt;)” has flared up in recent years. Apple itself recently [debuted](&lt;|url|&gt;) a feature that helps control your screen use. The “Time Well Spent” movement is, well, [an actual movement](&lt;|url|&gt;).

All of which is to say that the utility of any new smartphone-like device is now questionable at best. The technology is everywhere, and that everywhere-ness has become a burden to the modern internet user.
> # What may be more useful, now, at the turn of a new decade, is a renewed focus on individual devices that excel at individual purposes.

And so, back to the iPod Touch: What was once a simple if revolutionary music-listening device became, like everything else, an everything device. If you want, you can put Slack on your iPod. You can Skype with it. This might have been great a decade ago, when the novelty of these functions shielded us from their harms and there were far fewer of them to begin with, but in 2019, it’s a disaster. Though the burden may ultimately fall to an individual user to take responsibility for their own screen time, putting an App Store on a device is kind of like introducing Chekhov’s gun—expect the thing to be used.

What may be more useful, now, at the turn of a new decade, is a renewed focus on individual devices that excel at individual purposes. The classic clickwheel iPod was, for a time, the best portable music player. It helped you live your life with a soundtrack; so does an iPhone, but it will shudder with notifications and tempt you with apps that ask to be their own lived experiences. You could pop an earbud out midsong to give someone directions, but you can’t really hold a conversation with your mom while you’re reading a notification from Twitter.

When the paradigm shifted in consumer technology toward online services and social networking, Apple phased out the clickwheel and kept the Touch, a device that found some kind of parity with the iPhone. It was a sensible move that helped bring iOS to people who didn’t yet want to buy a smartphone. The entire market moved in this direction, and the differences between this thing and any other similar thing became boring and obvious. Different app ecosystems, perhaps. Different screen sizes. Same function.

Now, we have a parade of devices that are roughly the same amount of good at everything.The entire sales pitch of the iPad Pro is that it might also function as a laptop, and a [new category](&lt;|url|&gt;) of foldable screens has emerged in an effort to find the person who needs, at any given moment, both a [7.3-inch screen and a 4.6-inch one](&lt;|url|&gt;). The result is not to create new functionality; it’s to fit current functionality into whatever few open spots remain in our lives.

The invasion of the smart rectangles is, I’d bet, what drives our exhaustion more than any given app. The status quo is to interact with these things whenever possible. Stitching “Screen Time” into iOS can’t fix it.

But more purposeful devices could. An iPod that’s just for music—updated to work with the streaming Apple Music service, perhaps—might help us create space away from our phones, laptops, and tablets. In an era that’s seen [new minimalist phones](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [wild demand](&lt;|url|&gt;) for totally offline “classic” consoles from Nintendo, a revival doesn’t seem particularly unreasonable. Amazon still makes Kindle e-readers, after all: They’re less “functional” than the Kindle Fire tablet, perhaps, but there’s a reason many people prefer to read e-books on them.

So, bring back the clickwheel.

We’ve been moving to the point of app saturation for 12 years. For a time, there was a reason to be enthralled by the glossy black touchscreen and its many apps. Now we can feel how they’re broken, and how they’ve broken us. For a better tomorrow, we could do worse than to take inspiration from the past.<|endoftext|>

# Online Conspiracy Theories Start With the Young

## Middle school kids love watching videos about supposed celebrity secrets. But does this set them up to be radicalized by more dangerous ideas?

![Credit: Eduardo Angarita Muñoz/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Eduardo Angarita Muñoz/Getty Images*

*Co-authored with Rory Selinger*

Even when you think you know a lot about the online world, it’s still hard to know exactly what kind of guidance to give your kids. You may be [worried](&lt;|url|&gt;) about screen time, device distraction, oversharing, bullying, and appropriate levels of parental monitoring. But there’s so much more to address.

Recently, the *Atlantic *ran a shocking* *article headlined “[Instagram Is the Internet’s New Home for Hate](&lt;|url|&gt;),” which revealed a disturbing truth about the platform. While many older users view Instagram as a friendly (or [overly friendly](&lt;|url|&gt;)) place to share photos, kids have different agendas. They’re probing controversial ideas and experimenting with new identities to figure out who they are. In the process, journalist [Taylor Lorenz](&lt;|twitter|&gt;) writes, they’re exposed to “conspiracy theories, viral misinformation, and extremist memes all daisy-chained together via a network of accounts with incredible algorithmic reach and millions of collective followers — many of whom… are very young.”

This exposé hit home for us. Rory is a seventh-grader, and her dad, Evan, is a philosophy professor, and together we’ve had plenty of conversations about Rory’s Instagram account. What are family members posting? Get any requests from strangers? Are you [staying away from drama](&lt;|url|&gt;)? Yes, it’s a scam when a company says it wants to send our dog — who, like [so many pets](&lt;|url|&gt;), has her own page — discounted clothes to “model.” The list goes on — but it hasn’t extended to politics, much less the cesspool of political conspiracy theories.
> # How big or small is the leap from middle schoolers believing that Taylor Swift isn’t who she says she is to doubting the truth about the Parkland school shooting?

It turns out, however, that conspiracy theories are popular topics among Rory and her friends. At lunch, they chat about YouTube clips featuring stories about pop culture that revolve around secret and suggestive information. It’s stuff the mainstream media and other traditional authority figures aren’t acknowledging, are quick to deny, and are supposedly covering up. Is [Katy Perry actually JonBenet Ramsay](&lt;|url|&gt;)? Was [Britney Spears replaced by a clone](&lt;|url|&gt;)? Are [Jay-Z and Beyoncé members of the Illuminati](&lt;|url|&gt;)?

While it’s amusing to think of celebrities being replaced by biotech doppelgängers, these habits might embolden kids to go further down the rabbit hole of disbelief and incline them to embrace dangerous absurdities. Soon these kids will be as old as the teenagers profiled in the *Atlantic*, who Lorenz writes are checking out Instagram accounts that “intersperse TikTok videos and nostalgia memes with anti-vaccination rhetoric, conspiracy theories about George Soros and the Clinton family, and jokes about killing women, Jews, Muslims, and liberals.”

Comparing the two groups raises an unsettling question: How big or small is the leap from middle schoolers believing that [Taylor Swift isn’t who she says she is](&lt;|url|&gt;) to doubting the truth about the [Parkland school shooting](&lt;|url|&gt;) or [believing that climate change is a hoax](&lt;|url|&gt;)? Rory and Evan decided to talk it out.

## **Not sure what to believe**

### **Evan: Have your teachers talked with students about conspiracy theory videos?**

**Rory: **No. I’m honestly curious about whether this is a blip on their radar. Instead, they talk about not sharing your password and being kind when you’re online. One time, we got a worksheet with instructions for figuring out whether an article has real news or fake news. But even when we worked on the worksheet, it was more about having good sources for our essays. That is the only example I can think of where our teacher engaged us about social media and online safety, other than basic safety rules.

### **What kind of conspiracy theory videos are kids in your grade watching?**

The majority of the videos kids my age are watching are pop culture conspiracies based on celebrities. These videos are very appealing due to their titles and thumbnails, and kids click on the links because they see pictures of their favorite stars and they want to get exclusive information. We keep watching even though it can be scary, like when we’re told celebrities are murdered and cloned.

### **Do these videos talk about the government?**

Yes. Information about the government gets slipped in. Lots of videos combine multiple conspiracy theories together. But they tend not to be the main focus of discussion with my friends. So, maybe most of a video is about something that happened to a celebrity, but some small part is about stuff like whether the government faked the moon landing.

### **Why are these videos popular?**

They’re addictive. The people who post them have huge platforms and tons of followers. You feel special watching them.

### **How do kids know what to believe?**

We don’t. Are cloning centers real? We’ve never seen any. But so what? The government could be keeping things from us. We’re learning about chemistry this year in science. We don’t know what the real evidence is.
> # The only solution for preventing kids in middle school from sliding down a slippery path is for parents and teachers to help them develop critical thinking skills.

### **Do kids share these videos with each other on social media?**

No. Unlike funny videos or the images that my friends and I send each other, this spreads by word of mouth.

### **So, if parents are monitoring what kids in your grade are posting on social media, that won’t give them a clue as to how important conspiracy theory videos are?**

Right.

### **Do you think watching these videos will influence whether kids will believe in conspiracy theories when they get older?**

Yes. When you are watching these videos, you start to believe more and more, and then by the time a video with more dangerous or harmful information comes along, you are more susceptible to these intense theories.

### **Are conspiracy theory videos dangerous?**

Yes. Kids my age are naive, and even I have believed some of these absurd theories. They are captivating and hard to forget.

## **A step down a dangerous path**

On their own, the videos that Rory and her friends watch seem mostly harmless. And yet, we’re concerned they might represent a step down a dangerous path.

But we don’t know what the long-term impacts are going to be. Although conspiracy theories long [predate the digital age](&lt;|url|&gt;), kids today are born into a world where they carry smart devices everywhere. Wherever they go, they’re tempted by on-demand entertainment that’s optimized for short attention spans and uses slick visuals and snappy editing to call into question widely shared perceptions of reality.

Who knows what will happen as [deepfake technology](&lt;|url|&gt;) further develops? Early examples already feature highly realistic versions of public figures—celebrities and politicians alike—saying things they never said and doing things they never did.

Since videos about bizarre celebrity stories seem innocuous and nothing like toxic material that denies the Holocaust, we shouldn’t expect YouTube to block them or make them particularly hard to find. The only solution for preventing kids in middle school from sliding down a slippery path is for parents and teachers to help them develop critical thinking skills to avoid being suckered in by all conspiratorial narratives, however trivial or controversial.

Perhaps the most important lesson for kids to learn is just why conspiracy theories are appealing. Watching such videos can convince you that you’re special just because you think you know something special. Instead of taking the long and seemingly boring path your teachers recommend of thoroughly studying a topic, you learned something that most of society, including adults, just aren’t woke enough to appreciate.

Like many shortcuts in life, this one is too good to be true. And the costs are greater that wasted time, because these videos risk setting kids up to deny things that should never be doubted, like the tragic truth of what happened in Parkland.<|endoftext|>

# The Golden Age of the iPhone Is Ending

## The Golden Age of the iPhone Is Ending

### *As the smartphone market changes, Apple may be losing its edge*

![Photo: sombatkapan/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: sombatkapan/Getty*

“Don’t bet against Apple.” That’s my go-to mantra when someone asks me about Apple’s future as a market leader, or the success of any new iPhone. If the company’s performance this quarter didn’t wow you, the next one probably will.

Yet the wind is clearly shifting for the iPhone, with intensifying [worries](&lt;|url|&gt;) about sales figures, [diminishing](&lt;|url|&gt;) global demand for smartphones overall, rumors that Apple won’t make the [5G leap](&lt;|url|&gt;) for another year, and the company’s startling [decision](&lt;|url|&gt;) to stop disclosing unit sales for iOS devices and Macs in its financial reports. Though you’d be foolish to doubt Apple’s prospects, the status quo for its star product is, after many years, changing.

It’s no secret that much of Apple’s recent success has been driven by the now 11-year-old iPhone. Its rocket-like sales trajectory really began in 2009, after Apple introduced the App Store, a platform that transformed the iPhone from a beautiful gadget into a genuinely useful pocket device. Over the next decade, it narrowed our gaze from a wide vista to the distance between our eyes.
> # Apple and the iPhone are not immune to larger smartphone market forces.

Year-over-year iPhone sales grew by tens of millions, with post-holiday quarters setting monumental records. Looked at in isolation, it’s easy to think that Apple dominates the market, especially if you spend most of your time in the United States, where the iPhone has a commanding [39 percent market share](&lt;|url|&gt;) compared to its nearest rival, Samsung, which has 25 percent of the U.S. market. In the global market, [Apple trails Samsung and Huawei](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Apple and the iPhone are not immune to larger smartphone market forces. Smartphone sales growth has slowed over the last few years, and, perhaps thanks to market saturation, may even be in decline.

Tuong Nguyen, a senior principal analyst at Gartner, told me via email that although there’s been evidence of a slowing phone market for some time, Apple’s position as a higher-end brand and the overall prestige of the iPhone name may have shielded it a bit.

“Apple’s competitors have experienced it more acutely due to their broader exposure to the market,” Nguyen said.

Still, that Apple cachet, which was so obvious in the original iPhone, has gradually slipped away.

It’s hard to be special when the entire handset industry has coalesced around a handful of smartphone design principles. All-screen, notched displays with multiple cameras on the front and back are everywhere. A $549 [OnePlus 6](&lt;|url|&gt;) looks, from the front, a lot like an $1,199 iPhone XS Max. Even the tiny [Palm Phone](&lt;|url|&gt;) is a knockoff of the iPhone X design.

![](<|image|>)

To its credit, Apple’s iPhone doesn’t just look like a premium device as so many notched competitors do: It functions like one, too. The company commissions bespoke components to push processor, camera, and security performance. Still, Apple’s component lead threatens to crumble as [competitors plan major mobile CPU upgrades](&lt;|url|&gt;) and prepare for 5G networks. Apple may retain the raw performance lead in 2019 with, say, an A13 Bionic CPU. But if, as has been rumored, [Apple passes on 5G](&lt;|url|&gt;) at least until 2020, it will fall behind.

It seems unlikely that Apple can continue to charge premium prices for future handsets if the majority of the phone industry has a one-year head start on the fastest mobile connectivity technology.
> # Today, U.S. smartphone ownership [sits at 95 percent](&lt;|url|&gt;). Another shiny screen isn’t going to cut it.

If consumers are, as Nguyen sees it, already chafing at Apple’s higher price tags for incremental updates, how will they feel in a year, when Apple is virtually the only major handset manufacturer not natively supporting 5G? Granted, 5G infrastructure will not be ready for the majority of the U.S. market in 2019 and, more than seven years ago, Apple rightly [took the same slow approach with 4G](&lt;|url|&gt;).

In 2011, there were still questions about which flavor of 4G would survive, and the coverage across much of the U.S. was relatively anemic. With U.S. smartphone ownership in 2011 at only 35 percent (85 percent had cell phones), Apple could afford to wait on the relatively untested 4G. The leap from a basic feature phone to Apple’s all-touch, almost all-screen iPhone and its world of entertaining apps was enough for most feature phone users. Today, U.S. smartphone ownership [sits at 95 percent](&lt;|url|&gt;). Another shiny screen isn’t going to cut it.

In addition, Apple’s Teflon-like ability to resist smartphone market contractions may be wearing thin. Reports of lackluster demand for all of its new phones have dogged the company for weeks, buttressed by rumors that Apple is scaling back [orders from its third-party suppliers](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Apple has tried to beat back some of these rumors, claiming that the [iPhone XR is now its best-selling model](&lt;|url|&gt;). However, Apple quickly undercut its own argument by, for the first time in my memory, offering [substantial discounts on new models](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Apple’s previously weathered similar fear, uncertainty, and doubt (“FUD”), but rarely has the rumor mill had this kind of impact on the company’s stock price, which has taken an almost unprecedented [60-point slide since October](&lt;|url|&gt;).

These skittish investors could be wrong. Apple is still selling millions of iPhones, and I usually wait to reach any conclusions until the post-holiday earnings report, when blockbuster numbers inevitably erase rumors and concerns.

But that won’t be possible in 2019. As mentioned, Apple announced during its last earnings call that it will no longer break out unit sales for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. While Mac and iPad sales have been shrinking for years, iPhone sales are typically the bellwether for Apple’s success.

During [that earnings call](&lt;|url|&gt;), Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, offered a compelling justification for the change:
> *The number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. Furthermore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us today than it was in the past, given the breadth of our portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion within any given product line.*

He’s right. iPhone unit sales have never been broken out by model, and now there are seven to choose from. When Apple says it sold 45 million iPhones, we have no idea which model is driving the majority of sales, though [sometimes Apple tells us](&lt;|url|&gt;). In addition, the cadence of product releases, specifically iPhone product releases, means down quarters in-between new releases are inevitable, but hardly illustrate long-term performance. Still, the lack of transparency is cause for concern.

“It’s certainly suspicious when vendors become much more opaque about their sales, especially if it is in an increasingly tough market environment,” Nguyen told me.

Apple’s decision to stop reporting iPhone unit sales is, I think, an attempt to shift attention away from the iPhone. It’s also an acknowledgment that, over time, iPhone sales will flatten and even diminish as other sectors, like the [services business](&lt;|url|&gt;), rise to take its place. Apple’s services now include iCloud subscriptions, Apple Music, the App Store, and others.

On that same earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended the decision, saying that the installed base, basically the number of people with iOS devices, enjoys double-digit growth. More iOS users means more services customers, but it doesn’t necessarily mean new iPhone sales. Some Bank of America analysts argue that user growth is [coming from used iPhone sales](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Putting iPhone sales in a black box doesn’t necessarily mean we’ve reached the end of iPhone innovation, though recent changes have been incremental — larger screens, for example. Yet Apple still charges more and more for its flagship handsets. It’s a canny strategy. Even as unit sales fall, the revenue numbers could look just as good, if not better.

Apple’s roadmap for the iPhone looks a lot like the future of all smartphones; beautiful, smart slabs with only their services and company logos to set them apart. It’s the end of an era, perhaps, but certainly far from the end of the premium handset.<|endoftext|>

# Scientists Are Making THC and CBD Without Marijuana

## New research paves the way for cannabinoids without cannabis

As marijuana becomes increasingly mainstream — the legal cannabis market is [estimated](&lt;|url|&gt;) to reach $166 billion by 2025 — the potential for cannabis to change numerous industries from health to food is great. The future of cannabis may feature production facilities that have more in common with a craft beer brewery than a grow house — and leave out the plant altogether.

In a [paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) published today in the peer-reviewed journal *Nature*, biochemists at the University of California, Berkeley report what some cannabis industry experts are describing as a breakthrough in biosynthetic cannabinoid production. By using genetically modified yeast, the Berkeley scientists were able to convert simple sugars into the active chemical compounds in marijuana: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The scientists made THC and CBD — the chemicals that get users high and which have supposed medical benefits — without the marijuana plant.

The research could help make these compounds — which are produced in relatively low quantities by the plant — much cheaper and more widely available for medicinal and recreational use, potentially bypassing some of the common constraints for the traditional marijuana market, including sky-high energy needs and a complex, ever-shifting legal landscape.

“It’s an idea that many companies have been working on, but I’ve never seen anything so thorough,” says Daniele Piomelli, director of the University of California, Irvine’s Institute for the Study of Cannabis, who was not involved in the research. “It appears like a very substantial step forward.”

Over the last few years, biosynthesis — the process of producing complex molecules within living cells — has [quietly gained ground](&lt;|url|&gt;) as a way to satisfy the booming demand for nonsmokable cannabinoid products, like THC-laced snacks and CBD-infused oils. A handful of [American and Canadian companies](&lt;|url|&gt;) have begun to file patent applications for cannabinoid-producing yeast, E. coli, and other easily-manipulated microorganisms, usually keeping their research a secret to maintain their business advantage.

But Samuel Banister, a chemist at the University of Sydney’s Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics, who was also not involved in the research, says the *Nature* paper is the first public disclosure of the full process needed to make yeast produce cannabinoids at commercially-viable levels. He believes the work could also pave the way for yeast to synthesize some of the other cannabinoids besides THC and CBD, of which there are over a hundred, that could be promising for medical applications but are only found in cannabis plants at low levels.

The new research from the Berkeley scientists centers on the identification of a cannabis enzyme that can be transferred into yeast DNA so that it metabolizes sugar into cannabinoids instead of alcohol and carbon dioxide. Thanks to a [large public database](&lt;|url|&gt;) of cannabis DNA, scientists had identified dozens of potential candidates for this enzyme. But few are compatible enough with yeast DNA that they can produce large volumes of cannabinoids without side effects that damage the final product.

“You’re asking a yeast cell to make something it doesn’t normally make,” says Banister. “There’s always the chance it might be toxic or have other downstream effects on the viability of the cell.”
> # “It’s as easy as brewing beer.”

Jay Keasling, the biochemist at Berkeley who led the research, says his team tested dozens of options before finding the right combination of enzyme genes. Yeast is a good host organism, Keasling says, because its DNA is thoroughly documented and because it’s already in wide use for other commercial applications like beer-making and wine-making.

“It’s as easy as brewing beer,” says Keasling. “You feed the yeast sugar, it grows and replicates, produces the THC, and secretes it outside the cell so that it’s floating in the sugar water that the yeast is growing in. It comes in high concentrations, and then we purify it away and you’re left with a very pure white powder.”

Keasling filed a patent for this method back in 2017, and has since been hammering down the science and working with a Bay Area biotech startup, [Demetrix](&lt;|url|&gt;), to bring the process from the lab into commercial production. Over the next few years, the company hopes to bring the cost of production below $1,000 per kilogram, far below the cost of chemically-synthesized cannabinoids (tens of thousands of dollars per kilogram) or cannabinoids extracted from a plant (more than $5,000 per kilogram), according to Jeff Ubersax, the company’s CEO.

Biosynthesized cannabinoids aren’t yet being produced commercially by any company. And some of Demetrix’s competitors remain skeptical that Keasling’s approach is much different from what others are cooking up behind the scenes.

“They’re showing how these pieces will all go together, which is cool, but I don’t know that I would describe it as a breakthrough,” says Kevin Chen, CEO of Montreal-based [Hyasynth Bio](&lt;|url|&gt;), which recently received a $7.6 million investment from the Canadian cannabis distributor OrganiGram to speed up the rollout of its own biosynthetic cannabinoids. “Everyone is in the research stage, so it’s hard to say who will have the first product out.”

Ronan Levy, chief strategic officer of another Demetrix competitor, New Mexico-based Trait Biosciences, says his company’s preferred approach is to find ways to induce a cannabis plant to produce cannabinoids in every one of its cells, rather than only those in the “tricone” (better known as the “bud”), where it grows naturally.

“Instead of trying to find other organisms, why not figure out how to expand on what the plant can do?” he says. “Yeast is definitely interesting, we just don’t think it makes the most sense.”
> # “So you have a yeast that makes THC. Do you schedule this yeast?”

It’s unclear whether biosynthesized cannabinoids would be subject to the same legal restrictions as plant-derived compounds, since federal law applies to the plant and not necessarily to the cannabinoids in it. Cannabis researchers are subject to [tight restrictions](&lt;|url|&gt;) on where they can procure samples, and the Food and Drug Administration has [approved only one CBD-based drug](&lt;|url|&gt;), Epidiolex, for childhood epilepsy.

“So you have a yeast that makes THC. Do you schedule this yeast?” says Piomelli, referring to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s [drug classification system](&lt;|url|&gt;). “We haven’t seen the law at work enough to conclude, case by case, what will work. The legal landscape on cannabis is so confusing that almost anything goes.”

Either way, biosynthesis is poised to change the way we think about getting high.

“We don’t make insulin from animals anymore, and the plant won’t be the way forward for industrial production of cannabinoids,” says Banister. “If big corporations want to move into the cannabis space, I think they will be moving in this direction.”<|endoftext|>

# Keeping Virtual Reality Environments Harassment-Free

## Touch adds intimacy to VR experiences — but how do we make it safe for everyone?

![Credit: max-kegfire/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: max-kegfire/Getty Images*

I was in the living room of my childhood home, watching my mother as she stared out of the window, reeling from the news of her diagnosis. I could feel the carpet soft under my toes, and hear music in the background. “I wanted to save you from all the suffering,” Mom said as she turned and then embraced me with one of her never-let-you-go hugs before I said goodbye.

And then it all vanished, because this was just a virtual reality (VR) experience — one nothing like anything I’d experienced before. [*Draw Me Close](&lt;|url|&gt;)* is a VR-meets-theater performance that takes the audience on a journey through the memories of its creator, playwright [Jordan Tannahill](&lt;|url|&gt;). The experience centers around interactions with his own mother, played by a flesh-and-blood actor who was in the virtual space with me.

![Penny Layden (mother) in “Draw Me Close” with an audience member.](<|image|>)*Penny Layden (mother) in “Draw Me Close” with an audience member.*

The use of touch throughout the performance has a huge impact; my virtual mother and I drew pictures together, held hands, and she even tucked me into bed. Before the performance began, I was reassured that there would be “light touch” and was asked for my consent. It added intimacy and emotional power to Jordan’s story, certainly; consensual touch, research has found, can help to [build trust and connection](&lt;|url|&gt;), [encourage empathy](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [minimize stress](&lt;|url|&gt;).

But when touch occurs without consent it can be uncomfortable, unsettling, and form the basis of harassment and assault. And in the new world of virtual reality, this raises an important question: How do we ensure that virtual touch doesn’t violate people in VR spaces?

Understanding virtual embodiment — the phenomenon of believing that we are physically embodying another object or virtual avatar — is critical to the creation of VR experiences. In an influential 1998 study known as the “[rubber hand illusion](&lt;|url|&gt;),” participants viewed a rubber hand being stroked while their *own* hand was stroked out of sight at the same time; every participant began to regard the rubber hand as part of their own body. The concept was revisited in [2010 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) with a virtual arm where, again, participants readily took ownership of a virtual hand when the sensory information was in balance.


The discovery that people can feel as psychologically connected to a virtual body as their physical one adds to the responsibility of VR developers to prioritize the safety of their players. This is especially true of social spaces, such as [AltspaceVR](&lt;|url|&gt;), [Rec Room](&lt;|url|&gt;), [High Fidelity](&lt;|url|&gt;), [VTime](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [Facebook Spaces](&lt;|url|&gt;), which all involve real people interacting in shared virtual environments.

In 2016, journalist Jordan Belamire [wrote about her experience](&lt;|url|&gt;) of playing QuiVR on the HTC Vive, in which another user persistently followed and groped her VR avatar. Belamire acknowledged that even though it was technically nonphysical, the harassment was “still scary as hell.” More than 49% of women and 36% of men have experienced some form of harassment in virtual environments, VR consultant and researcher [Jessica Outlaw](&lt;|url|&gt;) found in a [2018 study](&lt;|url|&gt;), with many players reporting groping, catcalls, and sexual harassment.

Touch is also an issue at real-world VR events, says Samantha Kingston, CEO of the marketing consultancy [Virtual Umbrella](&lt;|url|&gt;) and VR veteran. “You can never be too careful. To put a headset on someone or put your hands on someone’s shoulders — it can be easy to forget people can feel quite vulnerable. I ask permission and tell them exactly what I’m doing.”

Some more intensive VR experiences can involve much more physical touch, and also have multiple participants moving throughout the space at once. VR attractions [The Void](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Nomadic](&lt;|url|&gt;) are focused on gaming and involve teams completing missions, shooting enemies, and exploring new spaces. These experiences operate like a theme park rides, requiring players to sign waivers and read a list of restrictions, but can be challenging for events designers to balance a seamless and absorbing narrative with the logistical challenges of waivers and consent.
> # “We have the technical challenge of making sure when people are being touched through digital networks, the person on the other end is who they say are.”

The complexity of touch in virtual worlds will only intensify with the development of haptic clothing, which uses vibration and sensors to replicate a sense of touch. If you’re wearing a haptic glove and someone holds your hand in a social VR space, it really feels like someone’s holding your hand. “This could increase the affective bonds we feel to remote users,” David Parisi, associate professor of emerging media at the College of Charleston and author of the book [*Archaeologies of Touch](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, tells *OneZero*. “Even if the reproduction of touch falls short of fully synthesizing the full range of tactile sensations, even low-definition can be emotionally meaningful.”

Yet as the sensitivity and intimacy of touch sensations becomes more sophisticated, so does the potential for abuse. “If implemented unsuccessfully, these haptic devices can be distracting, obtrusive, and uncomfortable,” says Parisi. “And we have the technical challenge of making sure digital touch technologies are secure, so when people are being touched through digital networks, the person on the other end is who they say are.”

Aware of concerns, many social VR spaces are now starting to deploy some of the tools used on social platforms including muting, blocking, reporting, and changing privacy settings. But they need to go further, says VR researcher and community builder [Eva Hoerth](&lt;|url|&gt;). “The key to a good social VR experience is making a visitor feel safe, welcome, and empowered from the moment they step inside,” she told *OneZero*. “This should happen before* *they step into a space with other people.”

Virtual hosts could also prepare users for how “real” virtual touch will feel. “[One of my favorite ideas](&lt;|url|&gt;) for communicating touch was to have a group of virtual butterflies fly close to the visitor and land on their hand,” Hoerth says. “This is a delightful way to understand that what touches you in VR can feel real.”

Several social and multiplayer VR spaces have offered a [space bubble](&lt;|url|&gt;) that creates a close barrier around your avatar to stop others getting too close. In environments where people want to get closer to other players, VR spaces simply need to do a better job of educating people about touch and consent. After hearing that male players had witnessed harassment, Outlaw developed bystander intervention training which she has since delivered in social VR meeting spaces High Fidelity and AltSpaceVR. She advised men about [techniques to respond to such situations](&lt;|url|&gt;), including distracting the victim, reporting and documenting the event themselves, or confronting the harasser.
> # One solution could be labels indicating which areas of the participant’s body would be touched — though that doesn’t, of course, account for interpersonal consent.

Hoerth suggests that developers explore [visual indicators](&lt;|url|&gt;) so that players could signal green if they are open to touch, yellow if they want to instigate touch, and red for no contact. “Because we don’t have the luxury of eye contact and accurate body language in VR yet, we as creators need to play around with how we can enable visitors to communicate their feelings,” she says.

Parisi advises simply that the best practice of consent in the real world should be applied to developing VR spaces. “We should never assume consent — we should always ask before we touch,” he says. One solution borrowed from the real world could be standardized advice labels indicating which areas of the participant’s body would be touched and with what intensity — though that doesn’t, of course, account for interpersonal consent. “Some experiences have warning screens that help to indicate to the user what they should expect,” says [Sarah Jones](&lt;|url|&gt;), head of the Birmingham School of Media at Birmingham City University in the U.K. “These include simple instructions, which seem self-evident, but this is a new medium that needs explanation.”

If VR is going to find a lasting home with mainstream audiences, creators have to make their VR spaces safe for users. “Harassment, whether in a virtual world or a nonvirtual world, is still harassment, but there are few measures to currently protect against this,” says Jones. “Regulation around consent and touch is necessary and needed, but for now there is a duty of care on creators to provide this.”<|endoftext|>

# An Algorithm May Decide Who Gets Suicide Prevention

## A recent study on Google’s search results raises questions about the faith we put in algorithms — and the tech companies that use them

![Credit: PhotoAlto/Alix Minde/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: PhotoAlto/Alix Minde/Getty Images*

To anyone unfamiliar with the suffocating feeling of suicidal ideation, the significance of a phone call with a stranger might seem dubious. In that moment, the lowest of lows, speaking with someone who understands what you’re going through can — quite literally — mean the difference between life and death.

While it remains [under debate](&lt;|url|&gt;) just how effective suicide hotlines are in terms of preventing suicides, there is [plenty](&lt;|url|&gt;) of [anecdotal](&lt;|url|&gt;) [evidence](&lt;|url|&gt;) that lives have been saved by their existence. Based on that evidence, in 2011, Google began to show suicide helpline numbers at the top of results for searches like “effective suicide methods.”

Like so much of our online lives, the decision to show this advice alongside results is determined by an algorithm. Facebook has been [doing something similar](&lt;|url|&gt;) since 2017, when it began monitoring posts for content about suicide or self-harm with pattern recognition algorithms, and then sending those users relevant resources.

Yet, while these steps are helpful, the algorithms concerned do not perform consistently across the world, according to a [study](&lt;|url|&gt;) published earlier this year in the journal *New Media & Society. *The researchers — Sebastian Scherr at the University of Leuven and Mario Haim and Florian Arendt at the University of Munich — found that [algorithmic bias](&lt;|url|&gt;) is increasingly becoming a challenge for technological growth as algorithm creators struggle to confront the limitations of their programming. In this case, they found that Google’s algorithms contribute to a digital divide in access to health information online.

An algorithm, it seems, could determine, in some cases, who gets shown lifesaving information, and who doesn’t.

The researchers behind the *New Media & Society *paper set out to understand this odd quirk of Google’s algorithm, and to find out why the company seemed to be serving some markets better than others. They developed a list of 28 keywords and phrases related to suicide, Scherr says, and worked with nine researchers from different countries who accurately translated those terms into their own languages. For 21 days, they conducted millions of automated searches for these phrases, and kept track of whether hotline information showed up or not.
> # “If you’re in an English-speaking country, you have over a 90% chance of seeing these results — but Google operates differently depending on which language you use.”

They thought these results might simply, logically, show up in countries with higher suicide rates, but the opposite was true. Users in South Korea, which has one of the world’s [highest suicide rates](&lt;|url|&gt;), were only served the advice box about 20% of the time. They tested different browser histories (some completely clean, some full of suicide-related topics), with computers old and new, and tested searches in 11 different countries.

It didn’t seem to matter: the advice box was simply much more likely to be shown to people using Google in the English language, particularly in English-speaking countries (though not in Canada, which Scherr speculates was probably down to geographical rollout). “If you’re in an English-speaking country, you have over a 90% chance of seeing these results — but Google operates differently depending on which language you use,” he said. Scherr speculates that using keywords may simply have been the easiest way to implement the project, but adds that it wouldn’t take much to offer it more effectively in other countries, too.

A Google spokesperson, who asked not to be quoted directly, said that the company is refining these algorithms. The advice boxes require the cooperation of local organizations which may not always be available, they said, but that relevant resources will still show up in regular search results. Google said the service does not have comprehensive global coverage, and while it is actively working on new languages and locations, rolling that out takes time.

Suicide prevention might not have the same status as Google’s [high profile ](&lt;|url|&gt;)[artificial](&lt;|url|&gt;) [intelligence](&lt;|url|&gt;) projects, but it is nonetheless a feature that could potentially help save lives. Some 800,000 people [take their own lives](&lt;|url|&gt;) each year around the world, or about one person every 40 seconds. “There’s a lot at stake if you don’t provide the same chances to everyone,” Scherr told me. “Google is a global company, with smart people all over the world. They shouldn’t be forgetting about the rest of the world. They could fix this. They could do that today.”

Algorithms have increasing influence over every aspect of our lives, from the triviality of Netflix recommendations to determining something as profound as suicide prevention. In 2018, a secret Amazon recruitment [algorithm](&lt;|url|&gt;) analyzed the resumes of job applicants, but was found to favor male candidates over female ones. And in 2016, *ProPublica* revealed that one risk assessment algorithm used in many courtrooms routinely [recommended harsher sentences](&lt;|url|&gt;) to black people than to white offenders — a disturbing reminder about the power we’ve allowed algorithms to wield, even as many of us assume that computers are inherently more reliable than human beings.

“A.I. makes mistakes, only faster and at scale,” explains Kirsten Martin, a researcher at George Washington University’s School of Business and an expert in A.I. ethics. “There has to be an assumption that mistakes will be made like a human, but at a faster pace. That should be a standard governing principle.”
> # “Although Google seems to be attempting to perform a social good by expanding its suicide prevention algorithms, ‘why aren’t they doing that all the time?’”

Martin says we seem to be letting algorithms [run rampant](&lt;|url|&gt;) before anyone truly [understands what they’re doing](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Just because you ignore the ethics of a decision doesn’t mean it goes away — it just means you do it badly,” Martin told me. “Google’s suicide result box is interesting because they have a good goal in mind, and they’re at least conscious of the fact that they are perhaps saving people in one group and not others.”

Martin warns that although Google seems to be attempting to perform a social good by expanding its suicide prevention algorithms, it raises an important question. “Why aren’t they doing that all the time? Why aren’t they being that thoughtful about, say, advertising? They’re admitting that they can do it right when they want to, so it’s a shame they aren’t using that principle across all their algorithms.”

Google, for its part, has made its [A.I. principles](&lt;|url|&gt;) public, though they mostly consist of vague aphorisms like: “Be accountable to people.” The company also recently announced an internal A.I. ethics council, which was heavily [criticized](&lt;|url|&gt;) for its makeup and then [cancelled](&lt;|url|&gt;) after just one week.

“We care deeply that A.I. is a force for good in the world, and that it is applied ethically, and to problems that are beneficial to society,” the company said in a January research [summary](&lt;|url|&gt;). The report highlighted the company’s [Google A.I. for Social Impact Challenge](&lt;|url|&gt;), with channels $25 million in funding to groups interested in using Google artificial intelligence. One of those grants went to The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ organization that intends to use machine learning to help [determine suicide risk levels](&lt;|url|&gt;).

As these tech companies continue to wrestle with this issue and their responsibility to address it, and continue to utilize algorithms to handle it, perhaps it’s worth remembering that all this technological effort has one simple goal — to make it easier for one person in need to hear the voice of someone who will listen.<|endoftext|>

# ‘Pokémon Detective Pikachu’ Is a Lie

## ‘Pokémon Detective Pikachu’ Is a Lie

### The movie hides darker truths about prejudice, civic infrastructure, and pooper scooper laws

![*“Pokémon Detective Pikachu.” © Warner Bros.*](<|image|>)**“Pokémon Detective Pikachu.” © Warner Bros.**

Sometimes you see a movie that challenges you, that really makes you think. For me, that film is *Pokémon Detective Pikachu*. The somewhat kid-friendly noir is set in a metropolis jointly inhabited by humans and highly merchandisable creatures of all types and sizes. It’s a fun film, but after watching it, I have not been able to stop questioning how such a society would work — or, more specifically, why it wouldn’t.

My conclusions have left me shaken to the core of my being.

The movie — which I will simply call *Detective Pikachu*, because the lack of a colon in *Pokémon Detective Pikachu* causes me actual pain — forgoes the traditional creature vs. creature battles that form the basis of the incredibly popular games and cartoons. Instead, it’s about a kid named Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) who partners with a titular electric rat detective (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) to figure out if his dad is dead or not. (Again: somewhat kid-friendly.)

The traditional knock on *Pokémon* is that it’s essentially glorified dogfighting, as players hunt down and imprison animals, and then force them to fight one another while the players journey to being the best at, uh, forcing Pokémon to fight each other. So it’s gratifying that *Detective Pikachu* is set in its own location — Ryme City, a neon metropolis where humans and Pokémon live side by side and such fighting is outlawed. Admittedly, this enlightened local policy indirectly reinforces the horror that forms the basis of Pokémon society outside the city, but I’ll move past it.
> # There are no bad Pokémon, just bad people who use Pokémon for bad purposes.

In Ryme City, not only do wild Pokémon run loose in the streets, but most humans have a specific Pokémon as a pet and/or ersatz companion. Try to imagine a New York City where everyone has a cat or dog or parrot or monkey or alligator or elephant with them at all times — even on the subway — and you get the idea. The movie is vague on whether these Poké-partners are considered pets or companions; my best guess is that they’re somewhere in between, sort of like service animals. I doubt they would be considered a medical necessity for most people, but I also doubt that many people would want to go to see *Avengers: Endgame* and leave them hanging around outside unsupervised for three hours, either. And therein lies the first problem.

If you have a smaller Pokémon like Pikachu, going to a movie — or any location, really — wouldn’t be a big deal, because it can simply come in with you, probably riding on your shoulder. (Too bad for the person sitting behind you.) But if you have a [Gyarados](&lt;|url|&gt;) — a 20-plus-foot-long flying water dragon — it’s obviously not coming in anywhere that doesn’t have an oversized loading dock. But should size really dictate a person’s access to his Pokémon? Might it not be considered a form of discrimination to only allow those with smaller, more convenient Pokémon? Any modern structure in the real world should be built disability accessible. Yet almost no building in Ryme City seems to be accessible for large Pokémon. (Side question: If you bring a Pokémon into a movie, do you have to buy it a ticket?)

This might be the least disturbing aspect of the culture portrayed in the film, however. Almost all of these critters are also fighters, and they all have offensive attacks ranging from the small lightning bolts Pikachu can shoot out of his tail to the [*Game of Thrones*-level lava vomit](&lt;|url|&gt;) spewed by the dragon [Charizard](&lt;|url|&gt;). But most of these creatures can be controlled by their humans.

Most.

In the movie, a fan favorite Pokémon called a [Psyduck](&lt;|url|&gt;) is the Poké-companion of a young journalist named Lucy (Kathryn Newton). Pikachu refers to it on multiple occasions as a ticking time bomb that could kill both him and the human characters. This is because when stressed, Psyduck involuntarily releases a massive psychic explosion — and Psyduck clearly has massive anxiety issues. Lucy’s constant companion in Ryme City is an adorable weapon of mass destruction that could erupt at any time. These are dangerous creatures.

With exceptions like Psyduck, Pokémon do not attack on their own unless somehow manipulated by humans. This is because there are no bad Pokémon, just bad people who use Pokémon for bad purposes. In the film, the antagonists send their [Greninjas](&lt;|url|&gt;) to try to murder living human beings. They fail, but not for lack of trying. Since the film is presented in a much more visually realistic form than the games or cartoons, it really forced me to think about all the people who would inevitably try to use these powerful creatures to commit crimes, up to and including murder. The only way these creatures could be stopped is by other creatures, which led me to this infinitely disturbing thought: Is the only thing that stops a bad guy with a Pokémon a good guy with a Pokémon? Because I don’t like that idea at all.

Even if you believe in Ryme City’s second Poké-mendment, there is one final issue I don’t think anyone can ignore. Please return to the everyone-in-New York City-has-a-pet scenario.

Now imagine those animals pooping.

Not all at once. Think about a city in which half of its inhabitants crap on the sidewalks whenever the need strikes. It’s a nightmare. Even if you take the incredibly optimistic view that Pokémon are trained not to defecate inside buildings or vehicles or whatever, this means there would be more animal waste on the streets and sidewalks. Remember, too, that there are many, many Pokémon that are much larger than horses. If you’re the poor soul tethered to that Gyarados, you must be walking around with a snow shovel and a full box of giant-sized garbage bags every time you leave the house. And where would someone throw all those bags away? Are there dumpsters everywhere, filled to the brim at all times with animal waste? Ryme City must be a giant toilet where there’s no escape from the stench and filth.
> # It’s a real shame that this fun, frivolous kids’ movie based on a video game targeted to young children didn’t spend more time considering the verisimilitude of its setting.

Again, *Detective Pikachu* is a really fun movie. (It’s surely the only PG movie this year to make a reference to *Reservoir Dogs’* [infamous “Stuck in the Middle With You” scene](&lt;|url|&gt;).) But as a depiction of what life would be like in a world where humans and Pokémon live together, it falls woefully short. As Ryme City is presented in the film, there’s simply no way to guarantee its citizens equality, safety, and public health when virtually everyone has a living, pooping weapon with them at all times.

It’s a real shame that this fun, frivolous kids’ movie based on a video game targeted to young children didn’t spend more time considering the verisimilitude of its setting. All we can do is hope that if humanity suddenly finds itself living and partnered with millions of adorable yet highly dangerous creatures, we manage to do better than *Pokémon Detective Pikachu*. Including the proper use of colons.<|endoftext|>

# We Don’t Need Social Media

## The push to regulate or break up Facebook ignores the fact that its services do more harm than good

![Credit: Amy Osborne/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Amy Osborne/Getty Images*

In an [op-ed](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the *New York Times* last week, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes laid out an argument for dismantling the social media behemoth, splitting it up via antitrust legislation, and (he hopes) paving the way for what he describes as a new age of innovation and competition.

Hughes joins a growing [chorus](&lt;|url|&gt;) of [former](&lt;|url|&gt;) Silicon Valley unicorn riders who’ve recently had [second thoughts](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the utility or benefit of the surveillance-attention economy their products and platforms have helped create. He is also [not the first](&lt;|url|&gt;) to suggest that government might need to step in to clean up the mess they made — to enact laws that curb the powers of the tech monopolies that facilitate our day-to-day lives, extracting and exploiting our personal data and behaviors as they go. Nor is Hughes the first to suggest that once that happens, some newer, better versions of what we have now might then be created and have the chance to proliferate.

“The vibrant marketplace that once drove Facebook and other social media companies to compete to come up with better products has virtually disappeared,” Hughes wrote last week. “This means there’s less chance of start-ups developing healthier, less exploitative social media platforms. It also means less accountability on issues like privacy.”
> # It might be time to consider another interpretation of that answer: the other kind of “nowhere.” We could simply choose not to have social media at all anymore.

Maybe — or maybe not. As Nick Srnicek, author of the book [*Platform Capitalism](&lt;|url|&gt;) *and a lecturer in digital economy at King’s College London, [wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) last month, “[I]t’s competition — not size — that demands more data, more attention, more engagement and more profits at all costs… The government’s efforts to increase competition risk simply aggravating these problems.” Regulation might change the business environment, but it won’t necessarily change the business model.

Still, for Hughes, it appears competition is the key to better outcomes. He warmly cited Adam Smith’s basic theories throughout his piece, pointing out how few people abandoned their Facebook accounts in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations. “In the end, people did not leave the company’s platforms en masse,” Hughes noted. “After all, where would they go?”

The unstated answer to the question is this: nowhere. As in, nowhere other than Facebook. But it might be time to consider another interpretation of that answer: the other kind of “nowhere.” We could simply choose not to have social media at all anymore.

It’s likely that some new kind of social media would indeed arise — perhaps even, as Hughes suggested, social platforms that are “less exploitative,” or, as Srnicek posited, publicly owned ones. But what if they didn’t? What do we really need social media for?

Despite the companies’ best efforts to convince us otherwise, we don’t need social media for all the things we’re told we need it for. We don’t need social media to make friends or build relationships. We don’t need it to become active or engaged in politics. We don’t need it to explore our cities or find new things to do. We don’t need it to hail a cab or catch a bus or fly on a plane. We don’t need it to hear new music or read new books. We don’t need it to do our shopping. We don’t need it to develop or discover subcultures or like-minded groups or to appreciate good design. We don’t need it to plan our lives. And we don’t need it to understand the world.

We also don’t need social media to do the things its founders often neglect to mention it does.

We don’t need it to help make corporate or government surveillance of our lives easier. We don’t need social media to make harassment and stalking easier. We don’t need it to spread conspiracy and violence. Nor do we need it to poison our democratic discourse or to infect our minds with dangerous anti-scientific nonsense.

​W​e don’t even need social media to show us ads.​

At the moment, the​ only people who actually need social media are the people who created ​it and continue to make money from it​ — and even they are using it less and less.
> # Instead of hoping that a breakup of a monopolistic platform like Facebook will usher in a new version of the same idea, we ought to use the opportunity to decide whether the idea itself is worth repeating.

Even Hughes admitted as much, offering an example of how using social media harms, rather than improves our lives. “Some days, lying on the floor next to my 1-year-old son, I catch myself scrolling through Instagram, waiting to see if the next image will be more beautiful than the last,” he wrote. “What am I doing? I know it’s not good for me, or for my son, and yet I do it anyway.”

Hughes immediately clarified that “the choice is mine,” before admitting that it actually “doesn’t feel like a choice” because of how Facebook “seeps into every corner of our lives to capture as much of our attention and data as possible.” But Hughes is even more deeply confused than that backtracking might suggest. He appears to believe that granted a choice, we might select a better alternative to Facebook — one that, presumably, does not operate in the same manner. But having different product options is not the same as choosing not to create the market in the first place.

The truth is we don’t need social media. Instead of hoping that a regulatory breakup of a monopolistic platform like Facebook will usher in a new version of the same idea, we ought to use the opportunity to decide whether the idea itself is worth repeating. We will likely find that it is not — that the connections social media helps us make are often flimsy, that the perspective of the world we gain from using it is warped, and that the time we spend with it is better spent doing almost anything else.

We don’t need a world where there is an alternative — or even many — to the social media we currently have. We need a world without social media — period.<|endoftext|>

# The Office of the Future — Brought to You by Microsoft

## The Office of the Future — Brought to You by Microsoft

### *An interview with director of office envisioning Anton Andrews*

![A space that’s equally suited for work and quiet reflection. All photos courtesy of Microsoft unless noted.](<|image|>)*A space that’s equally suited for work and quiet reflection. All photos courtesy of Microsoft unless noted.*

Remember your high school gymnasium? Chances are it was a large hardwood space with the floor markings for half a dozen sports, all sealed under 14 layers of polyurethane. The bleachers were folded flat up against the wall for PE time and rolled out from all sides for the big game. Ropes hung from the ceiling and hoops folded up out of the way to accommodate volleyball.

The modern workplace is a little like that. Cubicles, offices, and meeting rooms are built not for one purpose, but for every imaginable office task. The problem is that offices don’t transform like the old gymnasium. Instead, you have to make do with the desk where it is, or that mahogany conference table in the middle of your meeting space, or the whiteboard that sits like a challenge at the head of the room.

Offices were built for work — not for workers. But Microsoft’s director of office envisioning, Anton Andrews, wants to flip that equation by answering what he calls his core question: “How do you get people to lean in and do their best work together and collaborate?”

It’s a question that Microsoft has been asking itself for years. The company focused on putting the world on Windows, the operating system it launched almost 35 years ago. Each new application — Office, Internet Explorer, Windows Mobile, just to name a few — was designed to pull the user closer to the core platform. Microsoft was not interested in playing well with others.

That eventually changed — initially by force, as the U.S. government in the 1990s sought to disentangle Windows from Internet Explorer and open the platform up to more third-party integrations. But under current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s guidance, the company has proactively broken down barriers, focusing on putting Office on every possible platform and rewriting its own applications to run on Android and iOS as well as they do on Windows.

The spirit of barrier crushing has bled back into Microsoft’s own products, including its current Office software lineup. Andrews points out that when [Microsoft radically updated the Office suite’s app icons](&lt;|url|&gt;), it “removed the box around icons, because we’re removing the border around the app.” It was a small cosmetic change, but one that Andrews says is a nod to a longer-term strategy of breaking down the barriers between these applications and “letting people work more organically.”

![Microsoft’s new app iconography.](<|image|>)*Microsoft’s new app iconography.*

Andrews’ own work cuts across Microsoft’s many disciplines: hardware, software, engineering, design, and collaboration. He works with internal groups including those falling under Microsoft chief product officer Panos Panay and head of industrial design Ralf Groene, showing these groups how their Surface Pros, Surface Studios, and Surface Hub screens work in concept office spaces.

Fit and comfortably dressed in a silk-screened pullover and dark jeans, Andrews met with me in Microsoft’s New York City offices a few weeks ago to talk about the company’s future of work roadmap. I found him seated in a meeting room that — if I’m honest — didn’t quite live up to Andrews’ optimistic vision for the future of work. There was a round office table with a handful of comfy office chairs arranged around it, and blank blue and white walls.
> # Microsoft doesn’t make furniture, but it is looking beyond its devices and software to develop a more holistic approach to breaking down corporate boundaries.

Andrews described to me how, in the mid-1990s, he switched from a career in genetic engineering to one in design. He was following in his father’s footsteps to some extent: Andrews’ dad was an architectural anthropologist who studied nomads and their yurts. His own interests eventually shifted to systems and scales — concepts that play out in the modern workspace, as Andrews learned from his conversations with executives inside and outside of Microsoft.

Andrews recalled talking with retired four-star Army General Stanley McChrystal, who led special forces operations during the hottest years of the war in Iraq. The army’s rigid, hierarchical structure was not agile enough to compete with its insurgents on the ground. So McChrystal [dismantled that communication hierarchy](&lt;|url|&gt;) and installed a new communication protocol. Suddenly, there were daily meetings with thousands of military personal. McChrystal went from micromanaging decisions to overseeing teams that were more empowered to adapt to new situations.

For Andrews, this points to a larger truth about people working together. “It’s incredibly important to allow people to focus on intent instead of format,” he says. No one goes to work thinking about the Excel spreadsheet they’re going to make. Instead, they’re focused on the project and all the pieces that will help achieve that goal.

![Microsoft’s vision of a collaboration corner.](<|image|>)*Microsoft’s vision of a collaboration corner.*

Microsoft doesn’t make furniture, but it is looking beyond its devices and software to develop a more holistic approach to breaking down corporate boundaries. For years, Andrews’ team has worked with [office furniture manufacturer Steelcase](&lt;|url|&gt;) to develop office layouts and furniture that break down traditional office tropes.

He showed me a concept image depicting an exploded, mini-geodesic dome that would serve as a circular conference room. Instead of chairs, there are “wobble stools,” where meeting participants could perch. The idea is to stay on task and avoid getting too comfortable. Rather than a single whiteboard, there are screens all over the walls that make it easy for anyone to reach over and add something.

![Next Gen meeting space.](<|image|>)*Next Gen meeting space.*

Those screens, by the way, are not confined to a single purpose or platform. Microsoft envisions people adding everything from images to diagrams, text, drawings, and videos — content they can share directly from their Windows, Android, or iOS devices without inadvertently also sharing their full screens and personal content.

And the video conferencing leverages A.I., ideally so that those conferencing in feel completely connected to the host meeting. (Clearly, teleconferencing has a long way to go.) The new technology is smart enough to create automatic split screens for multiple participants and even blur out background images — including those doodles on your notepads.

What stands out about the meeting space Andrews is showing me, though, is not what it has, but what it lacks. There’s no table and, by design, no enforced central focus. More open spaces, without walls, supposedly encourage people to spontaneously start or even join ad-hoc meetings. The meeting room essentially begins as a blank space that can be molded as workers want.

It’s “digitally enabled and you hydrate with digital content just as you hydrate a sponge with water,” says Andrews.

In this vision, work is not supposed to be defined by space. Rather, the space becomes a container for the work of your choice and an active tool for getting that work and collaboration done. The office works for you, instead of the other way around.

While it might seem self-serving for Microsoft to promote future workspaces that, no surprise, include much of its own technology, at least one expert I spoke to agrees that a workplace shift close to what the tech giant anticipates is coming.

“The days of cubicles and offices will be gone as this workspace model isolates people and ideas and creates a sense of ‘silos’ or divisions rather than having an open and collaborative workspace,” says Cheryl Cran, future of work expert and founder of NextMapping. “A lot of traditional businesses are rethinking their workspace to match up with changing work styles and needs of the changing demographics of workers.”
> # “The 21st century is defined by uncertainty,” says Andrews. “You can find yourself, very efficiently, doing the wrong thing.”

In the meantime, Andrews and his team are pondering how to build a modern office that addresses the spectrum of space. They know that generalized spaces and the standard desktop are still important for some workers (coders, for example, need room for their three screens), but they’re focusing on building a work landscape that offers a variety of spaces types to accommodate different ways of working both together and alone.

Cran agrees that these spaces need the flexibility to accommodate a mix of full-timers and, increasingly, freelancers, all of whom demand more intelligent spaces with integrated apps and even voice controls. She says the shared spaces must be ready to support “global meetings, to host podcasts, to do ‘hub’-type work with teams. Trends are towards having workspaces that allow for remote workers to meet up, as needed, and to get work done in person, as required.”

The goal is to work better — not just faster. Andrews thinks his team and Microsoft can help people do that by protecting attention, encouraging collaboration, and connecting people in context. “The 21st century is defined by uncertainty,” says Andrews. “You can find yourself, very efficiently, doing the wrong thing.”

What Microsoft is developing is a solid vision for the immediate future of work. Andrews says the company will roll out some of these concepts over the next three to five years. In the meantime, the workers of the world will just have to make do with office spaces that are like an ill-equipped gymnasium, one where most of the equipment is broken and the painted lines no longer make sense.<|endoftext|>

# Electric Scooter Culture Must Change

## Who’s in charge of making e-scooters safer for pedestrians and riders?

![Photo by [Marek Rucinski](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Marek Rucinski](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

The worst motor vehicle accident in my life happened about two months ago. I skidded in the rain and hurt my right leg so badly I couldn’t walk correctly for three weeks.

It didn’t happen in a car. It happened on a Lime e-scooter at night.

I probably should have gone to the ER to address my injuries, but in my hubris I chose to wait out the pain. I got lucky in that I did heal, but the process was greatly lengthened by the fact that I didn’t go see a doctor. And I wasn’t wearing a helmet, kneepads, or safety gear of any sort.

Yet if I had to do it over again, I’d do it exactly the same way.

I rarely bike with my helmet, confident in my ability to, well, not fall off my bike. And even after what happened to me, I’m still confident in my ability to ride an e-scooter and *​*not* *​get into an accident, even without protective gear. Like 98% of drivers who still [text while driving](&lt;|url|&gt;), knowing it’s against the law and knowing that it’s dangerous to themselves and others, I believe that I just won’t get into bad accidents on a bike or an e-scooter because historically, I haven’t. (Besides, of course, that one exception.) We all have [overconfidence bias](&lt;|url|&gt;), the belief that we’re better bikers, scooter riders, or drivers than most other people. We also all have recency bias, the knowledge that we’ve texted and driven hundreds of times without incident, or that we’ve ridden our bikes and e-scooters hundreds of times without incident.
> # While the decision not to wear helmets or any protective gear is largely due to biases and the hubris of the majority of riders like me, the maintenance of e-scooters is entirely the responsibility of companies like Lime and Lyft.

But our bias isn’t keeping us from accidents like the one I had on a Lime scooter. The lack of safety is a national trend that seems to be [plaguing emergency rooms](&lt;|url|&gt;) in urban areas around the country. Most people who get injured in e-scooter accidents just fall, but about 11% hit something and 8.8% are hit by a car or another moving object. E-scooters also send some people to the emergency room from injuries sustained not by riding the e-scooter or being hit by one, but from falling over a parked e-scooter, or trying to lift one.

There are common patterns that belie many of these accidents, according to [Tarak Trivedi](&lt;|url|&gt;), an ER doctor at UCLA. Hospital records show that 12% of people in accidents had been drinking and 94% of accidents reported that the riders weren’t wearing helmets. A number of other riders complained about technical problems with brakes and trouble braking in general. This pattern of poor braking is one I have personally experienced while riding Lime and Bird e-scooters. Now I’m careful going full-speed on highly populated streets because I don’t trust the brakes on a lot of e-scooters.

While the decision not to wear helmets or any protective gear is largely due to biases and the hubris of the majority of riders like me, the maintenance of e-scooters is entirely the responsibility of companies like Lime and Bird. And while the number of injuries from e-scooters still falls short of car and motorcycle accidents, riders also travel much shorter distances on them than they do by car, so perhaps injuries-per-mile would be a better and more standardized metric.

### **What about the e-scooters that aren’t even legal?**

This summer, YouTuber Emily Hartridge [died](&lt;|url|&gt;) in an e-scooter accident in south London. Aside from the discussion of general e-scooter safety, Hartridge’s death caused an uproar because in the U.K., e-scooters are largely illegal. Despite these laws, however, e-scooter sightings in London are still common, riders still use them, and most of them don’t use helmets.
> # The dopamine rush has us coming back to e-scooters over and over again. Despite my accident, I ride them all the time. I still don’t use a helmet, and I still don’t ride nearly as safely as I should.

And perhaps these patterns in e-scooter use and texting while driving won’t change, despite the laws. Maybe riding an e-scooter is like Prometheus giving fire to man: the heightened alertness that accompanies going 15 mph across town, the free-flouting of traffic rules and laws, the money saved scootering instead of paying for an Uber or a Lyft. The dopamine rush has us coming back to e-scooters over and over again. Despite my accident, I ride them all the time. I still don’t use a helmet, and I still don’t ride nearly as safely as I should.

Regulations undoubtedly help. But that’s only what they’ll do: help.

E-scooters are still the Wild West of our modern generation, a place where we can freely traverse unknown terrain, a place where, in our minds, there are no rules, or the rules are so flimsy that we ignore them whenever we can.

I don’t know if that’s simply the way I see riding an e-scooter, being a high-energy and high-risk taking 22-year-old living in a major urban city. But that is the underside of human nature, our ids satisfying their natural needs to misbehave and fulfill our Freudian *​Todestrieb*​, our death wish and drive towards self-destruction. Any person that has been on a roller coaster knows the rush of the drop from the sky, when it seems like you’re so close to death, and your heart is about to leap out of your chest.

And then you don’t die. And you can just keep riding and doing it again with the same sensation of coming so close to death and not actually going to the other world; of being God and eating the apple of Eden when it wasn’t your place to play God. It also helps that you don’t need any training or a license to ride one.

So we need to change e-scooter culture with a more pessimistic view of the innate human nature to reform. Yes, e-scooter companies need to be more proactive about maintenance of their scooters. We may need to reduce speeds, because even though it may technically be illegal to ride on sidewalks, people still will, and 15 mph is far too fast for anyone to be going on a sidewalk. There is no world where any e-scooter rider going down a hill can appropriately and safely come to a complete stop.

Last month, Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris [implemented](&lt;|url|&gt;) laws banning e-scooters from sidewalks and restricting their speeds to a maximum of 20 kph (12 mph). Lime has started giving training courses on riding e-scooters, along with free helmets. I doubt that anyone besides the safety-conscious would take them up on the helmet offer, but it’s a start. Bird also has announced a tour to promote safety on e-scooters, and said it would designate parking spaces for theirs.

But at the end of the day, it comes down to e-scooter culture. For almost all of us who ride them, we do so because the pros outweigh the cons. And maybe we need to look at the risks of e-scooter culture as a public health crisis, because even after writing this article, I will likely go on one tomorrow, riding with buses, trucks, and cars on President Street in Baltimore (in the bike lane, of course). And many of my friends will do the same thing.

Over the past 55 years, since Surgeon General Luther Terry made a national announcement that smoking causes lung cancer and heart disease, America has seen the prevalence of tobacco use decline significantly. In 1964, there were over 4,000 cigarettes [smoked per capita in the United States](&lt;|url|&gt;), while in 2012, there were less than 1,000. Looking at the 2014 Report from the Surgeon General, it’s clear when cigarette smoking decreased the most — when the federal cigarette tax [doubled](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 1969.

I come from a family of smokers, and the biggest grievance they have against smoking, and the biggest reason why people in my family tried to quit, was cost. Smoking cigarettes, and smoking as much as they did, was just too damn expensive with all the price increases and taxes. Largely through economics — with an assist from larger changes in the culture — smoking in the United States eventually changed.

Politicians in America have been unwilling to raise taxes on e-scooter use. Perhaps this is where we should look for a long-term solution, especially since it seems like changing the laws isn’t a fail-safe solution.

Just as smoking, or texting while driving, harms not only the smoker or the texter, riding e-scooters can harm not only the riders, but also pedestrians and other motor vehicles.

We won’t change human nature in its desire to seek the novelty, thrill, and utility of using e-scooters. And that’s why the feasible solution, with regulations, is to make accessing e-scooters more costly. Just as my family quit smoking when it became too expensive, we might avoid using e-scooters if the cost becomes too high. E-scooter culture will most likely change only through economic change, just like smoking culture did.<|endoftext|>

# Neuralink’s Technology Is Impressive. Is It Ethical?

## Elon Musk’s audacious vision of a smartphone-controlled brain-machine interface comes with potential risks

![Photo: Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images*

Imagine being able to walk into a strip-mall and have thousands of microscopically-fine electrodes inserted into your brain, all implanted as quickly and as efficiently as if you were having LASIK eye surgery, and designed to boost your brain from a simple smartphone app.

Until this week, this was the stuff of [science fiction](&lt;|url|&gt;). Yet [at a launch event this past Tuesday](&lt;|url|&gt;), the company [Neuralink](&lt;|url|&gt;) — founded by Elon Musk — claimed they were on track to achieve this and more over the next few years.


Neuralink’s brain-machine interface technology is deeply impressive. Using Musk’s now familiar model of bringing together new talent from different fields to accelerate the rate of technological innovation, the company has made massive strides in what is achievable. But despite the technical promise of wireless read-write brain-machine interfaces, companies like Neuralink are in danger of getting so wrapped up in what they can do, that they lose sight of the ethics behind what they should do

## **The ethics of neurotechnology**

In my 2018 book, [*Films from the Future](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, I wrote about what we then knew about Musk’s creation of a neural lace, a term that comes from the science fiction of Iain M. Banks and describes a future brain-computer interface. But now that the future is a little closer, I have some more thoughts on the potential risks and ethical issues surrounding Neuralink. Although we’re still discovering how important our [whole body is in influencing who we are](&lt;|url|&gt;), we still think of our brain as the organ that ultimately defines us. This is where the roots of our sense of self and identity lie, where we receive and process data, where our intellect and reason are seated, and where our deepest feelings and aspirations reside.

This is, in part, why ethics are so important in the development of responsible neurotechnologies. But these technologies also come with social risks, which further complicates matters. When a new technology has the potential to change collective behavior, disrupt social norms, or undermine established values, there are broader ethical questions around where the boundaries between “can” and “should” lie.

Until this past week, these were largely theoretical questions. Basic neurotechnologies have been around for a while — including technologies like [cochlear implants](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [deep brain stimulation](&lt;|url|&gt;) and more complicated brain-computer interfaces. They are sufficiently basic that they’ve allowed breathing space for accompanying conversations around their ethical development and use.

But with Neuralink’s launch event and [the accompanying paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) on their underlying technology, these and larger ethical questions have taken on a new urgency.

## **Pushing the boundaries of what’s possible**

What makes Neuralink’s advances so potentially disruptive are their technological feasibility. This isn’t [vaporware](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the tech the company is working on appears to be grounded in solid science and engineering. While the current state-of-the-art allows limited numbers of crude electrodes to be hardwired into critical parts of the brain, Neuralink is developing integrated solutions where tens of thousands of ultrafine, flexible, read-write electrodes can be precisely inserted into the brain. These are placed using cutting-edge precision robotics, and will eventually be wirelessly controlled from a smartphone app to combat neurological disorders.
> # This type of speculation is rarely helpful when trying to navigate the landscape between a powerful technological capability, and its ethical and socially responsible development.

This, however, is just a taste for what’s coming down the pike. Using the platforms they’ve developed, Neuralink’s long-term objectives are to enhance how our brains function by adding a third artificial processing layer to them, an easy surgery that might take only a few hours. Based on current progress, this ambition is well within the bounds of possibility.

Yet as the late Stan Lee might have observed, with great power comes great responsibility. And this is where Neuralink and others in the field need to be thinking critically about how to innovate both responsibly and ethically.

## **Ethical challenges**

As always, there’s a danger of paralysis by analysis as soon as anyone brings up the ethics of advanced technologies like brain-machine interfaces. We can all speculate about the potential psychological harms of advanced brain-computer interfaces, or the dangers of brain-hacking or mind-jacking. And it’s easy to imagine dystopian visions of a future where social behavior is controlled by machines, as we sacrifice autonomy for neural lace convenience.

Yet this type of speculation is rarely helpful when trying to navigate the landscape between a powerful technological capability and its ethical and socially responsible development. Instead, despite the temptation to sensationalize and even fictionalize potential risks, there’s an urgent need for informed thinking about plausible issues, and how to navigate them. And in the case of Neuralink, this means grappling with three specific areas of ethical and responsible innovation.

## **Physiological impacts**

First, there are the potential acute and chronic physiological impacts associated with inserting thousands of electrodes into the brain. Ensuring the safety of this tech is far from trivial. Yet here, I’m reasonably confident that regulators, researchers, and developers will be able to identify and navigate the key challenges. From having worked for many years on the potential health risks of novel materials, including nanoparticles, I have a lot of respect for the scientists and regulators who will be working to ensure the neurological medical devices developed by Neuralink do as little harm as possible. But at the same time, they’re going to have to be open to new ideas as the technology breaks new ground.

## **Psychological and behavioral impacts**

The second area is more tricky, and concerns potential psychological and behavioral impacts. Where the technology is being used for medical purposes, there will always be tradeoffs between the benefits of neural interfaces, and how these might affect a person’s mental state and behavior. But as the technology moves from remediation to enhancement, potential behavioral and mood changes will demand much greater scrutiny.

For example, is there a likelihood of personality changes or addictive behavior, or the emergence of chronic psychological disorders, as people begin to use these devices? Here, there is a risk that long lag times between the widespread use of the technology and the emergence of psychological issues could further complicate things. This could spell disaster if people become dependent on the technology before the long-term impacts are fully understood.

Then there’s a third area of ethical concerns, and the potentially broader, societal impacts of the technology.

While Neuralink is currently focused on using its technology to address medical conditions, the company’s long-term goal is to create an artificial internet-connected overlay to the brain that enables users to interface with future intelligent machines. This is an audacious goal that is very overtly aimed at changing society. And because of this, it raises questions around ethics and responsibility that have to be grappled with while there’s still an opportunity to steer the technology toward responsible ways of using it.

For instance, if at some point in the future you get a Neuralink implant to enhance your mental abilities, or for recreational purposes, who owns that implant and has access to its data and functions? [Based on current law](&lt;|url|&gt;), it’s almost definitely not you.

This may seem fine, until the company who owns the device threatens to deactivate it unless you pay for the latest upgrade, or you find yourself vulnerable to hackers because you didn’t buy into the upgrade plan. Who owns the device also raises questions around who owns your brain signals and even who has the right to write data to your brain. We might be looking at a future where mandatory auto-updates rewrite your hardware as well as your physical mind.

This neural “write” capability of Neuralink’s technology raises a number of other issues. It’s a capability that’s essential for planned medical applications. But it’s easy to imagine people wanting to use the technology for enhancement — to increase cognitive ability, physical dexterity, perceptions, mood, and even personality.

Imagine being able to sharpen your mind or increase memory retention with an app on your phone, or change your mood at the flick of a switch. You could integrate Neuralink into gaming systems so you could viscerally feel the action as well as see it. A neural implant could also be used to amplify on-screen emotion when watching movies.

These capabilities are likely to become feasible in the near to medium future, but there are potential downsides. Imagine ads that trigger an emotional response, news feeds that can manipulate how you feel, or apps that allow others to alter how you behave with a simple text. And on top of this, the dangers of having your smartphone stolen or hacked take on a whole other dimension.

Now we’re heading into speculative territory. And to be fair, Musk has made it clear that he’s against the idea of funding neural implants with neural adverts. Yet, as the technology matures, these are possibilities that need to be explored if Neuralink is to be developed and used ethically and responsibly.

Let’s suppose that none of the aforementioned negatives come to pass. There’s still the question of who gets access to the technology, and who does not. If brain-computer interfaces truly do hold the ability to substantially enhance what a user can achieve, are we in danger of creating a two-tier society where the privileged are able to get better jobs, earn more, and have a higher quality of life, compared to those who are too poor or too “unworthy” in the eyes of society to get hold of the tech?

This is not an idle question. Already, there is social disparity around who gets to benefit from new technologies that increases the divide between the privileged and the marginalized in society. We must consider the possibility that neural implants could massively widen this gap.

## **Moving forward responsibly**

Unless ethical questions like these are addressed early on, we’re either looking at a future where brain-computer interfaces create more problems than they solve, or one where Neuralink has gone bust because it didn’t take the social and ethical concerns seriously enough from the beginning.

The good news is that there’s still time for Neuralink and others to develop a robust strategy for ethical and responsible innovation, so everyone can realize the full benefits of the technology. There are resources that can help here — the [Risk Innovation Accelerator](&lt;|url|&gt;) that’s a part of my Risk Innovation Lab is just one of them. But unless we start a wider, deeper, and more informed set of conversations, the future of Musk’s vision doesn’t look quite as rosy as he might hope.<|endoftext|>

# My Apps Have an Anxiety Problem

## ‘They spin, buffer, and refresh endlessly, searching for something that isn’t out there’

![Credit: wacomka/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: wacomka/Getty Images*

I’m starting to worry about the well-being of my apps. Lately, they feel anxious. These sophisticated tangles of software that knit my life into something workable are coming apart at the seams. They spin, buffer, and refresh endlessly, searching for something that isn’t out there, breaking themselves in the process. I’m not sure how much more of this they can take.

I began noticing that my programs were cracking up when a regression in the Spotify app threw my commute into chaos. Those of you who don’t spend your lives underground in a city like New York, slowly entombed by the crumbling infrastructure of an ailing subway system, might not have noticed anything. But earlier this year, Spotify made it more difficult to play songs that you’d already downloaded to your phone when you don’t have cell service. You click on your albums or your playlists and the app blanks into three endlessly bubbling dots, polling for the data it already possesses.

Co-workers commiserated, their subterranean trips also silenced. A consensus formed that you had to manually disconnect the app, switch on the offline toggle deep within Spotify’s playback settings, or unplug your phone from networks entirely, sliding into airplane mode, if you wanted to loop Carly Rae’s *Dedicated* for the hundredth time. But what kind of life is that? The promise of modern software is perfect smoothness, an earpod-white [Klein bottle](&lt;|url|&gt;) that cradles every possible piece of data, every hit song, every binge-worthy series. The stream flows, polishing rocks; it tunes faces. So why was I suddenly forced to grope across rough edges, to constantly fiddle with my connectivity like some bumbling radio operator in a ham shack?
> # “I cannot verify your identity, old friend. Once again, you must prove yourself through sacrifice.”

My unease didn’t stop there. Spotify was the crack that you notice, which highlights all the other cracks you’d missed, the hangnail that peels off the rest of the skin. Soon, my home screen was a bull pen of neurotics. My desktop was a mess of bobbing icons, programs seething for new content, demanding updates. I found myself unable to reach the top of my Twitter feed to write a post, as an overeager loop continually pushed the compose box higher and higher, beyond the latest tweets, past bitter fights about *Booksmart* and hot takes about the apocalypse. Steam and *Magic: The Gathering Arena* became loading-bar simulators as they sucked down patch after patch.

My Mac found itself paralyzed by the new. Every night, a panel peeked out of the corner of my screen, nagging me to download Mojave, promising “dark mode” as the thing I needed most. Even my password manager was upset, paranoically stalking the near-constant updates of Chrome, each time demanding a restart: “I cannot verify your identity, old friend. Once again, you must prove yourself through sacrifice.”

Having spent time on “the forums,” I’d seen this anxious behavior before — but in people. I first experienced it as a teenage Stone of Jordan day trader on the Battle.net boards of *Diablo 2*, then with *World of Warcraft*, *Dota 2*, *Overwatch*, and a long line of battle royales. Each day, tweaking children and obsessive adults would thread madly, speculating about when the next patch would drop, when fresh characters, abilities, and artifacts would flood the servers. Long treatises would appear about how the adjustments would either ruin or rectify the game, how the improved numbers would claw back the equilibrium and fun that the game itself had sadly lost.

Much like my Spotify locked itself out of playback, caught in a perpetual state of seeking new “Old Town Road” remixes, tens of thousands of MOBA fanfolk found themselves unable to play their favorite titles, compulsively searching for data on when their games would change. Just like my sad apps, every player “knew” that they were unhappy, that something was missing, but they couldn’t name it. Maybe it was a mercurial fairness that validated their personal play styles and tastes. Maybe it was a fancy skin — truly epic decolletage for their assassin main — that would get their blood boiling. Maybe it was just the promise that the game could change and, by extension, they could change, too.

Unfortunately, the games never really got better and the forums just got worse. Patches would arrive and analysts would work overtime to tear apart the release notes, line-by-line, putting up four- and five-hour-long marathon videos that delved into fractional updates with halachic extrapolation. “See, with his reload time reduced by 0.5 seconds, he can squeeze a round in between his ult and the Big Boom. This changes everything.”

But in the end, it changed nothing. Players despaired. Maybe they would never reclaim the magic that they remembered that game once had, when they were younger and the play was fresh.
> # What if the newest release notes can’t cure the griefers camping your spawn anymore than the new can cure grief itself?

I fear my apps will have to learn this lesson the hard way. I suspect all this anxiety — this nervous twitching of software, the frantic petitioning of the bulletin boards — is an unpleasant defense mechanism to distract us from a truth that is worse. Perhaps, despite all this eagerness and hope for novelty, there is nothing else out there.

Jacques Lacan, a psychoanalyst who died before he could know the pleasure of apps, once said in a seminar on anxiety: “In short, there is nothing except that which is current, that is why it is so difficult to live in the world… ” Our software yearns for unknown pleasures, while we crave the freshest content. But what if you already have everything you need, and you still aren’t happy? What if your Photoshop will never get the filter that will make you an artist, and Final Draft will always lack that killer feature that will help you finish your screenplay? What if the newest release notes can’t cure the griefers camping your spawn anymore than the new can cure grief itself? What if you have access to lifetimes of music, but you’ll keep looping the playlists of your youth, just like your parents did, until you die?

Our apps are anxious because the people who make our apps are anxious, afraid that we will learn the secret truth of the patch, the bad infinity of infinite scroll. The release cycle reaffirms the sacred covenant of incremental progress. Our world is getting better — just look at this shiny content-aware fill tool! When we go to our apps and find them unusable because they are updating, making sure that we are still connected to the source, they are protecting us from realizing that we already have more than enough. The download bar is a veil dance, hiding a hole that is already plugged up with plugins, already stuffed full with hats and DLC and absolute garbage tweets.

I don’t know how to make my apps less anxious. I cured my skittish message board habits when I found happiness in the churn of the forums and stopped waiting for something else. As Todd McGowan, another professor theorizing our neuroses, once [wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;), “The ethical position, for psychoanalysis, necessarily involves the embrace of this anxiety — and this is at once the path to enjoyment.”

I doubt our apps will ever know this satisfaction. If anything, the cresting wave of hyper-bundled subscription services (Apple News, Apple Games, Hulu-Spotify, Amazon-Twitch) will just accelerate wanting, more deeply embossing the promise of the new and the next. We often speculate the end of computing looks like an all-knowing orb or a Skynet spawning android super-soldiers to murder us. But maybe it just looks like a beachball that never stops spinning, never lets us open our apps because they are always fetching the latest data. Wouldn’t that be funny?<|endoftext|>

# ‘The Walking Dead’ Is Weird as Hell and Worth Streaming Again

## ‘The Walking Dead’ Is Weird as Hell and Worth Streaming Again

### *Ratings have dropped, but with a new showrunner and fresh foes, the zombies are worth revisiting*

*(Note: This story contains spoilers about *The Walking Dead’s just-completed ninth season*, but to be honest, they’ll probably make you want to watch the show again when it hits Netflix.)*

If you’re one of the millions of viewers who have [stopped watching](&lt;|url|&gt;) *The Walking Dead *since 2016, I can say with absolute honesty—for the first time in years—that this is a damn shame. While AMC’s venerable zombie apocalypse show has managed to squander much of its once immense popularity, the series’ just-wrapped ninth season proved that it is once again one of TV’s most entertaining dramas. Now if only its former audience knew.

I don’t blame anyone who gave up on the series between the show’s apex—culminating in 2016’s [infuriating, insulting cliffhanger](&lt;|url|&gt;)—and the two boring, interminable seasons that followed. After it was announced that star Andrew Lincoln, who played the main protagonist Rick Grimes, would be leaving the show in late 2018, there probably didn’t seem to be any particular reason to come back. Now I’m here to tell you there is, and it’s a simple one:

*The Walking Dead* has gotten* *weird.

New showrunner Angela Kang seems to be the one to thank. And the shift began, appropriately enough, with Lincoln’s final episode. While most viewers—[myself included](&lt;|url|&gt;)—assumed the only way Rick’s character would achieve any narrative closure would be to die heroically, Kang had a different plan in mind. Instead, Rick blew up a bridge he was standing on (it’s a long story), appeared to die, but then was seized by mysterious people and flown away in a helicopter to a mysterious location. It was completely bizarre, and it was also interesting as hell. Viewers still have no idea where he is, but AMC‘s canny announcement Lincoln would return as Rick in future *Walking Dead* TV movies has kept fans satisfied that they’ll eventually get to see what happened to the character who was the heart of the show.

After that shocker, Kang wisely used the opportunity afforded by such a seismic change to reset the series. Following a similar development from the original *Walking Dead* comics, the story jumped forward about seven years. Not only did this allow the characters in the world to move on from Rick’s death off-screen—as opposed to spending half a season wallowing in despair—it automatically gave viewers new, intriguing mysteries about their favorite remaining characters. Why had communication between the three communities broken down? Why did Michonne and Daryl have brands on them? Where was Maggie? What the hell had happened to everybody?
> # These people have decided the best way to live in the zombie apocalypse is to cut off zombies’ faces, wear them like masks, and then go shambling along with them.

This reboot started out with remarkable freshness and energy and was a perfect place to get onboard with the series. But the millions of fans who stopped watching over the last few years needed something more—something that would make *The Walking Dead* unique again, not just among the writhing piles of zombie entertainment that now clog up the pop culture megasphere, but even compared to the eight seasons of the show that preceded it.

They finally got it in the Whisperers, a set of new foes introduced in season nine. The Whisperers may be the most bizarre group of characters yet in a show that has been filled with them. There was the Kingdom, which had ersatz knights and a king. Then there were the inhabitants of Terminus, who seemingly chose to become cannibals about 15 minutes after the first corpse rose from the dead. My favorite may be the Scavengers, who, I kid you not, seemed to be some kind of [expressionist art collective](&lt;|url|&gt;) who lived in a garbage dump.

The Whisperers are something else entirely. These people have decided the best way to live in the zombie apocalypse is to cut off zombies’ faces, wear them like masks, and then go shambling along with them. They simply hang out with them, and they whisper to one another so they don’t, you know, get noticed and eaten by the dozens of zombies they are willingly walking among.

This is deeply hilarious. Even in the heightened reality of *The Walking Dead*,* *even in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse, this is an absurdly dangerous ethos. The group’s “only the strong survive” mentality prevents them from guarding themselves against zombies—meaning they get eaten with some regularity. And yet there are dozens, if not hundreds, of survivors who seem to be completely onboard with this unique and highly questionable lifestyle choice.

But there is a method to this madness. The fact that humans in zombie disguises now hide among actual zombies has brought excitement back to the show’s decaying bread-and-butter action because there’s always a chance that a zombie may suddenly spring into action and murder a main character. There was also a chilling moment in episode 11 (“Bounty”) where the Whisperers had to leave a crying baby on the ground for zombies to eat. (It survived. The show hasn’t quite crossed that line. Yet.)

That’s not all. Apparently being able to walk among the dead has allowed the Whisperers to somehow weaponize their decomposing pals. Alpha, the leader of the Whisperers, has a herd of thousands of zombies her followers can order like an army.

Nothing about these guys makes any sense, but they are a hell of a lot of fun to watch. And these are just the main new antagonists. The show has also introduced a group of survivors called the Highwaymen, who are essentially survivors who have decided to become a bunch of ’80s-era Hank Williams Jr. impersonators.

But the *pièce de résistance* has to be the unnamed group revealed in a flashback to have caused much of the psychological and emotional damage that occurred during the time jump. See, a few years ago, a fairly pregnant Michonne and her Alexandrians came across a woman guarding a bunch of ragamuffin kids—and the woman was one of Michonne’s old high school buddies. What could go wrong?

If you’ve seen *The Walking Dead,* you know the answer to that. It turns out Michonne’s friend has been training her Dickensian gang to steal supplies and murder adults in order to survive—except somehow these kids are much more dedicated to murdering adults than surviving. Her former friend orders her charges to continually attack Michonne, forcing the mother-to-be to essentially kill a first-grade classroom full of kids in self-defense. This scene is *The Walking Dead* at its most, well, *Walking Dead*: audacious, incredibly dark, and completely unique. For a show that just wrapped its ninth season, that’s an incredible achievement, not least because it’s been such a long time since the series could be described as any of those things.

The news that *The Walking Dead*’s season nine ender was the lowest-rated finale in the show’s history is not good, but it can’t have been that unexpected among Kang and her producers. After all, there are a lot of terrible *Walking Dead* episodes to make up for, and a single season—no matter how good it is—can only do so much. It’ll take at least a year, and most likely more, to win back even a fraction of the millions who have walked away from *The Walking Dead*.

If these audiences ever decide to return, season nine is exactly where they need to start over—as long as they’re comfortable with the zombie apocalypse getting weird.<|endoftext|>

# Palmer Luckey Revolutionized VR. Now He’s Selling A.I. to the Marines.

## The technology will allow for 24/7 automated surveillance near the U.S.-Mexico border in Yuma, Arizona, among other locations

![Video via Anduril](<|image|>)*Video via Anduril*

Palmer Luckey, the virtual reality pioneer who founded Oculus, is now responsible for a real-world defense contractor.

Luckey’s defense firm Anduril is supplying the United States Marine Corps with $13.5 million in surveillance technology to secure four of its bases around the world, according to [documents](&lt;|url|&gt;) obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request and [released today by Mijente](&lt;|url|&gt;), a Latinx activist organization lobbying tech firms to stop supplying technical support for border detentions and deportations. Other documents released by Mijente suggest that Luckey’s firm is also supplying drones and surveillance towers to third-party contractors, which are then selling the equipment to Customs and Border Protection.

Anduril did not immediately respond to a request for comment from *OneZero*.

The company’s technology will “autonomously detect and classify objects as humans on foot, wheeled and tracked vehicles on land, surface swimmers, and surface vessels and boats, and alert operators of such objects,” according to one of the documents obtained by Mijente and shared with journalists, which details the agreement between Anduril and the Marines. The contract describes the Anduril technology as a tool to autonomously detect potential intrusions to Marine locations on “surrounding air, land, and sea, through all-weather conditions.” What this means is that the Marines could use Anduril’s technology for 24/7 automated surveillance around its bases — including one near the U.S.-Mexico border in Yuma, Arizona, which has experienced a surge in border crossings so severe that in April the town’s mayor [signed a proclamation of emergency](&lt;|url|&gt;). (The other bases mentioned in the documents are in Hawaii and Japan.)

Until now, there has been little concrete evidence that Anduril was making money from government contracts. The startup — which was founded in 2017 — had reportedly received funding under the Pentagon’s Project Maven, according to [*The Intercept](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, but the report didn’t detail anything but the arrangement itself.
> # Anduril’s approach to the defense industry takes popular technologies developed elsewhere in Silicon Valley and adapts them for military use

At a time when some Silicon Valley companies have pulled back from working with the Pentagon, Anduril is one of a number of firms that are courting a relationship with the U.S. military and its $730 billion budget. The primary example is Palantir, the secretive data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel, which has [reportedly](&lt;|url|&gt;) built mass surveillance tools for police to track suspects from even the slightest bit of information.

Luckey started work on Anduril [the day after he left Facebook](&lt;|url|&gt;) in March 2017, after *The Daily Beast* [broke](&lt;|url|&gt;) the news that he had funded alt-right group Nimble America. (Both Facebook and Luckey have declined to say Luckey was forced out due to political views, but in a [later interview](&lt;|url|&gt;) Luckey heavily implies that was the case.)

Luckey met Trae Stephens, a former Palantir engineer turned Founders Fund employee, at an event put on by the venture capital firm in 2014 and the two kept in touch, according to a *Wired* [profile](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the company. Stephens and Luckey convinced the Founders Fund to invest in their company and also pitched Palantir on the idea. After that meeting, Palantir’s head of engineering Brian Schimpf joined Anduril and is now CEO.

Stephens, who worked on government contracting for Founders Fund, is especially bullish on bringing the speed and skills of Silicon Valley contractors to the defense industry.

“If you look back over the last 30 years since the end of the Cold War, the only two venture-backed companies that do the majority of their business with the government that have become worth more than a billion dollars are Palantir and SpaceX,” he said on the [Eye on AI](&lt;|url|&gt;) podcast [last month](&lt;|url|&gt;). “And so, I think part of this problem is how do we get the Defense Department.”

Founders Fund — where Stephens still works — is the lead investor for Anduril, as it was for Palantir. Even the firm’s name, Anduril, mimics Palantir’s *Lord of the Rings* reference. Anduril is the reforged sword of Aragon, a main character of the series, while Palantir references a crystal ball used by wizards to spy on events from afar.

Anduril’s approach to the defense industry takes popular technologies developed elsewhere in Silicon Valley and adapts them for military use. The company employs artificial intelligence algorithms running on Nvidia hardware to detect people, vehicles, and animals, according to the company [website](&lt;|url|&gt;). Nvidia hardware is found in gadgets like the Nintendo Switch, nearly every self-driving car prototype, and in the heart of major tech company data centers.

Anduril’s A.I. research, which is centered on the ability to automatically identify people and things through cameras, is fundamentally similar to consumer-facing projects like auto-tagging on Facebook — with the obvious distinction that Anduril is selling its wares to the military. A listing on an A.I. industry conference [job board](&lt;|url|&gt;) says that the company is interested in pose estimation, a [common](&lt;|url|&gt;) element of A.I. research in which an algorithm tries to identify the orientation of a person’s limbs. This software is what made the Microsoft Kinect able to look at people in their living rooms and track their movement for [virtual tennis](&lt;|url|&gt;). It could now be used to identify people crossing the U.S. and Mexico border.

Silicon Valley was essentially built with defense industry dollars, as the historian Margaret O’Mara [describes](&lt;|url|&gt;) in her new book *The Code*, but in recent years more consumer-focused companies like [Amazon](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Google](&lt;|url|&gt;) have faced employee protests over government contracts that would use their technology to track immigrants or assist in drone targeting. In the Eye on AI podcast interview, Stephens implied there was a void to fill.

“It didn’t seem like the tech community was responding to the call for help that was coming from the Pentagon,” he said. “If someone was going to do this, it should just be us.”<|endoftext|>

# Researchers Are Translating Brain Activity Into Speech

## It could lead to a computer-generated speaking tool for the speech impaired

Scientists are getting closer to developing a computer-generated tool to allow people with severe speech impairments — like the late cosmologist Stephen Hawking — to communicate verbally.

In a paper published today in the journal [*Nature](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a team of researchers at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) report that they’re working on an early computerized system that can decode brain signals from movements made while speaking, and then translate those movements into sounds. The authors said in a press briefing that the study is a proof of principle that it’s possible to synthesize speech by reading brain activity. “It’s been a long-standing goal of our lab to create technologies to restore communications for people with severe speech disability,” says co-author Dr. Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at UCSF.

The UCSF team’s system works in two stages. In the first, a device surgically attached to the surface of the brain picks up neural activity for vocal tract movements. That neural activity is used to estimate the physical movements of the jaw, larynx, lips, and tongue while a person is speaking. In the second stage, those movements are decoded so the computer can recreate the sounds as synthesized speech, like an artificial vocal tract.

![Image of an example array of intracranial electrodes of the type used to record brain activity in the current study. Credit: UCSF](<|image|>)*Image of an example array of intracranial electrodes of the type used to record brain activity in the current study. Credit: UCSF*

To train the system, the researchers asked people without speech disabilities to carefully read sentences while the researchers recorded their neural activity. The men and women, who suffer from epilepsy, already needed a sensor on their brains as part of their clinical treatment and agreed to participate in the study.

The authors report that their computer’s synthesizer-produced speech had energy patterns that closely tracked that of the original spoken sentences. But there are still challenges to making computer synthesized sounds understandable. In a test reported in this study, men and women were asked to transcribe the synthesized speech choosing from a list of provided words, and the authors report that about 70% of words were correctly transcribed.

One of the team’s most impressive achievements is that they managed to decode speech signals in the brain in real-time. In the synthetic speech system that [Hawking famously used](&lt;|url|&gt;), he controlled a cursor by moving his cheek and the software’s predictive algorithm would help him select words he wanted to type. A spelling-based system like that could produce about 5 to 10 words per minute, according to Chang. This new system uses natural rates of speaking, around 120 to 150 words per minute, and has the potential to help people communicate far faster than spelling-based systems.
> # By modeling the vocal tract movements, “the authors tap into existing neural processes for speech production that are likely generative.”

In another test, the team had study subjects mime the sentences without producing any sound. The system was still able to decode the signals based on the brain activity from the vocal tract movements. “This is an interesting finding in the context of future speech prostheses for people unable to speak,” says Blaise Yvert of the University Grenoble Alpes who has also [published research on speech synthesizers](&lt;|url|&gt;) and was not involved with the study. “Yet this result should be confirmed in other participants and also when participants imagine speaking without performing any movement.”

Other research groups are also getting closer to a functioning brain activity-based speech decoder. Nima Mesgarani of Columbia University led a team that published similar experiments earlier this year in [*Scientific Reports](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. Mesgarani’s team focused on neural activity in the sensory cortex, the part of the brain where speech perception happens, while the UCSF team focused on the motor cortex, the part of the brain where the muscular movements behind speech production occurs. “What approach will ultimately prove better for decoding the imagined speech condition remains to be seen, but it is likely that a hybrid of the two may be the best,” says Mesgarani.


By modeling the vocal tract movements, “the authors tap into existing neural processes for speech production that are likely generative as they demonstrated in their mimed-speech condition, and somewhat more intuitive for individuals to use in future clinical applications to restore speech for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments,” says Jonathan Brumberg of the University of Kansas who was not involved with the study.

While the UCSF team is mostly focused on the engineering of the system itself, they acknowledge the potential for clinical trials and studies that will include people with communication disabilities. But while the underlying mechanisms of how the brain activity relates to speech is the same across people, each person’s brain is different, and so future attempts to use this technology in someone who cannot speak would need to be personalized appropriately.

The system also requires placing a sensor directly on the brain, which limits the pool of people available to train the system. (No ethics board would allow study subjects to have an invasive device put on their brain, which is why the *Nature *study relied on people who already needed to have such devices implanted.) “It will be exciting to see over coming years whether similar results can be obtained using noninvasive brain-imaging approaches that do not involve surgery,” says Ian Wiggins of the Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, who was not involved with the study. “If so, this could really open up new possibilities for people who have lost the ability to communicate because of neurological damage.”<|endoftext|>

# Google’s Most Interesting I/O Announcements, Ranked

## Hint: The new Pixel phone isn’t one of them

![Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty*

As major tech events go, Google I/O lacks the glamour of an iPhone launch, the tension and drama of a Facebook keynote, or the cringe-inducing, over-the-top spectacle of a Samsung unveiling. The company’s announcements tend to be wonky, incremental, and heavily focused on artificial intelligence, especially its confusing inner workings.

Yet I find Google’s annual developer conference the most consistently intriguing of the four, because the company isn’t just releasing nifty gadgets: It’s pushing the boundaries of what can be automated, down to the most quotidian tasks in our everyday lives. In the process, Google is giving us glimpses of a future that often looks more like sci-fi than we’re really prepared to grapple with — even as it tries to reassure us with privacy and security measures that often feel like attempts to paper over the can of worms it just opened.

Here are the announcements that stood out during Google’s opening keynote, held at Mountain View’s Shoreline Amphitheatre on Tuesday, May 7. I’ve ranked them, not necessarily by their traditional news value, but according to my own opinion as to how interesting they are — that is, their potential to shake up the existing relationships between humans and machines.

## **1. A souped-up Google Assistant**

![Image courtesy of Google](<|image|>)*Image courtesy of Google*

It may lack the name recognition of Siri or Alexa, partly because it lacks a catchy name. But Google’s Assistant is one of the world’s most widely used consumer A.I. products, powering more than 1 billion devices around the world via Android phones, tablets, smart speakers, and smart displays. In many ways, it was already the most advanced — and now Google says it has found a way to make it 10 times faster, by pulling a lot of the complex computing out of the cloud and onto each user’s device.

Practically speaking, that means you can operate your Android phone faster by voice than you could by touch. In an onstage demo, a Google rep fired off a string of voice commands that required Google Assistant to access multiple apps, execute specific actions, and understand not only what the rep was saying, but what she actually meant. “Hey Google, what’s the weather today? What about tomorrow? Show me John Legend on Twitter. Get a Lyft ride to my hotel. Turn the flashlight on. Turn it off. Take a selfie.” Assistant executed the whole sequence flawlessly in a span of about 15 seconds. Further demos showed off its ability to compose texts and emails that drew on information about the user’s travel plans, traffic conditions, and photos.

All of that, of course, relies on users continuing to grant Google’s software deep access into their lives, which is why the company will have a hard time ever “pivoting to privacy,” [as Facebook plans to](&lt;|url|&gt;). But Google’s push to perform this machine learning locally on your device will help control the flow of personal data to the cloud, and new privacy features, such as the ability to regularly delete old data, should help. Even so, Google’s vision of the future is still one in which it learns more and more about you all the time. How that squares with the preferences of an increasingly privacy-conscious public remains to be seen.

The next-generation Google Assistant will come first to Pixel phones later this year.

Sticking with the theme of managing your personal life, Google’s new Nest Hub Max exemplifies the type of potent, versatile hardware the company can build to take advantage of all that data and A.I. It basically throws every Google smart home device together into one, combining a Nest security camera, a Google Home Hub smart display, and Google Home Max smart speakers in a single gadget that’s meant to sit in your living room and act as a command center for your household.

The combination of all those features, especially the camera, opens some new possibilities that could make the Nest Hub Max more capable than the sum of its parts. For instance, it is beginning to incorporate some gesture controls, like the ability to raise one hand to pause a song or video — something that will come in handy for anyone who has ever tried to repeatedly yell “Hey Google, stop!” above the din of a noisy room. Face recognition allows it to distinguish between members of your family and personalize greetings and information to each, as well as alerting you if it sees a stranger in your home when they’re not supposed to be.

Creepy? It sure has that vibe, which is why Google included a green indicator light to tell you when the camera is on and a switch that cuts off power to both the camera and its mic. But for the millions who have already decided to allow smart devices from Google, Amazon, and other tech companies into their home, the Nest Hub Max could have a lot of appeal. This is the closest Google has come yet to its longtime dream of building a [real-life *Star Trek* computer](&lt;|url|&gt;).

The Nest Hub Max will launch this summer at $229.

## **3. Automatic, real-time captioning for video and audio**

This is one of those features that might seem minor to some people but is crucial to others, and it could have far-reaching effects. Google’s latest mobile operating system, Android Q, can transcribe the words from any video or audio you play on your device—in real time—and overlay them on your screen. That means you can effectively turn on A.I.-generated closed captioning for everything from YouTube videos to autoplay clips in your social feeds to a video you took of your friends on vacation.

On the level of the average user, it’s a relatively small convenience. But assuming it works and is widely used, it could be a big deal for mobile video more broadly: The format has arguably been held back by people not wanting to turn on the sound when they don’t have headphones in. And, of course, it’s even more of a breakthrough for the hundreds of millions of people around the world who are deaf or hard of hearing.

The Live Caption feature is built into Android Q, and you can activate it with a tap.

## **4. New transparency tools for **A.I.

![Screenshot via Google I/O](<|image|>)*Screenshot via Google I/O*

A fundamental problem with cutting-edge machine learning software is that A.I. can draw conclusions based on signals and features that are opaque to the people using it and, often, even the people building it. For example, you probably couldn’t say exactly why your Instagram feed is ordered as it is. Shut into a black box, algorithms can be dangerously biased or discriminatory, even if their creators didn’t intend to make them that way.

At Google I/O, CEO Sundar Pichai touted the company’s use of an approach called TCAV, or testing with concept activation vectors, to shed light on the conceptual “reasoning” that underlies the software’s outputs. For instance, in an example that Google offered, it could tell you that the software identified an image’s subject as a doctor partly because of the white coat and stethoscope, but also partly because the person appeared to be male — presumably because it was trained on a dataset in which men were more likely than women to be doctors. Just identifying that bias doesn’t fix the problem, of course, but it’s a necessary first step toward confronting and correcting for those sorts of biases.

## **5. Incognito mode for Maps, Search, and YouTube**

If Google is going to continue to build its business on the combination of A.I. and personal data — and I/O 2019 strongly suggests that it is — then it’s going to have to find ways to reconcile that with tougher privacy regulations, more intense media scrutiny, and greater public awareness of the trade-offs involved. Google already announced last week that it will let you [auto-delete some of your sensitive data](&lt;|url|&gt;), including location and activity history.

At I/O, the company announced a new “incognito” mode for Google Maps, which will stop keeping records of your whereabouts while it’s enabled. That’s important, because your location data is some of your most sensitive, revealing behaviors that could be of interest not only to advertisers but also to stalkers and other malicious actors. It’s akin to the incognito mode that has long been part of Google’s Chrome browser. The company said it will also bring incognito features to Google Search and YouTube in the months to come.

## **Honorable mentions**

* [**A cheaper Pixel phone](&lt;|url|&gt;):*** *While everyone else’s smartphones are getting more expensive, Google is heading the other way with its new Pixel 3a. It will be less powerful than the existing Pixel 3, but at a base price of $399, it will be half as expensive. Reviewers are [already recommending it](&lt;|url|&gt;) as an option for buyers who want the best smartphone camera at the lowest price.

* [**Focus mode](&lt;|url|&gt;):** A new feature coming to Android P and Q devices this summer will let you turn off your most distracting apps to focus on a task, while still allowing text messages, calls, and other important notifications through.

* [**Augmented reality in Google Maps](&lt;|url|&gt;):** AR is one of those technologies that always seems to impress the tech companies that make it more than it impresses their actual users. But Google may finally be finding some practical uses for it, like overlaying walking directions when you hold up your phone’s camera to the street in front of you.

* [**Automatic rental car bookings and movie tickets](&lt;|url|&gt;):** Google’s most controversial demo last year featured an A.I. system that could place a call to book restaurant reservations for you automatically. Ethicists wondered whether the receptionists on the other end would be informed that they’re talking to a machine and not a human. This year, Google found a less thorny application for its A.I. reservations bot: Duplex on the Web can rent you a car or buy your movie tickets online by filling in all the required fields with your information — no uncanny valley required.<|endoftext|>

# The Ethically Questionable Math Game Taking Over U.S. Schools

## Kids love “edutainment,” but does the business model exploit them?

![Illustration: [Ben Voldman](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Ben Voldman](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Perched on a rise overlooking the Hudson River, the Main Street School in Irvington, New York, looks like a study for a Norman Rockwell painting, with a century-old brick façade and a blacktop area where kids play four square at recess. But the lost-in-time vibe gets a record scratch once or twice a week when the computer cart loaded with Google Chromebooks rolls into each classroom. After using the laptops for editing essays or doing online research, the kids can spend the rest of the period playing a video game called *Prodigy*, a massively multiplayer online game in which players roam a virtual landscape, engaging one another in magical combat. Think *World of Warcraft *crossbred with the flat, cartoony style of *Neopets.*

Given the growing concern about children’s overuse of screens, it might seem odd to find a school encouraging its pupils to play a video game. But *Prodigy *is different: To cast their battle spells, kids first have to solve math problems automatically calibrated to their achievement level.

The game succeeds in making math so much fun that kids actually clamor to play it. “They love it,” says Loren Holand, a fifth-grade teacher at Main Street School. “And I love the fact that the kids feel like they are playing a game but are actually practicing mathematical skills and concepts.”

Holand’s experience is not unique. In the past five years, the Ontario-based company Prodigy Game has grown sales by [9,230 percent](&lt;|url|&gt;) and now has more than 5 million active monthly users in the United States and Canada.

Common Sense Media, a nonprofit based in San Francisco that vets children’s media for quality and appropriateness, rates the game five stars out of five. “*Prodigy* does a great job of both entertaining students and providing them with valuable math lessons,” its website declares.

Not everyone is so happy about the spread of video games as an educational tool. Spurred by [media reports](&lt;|url|&gt;) of research suggesting that excessive screen time can result in social isolation and depression, an increasing number of parents are pressing for kids to spend less time plugged in, not more — even if that time is spent on an edutainment game.
> # “We consider games like Fortnite our direct competitors. As soon as they get home, that’s when we have our true competition.”

“We’re troubled by the whole push to get kids online in schools,” says Josh Golin, the father of a fourth-grader and executive director of the Boston-based nonprofit Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. “It’s being done because of a lot of hype and a lot of marketing to educators and to parents, and there’s not a lot of research that’s showing that this is a more effective teaching tool.”

And then there’s the issue of Prodigy Game’s business model, which relies on kids making in-app purchases of virtual goods with real money to augment their characters. Such “freemium” models have helped turbocharge the growth of popular video games like *Fortnite*, but critics and parents question its place in software that is meant to be educational.

“Why should kids be seeing advertising in a classroom? That, to me, just doesn’t make sense,” says Wendy Hart, co-founder of HeadsUp Rivertowns, a nonprofit group concerned about excessive use of screens by kids.

*Prodigy *is the brainchild of Rohan Mahimker and co-founder Alex Peters, both 30 years old. As a kid, Mahimker was obsessed with *Pokémon*, the hit video game series where players battle each other with collectible monsters. His mother, meanwhile, wanted him to spend his free time at Kumon, an after-school math and reading program. Later, as a student at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Mahimker had an idea: What if you could combine the two? In 2011, Mahimker and his classmate Peters created Prodigy Game and set about turning that inspiration into a business.

Prodigy Game isn’t the only company that has found success using screens to lure kids into learning. The “edutainment” space is booming. A 2016 [study](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the market research firm Ambient Insight found that between 2010 and 2015, the number of teachers using computer games in the classroom more than doubled, with global game-based learning revenues expected to climb from $2.6 billion in 2016 to more than $7 billion by 2021.

One reason the field is growing so fast is that the technology now exists to make the software both effective and actually fun. This isn’t *Oregon Trail* — *Prodigy *uses an algorithm to figure out which math questions to pose for users in their spell-casting battles. The company is currently hiring more engineers with experience in A.I. and machine learning to further refine its algorithm.

“We have to make sure we’re not consistently putting them in a position where they’re always learning, because they’ll get mental burnout,” says Steve Bergen, director of product at Prodigy Game. In other words, kids should be challenged, but not to the point of frustration. The more users play the game, the more data its algorithm has and the more effective its predictions.

The ultimate reason for *Prodigy*’s explosive growth is that kids don’t just tolerate it under the watchful eye of a teacher—they voluntarily log on to play after school as well. “We consider games like *Fortnite *our direct competitors,” Bergen says. “As soon as they get home, that’s when we have our true competition.”
> # Prodigy’s sole revenue stream is nudging kids to upgrade to a paid membership, a status that gives them access to outfits, hats, and little creatures that will follow them around.

To sweeten the pot, *Prodigy *gives parents and teachers elaborate control panels to monitor kids’ progress and adjust goals and rewards. And because Prodigy Game distributes its software on a freemium basis, teachers can incorporate it into their curriculum without having to go to the school board to ask for money.

While crucial for *Prodigy*’s rapid uptake, that model has engendered sharp criticism. The game’s sole revenue stream is nudging kids to upgrade to a paid membership, a status that gives them access to outfits, hats, and little creatures that will follow them around.

“The whole issue of having ads in a program like this is extremely troubling, and I think that viewing ads should not be a part of the school day,” Golin says. “It really indoctrinates kids into that virtual junk economy. I don’t think we should be teaching kids that the reason to learn is so you can buy a virtual reward for a character that doesn’t even really exist.”

Bergen insists that in-game purchases have no effect on what’s really important — namely, learning math. “They don’t make you any stronger,” he says. “They just make you look, maybe, cooler. The education content is not locked.”

As with most such games, the ask is hidden inside the app, so parents don’t see the potential cost when they first agree to let their kids play. Teachers don’t see any kind of messaging about the paid content when viewing the *Prodigy *dashboard, Holand said.

Of course, many kids first encounter the game at school, without parental oversight. That strategy can backfire, as Facebook [found out last month](&lt;|url|&gt;) when it came under fire for encouraging kids to make in-app purchases without parental supervision. In pushing similarly profit-motivated freemium software in their classrooms, public schools could be seen as in contributing to the exploitation of their pupils by introducing a commercial element into education.

“If we believe that these programs are beneficial and essential to student learning, then we should pay for them,” Golin says, “not pay for them through children’s attention and forced consumption of advertising.”

But for kids, who are already well adapted to constant come-ons from purveyors of free software, a few more ads are barely enough to register on their consciousness. For my own seven-year-old, the main take-home seems to be that he likes it, and grown-ups will let him play it.

“The last math game you made me play was torture,” he tells me. “*Prodigy* is actually fun.”<|endoftext|>

# Your Power Button Won’t Last Forever

## Companies like Apple want to strip away every mechanical bit

![Photo by [Jamie Street](&lt;|url|&gt;)/[Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Jamie Street](&lt;|url|&gt;)/[Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

You’re close to becoming powerless over your phone, and it all has to do with the little “wake” button on its skinny right side.

Companies like Apple have worked for decades to remove mechanical parts, including true power switches, from the gadgets they release to the public. Opening up these devices, fixing them, or even fully disabling hardware features has become much more difficult. That’s created a new status quo of slender electronics that corporations have full control over — displacing you, the consumer who paid a lot of cash to “own” a modern smartphone.

This transformation didn’t come out of nowhere. In fact, the seeds of this tech transition can be seen in completely unassuming appliances from long ago. My grandparents had one of those lamps where you would touch the metal casing to turn it on. It was a fun gimmick, but the novelty wore off quickly.

It turns out that physical switches have a lot going for them. They work when your hands are wet — my grandparents’ lamp was impossible to use after I washed my hands. A switch’s position can tell you if something is on or off. They are predictable. And cats don’t turn them on in the middle of the night.

Today, simple, intuitive objects like light switches are being replaced by internet-connected smart switches. We’ve become disconnected from how things actually work. If the bits that make the switch function are stuffed away inside a microchip, then we have no idea where to turn when things go wrong. Like when Google decided to [permanently disable](&lt;|url|&gt;) its smart-home hub Revolv, instantly disabling smart homes around the world.
> # I’m just one short circuit away from frying the phone.

This digitization has brought about a lot of changes. The platonic ideal of a modern gadget is thin and waterproof, with no moving parts inside. Any interruptions to the device’s smooth exterior gets in the way of that design imperative — for a removable battery, say. Or a fan vent. Or a power button. But the path to removing these features has been fraught.

Steve Jobs hated anything that got in the way of a seamless user experience. He especially despised fans and famously demanded that the Apple III eschew active cooling. Despite massive heatsinks, the lack of cooling created a thermal expansion problem that forced chips to migrate out of their sockets. Apple’s recommended “[fix](&lt;|url|&gt;)” was to lift your computer six inches off your desktop, then let it drop — in hopes that the chips would reseat themselves on impact. Seamless user experience indeed.

Years later, Jobs created the [Power Mac G4 Cube](&lt;|url|&gt;). Like the Apple III, the G4 Cube was fanless. It also eschewed one mechanical item possessed by almost every electronic device to date: a power switch.

The Power Mac G4 Cube took a capacitive cue from my grandparents’ lamp. Stroke the top of the case and the touch sensor would power the system on. No snick, no physical feedback. Just touch the top and *bong*, the Mac’s F-sharp major chord would sing, and the friendly face of Mac OS would beam at you while the machine booted.

The cube never sold well. *Low End Mac* [explains](&lt;|url|&gt;) one reason why: That touch sensor was awful. “Touch it by accident and watch the Cube shut down. That was annoying every time it happened — and even once was too often.”

The Cube failed, and Apple’s replacement had a proper power switch. But with Steve Jobs in the driver’s seat, mechanical switches were not long for this world.

I run *iFixit*, where we teach people how to open and repair electronics, including Steve Jobs’ greatest invention: the iPhone. His “internet communicator” ushered in a great many changes to cellphones in one fell swoop. Amid all the grand transformation, one detail went mostly overlooked: Jobs had finally managed to kill the power switch. Instead of a mechanical switch, you now held down the side “wake” button for a second, then swiped a virtual indicator on the screen to power it off.

Other phone makers followed suit. The Google Pixel 3, unveiled this week, has precisely three physical buttons and one USB-C charge port. That’s a huge divergence from the dozens of buttons (and a headphone jack) on the BlackBerries of yore.

The power-buttonless phones work okay day-to-day but present a challenge for repairers like me. Our normal approach to working on electronics — any electronics — is to disconnect the power before we do anything. But without an off switch or a removable battery, you have to disassemble the phone in order to remove power. So that’s what we do.
> # We’ve become disconnected from how things actually work.

The first step when I’m [servicing an iPhone](&lt;|url|&gt;) is to open it up and [disconnect the battery](&lt;|url|&gt;). Then, and only then, am I confident that the power is off. In fact, it’s common for me to have a phone halfway open only to have the screen power back on. That’s scary — I’m just one short circuit away from frying the phone. So I carefully reach inside and unplug the battery cable. Only then is the phone truly off and safe to work on.

## **Levers of Power**

There’s an element of agency intrinsic to a power switch. You are literally in control of the lever of power. There’s often a pivotal scene in science fiction novels that use robots to explore the line between machine and human intelligence: The robot glitches out and threatens its maker, so the heroine reaches behind its neck and — *snick* — shuts off its power. Turns out, that moment may soon be a reality.

Last year, lawmakers in the European Union [proposed legislation](&lt;|url|&gt;) requiring every robot be equipped with a “kill switch.” With [knife-wielding Roombas wandering around](&lt;|url|&gt;), that may not be such a bad idea.

And so I wonder about my phone. Without a way to definitively remove power, I never really know if it’s actually off. Is my phone listening to me right now? If I started talking with a friend about taking a vacation to the Maldives, would Facebook start showing me flight suggestions? [A lot of people think so](&lt;|url|&gt;), to the point where it has become a joke. But surely using the software “off switch” to disable your phone will stop that, right?

… Right?

People like Edward Snowden [aren’t so sure](&lt;|url|&gt;). He [told](&lt;|url|&gt;) NBC News that manufacturers — or the National Security Agency — “can absolutely turn them on with the power turned off to the device.” He recommends the rather extreme step of physically [removing the microphone and camera](&lt;|url|&gt;) from any device you’re worried about. And it’s not just phones: Researchers have uncovered ways of [taking control of smart TV sensors](&lt;|url|&gt;) while the TV is ostensibly powered off.

The world of always-on gadgets in our pockets was not inevitable. The current state of affairs is the result of intentional designs that [integrate batteries](&lt;|url|&gt;) inside our devices alongside the wholesale removal of power switches. But it is here. Steve Jobs has won: No major phone manufacturer uses a removable battery or a physical power switch.

And so, the last remaining true power switch available to us is the humble screwdriver. If you can open it, you can turn it off.<|endoftext|>

# ‘Fortnite’ Creative Mode Is Changing How We Think of Game Design

## ’This is all about putting the tools in the hands of people that might not otherwise get the opportunity.’

![Credit: Chesnot/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: Chesnot/Getty Images Plus*

A few days ago, my 11-year-old son sent me a What’sApp message: “Look what I made—it took ages.” There was a video attached, and when I (with some trepidation) hit play, I saw a character from the video game *Fortnite* running over a series of flashing tiles, each of which played a different musical note. As the avatar progressed along the pathway, it became clear the tiles were playing the EDM track “Alone” by Marshmello. My son constructed this masterpiece using the *Fortnite* Creative mode, and frankly, if you can find a better all-purpose metaphor for where childhood, pop music, gaming, social media, and imagination intersect in 2019, I want to see it.

*Fortnite* Creative mode is a digital construction kit—available for free when you download *Fortnite Battle Royale*—that gives users a little island of their own on which to build teeny *Fortnite* cities. When you enter the mode (through a shiny in-game portal that makes you feel like you’re walking into Narnia), your avatar appears on an empty landscape, one that is yours to do with as you will. Open your inventory and you discover hundreds of items to populate your kingdom. There are recognizable *Fortnite* buildings—arctic labs, castle fortresses, cafes—that you can just drag and drop straight onto the map. Or you can choose one of the themed bundles of walls, floors, and ceiling parts, which then arrive on your map in neat rows and piles like the parts of an unassembled Ikea wardrobe. Your architectural marvel is ready for construction.
> # “Letting them mess with a game they’re already fluent with is a great way to show that the game doesn’t just ‘exist.’ It’s made up of all these little things they’re able to touch and change.”

It feels intuitive, mostly because making levels in Creative mode is just like playing *Fornite*, a game that has [more than 200 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) users. You view and navigate the world via your gaming avatar and all the items are accessed through the regular in-game menu system. If you’re lazy, you can just lob buildings onto the landscape—and on top of each other—like grenades, leaving the system to mesh them together into M.C. Escher-esque cities. It is ridiculously compelling.

Creative mode isn’t just a fun building toy; it allows players to add basic game rules to their island, including timers and player spawn points, and then to invite in friends. This isn’t just messing about; Creative mode allows you to become a game designer, creating your own battle royale tournaments. After a few hours with the toolset, you learn how to place objects in relation to each other so they offer challenging jumps and handy hiding places; how to create choke points, where players are funneled into one place, encouraging shoot outs; and how to give the player a sense of flow—that nebulous design concept concerning the interplay of friction and freedom that underpins the very best level designs from *Super Mario Bros.* to *Assassin’s Creed*.

“*Fortnite* Creative mode has the potential to introduce many young people to the idea of game design,” says Nina Freeman, a designer at the independent games company Fullbright. “Letting them mess with a game they’re already fluent with is a great way to show that the game doesn’t just ‘exist.’ It’s made up of all these little things they’re able to touch and change. This realization may not be super obvious at first—a lot of people aren’t really aware of the labor that goes into making the things they play.”

This is an element mentioned by Mare Sheppard of Metanet Software, the company behind the brilliant platform games N+ and N++, which both came with map editors. “Level design, especially in a simpler genre like platformers, can seem quite easy,” she says. “But when you’re actually faced with it for the first time, you begin to understand that it’s a complex craft requiring a lot of experience and practice. There are a ton of nuances to the interactions between levels and the objects and enemies that fill them. Layering even very simple elements can have profoundly complicated results.”

Of course, *Fortnite* is far from the first game to offer a built-in level design mode—such options have been around since the early 1980s. The formative Apple II platformer *Lode Runner *allowed players to make their own levels. After it came *Pinball Construction Kit*, the real-time strategy game *Starcraft*, the skateboarding sim *Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater,* as well as more recent hits, such as *LittleBigPlanet* and *Super Mario Maker.* What all these intuitive modes showed was that opening up a creative tool to a large “amateur” audience invites completely unexpected and often subversive results, as a developer never really knows how players will use the tools it provides.
> # “This is all about putting the tools in the hands of people that might not otherwise get the opportunity.”

“We were surprised—people made all kinds of crazy stuff,” says Mark Healey, co-founder of Media Molecule, the studio behind *LittleBigPlanet*. “The first thing I remember really standing out was when someone made a working calculator. That was when the penny dropped. We often talked internally about the democratization of digital creation. This is all about putting the tools in the hands of people that might not otherwise get the opportunity.”

Every week, *Fortnite* developer Epic Games selects a handful of interesting, well-crafted maps and makes them available to the full player base to try out. I’ve played challenging snow levels where players have to jump between icy platforms as they ascend craggy cliff faces; I’ve played the fiendish *Death Run* courses designed by top YouTuber Cizzors, which challenge you to run as fast as possible through deadly *American Ninja Warrior*-style assault courses; I’ve played multiple intriguing escape rooms. It’s clear that the creators of these maps have learned the foundations of 3D-level design, yet they’re also different enough from the industry to run with weird and transgressive ideas.

Head over to the dedicated *Fortnite* Creative subreddit and you’ll find an entire community of creators and collaborators working on everything from music videos to hoverboard skate parks. Like the game’s famous dances, Creative mode produces content that slots perfectly into our social media-powered, meme-obsessed remix culture. The stuff you make in *Fortnite* can be recorded, edited, and shared as a TikTok video to make a perfect loop of digital creation, consumption, and redistribution.

Even if you never show anyone what you make, there is still something liberating about a favorite game with an easy-to-use editor. It changes your relationship with the product and accentuates the idea that a game is an ongoing conversation between the designer and the player. When I asked on [Twitter](&lt;|url|&gt;) for favorite examples of in-game editors, I received almost 500 replies, many from professional game designers who started out using these games. By exploring a map editor, you begin to understand why key decisions are made and why certain features are so common—and you get a glimpse of the minds of the creators you admire. It’s like seeing a band live and singing along.

Through streaming channels and YouTube videos, playing video games—long the most solitary of acts—is becoming ever more performative. Most of my son’s friends now have YouTube channels filled with videos of them playing games and commenting, just like their heroes, Ninja and PewDiePie. Creative modes are going to become an important part of this new interplay between game-makers and game-buyers, creators, and consumers. A forthcoming title from Media Molecule, entitled *Dreams*, is a hugely ambitious, highly versatile creative tool that will let PlayStation owners make their own games, movies, and albums. The concept is both incredibly modern and yet also nostalgic.

“I was a Commodore 64 fanatic in the ’80s and I was always a bit disappointed when consoles took over from home computers,” says Healey. “It was great to see the technology leap, but what happened to the keyboards and built-in languages? How was one supposed to make stuff for these new machines? The game industry grew out of bedroom coders making stuff on early computers, and I hope *Dreams* will rekindle some of that magical time.”

For now, we have the *Fortnite* Creative mode, with its hundreds of millions of potential users all with different ideas about what creativity is—whether it’s about making an incredible explorable city or a little Marshmello video that only a dad will see.<|endoftext|>

# The One Rule of Content Moderation That Every Platform Follows

## For YouTube, Facebook and the rest, if a decision becomes too controversial, change it

![Photo: Szabo Viktor/Unsplash](<|image|>)*Photo: Szabo Viktor/Unsplash*

Facing pressure to ban a hatemonger, a tech company like Facebook, Google, or Twitter initially demurs, saying that while some may find his speech (or her speech, but usually his) objectionable, it doesn’t violate the platform’s rules. After a torrent of outrage, the tech company changes its mind and takes some form of action. Activists claim victory, conservatives cry censorship, and eventually, the controversy dies down — until the next time.

It’s a cycle that we witnessed last year with Facebook and the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the host of Infowars. The social network first declined to take action against Jones’ pages, saying it would be “contrary to the basic principles of free speech.” After three weeks of public pressure, Facebook changed its stance, saying, “We believe in giving people a voice, but we also want everyone using Facebook to feel safe.”

It played out again last week with Google and Stephen Crowder. Crowder is a right-wing comedian who had used his YouTube channel to lob homophobic taunts at the *Vox* writer Carlos Maza. On June 4, Google-owned YouTube indicated that it had carefully reviewed Maza’s complaints and found that [Crowder hadn’t violated its rules](&lt;|url|&gt;). By the next day, with a rather predictable backlash in full force, YouTube shifted into reverse, saying that a “deeper look” at Crowder’s videos revealed a “[pattern of egregious behavior](&lt;|url|&gt;).” It opted to [“demonetize” his channel](&lt;|url|&gt;), meaning that Crowder could no longer make money from his YouTube videos, though he would not be banned from the site.

To one side, the reversal looks like a hard-won victory: A major tech platform has been shamed into doing the right thing. To another contingent, it smacks of mob rule: A major tech platform has been goaded into moving the goalposts to censor a politically incorrect voice.

What should be clear to both sides, by now, is the extent to which these massive corporations are making up the rules of online speech as they go along. In the absence of any independent standards or accountability, public opinion has become an essential part of the process by which their moderation policies evolve.

Sure, online platforms have policies and terms of service that run thousands of words, which they enforce on a mass scale via software and a bureaucratic review process. But those rules have been stitched together piecemeal and ad hoc over the years to serve the companies’ own needs — which is why they tend to collapse as soon as a high-profile controversy subjects them to public scrutiny. Caving to pressure is a bad look, but it’s an inevitable feature of a system with policies that weren’t designed to withstand pressure in the first place.

The underlying problem of our platforms is not that they’re too conservative or too liberal, too dogmatic or too malleable. It’s that giant, for-profit tech companies, as currently constructed, are simply not suited to the task of deciding unilaterally what speech is acceptable and what isn’t.

That’s a case made in different ways this month by two experts in online speech. But one sees platforms’ very public flip-flops as part of the problem, the other as a key to the solution.

David Kaye, a University of California-Irvine law professor and UN special rapporteur on free expression, argues in [his new book *Speech Police](&lt;|url|&gt;) *that leaving content enforcement in the hands of private companies is a recipe for injustice. An absence of regulation in their home country, coupled with an inconsistent patchwork of laws abroad, has left platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter as de facto global speech regulators, even though neither users nor even the platforms themselves really want it that way.

These companies’ incentives — which include user growth, limiting labor costs, and staying on governments’ good side — often works against values such as consistency, fairness, and transparency in content moderation. Even though each of these companies now employs (or subcontracts) scores of human content reviewers, and some well-intentioned managers and executives, Kaye told me, “At some level, maybe at the most senior level, they preference the ad model, they preference the business model, they preference protection against liability.”

Kaye argued that the cycle of public outrage and corporate waffling will continue as long as the platforms make their rules and decisions behind closed doors. Even when they actually do have policies that they’re trying to apply consistently, the lack of a transparent process undermines the public’s confidence in their decisions. From outside, it all looks like a black box.

In a good legal system, decisions may be controversial, but at least the rationale is clearly laid out, and there’s a body of case law to serve as context. But when Facebook decides to de-amplify a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, or YouTube opts to demonetize Steven Crowder’s channel, there’s no way to check whether those decisions are consistent with the way they’ve interpreted their rules in the past, and there’s no clear, codified way to appeal those decisions.

Jennifer Grygiel, a communications professor at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School, agrees social platforms are letting down their users and the public when it comes to safety, misinformation, hate speech, and harassment. But whereas Kaye sees these problems through the lens of international governance and human rights law, Grygiel views them as fundamentally a failure of corporate social responsibility.

In [a paper published](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the June issue of the journal *Telecommunications Policy*, Grygiel and co-author Nina Brown argue that it’s not crazy for social media platforms to change their policies and practices in response to public pressure. On the contrary, public pressure, along with the growing threat of regulation, has been crucial in pushing tech companies to take on responsibilities that they were otherwise inclined to shun, such as proactively policing revenge porn, hate speech, and terrorist activity. “The fact is, the platforms are wildly out of control,” Grygiel said in a phone interview. “The use case has to be so horrendous and awful to really push these companies to take bigger steps.”

For instance, it took the Christchurch mosque shootings for [Facebook to tighten control of its live streaming features](&lt;|url|&gt;). Grygiel sees YouTube’s response to Steven Crowder’s homophobia as another example of a company re-evaluating its policies only when confronted with an extraordinary outcry. Because the tech firms haven’t invested the thought or resources necessary to create and enforce robust moderation policies, Grygiel said, “this is really being negotiated in the public sphere right now through feedback loops with the public, through social media activism, and also through the press.”

So if tech companies make poor speech police, what’s the solution? I’ve argued before that putting national governments in charge [isn’t the answer](&lt;|url|&gt;), and both Grygiel and Kaye seem to agree. Repressive regimes would overstep, of course, but even liberal democracies can vary widely in how they would regulate platforms. European countries like Germany have historically been quicker to regulate what they see as problematic speech, while in the United States the First Amendment would likely prohibit the government from doing much at all. Grygiel is also wary of reforming [Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act](&lt;|url|&gt;), the bedrock law governing online platforms’ responsibilities, because they see its liability protections as necessary to empower companies to make decisions that protect vulnerable users. Prior to its passage, websites faced incentives to avoid moderating content at all, lest they expose themselves to lawsuits.

Kaye thinks the answer lies in international human rights law. If tech companies agreed to adopt its language as a common standard, their policies would begin to look less arbitrary and more defensible, with a basis for consistency across national boundaries. On top of that, they’d need to become radically more transparent about their specific rules and decisions, giving governments, academics, and the public the ability to check their work.

That all sounds good, and Grygiel agrees that the big tech companies need to settle on a common framework. Grygiel envisions a standards body analogous to the advertising industry’s Advertising Self-Regulatory Council, but for content moderation and social media safety. Even so, Grygiel believes that public pressure and even controversy will remain an important mechanism for accountability — which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. “The idea that social media gives everyone a voice is often viewed at the individual level, but the real power is in collective action and the public’s ability to help steer corporate social responsibility and accountability through feedback loops.”

Obviously, there are drawbacks to a system that depends partly on public outrage. It encourages activists on all sides to try to “work the refs” to interpret the rules in their favor, as we saw Congressional Republicans attempt when they [held bad-faith hearings](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Facebook’s alleged censorship of Trump supporters Diamond and Silk. It risks rewarding those who shout loudest, whether at the expense of a quiet majority or a marginalized minority. It may work against nuance, as we saw when [Facebook struggled to defend](&lt;|url|&gt;) the careful application of its misinformation policies in the case of the Pelosi video against many who just wanted it taken down.

All of which is why the current system, in which each controversy becomes a fresh referendum on the tech companies’ ill-considered rulebooks, is such a mess. But a mess may be the best we have, at least for now. Though Kaye’s proposal to ground global moderation guidelines in human rights law makes sense, I tend to think Grygiel is right that we’ll never achieve some ideal, unchanging set of rules that the platforms can apply confidently in all cases without misstepping. Consistency is a virtue, but so are responsiveness and adaptability. We need standards, and we need transparency — but ultimately, we’ll always need the backlashes, too.<|endoftext|>

# This Is How It Feels to Go Viral on Twitter

## As the likes from a tweet passed 100K, I received love and hate — but mostly felt raw terror

![Photo: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty*

Imagine you’re at a party, chatting with people. Most you met there, while a few you met before you arrived. You make a comment. People nod enthusiastically, maybe laugh. Some reply. Then the walls surrounding the party crack and tumble away, revealing thousands, even millions of people. You look down and realize you’re wearing a mic. They all heard what you said.

Buckle up. You’ve gone viral.

I’ve had two tweets go — and this is the only way I can describe it — horribly viral. The first was in November 2017, after the [Sutherland Springs shooting](&lt;|url|&gt;). I was extremely upset by the news, furious that politicians with the power to implement gun control laws just “sent thoughts and prayers,” using the language of empathy to look noble while doing nothing. So I tweeted to my roughly 2,500 followers:


It would be liked 114,000 times and retweeted 46,000 times as of early April.

The second time was in March 2019, in response to the news that New Zealand was moving to ban semi-automatic weapons one day after the Christchurch shooting. All I did was retweet the news, with the joke:


It being so similar to the first tweet, maybe I should have suspected this one would go viral too — which it did, with even more likes than the first. What I wouldn’t have suspected is how similar the experiences were.

So, if *you* go viral, I think I can give you an idea of what to expect.

## **Numbers. Terrifying numbers.**

Up until this point, a good tweet of mine would get maybe 10 likes, perhaps a retweet or two. When my tweet on guns notched up 70 likes, I said, “Gosh!” When it reached the high hundreds, I said to myself, “Surely it’ll stop soon.” When it made the thousands, I shivered inside with a feeling I recognized from the times I did theater and stand-up comedy: stage fright. As it broke 100,000, I put my phone away.

Of course it’s a form of validation — there’s a reason the like button is shaped like a heart and not a rotten tomato. But the first time the like button on your tweet is pressed by six figures of thumbs, I bet you’ll shiver too.

## **It leaves your control**

What counts as having “control” over a tweet? Well, you have the power to delete it, and you can monitor the numbers on it. But by the time a tweet has gone truly viral, it’s too late. I hope you picked a decent profile pic, because you are now a meme.

You will see your face plastered all over Reddit, Instagram, and Facebook, courtesy of your excited friends who report the tweet’s whereabouts to you like a team of private investigators you haven’t hired. They’ll send you feverish messages: “You’re the top post on Reddit!” “January Jones just shared your tweet!” “Ruby Rose just shared your tweet!” They’ll probably assume this will delight you, and maybe it will at first. But there’s also fear and dread — or whatever emotions you associate with an enormous amount of attention over which you have precisely zero control.

## **Blasts from the past**

You’re going to hear from people you know. They’ll get in touch for three reasons:

1. **To tell you they’ve seen your tweet getting shared.** *“They don’t even know I know you!”* Most of the time, it leads to a lovely chance to catch up with someone you may not have seen in years — though sometimes it leads to snide comments, which is a great way of working out who on your friends list is The Worst.

1. **To go all vigilante for you.** They become *outraged* on your behalf, claiming someone has plagiarized you. Most of the time, it’s just someone else commenting on or joking about the same situation; we’re all stuck in this cultural bubble together, so it’s natural for similar takes to emerge. [Occasionally they might be right](<|url|>), but honestly, who cares? Nobody remembers what anyone tweeted last week.

1. **To demand to know “how you go viral.”** As if it isn’t just luck. As if it has *anything* to do with you.
> # I tweeted into my echo chamber, and the walls fell down.

## **Feedback**

Strangers get in touch for three reasons:

1. **Love.** I want to make a lot of this, because it’s really easy to focus on the death threats, which we’ll get to soon enough. You get a lot of love and attention when you go viral. People declare that you’re a genius, that you’ve won the internet, that you should be the next president. They direct message on any and all mediums to thank you, to tell you they loved your tweet. Don’t lose sight of that, because…

1. **Hate.** My god, the hate. You’ll be called stupid, moronic, idiotic. If you’re a woman, you’ll be called various synonyms for prostitute. And if the point of your tweet is something as apparently divisive as “I wish children weren’t getting murdered at school,” you can expect a death threat or two. That sounds scarier than it is. One man told me that if I came for his gun, “I’ll splatter YOUR thoughts and prayers all over my lawn you dumb cunt.” First of all, rude! Second of all, I’m busy and don’t have time to be gathering up *all* the guns myself. Third, let’s be honest: It would be your mom’s lawn. I can’t say why, but in my experience, Day Three is the worst for the outright “kill yourself you useless slut” type of abuse. (Thanks for that, @bronxboy1993! I sincerely hope things improve for you.)

1. **To respectfully ask what your tweet meant.** Jokes and sarcasm don’t always translate outside the bubble of the people who know and follow you, so a surprising number of people get in touch to check whether they’ve understood. If they’re respectful, I’d say it’s safe to engage. I’ve had many pleasant conversations with people checking to see if I’m “disparaging” prayer. If they’re condescending, ignore them. Trust me. One person ranted that her misunderstanding of my tweet was my fault and went on to inform me that she’s kind of a big deal.

## **People think you went viral on purpose**

The strangest element of going viral is people reacting like your tweet was some kind of Jehovah’s Witness–style knock on their door. It’s as if they feel they were minding their own business while you barged into their life with your opinion, when one look at your “requests” inbox shows that the truth is the other way around. If people could go viral on purpose, everyone would be doing it.

When your words are being seen by millions, people imagine you as someone with power and influence, rather than just some woman in her kitchen, trying to reach a bowl as the kettle boils. Don’t get me wrong—I’m not complaining. This is the small print of social media. If you don’t want the chance of going viral, don’t tweet. But still, the questions you get about the experience are bizarre. In an interview for a book, I was asked, “Why didn’t you word your tweet in a way that would please everyone?” I decided not to say, “Um… how would one do that?” and instead explained that I *didn’t go viral on purpose*. I tweeted into my echo chamber, as I always do — and then one day, the walls fell down.

## **How to deal with going viral**

The most mature course of action, and also the hardest, is to step away from social media. The noise of all those voices is deafening, but so is the silence when you switch it off. Read a book, watch an episode of something hilarious, eat cake, temporarily ditch your avatar friends and talk to a face made of flesh. Appreciate the quiet of not having random people from all over the world strolling into your day with unsolicited feedback.

I worked out much too late that Twitter’s advanced filters are your friend. Part of the stress of going viral is the noise of your mentions going wild. Your tweet already has six figures of likes — do you really need to see the next 20 people who like it? I’d already muted notifications from anyone with a default profile photo and anyone who hadn’t confirmed their phone number or email address (people who want to remain anonymous, basically), but muting notifications from anyone who didn’t follow me quieted things right down. It also meant I’d have to deliberately click on a tweet and scroll down through the replies if I wanted to be told how stupid I am.

One more thing: Your words reached people across the world. You can feel good about it for a little while. Then go back to your life. And be nice to whoever’s next.

And get ready for Day Five, when…

## **Everyone forgets about you**

Probably the most important thing to remember when going viral is not to get addicted to the attention or let it validate you, because after a few days it’s withdrawn, pretty much all at once. By day five, you probably have a lot more followers, and maybe you see a bit more engagement on your tweets than before. But for now, the mic has been turned off, and things go, really startlingly, back to normal.

Because nobody remembers what anyone tweeted last week.<|endoftext|>

# Email Autocomplete Is Sucking the Life Out of Communication

## The new services turn email into bloodless business speak. So why are we allowing Silicon Valley to dictate what we say?

![Credit: [Shira Inbar](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Credit: [Shira Inbar](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

If you’ve used Gmail any time recently, you’ll probably be familiar with Smart Reply and Smart Compose. Smart Reply is simple. Whenever you receive an email, three jaunty and heavily exclamation-pointed options pop up under its body: things like “Thank you!”or “That sounds great!” or “That works for me!” Click the option you like the best, edit (or don’t), and press send. Congratulations: an email that would have taken you 30 seconds to write has taken you two.

Smart Compose, on the other hand, helps you craft emails yourself. Up pops grayish text when you start to write an email, suggesting how you might like to end your sentence. You start writing “That sounds…” and “good to me!” appears. Like Smart Reply, it makes writing emails easier, faster, and far less mentally taxing.

When Google rolled out Smart Compose for business customers last year, the company said the feature would “[fill in common phrases and relevant addresses](&lt;|url|&gt;),” though the technology is ultimately supposed to write in a user’s voice. It’s still a work in progress: in April, Google said Smart Compose was “[becoming more tailored to your writing style](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

As the feature stands, its rote suggestions feel meaningless. Though it is hard to imagine now, in the early days of the internet, email was often a joyful, creative medium. But many of us now consider email a largely professional mode of communication, the primary method for contacting colleagues or clients, finding work, arranging meetings, or chasing invoices. Smart Compose and Smart Reply functions, often efficient and businesslike in their tone, both reflect this use. But should they?

Josh Cohen isn’t so sure. “If you hold the view that language is important, that it’s more than a simple communication of information, and that it has to do with the way that we understand ourselves and our relationships with other people, then there’s something very significant about this,” he tells me.

Cohen is professor of modern literary theory at Goldsmiths University in London, and when he’s not in the lecture hall he’s in the consulting room, working as a psychoanalyst. He’s also the author of the book [*Not Working*,](&lt;|url|&gt;) in which he exhorts us to do exactly as the title suggests: slow down and stop thinking about work.

Cohen argues that work impinges on all aspects of our lives — not least our inner lives, which he is naturally interested in as an analyst. And business speak — the corporate language of “circling back,” “going forward,” and “reaching out” — is of particular interest to Cohen.

“It basically conceives of the person we’re communicating with as something other than, less than, a complete person,” he says. “We’re encouraged to communicate with them on a purely informational basis. And the more that becomes the common language of interpersonal relations, the more the relationships themselves get slowly transformed.”

Why is this? Because business jargon is a “language of externalities… a language of surfaces.” It’s the language of what we do rather than who we are. Cohen describes it as “a stripped down Esperanto”, a universal language created in the 19th century.

“It doesn’t really acknowledge the existence of thoughts and feelings below the surface of our speech,” says Cohen. “But there’s something really rich, in social life of all kinds, about ambiguity, about being able to find other possibilities in what people are saying. When there’s no interest in or curiosity about the personal dimension of this interaction, that does have an affect on the inner life. It switches our focus pretty exclusively to our external being and to the being that we show the world, rather than the one whose heart is beating underneath.”

It’s not hard to see how business speak flattens our emotional affect. It’s highly unlikely that we’d sincerely tell a friend that we’d “circle back” to a query they had or a comment they’d made, and different relationships tend to produce different grammars and rhythms of intimacy. But even in a professional relationship that was friendly and seemingly authentic, to “circle back” or “go forward” would not seem amiss.

Encouragement to engage in such dialogue, then, through autocompleted sentences or one-click replies, may not be a good thing. The use of exclamation marks alone is telling — the upbeat, enthusiastic face many of us feel implicitly forced to wear at work writ large in a spiral of ever cheerier responses. Séamas O’Reilly wrote in the [*Guardian* ](&lt;|url|&gt;)of a week in which he replied to his emails with nothing but Smart Reply; he described being made to feel that tech companies are “not just reading, but remodeling” us in “their own ghastly image.”

As with so much in modern technology, at the heart of such features lies a tendency to encourage speed, streamlining, and productivity. We’re working more than ever; as Juliet B. Schor [wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) in her 1991 book *The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure, *one of capitalism’s most durable myths “is that it has reduced human toil.” Why wouldn’t we want to cut down on one of the more pointless tasks a day presents us with?
> # Once, AOL’s cheerful chirrup that “You’ve Got Mail!” seemed thrilling, perhaps even [romantic](&lt;|url|&gt;); now we spend time reading articles about how best to “reclaim our productivity” by achieving inbox zero.

Technology, we’re told, gives us the capacity to reduce the time we spend doing apparently thankless tasks. We no longer have to spend 15 seconds writing “Thanks!” to someone who does us a favor, just as the [rise](&lt;|url|&gt;) of subscription services means we don’t even have to go to the store for toilet paper anymore, instead receiving it at our door, each month, as if by magic.

When it comes to boring logistical tasks like scheduling meetings, writing to-do lists, or sharing documents, this automation can be time-saving and useful. But email, somehow, has also become part of that group. We see it as an administrative tedium, a necessary evil, something we no longer value as an authentic mode of communication. We rarely, if ever, think about the people on the other end of our missives; if we do, we tend to think of them as a source of frustration, not connection. Once, AOL’s cheerful chirrup that “You’ve Got Mail!” seemed thrilling, perhaps even [romantic](&lt;|url|&gt;); now we spend time reading articles about how best to “reclaim our productivity” by achieving inbox zero.

But is it even possible to automate human interaction, to automate a relationship between colleagues, between client and supplier, editor and writer? With [more of us working remotely](&lt;|url|&gt;), email is fast becoming the primary mode of professional communication for thousands of people. Shouldn’t we make it better, not worse? And shouldn’t we make it more personal, rather than less?

“I’m really suspicious that it has the intended effect,” says Cohen, when asked about the negative effects of streamlining. “When human beings are talking to each other, streamlining often has the effect of making people feel unheard… when what they’ve actually said has received this completely generic, impersonal response that they might have got if they’d said the opposite.”

Cohen has other concerns about what this might generate, too: resentment, suspicion, a feeling of why didn’t they reply to me properly? “Presumably people are getting more and more adept at recognizing when they’ve been fobbed off with a bit of Google predictive text,” he says. And when that happens, it feels like a slight.

“It’s a way of saying ‘I don’t think this warrants anything like personal effort or input or voice,’” Cohen says. If someone’s message gets a generic and interchangeable response, what does it imply? That their concern is interchangeable and irrelevant, too.

As much as we might wish otherwise, email isn’t going away. One [study](&lt;|url|&gt;) described email as a “staple form of communication that is essential, important, and entrenched in the lives of people today,” and also found that Gen Zers were likely to increase their email usage over the next few years, overtaking even Gen Xers and millennials.

The Gen Z study also found the group was not using email primarily for business or professional reasons: 36% of emails were between respondents and people they work with, 24% between respondents and “companies connected to their occupation.”

The key finding, in fact, was that 68% of emails were personal. Merrily automating replies or clicking instant responses that make us sound like the cheerful and put-together professional that we’re expected to be at work is one thing; having it overtake more intimate spheres is another.

Yes, we might be making our lives easier and more convenient. But are we making them better?

# The Insane Demand for Cybersecurity Workers

## By 2021, there will be roughly 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs across the globe

Angela Gunn is fried. With three cases going and a fourth just getting started, this is one of those frantic periods when it feels as if she works in an ER or at a fire station rather than holding a staff position with a computer security firm.

It’s people like Gunn that organizations large and small call if they’ve had a data breach or suspect they have. People in the industry — cybersecurity, if you’d like, though Gunn’s preference is information security, or “info-sec” for short — call this “incident response.” To my mind, though, they’re the online world’s firefighters: those who rush to put out the flames and then assess the damage.

As an incident response consultant for British security firm BAE Systems, Gunn is in charge of assembling a small crew for each case. Typically, that includes an analyst who can pore over computer logs, a malware specialist, and those she dubs “forensic workers, except without the formaldehyde smell and ripped-open chest cavities.” That is, if she can find any live bodies to do the work.

“Right now, I’d sell a right toe for a forensics guy,” Gunn says. “Like a lot of people in info-sec right now, we’re agonizingly understaffed.”

A 2015 report by job analytics firm Burning Glass Technologies found that postings for cybersecurity had grown more than three times faster than other information technology (IT) positions and roughly 12 times faster than all other jobs. The firm also reported that those working in cybersecurity on average earn nearly 10% more than others in IT.

There’s good reason behind the growth: Cybercrime caused an estimated $3 trillion in damages in 2015, according to research firm Cybersecurity Ventures. The company expects that figure to double to $6 trillion by 2021. Corporations face a “defender’s dilemma,” which Dave Weinstein, a security manager inside Google, summed up this way: “The defender has to be strong everywhere, every day. The attacker only has to win once.” For each set of bad guys, the defense side needs veritable armies, beefing up armaments and rushing to the rescue at the first sign of an attack.
> # “If someone has six months to a year of work and when they came in for an interview, they didn’t pee on the rug, they’re going to make in the neighborhood of $85,000.”

The march of technology, in other words, has created a huge demand for ethical hackers, or “white hats”: people skilled at using computers who can protect our systems and battle those with bad intentions. By now, any university offering a computer science degree invariably offers classes in security. The more forward-looking among them have created a dedicated computer security department and offer a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity. Still, businesses are having a hard time finding people to work computer security.

At the end of 2018, for instance, there were more than 26,000 openings for cybersecurity analysts (average pay: $85,000 a year), according to CyberSeek, which is part of a program nested under the U.S. Department of Commerce. “If someone has six months to a year of work and when they came in for an interview, they didn’t pee on the rug, they’re going to make in the neighborhood of $85,000,” Angela Gunn says. “If they have a special skill — if they have experience doing database scanning or maybe they worked as a programmer before moving to security — then they’re going up to 110, 120, 125.” For those with five or more years of experience, she said, the salaries start at $150,000. “There was never a cybersecurity job that I took where I was like, ‘Man, I wish I could make more money,’” said Billy Rios, who worked for Microsoft and then Google before venturing off on his own.

How crazy is the demand for quality people in info-sec? A security reporter I know was wearing a free T-shirt he had picked up at an industry event while waiting for a table at a San Francisco restaurant. A stranger struck up a conversation: “My company is hiring security people. You have a résumé?” The on-the-spot recruiter worked for Square, a publicly traded mobile payments company worth in the tens of billions.

All told, according to CyberSeek, just over 700,000 people were working cybersecurity for U.S.-based businesses and other organizations in 2018, not including 300,000-plus unfilled positions. The data point in 2017 that had people inside the cybersecurity world buzzing was a prediction by [Cybersecurity Ventures](&lt;|url|&gt;) that by 2021, there will be roughly 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs across the globe.

“It’s a cool job,” security entrepreneur Allison Wong tells young women exploring options for their tech careers. “If you stay in it for four years and show you’re good, you’ll make in the six figures. And not just the low six figures.” Plus, one more advantage, she tells them: “It’s not a job you can get bored at. If you get bored, you’re doing something wrong.”

# How Tech Redefined the Experience of Culture

## Video games and social media require human users to enter into a procedural loop known as flow

![Photo by [Julius Drost](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Julius Drost](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Beginning in the late 1960s, a new group of technologists (including Douglas Engelbart’s team at Stanford, Alan Kay and others at Xerox PARC, and later Steve Jobs and his colleagues at Apple) set about to redefine the computer as a medium for representation and communication. By developing the personal computer, the graphic user interface, 3D computer graphics, local- and wide-area networking, they helped to provide millions of users with a digital platform for reading, writing, and eventually aural and visual communication.

These technologists had a modernist conception of what a medium is and of their capacity to engineer culture, but in fact they were designing the platform for media culture at the end of modernism. The digital media they helped create now support an enormous, heterogeneous world of media forms, makers, and users, a world with as many centers as there are communities, and more communities than anyone can know.

If the printed book and the library were suited to define hierarchy and cultural order, networked digital media are suited to foster multiplicity and competing orders. The internet and the World Wide Web provide an ideal environment for the various elements of traditional high culture and popular culture to coalesce into their own media communities. The fragments of modernism turn up in many of these communities: among film critics and enthusiasts, makers and critics of video games, industrial designers of computer interfaces, tablets and smartphones, graphic designers for print and digital media, and so on.

For some digital communities, then, it makes good sense to keep close to the modernist heritage. The stand-alone computer of the 1940s was a modernist machine, the physical embodiment of the finite-state logic of Alan Turing. But today, when each computer is part of a dynamic network of devices, applications, and users that constitute the digital plenitude, the grounding assumptions of modernism no longer suffice.

The loss of hierarchy in cultural knowledge clears the way for greater participation in our media culture. Traditional universities coexist with online communities that share knowledge without any formal credentials. Gallery art coexists with online art of every style. In fact, style itself, which was the imperative of modern art, is now completely a matter of personal preference. Play becomes a powerful metaphor for cultural participation, and playing in the plenitude means assuming there is no imperative, nothing that has to be done based on a controlling historical understanding. Everyone is invited to play in whatever corner of the plenitude she cares to, and all kinds of making and playing can be characterized as art or creativity.
> # Even if the newest digital media favor flow rather than catharsis, neither aesthetic seems likely to eliminate the other.

While there are no universals in media culture today, there are many qualities worth exploring, because they are shared by many communities or because they are compelling remediations of the age of modernism. One of these is procedurality. Popular modernist writers today claim that this is the essence of the computer: its procedures (algorithms, programs) allow it to interact with other machines and human users in increasingly complex and creative ways. Video games and social media are procedural: they require human users to enter into a procedural loop that both constrains and empowers them. Procedurality is itself the latest version of mechanization, which has been a key condition of society and the economy since the Industrial Revolution. While modernism was vitally concerned with the cultural meaning of mechanical and power technologies in the 20th century, today’s media culture is exploring how far procedurality and simulation can penetrate into and redefine creative expression as well as our politics and everyday lives.

Procedural media often favor a particular state of mind in their users. Video games and other contemporary cultural experiences aim through repetition to induce in their audience a state of engagement that the psychologist Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi has named “flow.” The player of a video game, a Facebook user, or a YouTube viewer falls easily into a state in which she simply wants the experience to continue at a more or less constant rhythm.

This flow state in digital media contrasts with another familiar state of mind often called catharsis. Popular films, novels, and a great deal of traditional music aim to evoke catharsis, an emotional release through identification with a main character. And even if the newest digital media favor flow rather than catharsis, neither aesthetic seems likely to eliminate the other. Neither is dominant in our time. Millions prefer to spend their leisure time watching films, whether in a theater or streamed to their computer; millions play video games; and of course many millions do both. What is new is that the flow aesthetic has an equal status with catharsis. Video games are now as legitimate a cultural experience as novels, though largely for different communities.

Remix is another facet of our current media culture that thrives in and through digital technology. DJs, dance remixes, and hip-hop (all now supported by digital sampling and mixing machines) are among the most influential musical trends of recent decades. And the internet’s vast (commercially available and pirated) resources of photographs, films, television shows, and printed texts invite professional and amateur players to appropriate, edit, and combine samples into new versions.

Remix is a repudiation of the modernist and earlier romantic notions of originality. Remixes on YouTube and throughout the web may be clever or trivial, compelling or mind-numbing; they may be original and derivative at the same time. Huge remix communities today reject the absolute values of authorship and intellectual property that seemed unquestionable in the heyday of the printed book. Yet even some of the pioneers of the current digital media technology protest against the “remix ethic” of borrowing and revising, because interfaces and applications can be revised and remixed as well as songs and films.

To a time traveler from 1960, the present would look like a chaos of media forms all competing for our attention, far too many to absorb and appreciate. The view from the present is that the earlier media culture is parochial, limited, and hierarchical, especially because of the absence of participatory media. In 1960, a relatively small group of producers controlled the content for a huge audience of consumers. But the relative cultural unity of that period also meant the categorization and marginalization of women and minorities in the media to an even greater extent than today.

Although no one can travel back in time, there are many today who seem to be stuck in a particular moment in the past. I mean contemporary critics who evaluate our current media culture from a perspective that belongs to the mid-20th century. They assume that we should still have a unified media culture for art and entertainment and an agreed set of standards of evaluation. Whether they realize it or not, they are popular modernists who want to reinstitute a hierarchy of forms enlarged to include their own popular favorites, such as film or rock music, raised to the level of art. What they fail to acknowledge is that the same forces that freed us from a rigid definition of “high culture” have brought us to a plenitude in which there can be no universally shared hierarchy. It should be no surprise that the shift from that earlier cultural condition to the current plenitude entails both loss and gain.

# Why This Internet Linguist Uses Android Instead of iOS

## ‘I don’t know why iOS still doesn’t let you do this.’

![](<|image|>)

*This is “What’s on Your Home Screen?” a Q&A column from *OneZero*. We want to understand more about how people use their smartphones — those life-consuming devices we dump hours into every day — to pave a way toward a better future. Or at least a more reflective one. We’ll add new entries regularly, and each will feature a new interview with a notable person about the apps they use, how they’re organized, and whether those red bubbles drive them nuts.*

Gretchen McCulloch is the author of [*Because Internet](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a new book examining how digital tools and online communities are reshaping our language. I wondered if home screens might be counted among those tools.

As it turns out: Kinda sorta! While your home screen itself may not directly influence how you speak to someone else, the default services on your phone certainly do — your keyboard, your apps, your autocorrect settings.

McCulloch and I discussed all of this — and why Android is arguably a better platform than iOS — in a recent conversation marking the release of her book.

*What follows is our chat, edited for length and clarity.*

![](<|image|>)

### **OneZero: You’re only the third person I’ve talked to for this column who uses Android, and [one of them works for Alphabet](&lt;|url|&gt;), so… Why Android as opposed to iOS?**

**Gretchen McCulloch**: I was an iOS user for a while, and I switched to Android, and one of the things I really like about Android is the home screen experience. I have a widget that’s a calendar. iOS still doesn’t have widgets!

Another huge thing that I like is, you’ll notice I have a blank space on the home screen, with a couple spots that don’t have icons. One of the things I really like about Android is that you can put icons on the bottom of the screen. They don’t auto-fill from the top. This seems petty, but as someone with relatively small hands, it’s much easier for me to hold the phone and reach icons from the bottom of the screen than the top. I always fill my screen in priority from bottom to top. The least-used go to the top, because I can’t reach them as well. For me, this is a key feature of usability. I don’t know why iOS still doesn’t let you do this.

### **Right.**

When I had an iPhone, I had to find junk icons to put at the top just to move my most-used ones down.

### **That’s ridiculous. The point is well-taken that these default settings on iOS don’t always work that well — Android is more flexible. It occurs to me that it must be of interest to you to pay close attention to how people are able to express themselves through technology; is there something about the customization on Android versus the stock functions on iOS that relates to all of this?**

There are two ways this connects. One of them is in keyboards. The default behavior that keyboards have in terms of autocorrect, auto-complete, predictive text, trying to help you type things but also interfering between what you’ve typed and what comes out ends up shaping how we communicate.

One of the things I talk about in the book is how the rise of auto-capitalization led to people using all lowercase as a way of rebelling, and conveying a kind of anti-authoritarian or deliberate, laconic tone of voice. That’s shaped by the default tools. It shapes how people react to and engage with people.

### **Interesting.**

It’s not that it shows up on the home screen per se, but it does show up in the default experience. I’ve experimented with various keyboards on various phones, and which words they enter into your dictionary, how they let you type things. I sound much more intelligent in French than I have any right to, because I now have a French keyboard. One of the reasons I have Google Translate on my screen is because I live in Montreal, and I have to type in French, and my French is okay, but it can use technological assistance sometimes. Having these readily accessible to me makes me sound more intelligent in French, because I can get the accents right and the keyboard helps me with that.

### **You’re kind of faking it through the technology that’s at your disposal.**

Is it any more fake than if I paused and had to look up a word in a dictionary? I just don’t have to spend the time doing it. It’s an interesting question about authenticity. It isn’t just me, but was it ever going to be just me? When we use another language, we’re drawing not just on our cognitive resources in our heads, but also technological tools. The dictionary is technology, too. Writing is a technology. Phones are just another kind of technology that we use to shape how it comes out and how it gets to people.

### **Well, and clearly we’re so far beyond the written word right now on social apps.**

I’m in a number of Slack groups, and they’re primarily social. Slack’s really interesting because you have custom emoji, and when we’re looking at what’s the future of emoji, there’s this whole Unicode approval process for emoji, but there’s also a few places, like Slack and Discord and Twitch, that let people add custom emoji. It’s interesting to see which custom emoji are popular in certain Slack groups, and which ones transcend and exist in multiple Slack groups.

A lot of groups have a Slack emoji that corresponds to “thank you,” like “TY.” It’s a word, but you can put it in an emoji format. Even when you think of emoji being this very visual medium, as soon as you give people the ability to customize it, it turns out what they really want is the ability to make tiny words as small icons.

### **What does that signal to you?**

The fear mongering about emoji replacing words is overstated. People really like words. GIFs that have word captions on them do better than GIFs that don’t, in terms of search results. Bitmoji that have words on them do better than Bitmoji that don’t. The types of things that people are trying to use emoji for aren’t purely trying to get rid of language: They’re about reimagining the formats we use to communicate with each other.

### **Clearly you’re interested in communication and how we express ourselves. These social apps you have here — is there something individually compelling to you about how people communicate on these platforms in particular?**

I like Twitter because it’s very verbal. That’s where the linguists hang out. There aren’t a lot of linguists doing stuff on Instagram.

I use the “Lite” version of the Facebook Messenger app, and I prefer it because it’s not trying to make you do all of their rich media stuff. If you use the regular version of Facebook’s Messenger app, the text box to type in is so tiny, because they’re trying to get you to send pictures, or play games, they just cram so many features into the regular Messenger app that I find it difficult to use. They constantly try to get you to watch the Facebook “My Day” things. If Twitter had a separate DM app, I would have that, too.

### **And what is this Libby app?**

Oh, I love the Libby app! It’s an e-book reading app that syncs with your local library and your library card number. You can borrow books from your local library and sync them with your Libby app. You read them there, return them there — you can browse the library with your Libby app. It’s a great way of reading e-books. I’m trying to encourage myself to read more books on my phone rather than do other stuff.

### **And you have Feedly. Why is this where you choose to consume news?**

I was a big Google Reader fan back in the day before they killed it, so Feedly is what I use instead. It’s there as a reminder that maybe you don’t want to be spending as much time on social media — maybe you can read instead.

# There Is Water on the Moon. This Is How We’ll Get It.

## There Is Water on the Moon. This Is How We’ll Get It.

### 50 years after the first moon landing, humans are trying to reach the lunar surface again. They’ll stay longer if astronauts can find and mine water.

The Earth and our moon are made of many of the same ingredients. We know that the moon was likely created out of material from our planet because we share the same isotopes, making us the solar system equivalent of fraternal twins. When the astronauts of Apollo 11 took off from Earth 50 years ago today, they were visiting a long-lost relative.

In the images sent back by Apollo 11, the moon looked like an airless wasteland. But like the Earth, the moon also has water, as well as hydrated minerals called hydroxyl. This abundance of hydrogen could have been delivered in a myriad of ways. During the formation of the Earth and the Moon, a water delivery system was created from comets and asteroids impacting the surface, and from the interaction of sunlight with hydrogen molecules on the lunar surface.

While scientists know that the Moon is covered with a variety of hydrogen, they are unclear about exactly how much water is on the Moon, or even where it is located. Missions that have orbited the Moon have done basic surveys but have so far been unable to provide full clarification. When NASA’s SLS rocket launches in the near future, its payload will include a cubesat — a tiny satellite — called LunaH-Map that will begin to map the water around the Moon.

So let’s say in 10 years, scientists have a complete understanding of where the hydroxyl and H2O are located. What can be done with that water?

It’s not just for drinking. There’s a concept in space exploration called “[In Situ Resource Utilization](&lt;|url|&gt;),” or ISRU, which basically means going to a place and utilizing the materials that are already there. Water on the Moon can be used to make rocket fuel, as well as help shield spacecraft from radiation exposure. And NASA is not the only organization that wants to know where all the hydrogen is hiding — many private companies have plans to grow full-fledged businesses out of lunar rocket fuel, potentially even selling water to NASA for long-duration trips to space.
> # “There are two basic concepts on how to extract the water from the Moon.”

Once researchers locate water on the Moon, the next step is mining it. That’s easy enough on Earth, but it has never been done in space. “While we know how to extract these components on Earth, a huge unknown is how to do this with lunar regolith,” the unconsolidated dust and rock atop the lunar surface, says Debra Needham, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center.

Plans are in the works, however. “There are two basic concepts on how to extract the water from the Moon,” says Phil Metzger, a planetary scientist at the University of Central Florida. “One concept is that you scoop up the soil and you carry it back to a processing plant. At the processing plant you melt the ice or vaporize the ice with heat and you get [water] out from the soil grains and then you refreeze it.”

This first method — called “thermal mining” — is technically more complicated and requires more infrastructure, which means it is more costly. Another method goes by the name “mechanical mining.” “You apply heat in situ and you get [water] to vaporize while it’s still in the ground, and you have to capture the vapors on top of the ground,” says Metzger. “We’re making progress, but there’s too much uncertainty still about the thermal conductivity of the ice.”

The water is also bound to other chemicals, and it’s not yet clear how future astronauts might separate out the water in its pure forms. “There are other elements strongly bonded to other minerals,” says Needham. “So the mining companies basically need more information from the scientists before we can go through and know what techniques specifically to use.”

Then there’s an additional complication: ethical considerations. How do we respect an environment that belongs to everyone? “We will be putting industry largely outside the social controls that we’ve evolved for 10,000 years,” says Metzger. “So there’s going to be a degree of isolation between the industry and space and the people on the Earth trying to govern that.”

Of course, one of the biggest hurdles to mining water on the Moon is actually getting to the Moon — the last time a human stood on the lunar surface was December 14, 1972, during the Apollo 17 mission. Many cubesats and smaller spacecraft are on the launch roster, however, and should be able to help map the location of water around the surface of the moon. If we first locate the craters with ice deposits and regions that contain more hydroxyl than H2O, then missions can be planned to visit those specific locations with the instruments needed for extraction.

While mining the moon might sound like a mostly commercial venture, both scientists and companies have a vested interest in digging into the lunar soil. By locating and studying the Moon’s water sources, it can not only set up long-term human exploration, but also provide answers to some of planetary science’s biggest questions.<|endoftext|>

# Should Twitter Get Rid of Follower Counts?

## Should Twitter Get Rid of Follower Counts?

### The possibility feels closer than ever

![Photo: FARBAI/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: FARBAI/Getty Images*

If Twitter was a megaphone, you’d measure its volume through follower counts. The difference between an account with 45 followers and an account with 45,000 is like the difference between a grade school music class and a concert at Madison Square Garden.

As a legacy element of Old Twitter, follower count has long been the benchmark of user popularity and reach. But with the platform struggling to control waves of troll attacks, abuse, and fake accounts, one has to wonder if the metric should stick around.

Twitter co-founder and current CEO Jack Dorsey has stopped short of chucking it, though he’s clearly doing some soul-searching. Late last year, he [told](&lt;|url|&gt;) an audience in New Delhi that developers didn’t give much thought to how prominent the metric was in the social network’s original interface.

“We did not really think much about it and moved on to the next problem to solve,” Dorsey reportedly said. “… we put all the emphasis, not intending to, on that number of, how many people follow me. So, if that number is big and bold, what do people want to do with it? They want to make it go up.”
> # If Twitter is about letting “strangers” know what you’re doing, then it’s a broadcast platform. Broadcasting doesn’t work without an audience.

Early Twitter prominently featured a site member’s follower number near the top of the right-hand column. Above it, though, was a metric Twitter no longer publicly tracks: “Friends,” or the number of your followers that you followed back. It aligned neatly with one of [Twitter’s earliest taglines](&lt;|url|&gt;) (from September 2006), which read, “Twitter is for staying in touch and keeping up with friends, no matter where you are or what you’re doing.” Two months later, the text was [amended](&lt;|url|&gt;) and Twitter was now: “A global community of friends and strangers answering one simple question: What are you doing?”

That update opened the door to “strangers,” which might explain more about today’s ongoing follower fixation than anyone realizes. After all, if Twitter is about letting “strangers” know what you’re doing, then it’s a broadcast platform. Broadcasting doesn’t work without an audience, and, to build one and be heard, a broadcaster needs followers.

Dorsey is not alone in his insistence that it was a mistake to prioritize followers in the first place. Last September, Kanye West made his own [argument](&lt;|url|&gt;) about it.

“We should be able to participate in social media without having to show how many followers or likes we have,” he tweeted. “Just like how we can turn off the comments we should be able to turn off the display of followers. This has an intense negative impact on our self worth.”

Giving Twitter users the ability to hide follower counts (and likes) isn’t a terrible idea, but I think Twitter and Dorsey are leaning in the direction of demoting or removing follower counts altogether.

I was recently invited by Twitter to try out the company’s new web interface. With its more streamlined look, it’s a close cousin to the Twitter mobile app. But I immediately noticed what was missing. New Twitter, as I took to calling it, had [pushed follower counts off my home page](&lt;|url|&gt;); I could only see them by clicking on my profile.

![](<|image|>)

It isn’t a huge change, but it’s clearly a signal that Dorsey’s quest to demote personal performance metrics on the platform is getting serious. The design update also forced me to confront the possibility that Twitter follower counts might soon disappear from the platform altogether.

I asked Twitter and Dorsey about this change and what it might mean for the future of the product. Dorsey didn’t respond, and Twitter spokespeople wouldn’t speak directly to some of my questions about the potential removal of follower counts. They did point me to some changes the service [made to profiles on its iOS version](&lt;|url|&gt;) late last year, reducing the font size of most everything, including followers and following counts, but leaving names and bios larger. The effort clearly shifts the focus away from the follower metric.

To be fair, Twitter has been open about “[rethinking everything](&lt;|url|&gt;)” to encourage healthier conversation on the platform. Still, I was frustrated by Dorsey’s apparent efforts to rewrite Twitter history, saying, in essence, that the company never wanted one’s follower count to matter. I started looking for insights about why from Old Twitter.

![](<|image|>)

As I dug through the [Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine](&lt;|url|&gt;), I found myself fascinated by the less stylized graphics, tweets from early adopters — like Barack Obama, [who had just 600](&lt;|url|&gt;) followers in 2007 — and the activity of other less-notable early adopters who found some engagement in the young social platform but were never swept up in the follower obsession.

Stephen Francis Kenny, a former engineer and current stay-at-home dad who signed up for Twitter in 2006, told me via direct message that he “was a little confused about follower mechanics at first, and not being able to direct message at will.” Other than that, he never gave his follower count much thought.

He did add that the follower concept “seems to have been important to [Twitter’s] growth.”

He’s probably right about that. Though I [started off skeptical about Twitter’s prospects](&lt;|url|&gt;), I’ve now obsessively tracked my follower count for more than a decade. Scanning my earliest tweets, a shocking number are devoted to [my quest to hit 1,000 followers](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s embarrassing.

In my defense, I wasn’t alone. During a period of explosive growth for Twitter — between 2010 and 2014 — celebrities also became fixated on their follower counts. There was [Ashton Kutcher’s quest for a million](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Katy Perry’s rise to 50 million](&lt;|url|&gt;). (She was the first to reach such heights and now claims over 100 million followers.)

As more and more people crested a million or more followers, the concept of influencers took hold. Now the relationship between the tweeter and their audience was flipped on its head. Followers weren’t simply a passive audience: They were tracking Twitter accounts for nuggets of insight, wisdom, opinion, and guidance. Some were [obsessively pursuing follow-backs](&lt;|url|&gt;) from their favorite celebs. People with massive Twitter followings became inadvertent thought leaders.

Over the years, I’ve interviewed and met a number of these so-called Twitter celebs. I wondered how they would feel if the clearest measure of their social platform popularity and influence disappeared.

For most, the topic was radioactive. No one, least of all celebrities, wants to be caught saying they care about the number of followers they have. Still, I did manage to get a couple of internet celebrities to open up about the topic.

Actor and author William Shatner, who’s been on Twitter since 2008, told me he really doesn’t care about his count — he currently has 2.5M followers — but is more concerned about the quality of followers.

“How do you tell a troll account that created a secondary or third account and has no followers? The date of account creation? Or [how do you identify] an imposter account?” he told me via DM. Whatever Twitter does, he added, “the decision needs to be well thought out and not be a stopgap because Twitter wants to be politically correct to those who don’t have a large number of followers.”

I’ve long believed that Twitter follower counts are a reasonable measure of influence, but I’m not oblivious to how those counts have been gamed and distorted over the years.

Back in 2015, a massive influx of [porn-filled spam bot accounts](&lt;|url|&gt;) inflated the follower counts of many users. At one point, a third-party service identified up to [23 percent of my followers as fake accounts](&lt;|url|&gt;). Twitter has cracked down on these bots and zombie accounts — my growth has downshifted from nearly 10,000 new followers a year to, if I’m lucky, a couple hundred per month.

Systemic problems like [trolls, hate speech, and outright abuse](&lt;|url|&gt;) are often intertwined with Twitter’s influence-based culture, and I agree with Dorsey, that Twitter has to [focus more on conversational health](&lt;|url|&gt;). On the other hand, I don’t think hiding or removing follower counts is going to fix it.

Justine Ezarik, who goes by [iJustine](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Twitter and on her [popular YouTube channel](&lt;|url|&gt;), told me via DM that displaying follower counts looks “great for brands and public perception.” However, people may be overestimating the power of those follower counts.

Ezarik, who joined Twitter in 2006, rightly pointed out that it’s now “algorithms telling us what we want to see, watch, and hear. Much like YouTube subscriber counts don’t equate to view counts. It’s still a great metric, but looking at engagement to content is more important overall.”

Whatever the case, I still don’t agree with removing follower counts altogether. Conversations are what make Twitter such an engaging platform. But the existence of follower counts reminds us that it is and has always been more than just a heightened version of group chat.

Twitter is an information platform for media, brands, politicians, organizations, celebrities, and regular people, all of whom want to know who’s listening. They also want to know how far their tweet traveled. Follower counts help tell that story. Without that information, it’s almost impossible to know why your 280 characters went viral.

No one comes to Twitter to share private thoughts. The platform is the equivalent of climbing to a mountaintop and shouting. If someone hears you, they might also shout it from their mountain top, and the reality of this Twitter terrain is that some mountains are higher than others, and some shouts travel further.

This, to my mind, is what’s still best about Twitter. I would hate to see the company dynamite the peaks to achieve some kind of false equivalency. On Twitter, not every voice is equal — and I think that’s okay.<|endoftext|>

# Can ‘The Walking Dead’ Survive Without Its Lead Character?

## Can ‘The Walking Dead’ Survive Without Its Lead Character?

### It sure as hell can’t survive with him

![Credit: Jackson Lee Davis/AMC](<|image|>)*Credit: Jackson Lee Davis/AMC*

*The Walking Dead* may be doomed. With star Andrew Lincoln [leaving](&lt;|url|&gt;) after only six episodes of season nine (which premieres October 7), AMC’s hit show now faces the difficult dilemma of losing its main character, Rick Grimes. The show is already facing years of declining viewership, and Lincoln’s departure may mean *The Walking Dead* is destined to die. But Lincoln was also the show’s biggest problem — which means his exit may be the only chance *The Walking Dead* has to survive.

It’s always problematic when a show loses a main character — think *The X-Files* after David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson left or *The Office* without Steve Carell. Andrew Lincoln has been the heart and soul of the series since it began in 2010. His character, Rick Grimes, has been the primary viewpoint for the audience, discovering the zombie apocalypse after waking up from a coma, searching for his wife and son, and trying to protect a group of people in a world where seemingly 99 percent of the surviving human population also turned into murderous assholes. (One of the show’s best and most accurate taglines is “Fight the Dead, Fear the Living.”)

Rick’s primary (and most compelling) storyline has been his struggle to be good in a world that has forced him to murder people to survive. Watching his attempts to be merciful, when being merciful is a pretty consistent way to get yourself or someone you care about killed, was fascinating for the first several seasons. Then, in season five, Rick and his people got captured by cannibals and Rick decided to murder them all. Because, you know, cannibals.

While killing cannibals is about as guilt-free as murder gets on the series, Rick never really made his way back to the “good” side of the moral line. When the peaceful town of Alexandria let him and his group in, he quickly started waving guns around while covered in blood. He decided to lead a preemptive strike against a fascist group called the Saviors, led by Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan); it’s not exactly heroic to sneak attack and murder a bunch of people without trying diplomacy first. All that might be fine if Rick’s obsession with killing Negan hadn’t kept putting his people in danger. Or if when his son Carl lay dying in his arms and made his father promise to try to make peace with the Saviors, Rick hadn’t literally lied to his face and immediately continued his war. Or, most heinously, that time last season when a group of Saviors captured Rick but then surrendered to him, and he murdered them all anyway.

*The Walking Dead* is no zombified *Breaking Bad*, showing the slow corruption of a good man. While the show has drawn attention to Rick’s most horrific acts, it almost never acknowledges them as bad. There’s an argument to be made that Rick’s descent from civility is a poignant commentary on the times, except there’s been nothing in the show to suggest that kind of self-awareness. Occasionally, Rick shows a pang of morality, but there’s never a discernible reason, and it’s even more frustrating when he arbitrarily returns to being utterly merciless in the next episode. In particular, Rick’s inexplicable decision to spare Negan’s life in the season eight finale — after three seasons of murderous determination — was [spectacularly unearned](&lt;|url|&gt;). The show has ill-used the drama of Rick’s erratic morality, and thus exhausted it. There’s nothing compelling left to explore.
> # Rick has to die.

Getting rid of Rick is for the best, but that doesn’t mean viewers won’t be upset to see the character go. Although *The Walking Dead* is still pulling in excellent ratings for today’s TV landscape, the show’s ratings have dropped precipitously over the past several years, from up to [17 million viewers in its height](&lt;|url|&gt;) to around 6 million in season eight.

That’s not great, and the loss of Lincoln may actually be fatal. But there is some hope: The interminable Savior war is over and Negan has been captured; perhaps more important, Angela Kang, a longtime show writer and executive producer, will become *The Walking Dead*’s showrunner for season nine. Kang has been given the nearly impossible task of writing Rick off without upsetting viewers. But how?

First of all, Rick has to die. There’s no situation where the character voluntarily leaves the people he’s shepherded for nine years, especially when he has a toddler he would be endangering immensely by setting off his own. People exiling Rick for his savagery would be warranted, but that would be unsupported by the show’s narrative. And there’s no way viewers would be okay with Rick simply disappearing, leaving them to wonder what happened to the character they cared most about. Death is the only way to give him — and the audience — the finality necessary to move forward.

So what is *The Walking Dead* after Rick Grimes? Of the show’s four other most beloved characters — including fan-favorite badass Daryl (Norman Reedus), housewife turned even bigger badass Carol (Melissa McBride), and Rick’s samurai sword–wielding love interest Michonne (Danai Gurira) — only Maggie (Lauren Cohan), a longtime teammate now in charge of the Hilltop colony, has the character and narrative position to replace Rick as the show’s center. But that poses its own problem, as Cohan is [also leaving the series](&lt;|url|&gt;) after this season to star in an upcoming TV comedy called *Whiskey Cavalier*. Michonne is the best bet as the show’s new primary lead, as she’s also a fan favorite, the closest Rick has to a successor, and because she’s played by Gurira, still blazing hot after her role as Okoye in *Black Panther *and* Avengers: Infinity War*. But the show will have to get to work when season nine begins if it wants to position the character to fill that Rick-shaped void*.*

Here’s the funniest part: Up until the middle of season eight, *The Walking Dead* had the closest thing to a built-in fail-safe in the event of Lincoln’s departure and then threw it away. That’s when the show killed off Carl (Chandler Riggs), Rick’s son. We don’t know why Riggs was let go — it came as [quite a surprise to the actor](&lt;|url|&gt;) — but supposedly Lincoln had wanted to leave the series in season eight, meaning the showrunners knew his departure was in the cards. Having Carl survive to carry out his father’s vision would be the best, easiest, and most narratively traditional way to transition Rick out of the picture. Whoops.

If any other show had *The Walking Dead*’s writing problems and then lost its leading actor, it would be doomed. But *The Walking Dead* is not most other shows. Even at its most troubled, it remains one of the most-watched dramas on TV. That’s no mean feat. So maybe it will survive Andrew Lincoln. Maybe Angela Kang can turn it all around in season nine, and the show can live to see another season.

But as *The Walking Dead* has made very, very clear, no one survives forever.<|endoftext|>

# Can “Govtech” Save the Government—and Tech?

## Tech companies can help streamline government services, but they need to overcome privacy fears

Gavin Newsom did not become governor of California quietly. During his first days in office in January 2019, Newsom said he would[ remove](&lt;|url|&gt;) state National Guard troops from the Mexico border, and he accused the White House of “[corruption and incompetence](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

The mini-drama surrounding his first few weeks in office eclipsed two significant new policies that will affect how the state of California collaborates with technology companies. On his first day in office, Newsom announced changes to the way state agencies [could buy technology](&lt;|url|&gt;). On his second, he created a new department—the [Office of Digital Innovation](&lt;|url|&gt;)—with a starting budget of $36.2 million.

Few Americans took note of the announcements. But in the technology world, Newsom’s policies were read as a nod to a little-known sector called “govtech,” where technology companies offer solutions to government problems.
> # How can governments make applying for food stamps or reporting earthquake damage as seamless as ordering an Uber?

While technology has transformed our lives as consumers—for better and for worse—our existence as citizens has remained largely untouched by the influence of tech, as anyone who tried to renew their driver’s license or contact their local representative knows. But Newsom—who was mayor of San Francisco during some of the frothiest years in tech—has [long pushed](&lt;|url|&gt;) for governments to partner with tech companies on innovation. His new policies spotlight an important question: how can governments make applying for food stamps or reporting earthquake damage as seamless as ordering an Uber?

Code for America’s app,[ ClearMyRecord](&lt;|url|&gt;), is one promising answer. In 2014, as many as[ one million Californians](&lt;|url|&gt;) with low-level, nonviolent felonies became eligible to clear or change their records after lawmakers recognized how even minor convictions can create barriers to jobs, housing, and student loans. But actually clearing those convictions was so bureaucratic that few people managed to [complete it](&lt;|url|&gt;);** **in LA County, only seven percent of eligible citizens even started the process.

“Essentially, it was a law that was unimplemented,” says Code for America founder Jennifer Pahlka. The nonprofit was founded in 2009 to bridge the gap between private sector technology expertise and public sector needs. In 2016**, **it created a free-to-use mobile and desktop app that can help affected citizens complete the first steps of an application to “clear their record” in just 10 minutes. Applicants typically hear back from an attorney around[ 25 days later](&lt;|url|&gt;)—a significant improvement over the previous system that had limited access to a series of complex forms and could take three-six months to complete each stage. Since the launch of Clear My Record,** **more than 11,000 people in 14 California counties have applied to dismiss or reduce their own convictions using the software.

Code for America has been working with San Francisco district attorney George Gascón to further streamline the process of dismissing convictions. Since 2018, the nonprofit has been running algorithms through Department of Justice databases, automatically clearing eligible records—no application required. In February 2019, Gascón announced that the project had automatically cleared another [8,000 convictions](&lt;|url|&gt;), all marijuana-related. San Francisco is now the first county in the U.S. to automate the clearing of convictions, and the pilot project will be expanded across the state.

Code for America’s program is emblematic of the Golden State’s progressive approach to govtech. “California continues to be a leader in digital infrastructure,” says Jay Nath, San Francisco’s chief innovation officer from 2012 to 2018. “That spirit has now been continued with Governor Newsom. He’s using the ethos of the Valley to transform government.”
> # Governments are sitting on treasure troves of data but don’t know how to use it — something tech companies are more than capable of doing.

While in office, Nath created [Start Up In Residence](&lt;|url|&gt;), a program that matched tech startups with government agencies. When San Francisco asked Nath to help the county find more people willing to be foster parents, he introduced the Human Services Agency to Felicia Curcuru, a former McKinsey analyst who was trying to use tech to help improve the private adoption process.

Curcuru shadowed the department for four months in 2016, approaching the problem from a tech perspective. “The system was complicated, time-consuming, entirely paper-based,” she says. “A lot of prospective foster parents would drop out midway through the application process. But the number of children needing foster parents wasn’t getting any less.”

She transformed that application system, creating a software program called “Binti,” which means “daughter” in Swahili, Arabic, and Malaysian. The software went live in 2017** **and enabled foster parents to apply online, sign everything digitally, and upload supporting documents to the web. “With Binti, counties have seen 60 percent more families approved in 20 percent less time, with the same team,” she says. The software has since been adopted by 34 of California’s 58 counties and is now in place in 12 other states.

Govtech companies work in two ways. They either use government data to build their product, like Clear My Record, or they use their product to better collect data on the government’s behalf, like Binti.

Either way, data is critical. Governments are sitting on treasure troves of data but don’t know how to use it—something tech companies are more than capable of doing. “People say data is the new oil,” says Nath. “Whether that data is from a legacy or a modern system doesn’t matter—you can’t build an effective solution without it.”

Yet [Lee Tien](&lt;|url|&gt;), senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is concerned that govtech will become another new field where citizens could lose control of their personal information. “Partnerships sound great from the perspective of the government,” he says. “They can get things done, it’s more convenient, and it’s cheaper. But what if the price of doing that is citizens are being forced to—without knowing it—have their personal information taken and monetized by companies they don’t know about?”

Tanya Filer, who leads a digital states project at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., believes govtech could represent a tipping point on trust—and one that could fall either way. Govtech companies could potentially rehabilitate citizens’ trust by making government more effective, but there are risks too.

“A lack of sectoral responsibility, answerability, and respect for societal values could have the opposite effect,” she says. “Currently there is a lack of shared standards, and so usage of citizens’ data can vary quite a bit across government contracts, without a lot of forethought.”

Filer points to the example of Google’s DeepMind A.I. division, which began working with a group of state-run London hospitals in 2015 to develop an app called Streams. The app aggregates and analyzes patient information to identify emerging problems, and as part of its development, more than one million identifiable patient records spanning five years were [transferred](&lt;|url|&gt;) to DeepMind without the consent of patients.

A [2017 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the DeepMind transfer—which violated [U.K. privacy law](&lt;|url|&gt;)—found that government institutions weren’t equipped to deal with the “data politics” of the A.I. tools they were using. “Governments that lack data privacy policies for all data—both internally managed and shared with third parties—are very vulnerable to exploitation,” says Charles Belle, founder of the** **San Francisco-based think tank Startup Policy Lab. “I would anticipate that most government agencies, especially local government, lack robust data privacy policies.”

There is potential for effective govtech to make government more user-friendly, more responsive to citizens’ concerns, and to reinforce the idea that technology can work in the interest of the public—not just for founders and venture capitalists. To work effectively, the sector requires citizens to trust technology companies with the data they share with their government. Govtech’s challenge is to avoid the privacy-convenience tradeoff so common in consumer tech and rebuild trust in technology companies, which has [rapidly eroded](&lt;|url|&gt;) after a year packed with scandals ranging from the Cambridge Analytica privacy breach to the misinformation on Facebook that [incited genocide](&lt;|url|&gt;) in Myanmar**.**

Reflecting growing regulatory concern since these scandals, California became the latest territory to pass a new [consumer data privacy law](&lt;|url|&gt;) in July 2018**.** For his part, Newsom has suggested that internet users should be [paid a percentage](&lt;|url|&gt;) when companies make money from their data, though it is unclear how this would work in the govtech sector. Perhaps Newsom revealed a more realistic expectation of the future when he stated in 2013 that “privacy as we’ve known it [is dead](&lt;|url|&gt;).”<|endoftext|>

# Imagining New Institutions for the Internet Age

## A sci-fi novelist on what he learned writing a trilogy of speculative novels that extrapolate how feeds shape our lives, politics, and future

![Photo: Motortion/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Motortion/Getty Images*

Feeds shape our world. Google uses hundreds of variables to determine the search results you see. A complex statistical engine produces your personalized Netflix queue. Facebook uses everything it knows about you and your friends to build your timeline. Your credit score is compiled from third-party data brokers. Taylor Swift uses facial recognition software to identify stalkers at concerts. Even these Herculean efforts are dwarfed in scale by the Chinese social credit system that will integrate data from many disparate public and private sources.

Feeds are inevitable to the extent that they are useful. Every minute of every day, 156 million emails are sent, 400 hours of video are uploaded to Youtube, and there are 600 new page edits to Wikipedia. There is so much more information than we can possibly digest, and feeds are the imperfect filters that we use to try to distill what we want from all that’s out there. But their imperfections generate horrendous side effects, like unjust parole decisions made on the basis of racially biased data. And even more fundamentally, the sheer scale of feeds, and their incomprehensibility to most users, give their masters enormous hidden power.

In a world awash in information, the curator is king. Behind each digital throne is an algorithm, a specialized artificial intelligence that is powered by data. More data means better machine learning which attracts more talent that build better products that attract more users that generate more data. Rinse, repeat. This positive feedback loop means that A.I. tends toward centralization. Centralization means monopoly and monopoly means power. That’s why companies like Google and Facebook post annual revenues that dwarf the gross domestic product of some countries.

As technology changes the structure and flow of power, how should we adapt the ways in which we share power and hold those in power to account? The obvious answer is to draft new laws, and governments are attempting to do just that — with decidedly mixed results. But even if national governments manage to make good policy, the internet is challenging their ability to enforce it.
> # In a world awash in information, the curator is king.

Growing up, I learned that countries defined our political world: you’re born in a place where you become a citizen with certain rights and rules. But history is often the best guide to the future, and the concept of a “nation-state” is brand new by historical standards — invented as a part of the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia that ended the Thirty Years’ War.

Over the past few centuries, nation-states became the dominant form of governance, but technology has stitched the world together in ways that ignore political borders. The economy is global. The internet is global. Corporations operate globally. Many of the greatest challenges we face, like climate change, are inherently global.

When problems transcend the scope of nation-states, we can’t expect nation-states to solve them, and yet multilateral institutions like the United Nations often lack the power to take substantive action. Our system is in violent flux and the cracks are spreading. Trade wars and resurgent nationalism are ugly reactions rooted in fear of the unknown. A blank page is a dangerous thing — we must imagine new forms of governance and draft a new “treaty” with courage, humility, and compassion.

What might that actually look like? That’s the question I’ve been wrestling with over the course of writing three novels that extrapolate how a future tech platform might itself become sovereign and democratic. [*Bandwidth](&lt;|url|&gt;)* grapples with the geopolitics of climate change and how feeds shape our lives. [*Borderless](&lt;|url|&gt;)* examines the rise of tech platforms and the decline of nation-states. [*Breach](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, which was published on May 14, explores what might come next — how we need to reinvent ourselves and our institutions to build a better future.

Speculative fiction doesn’t predict the future — it imagines myriad possible futures. It forces us to ask: What if this were to go on? How might the world be different? What are the true axes on which history turns? It is an escape and a warning and a lodestone. It is the promise and the threat of new horizons opening up before us. By taking us on journeys through plausible alternative realities, speculative fiction encourages us to look at our reality through fresh eyes. It challenges us to flex our empathy and imagination. As feeds remake our personal and political lives, we will need all the empathy and imagination we can get.<|endoftext|>

# Do You Really Need Another Computer Monitor?

## Do You Really Need Another Computer Monitor?

### Short answer? Yes. Yes, you do.

![Illustration: [Eva Cremers](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Eva Cremers](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

My husband has what I once assumed was a really intense home office setup. Two large monitors are supported by aluminum arms that position one screen directly in front of the user and the other to the right. At first, I was flabbergasted by the effort and expense: Does anyone actually need two huge, adjustable monitors for email, Google Docs, and video games?

As it turns out: Yes, they do. Multiple monitors actually make a positive difference when it comes to productivity.

I started to suspect this was true over the course of the past year, when I switched from working at various media companies and transitioned to freelance writing at home. It turns out there’s research to support my newfound discovery: For most office labor, employees benefit from multiple monitors, so if you — or even better, your employer — have a little extra cash and want to beef up productivity in a painless way, opening your wallet for an extra monitor or two is well worth it.

“If you have a lot of papers you’re working with on a project, would you rather work on a big conference table or an airline tray table?” says John Stasko, a professor of interactive computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology who has researched the effects of using multiple monitors. “I don’t know many people who’d trade their multi-mon setup and go back to a single monitor.”
> # “Would you rather work on a big conference table or an airline tray table?”

(“Multi-mon,” I’ve learned recently, is a phrase used by experts to refer to a “multiple-monitor” setup.)

This is what many respondents told me when I asked my extended Twitter network about their preferred monitor setups. “I find it reeeeeally odd now when I work remotely with my laptop and have to condense all my thoughts and tabs and apps back to one,” writes Becca Caddy, a technology journalist. “If I had the room, I’d even consider three.”

![*Image courtesy of Becca Caddy, [Twitter.com](&lt;|url|&gt;)*](<|image|>)**Image courtesy of Becca Caddy, [Twitter.com](&lt;|url|&gt;)**

Alicia Hannah Naomi, a Melbourne-based contemporary jewelry designer, has had a similar experience. “I’ve never had the luxury until my current job where there were two monitors set up for me before I started, and I feel like a goddamn boss,” she writes. “It was weird but I adjusted VERY quickly. Now I can’t work on my single screen laptop at home properly.”

My own experience is similar. At my most recent office job, I had a large Apple monitor, which was considerably more luxurious than the small laptop screens I’d been accustomed to using. But it was nothing compared to my current situation, in which I work off two 27-inch monitors and, if I need it, my little MacBook Air as well.
> # “There were two monitors set up for me before I started, and I feel like a goddamn boss.”

These experiences are echoed in the scientific literature on the topic, which while scant, uniformly backs up the anecdotes presented here as far as I could find. A [2004 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) looked at how performance compared when a worker used one monitor as opposed to two. It found that workers got started on work 6% more quickly, worked 16% faster, and had 33% fewer errors when using more than one screen.

Users also vastly preferred the use of multiple monitors — those with multiple monitors rated their experience 28% easier to focus and 24% more comfortable. Stasko’s [2008 research](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the topic confirmed the earlier study’s findings, concluding that study subjects worked faster and much preferred multiple monitor over single monitor setups. Still another, a [2011 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) (sponsored, to be clear, by Dell), reported that participants “were often observed to show disappointment (or groan!) when they were asked” to use a 17-inch single monitor configuration.

This enthusiasm for multiple monitors (and distaste for single monitors) was reflected in the responses I received after asking people how they prefer their work computer setups.

Chris, who works in finance in London, has an impressive and almost overwhelming desk. He uses three monitors which, [he says](&lt;|url|&gt;), helps him work on projects that are complex and have multiple elements.

![*Courtesy of @_Capilano_*, [*Twitter.com](&lt;|url|&gt;)*](<|image|>)**Courtesy of @_Capilano_*, [*Twitter.com](&lt;|url|&gt;)**

But most people don’t seem to be using their multiple monitors for as complicated of tasks as Chris. That extra screen is often reserved for chat apps like Slack or email, as several people, including user experience designer Maxim Leyzerovich, informed me.

![*Courtesy of Maxim Leyzerovich, [Twitter.com](&lt;|url|&gt;)*](<|image|>)**Courtesy of Maxim Leyzerovich, [Twitter.com](&lt;|url|&gt;)**

Stasko says partitioning off tasks into multiple monitors helps save brainpower. “With one monitor, a person is often forced into ‘window churn,’ where they cycle through the applications they’re using,” he says. “So with multi-mon, less cognitive resources have to be devoted to window management.”

Theoretically, a large screen — say, double the size of a 13-inch Macbook Air like mine — would be enough without a user benefiting from another monitor. The worker could segment their screen, with a word document on the left side and Slack on the other. But as [research from 2001](&lt;|url|&gt;) shows, people tend to use different screens to organize and partition their work. Second monitors are often used for “secondary activities,” such as email, social media, or Slack, or for adjacent activities or information. I, for example, don’t always use my second monitor. When I do, it’s typically either to keep an eye on my email or Twitter account, or to be able to refer frequently to a research document or story outline. Other people told me they will keep Spotify on their second monitor; some, like Maxim, watch movies while they work. All these activities are secondary to the main task at hand.

While two screens are typically better than one, regardless of size, there’s one significant situation in which a large, solitary screen is preferable: when that screen is *really* big. A [2009 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that users preferred a 16-foot-wide, 6-foot-high display to single or double monitors 21 inches or smaller. Workers felt “surrounded” by their task, which they basically were, given that their Excel sheets and other work duties took up most of an entire wall. I’ve spent some time working on very large screens — a friend in high school had a computer hooked up to a large TV that was probably about 55 inches — and I personally found it somewhat overwhelming. That said, if I were made to work in front of it for five days like the users in the study, rather than intermittently using it to download movies, it’s possible I’d feel differently.

There are situations, of course, when one monitor is more than enough. Ann-Marie Alcantara, a reporter at *Adweek*, [told me](&lt;|url|&gt;) she prefers just her laptop when she needs to concentrate, because it’s “less space, so less prone to being distracted.” And Dave Gershgorn, my colleague at *OneZero*, says he primarily used an iPad to work at his previous job, because he was “able to focus better without so many apps open at the same time.”

A [cluttered screen](&lt;|url|&gt;) only creates more stress. With a cluttered single screen, people take longer to do their work, they make more errors, and perhaps counterintuitively, they have more trouble focusing. So I advise you to do what any good employee would do: send this story to your boss and explain to them why your current work setup is actually interfering with your productivity. You might end up with a pretty new 27-inch monitor on your desk by next week.<|endoftext|>

# How a Limitless Internet Binds Us

## The new constraints in our digital world

![Credit: liulolo/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: liulolo/Getty Images*

On May 20, 2013, then Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer [told the world](&lt;|url|&gt;) her company was changing the photo-sharing site Flickr. “Since 2005, Flickr has become synonymous with inspiring imagery,” Mayer wrote on the company blog, adding that, “when it comes to photography, technology and its limits shouldn’t hinder the experience.”

So, Mayer continued, the company was offering each of its users one terabyte of free storage space. “That’s enough for a lifetime of photos — more than 500,000 original, full-resolution, pixel-perfect, brilliant photos,” she wrote. “Flickr users will never have to worry about running out of space.” Not only was Flickr offering what seemed like unlimited space, Mayer went on, but also an entirely new user experience. The site was now a “photostream” that gave users “a vivid and endlessly scrolling gallery,” so that people could easily see what their friends “are posting and what they’re saying about your photos.”

Flickr, in other words, tilted toward a social media platform — of unlimited photos, unlimited space, and a suggestion of unlimited possibilities.

Mayer’s data plan for Flickr (which has since been reversed under new management) was in keeping with a long-standing idea, at the time, that the more we live our lives online, the more boundless potential and endless opportunity could be created. The promise of living life increasingly on the internet was that, in doing so, we would enter a new kind of world, a world that stretched far beyond the borders of the old, in which we would experience never-ending information, countless friendships, incalculable connections, on and on and on to an invisible horizon and beyond. Everything we once believed had limits would become infinite.
> # We’re realizing that eventually all the data we posted to our screens to help us organize our lives will soon organize our lives for us.

But something odd has started happening. We’ve found ourselves bumping up against boundaries and unanticipated limitations — unanticipated in that they were never part of the sales pitch made to us over the years of internet-fueled freedom. We’ve started to understand that the information highway is less an endless road than an enormous loop, and that the data we create tends to travel through time in a wide circle. We’re realizing that eventually all the data we posted to our screens to help us organize our lives will soon organize our lives for us.

On March 11, *BuzzFeed* [reported](&lt;|url|&gt;) that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is “scrambling” to fulfill an executive order signed by President Trump last year that will make facial recognition mandatory for anyone (including Americans) boarding an international flight from one of America’s 20 busiest airports. CBP is rushing to meet the 2021 deadline, and among the concerns raised by critics, are that the CBP may not have done due diligence in seeking public feedback before adopting the technology.

The Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology criticized airport biometric scanning in 2017, when it [reviewed](&lt;|url|&gt;) the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) then-deployment of facial recognition at eight select airports in the U.S. (The CBP is part of DHS.) Researchers noted that DHS’s own figures from the time showed that its systems “erroneously reject 1 in 25 travelers using valid credentials.”

On Tuesday, *NBC News* [revealed](&lt;|url|&gt;) what it called the “dirty little secret” of facial recognition: that the artificial intelligence algorithms behind some systems could be training on public Flickr photos. The report detailed how a new, massive data set of facial images IBM released in January was created by compiling pictures people posted of themselves or others on Flickr. IBM released the data set, called [Diversity in Faces](&lt;|url|&gt;), to address a different problem: that facial recognition technology is inherently biased against people of color, because it is regularly trained on data sets that are not representative enough of the population at large, usually by virtue of them being too small.

A 2018 study by MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini [showed](&lt;|url|&gt;) facial recognition programs created by IBM, Face++, and Microsoft, had trouble identifying women of color. “IBM had the largest gap in accuracy, with a difference of 34.4 percent in error rate between lighter males and darker females,” Buolamwini wrote. In responding to the study at the time, IBM noted its data set compilation was underway, stating that it is “deeply committed to delivering services that are unbiased, explainable, value aligned, and transparent.”

In its research paper released alongside the Diversity in Faces data set, IBM notes it stripped the pictures of other identifying metadata that could skew the sample, like geotags, labels, or Flickr usernames.
> # It is indeed odd to consider that what you once hoped would be stared at on a screen is now teaching that screen how to stare back.

*NBC News* tracked down some of the photographers whose photos fell under the public Creative Commons license that enabled IBM to use them freely. They found the idea that their work was being employed to train facial recognition algorithms unsettling. It is indeed odd to consider that what you once hoped would be stared at on a screen is now teaching that screen how to stare back; that what was once fed into a technology for all to see has now become part of a technology that could become all-seeing.

The photographers might also be surprised to learn that IBM isn’t the first to do something like this.

In 2016, researchers at the University of Washington [asked a question](&lt;|url|&gt;): “How well do facial recognition algorithms cope with a million strangers?” To answer it, they first needed the gigantic data set against which they could test various facial recognition programs for accuracy. To build the data set, they turned to Flickr, compiling over one million photos that users from around the world had uploaded under the Creative Commons license. The photos represented nearly 700,000 separate people. The researchers called the data set, MegaFace.

MegaFace has quickly become a go-to standard check for those in the facial recognition industry. When facial recognition technology developer [IntelliVision](&lt;|url|&gt;) [wanted to boast](&lt;|url|&gt;) about its program’s accuracy, one of the “leading public test databases” against which it said it assessed the program was MegaFace. Similarly, when Amazon’s Rekognition facial recognition software was criticized in Buolamwini’s [latest research](&lt;|url|&gt;) for misclassifying some women as men and mistaking “darker-skinned women for men 31 percent of the time,” Amazon [defended](&lt;|url|&gt;) the program’s accuracy, stating it “evaluated photos from parliamentary websites with the MegaFace data set of 1 million images” and noted it found “exactly zero false positive matches at the recommended 99 percent confidence threshold.”

The MegaFace team is not alone in culling images we’ve put online to create data sets against which facial recognition can be tested. Researchers have been able to obtain images from Facebook for some time, for instance. In 2008, two researchers created a tool to extract facial images from Facebook, gaining access to pictures and tags through the site’s API. “Using this feature, we automatically downloaded tagged photos from seven different Facebook accounts and their friends,” [they wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;). Nearly a decade later, in 2017, a pair of Korean researchers, looking for more examples of real-world photos for more accurate gender classification, did something similar and [managed to gather](&lt;|url|&gt;) over 28,000 photos from the site for their research.

There is a difference between research and retail, of course. Most researchers are not looking to perfect a system to sell to governments, but rather simply conducting scientific testing. Still, their work informs others, and ultimately may contribute to a growing tech sector that some are already using to build an entirely new kind of infrastructure within our society — for good or ill — that is [so far unregulated](&lt;|url|&gt;) and which very few of us have a say in controlling or stopping.

Some of us who once believed in the promise of a limitless internet are now beginning to learn that it now could mean something different than we imagined. Limitless photo storage, for instance, once meant convenience. Soon, limitless photo storage might mean the opposite. It might mean that when we’re trying to [take a holiday abroad](&lt;|url|&gt;), or [cross a border](&lt;|url|&gt;), a facial recognition program schooled in human face identification from a database that includes our photos will tell us we can’t do it.

Stranger still, we may all discover that our past hopes of exploiting the limitless life online will soon not only determine what we can’t do, but what we *become required *to* *do. Because the data exists to enable facial recognition software to constantly improve — thanks in some degree to the millions of photos we uploaded here and there over the years — logic will dictate that its capabilities must be continuously perfected. Eventually, there will simply be no other accepted way to identify people. At that point, there will be no way to avoid being recognized by a computer program. It will be mandatory and, tracing the circle back around, we will discover we are the ones, with all our data, that have made it so.

We may learn that what were once limitless possibilities might soon forever limit what’s possible.<|endoftext|>

# I Made Myself Lose My Phone

## Beneath our dependency on smartphones lies a seething resentment at what our devices are turning us into

![Illustration: [Joe Melhuish](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Joe Melhuish](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

For Christmas 2018, I booked a trip to Thailand on a whim — keen to escape work and the annual family gathering. Nothing good tends to comes from hasty decisions. Jetting off to the other side of the world because I couldn’t deal with real life would come at a price.

Sure enough, soon after landing in Bangkok, things started to go missing. I left a copy of *Lord of the Flies *in a restroom, forgot to retrieve my credit card from an ATM, left a pair of earphones in a restaurant. This losing streak reached a peak when I misplaced two cellphones in two days.

The first was a recently upgraded iPhone 8, already cracked on the back. It fell out of the pocket of my swim shorts while I was riding a scooter from the beach. I got back to my room and noticed it was gone. The second phone, a battered iPhone 6 kept at the bottom of my travel bag for emergencies, disappeared in exactly the same way.

When bad things happen we tend to get derailed by emotions. I spent several hours feeling gut-punched, convinced of my own uselessness. But once the pity party was over, I started to wonder if there wasn’t a more profound explanation for losing all this stuff in such quick succession.
> # The uneasy, immature, and overwhelming relationship we have with social media is at the heart of the conflicted feelings we have toward our phones.

Smartphones are, of course, powerful gadgets that have allowed us to do things which, just a few years ago, were unimaginable. But they have also become the gateway to social media, a place that has made a great number of us increasingly unhappy over the years. In an effort to fit in, most of my posts felt forced, out of character for who I was in real life. Every time I found myself on a bus or train somewhere, scrolling without a purpose, I knew I should be doing something better with my time. There was a war going on for my attention, and Twitter and Facebook were winning.

The uneasy, immature, and overwhelming relationship we have with social media is at the heart of the conflicted feelings we have toward our phones. We know that we check them an average [80 times throughout the day](&lt;|url|&gt;), adding up to some 30,000 twitchy phone checks every year. In my case, many of those twitchy phone checks have come at completely inappropriate moments: while walking the streets of Florence, or while not watching a spectacular sunset in Rio de Janeiro.

After Thailand, I didn’t replace my phone for three months. We’re so used to everyone knowing where we are and what we’re doing that it felt both isolating and liberating to disconnect. Quitting Facebook and Twitter meant that I was less aware of what was happening in the world — but also that I barely heard from any of my online friends. It’s a dilemma almost as old as social media itself: Does Facebook and the like really bring us closer together, or are we just hiding behind computers, pretending we have friends?

“We think we have a relationship with someone [when using social media] but what we have is a connection,” explains Larry Rosen, an expert in the psychology of technology at California State University. “Connection is part of communication, but it’s not all communication. Communication is pulling in various cues about the person you are communicating with that include things like body language, tone of voice, a roll of the eyes. Through social media, you don’t get that. You are reading what they wrote and then jotting down a few words of comment, but it’s not the richness of communication.”

The German philosopher Arnold Gehlen used the term *mängelwesen* — or “deficient creature” — to describe what he saw as the vulnerability of humans compared to animals with inherent survival skills. Man’s fabled power of thought is a substitute for our many physical shortcomings. To liberate ourselves from our inferiority, we developed tools like language, gossip, and technology. Gehlen’s vision is a prescient one of a world where we are only as good as the technology at our disposal, clueless on how to go through life without it.

There are two main theories for why we lose things. Science tells us that losing objects represents a failure of recollection or attention. That sheds no light on how it feels to lose something and provides only the most abstract, impractical notion of how not to do so. (“Focus! Pay attention to what you’re doing, retrace your steps.”)

Psychology, on the other hand, says losing things is, in fact, the success of our subliminal desires over our rational mind. In *The Psychopathology of Everyday Life*, Sigmund Freud describes “the unconscious dexterity with which an object is mislaid on account of hidden but powerful motives,” including “the low estimation and pity in which the lost object is held, or a secret antipathy towards it.” When it comes to my phone, Freud might be onto something.
> # Quitting Facebook and Twitter meant that I was less aware of what was happening in the world — but also that I barely heard from any of my online friends. What does that say about the value of these relationships?

Our smartphones encourage vanity, futile nostalgia, and distraction. We spend a great part of our days romanticizing the past, lusting after things we can’t or shouldn’t have. This had seeped into how I saw the world; I felt devastated at losing my phone because it meant I had lost my way of controlling my surroundings. My reliance on it was such, that it felt like losing a part of myself. And now that I recognize that seething resentment, losing two phones in two days no longer feels like an accident.

Over the years I’ve grown used to walking away. In the last decade, [I have left](&lt;|url|&gt;) countries, jobs, people — at times to my detriment. Three weeks before jumping on that plane to Thailand, I deleted my Facebook account. Two months later, in South Africa and still without a phone, I turned to my girlfriend and said, “You know what, I’m getting rid of Twitter.” Sometimes, you just have to rip off the band-aid. In the months that followed, there came a sense of security and serenity I hadn’t felt for a long time. Humans may be tool-using animals, but there are some tools we simply don’t need.<|endoftext|>

# More Books on Climate Change Won’t Help Us Now

## Bill McKibben on his new book, the need for direct action on climate change, and the threats of A.I.

In 1989, Bill McKibben — then a journalist who had recently quit a five-year stint at the *New Yorker* — published a landmark environmental text called *The End of Nature*. One of the first books to attract mainstream attention to the subject of climate change, *The End of Nature *warned that human materialism and the exploitation of natural resources would be disastrously harmful to the planet.

Thirty years later, McKibben has become one of America’s most renowned climate change activists, and he’s out with a new book, [*Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?](&lt;|url|&gt;)* While *The End of Nature* focused on the impact of climate change on our physical planet, *Falter* explores what these changes will mean for the humans who live here. McKibben is interested in the fate of what he calls the “human game” — “the sum total of culture and commerce and politics; of religion and sport and social life; of dance and music; of dinner and art and cancer and sex and Instagram.”

*Falter* is a sprawling book, but it leans on two distinct lenses through which we can understand our future: climate change and the rise of artificial intelligence. McKibben tells *OneZero* that we’re “well past the point where we can stop climate change,” but with enough effort, we can slow it down. We’re currently doing a bad job of that: Last year, carbon emissions [rose by 3.4%](&lt;|url|&gt;), the largest annual jump since 2010. McKibben explores how we arrived at our current predicament, and his diagnosis echoes an increasingly mainstream conclusion: Since the Reagan years, the wealthy and politically powerful have been fueling global warming at the expense of the rest of us.

McKibben is generally skeptical of “Big Tech” and certain technologies currently in development. He’s concerned that while computers may be able to perform some tasks “better” than we can, it’s important to preserve “the experience of being human — which is precisely the thing that’s disappearing.” But he’s not a tech pessimist, either. He’s hopeful that avoiding the dangers of automation “is at least possible,” and he says that “watching the rapid spread of a technology as world-changing as the solar panel cheers me daily.”

*Falter *doesn’t reveal much new science. In fact, McKibben argues that the science of climate change has been agreed upon — and ignored — for decades. Now, McKibben insists, it’s time for collective action. The climate activist group he helped found, 350.org, has been doing just that around flash points like the Keystone pipeline protests. Most recently, 350.org has turned its attention to the fossil fuel divestment movement.

*OneZero* caught up with McKibben to discuss *Falter*, the dangers of libertarian philosophy, and how to stand up to wealth and power in the fight to slow climate change.

*This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.*

### **OneZero: Americans may be aware of all the facts about climate change, yet, as you write, “we’ve gone on more or less as usual. We literally don’t want to hear about it.” How do we combat apathy?**

**Bill McKibben: **So, the problem is not that people don’t understand that we face real danger from climate change. Increasingly, people really get that, and Mother Nature is doing her best to make the case year after year. The polling shows that after the fires in California, we seem to have reached a kind of new movement of climate consensus — that something needs to be done. The problem is that people have a hard time imagining what it is we’re going to do. Or imagining that anything they could do would be large enough to matter. And truthfully, as individuals, that’s kind of true. I mean, I have solar panels all over the roof of my house, and I’m proud of them, but I don’t try to fool myself that they are how we’re going to stop climate change.

What we’ve tried to do is build movements big enough to let people feel there’s a plausible chance of actually getting something done. And these movements are achieving victories. Whether they’re going to work or not, I can’t tell you.

### **You write that “we need to understand what drives [those in power]. We need to diagnose the intellectual and spiritual hookworm that has entered their bodies and attached itself to their brains.” What is your diagnosis?**

Look, I think our society has gotten dangerously out of balance. You can tell by the fact that the temperature is going up and the gap between rich and poor is even wider. I don’t think the people at the top are ever going to do anything about it, not unless those of us who aren’t at the top force them to.

If you look at the Democratic presidential contenders, there are two people talking about the need for real redistribution and rebalancing of power, but it’s not going to come easily, because the people in control, the very rich and powerful, have the resources to stay in control. They’ve figured out how to game our political system in all kinds of ways. There’s no shortcut around people getting together to demand change.

### **You devote a hefty chunk of the book to the influence of Ayn Rand, saying that she’s arguably the most “important political philosopher of our time,” and “when the United States was occupying the role of superpower, charting the course for a planet, she was occupying the hearts and minds of many of its most powerful people.” How is her free market ideology related to climate change?**

So, it’s just the wrong moment in American history and world history [for us to follow the principles of Ayn Rand] — the ideology that markets solve all problems, that we should leave the rich alone. When I say “worst moment,” it’s because over the past 30 years, from the Reagan era on, we could have done something about climate change, but we didn’t. We were locked into the belief that a free market economy was somehow going to do it on its own. It clearly hasn’t.

That idea—that selfishness was all we needed, that greed was good—simply turns out to be incorrect.

### **You also argue that although “the tech billionaires who inhabit Silicon Valley aren’t at all like the fossil fuel moguls and assorted other magnates who celebrated Trump’s rise to power,” Ayn Rand is the “one human being that bridges the cultural gulf between different species of plutocrat.”**

If you start reading the biographies of [tech moguls like Elon Musk, Travis Kalanick, Peter Thiel] — and they’re almost all guys — Ayn Rand is one of the few commonalities. People who have made a whole lot of money and don’t want to be bothered in any way find her enormously appealing. And that’s why there’s an awful lot of yachts on this planet named *The Fountainhead* or *Atlas Shrugged*. I mean, these guys are usually social progressives. They just don’t want anyone telling them what to do.

And we’ve now seen how that works out. I mean, people have used Facebook to rig elections, massacre racial minorities. Finally, 10 years too late, Mark Zuckerberg is saying, “Well, maybe we need some regulation here to help us get things under control.” But that’s precisely the opposite of what they were saying for a long time, when the slogan was “move fast and break things.”

It broke a lot of things, including, in many ways, the politics of this country.
> # One of the absolute side effects of turning people into products is that they become obsolete, which is new for human beings.

### **You write about how new technology has a way of “washing away meaning from human activities.” What do you mean?**

So, let’s differentiate here between “tech” and “tech” a little bit. Because some of the book is clearly enamored of new technology—solar panels above all. And there are things that bring down the price of solar panels and wind turbines to the point where they might be able to power the world, [which is] one of the great accomplishments of our time.

But there’s this other kind of technology that seems to really strike at what it means to be human. We’ve watched, in the past year, as scientists have delivered the first designer babies on this planet in China, with American help. Even scientists are backing away from [that technology], because the implications of making the human being into a product are so enormous.

Just think about what’s going to transpire when you go into a lab and order up some upgrades for your embryo—maybe regulate their dopamine or try to add a few IQ points. Then think about what happens when you go back in five years for kid number two and the tech has gotten better. What is your first child now except Windows 8 or an iPhone 6 or something?

One of the absolute side effects of turning people into products is that they become obsolete, which is new for human beings.

### **You describe yourself as “naive” when you wrote ‘*The End of Nature’* in 1989. How have you changed over the past 30 years?**

When I was in my twenties, I did not expect to be spending a fair amount of time in handcuffs and in jails and things. I thought we were engaged in an argument about climate change and that the key was to produce more books and more articles and give more speeches. And eventually, people would understand and come around. It took me 10 or 15 years to realize that we’d won the arguments. Science was very clear about what was going on, but we were losing the fight, because the fight was what fights were always about: not reason and data, but money and power. And if we have any hope of standing up to the wealth, the power of the fossil fuel industry, it would be by organizing.

I don’t have as much time to write books anymore, which is okay. Books are important, but by themselves, they’re not going to move the needle.<|endoftext|>

# It’s Okay to Put Your Phone Down

## People would rather be on their phones than engage with other people

![Photo by [Tyler Lastovich](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Tyler Lastovich](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

I’m sitting in a coffee shop right now that overlooks a busy four-way stop at an intersection. I keep seeing people drive by, and as they roll to a stop, they look down at their phones, only to let off the brake and continue on their merry way, sometimes with their phone still in hand.

All I can think is, “Why, for crying out loud, is it so necessary to check your phone for two seconds?!” But then I remember that this is not the only situation where this behavior occurs, and smartphone addiction isn’t exactly a recent development. I recently wrote about [deactivating my Facebook account](&lt;|url|&gt;) because of how it interfered with my daily life, but I think the issue goes even further than that.

I see this problem every day with my students in the classroom. If you haven’t been around a school lately, I’ll paint you a picture: droves of teenagers walking down a hallway, most with their earbuds in while looking down at their phones. I take delight in stepping in front of them just so they can awkwardly bump into me because they aren’t paying the least bit of attention. “You shouldn’t text and walk,” I tell them half-laughing, half-serious, but they can’t hear me. Even worse, I see some students in the classroom who have a compulsive connection to their phones. I’ve had to take phones away simply because some students genuinely can’t seem to put them down.

Adults are no better. I look around during after-school meetings and at least half of my colleagues are on their phones, completely ignoring the presenter. I too have been guilty of this. I used to jump from app to app to check the latest updates and scroll mindlessly through my feeds, looking for something more “entertaining” than the real world. But was anything I was doing necessary? Definitely not.
> # “Smartphone users spend an average of 140 minutes on their phones each day.”

And of course we’re all too familiar by now with the modern hangout or dinnertime scene: a bunch of friends or family members in the same room all looking at their phones. Even more sad than these scenarios, however, is what I saw on TV two weeks ago. It was a news story by the local media in which the [reporter interviewed a group of children](&lt;|url|&gt;) about how they feel when their parents spend a lot of time on their phones. The parents watched the conversation from another room and reacted in shock when most of the kids confessed that they often felt ignored or, even worse, that the child was afraid to interrupt the parent and make them angry. Needless to say, there is a major problem in our society that all of us need to address.

It’s been more than a decade since smartphones and tablets first appeared. Since then, humans have been completely glued to their devices. On the one hand, the technology does make daily life easier and more convenient, but on the other hand, people have become too accustomed to using tech merely as outlets to escape the real world and the people around us. Check out the [pictures in this article](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the *Huffington Post* and you’ll see the problem very clearly: People would rather be on their phones than engage with other people.

I wanted to do some digging to find out just how addicted we are. I found [a study](&lt;|url|&gt;) that showed smartphone users spend an average of 140 minutes on their phones each day, unlocking them more than 70 times and touching them more than 2,600 times total! I was shocked at first; I know I fall into the average user category, and it’s appalling to think how much wasted time that adds up to in an entire year of smartphone addiction.

As Sherry Turkle, an MIT psychologist and author of the book *Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other*, [writes](&lt;|url|&gt;), “The way I like to put it is technology can make us forget what we know about life. One of the things it’s made us forget is that we need to tend to our relationships and other people and our own feelings.”

Turkle’s advice is spot-on. We need to take time away from our devices to actively* *engage with the people around us and cultivate better relationships, as humans were genetically programmed to do. Equally important, we need to tend to our own feelings, because so many of us don’t even realize the anxiety and stress that being addicted to our smartphone is creating in our lives.

I know this, because I was that person.

I used to care so much about my social media presence. I wanted to post the perfect pictures with the perfect filters and the perfect caption. Then I had to check — constantly — and monitor the response from my followers, thereby validating my social media worth. I used to keep up with group text message conversations and try to plan the next hangout while I was in the middle of work. I used to scroll through Twitter or Instagram at lunch instead of connecting with the people around me. And when I had exhausted all of the above options, I would scroll through my stock holdings just to see the latest minor fluctuation in prices.

I had a serious problem and didn’t even know it. Even when people around me joked about how much I used my phone, I brushed it off as just a sign of the times. It’s okay, I thought, because I can multitask, so it’s really not a big deal. Little did I understand, though, how these habits were eroding my own sense of security while also elevating my levels of stress and anxiety. I started to dwell on responses to my posts, or how many “favorites” my tweets got, or how often somebody texted me, or how much my stocks gained or lost. My relationship with my phone became completely compulsive and negative.
> # “My body physically forced me to take a break from all the texting and apps.”

The turning point for me came when I first started having signs of rheumatoid arthritis. I mistook the pain in my hands and wrists as possible carpal tunnel, because the pain made me aware of how many times I touched my phone. My body physically forced me to take a break from all the texting and apps, because I didn’t want to exacerbate the symptoms I was experiencing. With some ice and rest, I figured it would all go away.

When that didn’t happen and I learned it was a more serious problem, it was an even bigger revelation for me: Life doesn’t last forever. There will come a point when I can’t use my hands or feet or body as well as I can now. I’m wasting my best years staring at a phone screen instead of living my life. Since that moment, I have become mindful of this modern-day addiction and am working to revert my life back to normal.

To help with this goal, I just finished reading the book [*10% Happier](&lt;|url|&gt;)* by Dan Harris, who opened my eyes to the importance of being mindful and present. Harris is a famous journalist at ABC who had a similar epiphany when he had a panic attack live on national television. He learned that this was caused by a buildup of stress and anxiety relating to his modern lifestyle, such as compulsively checking his BlackBerry to keep in touch with his work 24/7. Similarly, I used to check my phone incessantly — without any prompting — mostly to entertain myself in everyday situations. I was allowing my mind to obsess over the latest updates, notifications, texts, tweets, and posts rather than focusing on the real world, and especially the people around me.

So, I’ve taken Harris’ advice and started practicing mindfulness and meditation in my own life. I have to say it has already had hugely positive ramifications, which is why I’m writing about it here. It doesn’t take much to regain control of your life and drastically reduce the stress of smartphone addiction.

For example, you can charge your phone in another room besides your bedroom.** **I used to check my phone every morning after waking up and every evening before bed. Now I limit my interactions during these times and instead focus on a relaxing start and end to the day. You can put your phone on silent while you’re working. If you’re expected to focus on something, don’t let your phone distract you. You’ll find that you can start to appreciate the work you’re doing again.

Another challenge is to resist the urge to use your phone as a distraction from life. Sometimes mindfulness means becoming aware of how you feel in seemingly “boring” moments throughout the day. Now, instead of checking my phone while waiting in line, I just wait in line. Likewise, I eat meals without needing to scroll through Instagram at the same time. Throughout the day, I actively remind myself to pause, look around, and enjoy a few mindful moments. When was the last time you noticed what a snowflake looks like as it falls all the way to the ground? (I see snow out my window right now.) Or the last time you actually tasted the coffee you’re drinking? You’d be surprised how it can feel incredibly relaxing to slow down time by avoiding unnecessary distractions.

Lastly, I recommend deleting some apps — especially at least one social media app. If you want to use your phone less, then give yourself one less notification to read or one less mindless game to play. Instead, use your new free time to take up an activity that reengages you with the world. I have been spending more time with people, more time reading books, and more time blogging. It’s amazing how beneficial replacing even small amounts of time with a more soul-satisfying activity can be.

As I sit here watching driver after driver checking their phone, I think there’s an important message to spread: It’s okay to put the phone down. In fact, it’s okay to not even have the phone within reach at all times. You might just be surprised how great you feel by doing it.<|endoftext|>

# How Trump’s ‘Social Media Summit’ Muddied the Waters on Tech

## Platforms like Facebook should be held to account — but not like this

You might expect that a “Social Media Summit” at the White House would include major social media platforms, like Twitter and Facebook, and foster useful policy conversations about how those platforms affect democracy and whether they need to be regulated.

President Donald Trump’s [Social Media Summit on Thursday](&lt;|url|&gt;), which was closed to the press, did none of those things. The gathering brought together fringe voices, conspiracy theorists, and far-right online agitators to complain about alleged censorship by tech companies, and it gave the president another opportunity to grouse about what he sees as his declining Twitter reach.

“I used to watch it, it’d be like a rocket ship when I put out a beauty,” Trump reminisced about his old tweets at the summit, some of which were printed out on poster boards and displayed at the event.


Trump and many of his supporters are stuck on the idea that social media platforms are [biased against conservatives](&lt;|url|&gt;). In fact, as investigative journalist Renee Diresta [explained in *Wired* last year](&lt;|url|&gt;), there is no credible evidence to suggest that’s the case. Tech executives are not sitting around deciding what news and memes should be consumed. Algorithms decide what content is most relevant to Facebook and Twitter users, and the political leanings of that content can seem quite random. “Even the creators don’t always understand why it recommends one video instead of another,” Guillaume Chaslot, an ex-YouTube engineer who worked on its algorithm, told Diresta in the piece.

A doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slurring her speech and sounding drunk, for instance, received over a hundred million views on Facebook earlier this year, and the site [refused to take it down](&lt;|url|&gt;) even after learning that it was fake. Right-wing accounts on Twitter also [worked together to amplify a viral tweet](&lt;|url|&gt;) from conservative operative Ali Alexander claiming Senator Kamala Harris is “*not* an American black” — a racist, false conspiracy theory. (Alexander attended Trump’s Social Media Summit on Thursday.)
> # This dog and pony show at the White House might only draw attention away from actual problems that need fixing.

The complaint that tech platforms discriminate against conservatives is also ironic considering that Trump probably wouldn’t have won the presidency without the proliferation of memes, fake stories, and conspiracy theories from the far right on Facebook and Twitter. Trump’s campaign leveraged social media platforms far more effectively than Hillary Clinton’s — his microtargeted ads increased Republican voter turnout by up to 10% in the 2016 election, [according to one University of Warwick study](&lt;|url|&gt;). Trump’s campaign infamously hired a private firm, Cambridge Analytica, to access the private information of [more than 50 million Facebook users](&lt;|url|&gt;) in an effort to sharpen this targeting. And he’s already [outspending Democratic candidates for 2020](&lt;|url|&gt;) on social media platforms.

“He has purchased millions of dollars in ads on Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, while broadcasting his political views to an audience of more than 61 million followers on Twitter each day, a strategy that helped catapult Trump to the White House in the first place,” [wrote the *Washington Post](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

To be clear, there are plenty of problems with these big social media platforms — and political ad spending and the proliferation of fake news hardly the least among them. The issue isn’t exactly that Trump is criticizing tech, which deserves criticism. It’s how he’s doing it — and the fact that this dog and pony show at the White House might only draw attention away from real problems that need fixing.

One such problem: content moderation. Platforms like Facebook and Google are [under increasing pressure](&lt;|url|&gt;) to stop the proliferation of harmful, racist content and political disinformation. And Facebook, which arguably has nearly as much political power as some countries, as the Trump administration knows, also has a responsibility to identify and [root out foreign influence in American elections](&lt;|url|&gt;) through its platform, which clearly [aided Trump’s victory](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2016.

Then there’s the monopoly issue. Facebook and Google — often considered a tech “duopoly” — now control [more than 60% of the digital advertising market](&lt;|url|&gt;), and their stranglehold grows each year. In addition to [likely violating U.S. antitrust laws](&lt;|url|&gt;), these companies are also responsible for platforms that drive a huge portion of traffic to online outlets, [creating constantly shifting incentives](&lt;|url|&gt;) for publications that have shaken the media industry to its core. The nation saw [32,000 newspaper layoffs between 2008 and 2017](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [nearly 3,000 media layoffs just this year](&lt;|url|&gt;). Two-thirds of U.S. counties are now [without a local newspaper](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, [has introduced bipartisan legislation](&lt;|url|&gt;) that would allow media companies to organize against big tech. He said Facebook and Google’s domination of the digital ad market “has pushed local journalism to the verge of extinction.”

Beyond just their impact on local news, social media platforms are facing reputational and antitrust crises in general. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the issue earlier this year, the House Judiciary Committee is probing potential antitrust issues with the four major tech companies, and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for the [breaking up and regulation of Facebook and Google](&lt;|url|&gt;).

These are the real issues with social media platforms that the Trump administration could be addressing: their potential to spread hate and disinformation; their power to shape conversations and tip elections; their ability to suck the financial lifeblood out of newspapers and cripple the American news media, which is a true threat to democracy. None of these issues were addressed on Thursday.

Instead, Trump used the occasion to complain about his own social media metrics and legitimize far-right conspiracy theorists who help boost his own popularity.

“The crap you think of is unbelievable,” [he told them](&lt;|url|&gt;).<|endoftext|>

# How Physicians Should and Shouldn’t Talk With Dying Patients

## Hospitals should require patients to give explicit informed consent before physicians are authorized to discuss life-and-death matters with them offsite via technology

![Credit: Catherine Quintana](<|image|>)*Credit: Catherine Quintana*

*Co-authored with [Arthur Caplan](&lt;|twitter|&gt;)*

On March 3, 78-year-old [Ernest Quintana was admitted](&lt;|url|&gt;) to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center’s emergency department in Fremont, California. Quintana was suffering from lung disease; it was the third time he had been admitted to the hospital in 15 days. As his granddaughter Annalisia Wilharm stood by his bedside, a machine on wheels with an attached digital screen rolled into Quintana’s room. A live-streaming image of a doctor in a remote location appeared on the screen to tell the pair that Quintana didn’t have long to live.

While Quintana’s family “[knew he was dying](&lt;|url|&gt;) of chronic lung disease,” they weren’t expecting him to die imminently and in the hospital. While repeating aloud what the remote physician was saying to her hard-of-hearing grandfather, Wilharm had to be corrected. She suggested the next step might be “going to hospice at home,” but the physician told them he didn’t think Quintana would make it that far. He died in the hospital the next day.

Quintana’s family was justifiably horrified by how this news — the worst medical update any family could receive — was conveyed. His daughter Catherine Quintana [told news outlets](&lt;|url|&gt;), “I don’t want this to happen to anyone else. It just shouldn’t happen.” People expressed outrage on social media, calling the exchange not just underwhelming but unbearably cruel. Doctors chimed in, bemoaning the fact that they are given little time to talk to patients about anything, even a death sentence.

Video conferencing, or telemedicine, can play an important role in medical treatment, but what happened to Quintana and his family demonstrates that health care providers must set the right policies — especially policies for ensuring that remote clinical services provide vulnerable patients with the compassionate care they deserve. It should go without saying, but technology shouldn’t be used if it could undermine intimate conversations about death and dying. Patients and their families should never feel that talking about end-of-life care isn’t worthy of a face-to-face discussion.

Michelle Gaskill-Hames, the senior vice president of Kaiser Permanente Greater Southern Alameda County, [issued a statement](&lt;|url|&gt;) conveying regret at “falling short of the patient’s and family’s expectations.” She also vowed that the hospital “will use this as an opportunity to review our practices and standards with the care team.” Taking her at her word, we’re going to provide clear recommendations for what the policy should include.

## **Getting the facts right**

As terrible as this story is, it has been marred by inaccurate reporting that [has included headlines](&lt;|url|&gt;) such as “Family horrified to learn loved one is dying as told by a robot not real doctor.” This wording wrongly suggests that a non-human robot conveyed the tragic medical update. In reality, it was a human physician who had the fraught conversation with Quintana via a video screen on a mobile robot.

We shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that the controversy is about a verbal interaction occurring between people that was mediated by video-conferencing technology enabled by a robot body. It has absolutely nothing to do with a human expert being taken out of the medical loop. A talking artificial intelligence didn’t replace a human doctor in judging Quintana’s condition or in discussing his dire medical circumstances.

But those clarifications don’t prove that good policy exists. Yes, the doctor who initiated the live video conversion was a “specialist physician”; per standard practice “a nurse was in the room to accompany the video conversation”; and the video conversations were “secure.” None of that, however, justifies subjecting Quintana and his family to the insensitive prognosis they received without their consent.

## **Informed consent should be required**

Compassionate care requires that physicians discuss matters concerning death and dying with patients in a sufficiently empathetic manner. Otherwise, the enterprise of medicine fails to fulfill its most basic promise as an art and a science, and physicians themselves fail at one of their primary responsibilities: to respect a patient’s dignity.

As Quintana’s case demonstrates, the limitations of telemedicine can impede empathetic conversations about mortality by making them harder to understand and making it more difficult for patients to both ask immediate questions and, as they process a diagnosis, pose follow-up queries. Poor audio and image quality and the possible loss of an internet connection are intolerable problems that introduce more tension for patients in an already difficult situation.

So long as technology can’t capture the full bodily presence of face-to-face experience, patients will be justified in perceiving such conversations as utterly unempathetic, even when physicians feel they are doing everything they can to deal with people sensitively. One key reason is that reassuring body language is missing. The family has every right to believe that the video conference was marred by an empathy gap that trivialized the value of Quintana’s life and made his granddaughter’s role hellish.

We’re not so naïve to think every physician displays warmth even in person when interacting with terminal patients. To avoid burnout, some doctors keep an emotional distance, and that sometimes means robotically addressing the most intimate concerns of their patients. But just because this is sometimes the case doesn’t mean that it’s acceptable and that we shouldn’t expect better. Indeed, medical schools realize this a serious dilemma and are working to train resilient physicians to be better at “[delivering bad news to patients](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

Only an ethical framework can provide an appropriate solution to the problem that Kaiser Permanente blundered into. But to propose a technical standard for face-to-face discussions is to keep going down the wrong path. Not only will people disagree about what the right standard should be, but some will find the very prospect of creating an engineering solution demeaning. Consensus doesn’t even exist about [whether it’s ever okay](&lt;|url|&gt;) to dump a romantic partner over text message, much less deliver unwanted medical information. The only justified policy, then, is to require informed consent.

Upon admission to hospital, patients should be given a form that explains that the hospital provides telemedicine for a variety of purposes, which could include discussing grim prognoses. The form should provide a clear and easy-to-read explanation of why this is the case, explain what follow-up options are available and what alternatives exist, and then seek consent only from patients who believe this approach matches up with their own values. This way, patient autonomy gets respected, and health care providers can avoid the charge of gross indifference.

Nobody should be forced into the situation Quintana found himself in. And everyone should have the unquestioned authority to tell the TV-bearing robot to get lost and that they require face-to-face conversations for life-and-death matters.

In rural areas or at small hospitals lacking specialists, some patients may consent to telemedicine. If so, it’s crucial that hospitals require doctors to undergo robust education on how to use telemedicine tools as empathetically as possible. And nurses and chaplains need to be involved in managing off-site communication as well.

The stakes of some situations in health care are high. The only ethical way to approach them is to give patients the guarantee of old-fashioned, face-to-face dialogue with a human being rather than have them react in horror at the fuzzy image of a stranger bearing bad news.<|endoftext|>

# Language Is the Latest Weapon Against the Climate Emergency

## A former ‘Guardian’ journalist on how revisions to the British paper’s style guide can alter our view of the climate crisis

![Credit: Barcroft Media/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Barcroft Media/Getty Images*

The language of our impending environmental disaster is changing. In a note to staff, the *Guardian* on Friday announced it was responding to increasing concern about climate change by calling it the “climate emergency” instead.

The email, as [tweeted](&lt;|url|&gt;) by *BuzzFeed* reporter Mark Di Stefano, reads: “Use climate emergency, crisis, or breakdown instead of climate change. Use global heating instead of global warming… Use climate science denier or climate denier instead of climate skeptic.” The memo states that the aim is to “accurately reflect the phenomena they describe,” and points out that the term climate change “sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.”

It’s a good point — the word “change” hardly captures the self-imposed extinction of humankind, akin to calling an airstrike a “land-changer.” But not everyone agrees. One person on Twitter [replied](&lt;|url|&gt;) sarcastically: “THIS is what will finally convince people. Lol.” If by “people” they’re referring to those actively promoting denial, then fair enough. But when it comes to non-dogmatic skeptics, the change in language might actually help. And believe me, newspapers like the *Guardian* take language very seriously.

I was a staffer at the *Guardian* for about a year, and (full disclosure) still freelance for them occasionally. The first part of my training involved spending a few weeks as a sub-editor. I expected to finish with an intricate knowledge of semicolons and a sense that I would fight with anyone over proper comma placement. (I did, and I will.) But much of it had more to do with understanding the tacit messages we send by the language we use. To say someone “admits” to being gay, for example, suggests that being gay is wrong or shameful, so in order to avoid both offense and moral bankruptcy, sub-editors stopped letting the word by, and journalists stopped using it. And since the media is essentially society’s journal, perhaps removing that micro-aggression actually helped turn down the volume on the notion itself.

Before you go away thinking the *Guardian* has one person who decides what shall and shall not be said, drunk on power and cackling in an ivory tower, that’s not how it works. These decisions are the result of a lot of input from a lot of people. During my year in the office, there was an email from the style editor asking staff for input on how to refer to people fleeing Syria. Should it be migrants? Refugees? I remember one of the responses was: “Perhaps we should refer to them, as often as possible, as people.” Amid a slew of articles and columns in which human beings fleeing a war were dehumanized and demonized, using the word “people” was as much a matter of defending the humanity of those we were writing about as it was a simple, basic fact.
> # If we’re going to use leading language, why not use it to lead people to the actual, scientifically proven, peer-reviewed, obvious-to-the-naked-eye, damn-I’d-better-visit-Miami-while-I-still-can truth?

We know language matters. It’s why the [2011 tweet](&lt;|url|&gt;) from *Modern Family* writer and producer Danny Zuker — “I’m constantly amazed at how different my twin daughters are. Lisa is so much more positive & confident than her sister Hog Face.” — was so funny. It’s because we understand the basic principle that the words we use affect what we think and how we feel about a topic, our identities — and yes, facts.

There has been plenty of scientific study on the effects of language. In 1974, the psychologist Elizabeth Loftus showed films of traffic collisions to participants in an experiment, then asked how fast the cars were going when they (alternately) “contacted,” “hit,” “bumped,” “collided,” or “smashed.” The speeds estimated by participants were directly affected by the verb used by the researchers — the highest speed reported by participants when asked the question using the verb “smashed” was nearly 41 mph, but the highest reported by those asked using the verb “contacted” was just under 32 mph.

If leading language can affect a person’s view of their own memories, surely it can affect a person’s view of a complex topic such as what effect humans are having on our climate. Certainly reporters have a responsibility not to downplay the climate crisis. If we’re going to use leading language, why not use it to lead people to the actual, scientifically-proven, peer-reviewed, obvious-to-the-naked-eye, damn-I’d-better-visit-Miami-while-I-still-can truth?

Perhaps the most important change is to ditch the word “skeptic.” You can’t be skeptical of a proven fact. There are no death skeptics, only death deniers. The media is where we get our stories, so they’re the ones who have to say: enough is enough. State your (possibly) false opinion. Say it loud, and say it proud if you must — no one will jail you or kill you for it, because that’s what "freedom of speech" means. But pretending the counterpoint to scientifically-proven fact is probably false contrarianism? This is where it has to stop.

Welcome home, facts. We’ve missed you.<|endoftext|>

# Your Smartphone Apps Are Filled With Trackers You Know Nothing About

## Your Smartphone Apps Are Filled With Trackers You Know Nothing About

### *The privacy crisis Apple and Google need to fix—now*

![Credit: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images*

Most of us understand by now that we’re being followed across the web. But how much do we know about how the smartphone apps we use track our every move? Thanks to tiny pieces of code that millions of developers use to make their lives easier, an array of companies gets free access to data they can employ to understand your habits. The process is invisible, and it’s worse news for you than you might think.

When we browse the web through Google Chrome, for example, a dizzying array of companies follow us. Such is the Wild West of our modern web, but you still remain in control of which sites you visit and which social networks you log into.

The shift to native apps changes this equation, however. Suddenly you’re no longer in full control of what’s loaded, nor of who is tracking you, and you must trust app developers to do the right thing.
> # All of this should make you skeptical of marketing like Apple’s recent “privacy matters” campaign.

On mobile, tracking is generally performed through the use of a “software development kit” or SDK—a set of tools that helps app developers get something done faster. Many SDKs help developers debug their code or hook into useful services, but others help advertisers and marketing companies peer into your private life. Take the iHeartRadio app for example: Last fall, [*Medium *reported](&lt;|url|&gt;) that it contained code from Cuebiq’s SDK, which would permit user data to be sold for the purposes of ad tracking.

All of this should make you skeptical of marketing like Apple’s recent “[privacy matters](&lt;|url|&gt;)” campaign. While the company offers tools within Safari to block trackers on the web, it doesn’t offer any control over trackers embedded in apps that are distributed through the iOS App Store. Most people use the Google Chrome browser anyway, and it has even fewer privacy protections baked in. (Apple does [ask developers](&lt;|url|&gt;) to “respect user preferences for how data is used,” but good luck with that.)

SDKs present a solution to Apple’s pesky tracking restriction for advertisers. They can connect who you are between apps, provided the developer of each app uses the same SDK and the advertiser is able to use signals to figure out who you are. If we look at the top 200 apps on the iOS App Store, it’s interesting to see how broad the reach of most SDKs actually is.

The top 10 most commonly used SDK libraries in the top iOS apps, as reported by analytics firm [Mighty Signal](&lt;|url|&gt;), are largely provided by Facebook (three out of 10) and Google (four out of 10). [Google’s AdMob tools](&lt;|url|&gt;), for example, helps developers show advertising and track their users, and it’s integrated into 78% of the top apps on iOS—everything from the Holy Bible to LinkedIn. Facebook’s “Core Kit,” which provides access to the social platform’s features, is integrated into 61% of top apps. The list goes on.

Both of these SDKs allow Facebook and Google to track users beyond their desktop web browsers and [automatically collect information](&lt;|url|&gt;) like when you installed the app, each time you opened it, and what you purchased.

Tracking in SDKs is clearly part of the modern App Store ecosystem, and it goes far beyond the big corporate names. There are a dizzying array of companies you’ve never heard of invisibly tracking your habits in apps you use every day. Networks like Vungle, Apps Flyer, and Applovin all call themselves “advertising and analytics” platforms. They help developers monetize their apps, and all of them track data to [sell to](&lt;|url|&gt;) other* *partners behind the scenes as well.

This often overflows into our daily lives in weird* *ways. The technology podcast *Reply All* recently dug into mysterious [automated robocalls](&lt;|url|&gt;), which were somehow matching the area code of producer Damiano Marchetti, even adjusting to different locations as he traveled. How could such robocallers know* *where you physically are?

After digging into all* *of Damiano’s apps, *Reply All *made a discovery: He had downloaded a game called *Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, *which reported the phone’s location and IMEI (a unique identifier) to a bunch of analytics companies, which then sold that data, eventually leading to robocallers purchasing it.
> # The world of SDKs is intentionally obfuscated from view in the same way a magician wishes their most impressive tricks to remain secret.

The *Wall Street Journal [*recently wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) about data collection on millions of other apps, such as those intended for menstrual cycle and body weight tracking. Those apps were found to sell this data to Facebook. Many people assume that Facebook is monitoring their microphones, but the reality is that they don’t need to: They can just collect data from the apps you’re using all day long.

In the past, Apple has moved to make it more difficult to identify you by blocking access to unique identifiers and your phone number, but it’s still trivial to correlate an identity via your IP address, the name of a Wi-Fi network, or just matching together the bread crumbs of data they grab about you. Android allows even broader access to identifiers—not surprising, given that it’s built by a company that relies on advertising to make money.

The world of SDKs and the companies tracking with them is intentionally obfuscated from view in the same way a magician wishes their most impressive tricks to remain secret. If you knew that the game you love was the one ratting out your habits, you’d probably consider uninstalling it.

There’s frustratingly little we can do to combat SDK tracking without intervention from Apple and Google. There are nuclear methods that can help protect you, such as installing a [network-wide ad-blocker](&lt;|url|&gt;) on your home Wi-Fi, which blocks the requests at the source—but of course that only works within the confines of your home. On the go, some VPN providers are able to [block advertising](&lt;|url|&gt;), but with the same limitations: You must stay connected to the VPN at all times to block them, which simply isn’t realistic.

What we really need is change from the top. Apple and Google should provide operating system controls that show the parties harvesting data inside the apps on our devices or should require third parties to reveal this information. A good example of this in practice can be found in the* Guardian* app, which allows users to disable tracking on a per-SDK basis in its settings. Requiring this should be standard for all developers.

Ultimately, the gatekeepers of mobile app stores have a responsibility to give us more control. Otherwise, the next big privacy scandal will be the digital equivalent of the Deepwater Horizon* *oil spill: All our information out there, under the surface, helping companies build a picture of who we are—without us ever seeing it.<|endoftext|>

# Congress Must Act on Regulating Deepfakes

## An A.I. policy expert on the desperate need for a new law that will seek to protect Americans from manipulated video

![Deepfake Mark Zuckerberg. Credit: Bill Posters on Instagram](<|image|>)*Deepfake Mark Zuckerberg. Credit: Bill Posters on Instagram*

Last week a bill l have been working on for the last eight months was introduced to the House of Representatives. The [Deepfakes Accountability Act](&lt;|url|&gt;) seeks to protect the lives of everyday Americans by giving us control of our online image. But what are deepfakes?

Deepfake video is the latest advancement in visual manipulation technologies, but it is not new as it seems — computer scientists note that the first mass-market visual modification technology was actually Photoshop, which was originally released in 1990. But what makes deepfakes different is that they are produced using open source A.I. software, combining facial mapping and audio augmentation to create a completely new property. The videos produced in this way place people in places they have never been, saying things they have never said.
> # If someone were to make deepfake pornographic content of me, it would undermine public trust and derail my career.

The emergence of deepfakes was [brought to public attention](&lt;|url|&gt;) by Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson when an online deepfake of her seeming to perform explicit sexual acts was released last year. Her team worked tirelessly to refute the video and encouraged her to make a victim impact statement to clear her name, pointing to similar attacks on the actresses Natalie Portman and Emma Thompson. I was happy to see this show of strength — but at the same time I could not help but wonder: What if this happened to a poor Black woman like me?

I provide nonpartisan advice on artificial intelligence on Capitol Hill. My job is to help policymakers ensure that technological progress is in the public interest. If someone were to make deepfake pornographic content of me, it would undermine public trust and derail my career. I do not have the resources to salvage my reputation, to place my attack in a larger social context and to recoup the lost income. This is why I need the government to regulate the spread of deepfakes — and so do the rest of us.

This call was taken up by Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, the vice-chair of the House & Energy Committee and chair of the Tech Accountability Caucus. Clarke’s team has been working on this issue for over six months and were inspired to take immediate action last month after Facebook refused to remove a clearly doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that made her appear to be intoxicated. I found the video deeply disturbing because alcoholism is widely seen as a medical condition. Had Pelosi actually been seeking treatment for this issue, the public disclosure of her condition could be viewed as what the legal scholar Danielle Citron [calls](&lt;|url|&gt;) the “unraveling of privacy.” Such technology, if unregulated, could usher in a time where the most private parts of our lives could be outed through the release of manipulated online content — or even worse, as was the case with Speaker Pelosi, could be invented whole cloth.

I am honored to lead an all-female team of computer scientists, researchers, legal scholars, and disinformation experts who explained the national security threats associated with deepfakes to legislators in Congress. We are public sector technologists in a growing field that seeks to provide a counterweight to the profit-driven tech companies who are not incentivized to remove lucrative and highly clickable content. There needs to be another set of actors weighing in on these questions who have an established commitment to the public good. This is why we need to put pressure on Congress to act.

In order to understand how deepfake technologies entered our communication systems, we have to look at their history. Safiya Noble, a professor at UCLA and author of the book [*Algorithms of Oppression](&lt;|url|&gt;)*,* *helped us with this endeavor. She has been studying the online treatment of Black women and girls for the last 10 years and has seen what I call the “disinformation migration.” This is when technologies that are meant to mislead the general public are first weaponized against women and girls to test their capabilities. Once they have been perfected they are then used against a larger segment of the population. This theory may explain why the public deployment of deepfakes started with female celebrities, before being [used most recently](&lt;|url|&gt;) against Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The evidence suggests the use of deepfakes will not stop there.

We are 17 months away from the 2020 Presidential Election and the rise of deepfake videos should concern us all. The indictment of 13 members of Russia’s Internet Research Agency (IRA) by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for online African-American voter suppression highlights how American anti-blackness was weaponized against the country as a whole. Mueller’s team showed how Russian operatives created 30 pro-black Facebook and Instagram sites with names like “blacktivst” and “woke blacks,” which thanks to advertising recommendation algorithms reached 1.2 million people.

During the deepfakes briefing process, Russia expert Nina Jankowitcz debunked the idea that disinformation campaigns were built solely on lies. She explained that Russian disinformation campaigns build trust with their target audiences by introducing verifiable facts into public debate. In the case of the IRA they bought Facebook ads highlighting Hillary Clinton’s support of the 1994 crime bill, linking this legislation to the criminalization of the African-American community, and reinforcing this argument with clips of her describing young black boys as “super predators.” That much was true, but they also weaved in inspirational quotes, funny memes and provided a space to vent online for African-Americans frustrated with their presidential options. Once messages expressing dissatisfaction with both 2016 candidates began accumulating, the IRA began to release ads suggesting members of these pro-Black communities should not vote for Hillary Clinton because she may still hold these views. That part wasn’t true, but it did fit into the narrative laid out by this otherwise trustworthy community.
> # The role of platform companies is to increase shareholder value, not weigh public concerns. The job of the government is to protect the American people.

Now imagine if nefarious actors could create deepfake video of a presidential candidate saying the N-word, or appearing in blackface? That would potentially and unfairly end their run. That’s why we need to stop the spread of deepfake video before it is used to interfere with the 2020 election.

Repealing [Section 230 of the 1996 Communications and Decency Act](&lt;|url|&gt;), which absolves platform companies from taking responsibility for user-generated content, would raise First Amendment questions. So the Deepfake Accountability Act’s legal expert Mary Anne Franks, president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative and a professor at the University of Miami School of Law, argued for an amendment** **to the Federal Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, which would frame social media users as the consumers of content and therefore invoke consumer protection rights.

This new approach places the distribution of deepfake content alongside misappropriation of information such as names, addresses, or social security numbers, which the act already views as inflicting financial, reputational, and psychological injury. Amending the identity theft law to address deepfakes has the potential to serve as a powerful deterrent against the creation and distribution of these malicious images.

There is bipartisan support for the regulation of deepfakes because Congress sees this as a way to maintain the integrity of our democracy. The role of platform companies is to increase shareholder value, not weigh public concerns. The job of the government is to protect the American people. Please call your congressperson and ask them to support the legislation. Congress has to act.

# What Apple Needs for TV+ to Succeed

## What Apple Needs for TV+ to Succeed

### *A-list talent alone won’t cut it*

![Credit: Apple](<|image|>)*Credit: Apple*

We used to wonder if Apple would make an [actual TV set](&lt;|url|&gt;). Instead, it became a TV studio. Before Netflix, Apple would have seemed like an unlikely content creation house. Back in 2013, Tim Cook [told](&lt;|url|&gt;) journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, “We never felt we needed to own content. We need access to great content… We don’t have the skill to produce and direct.”

That has clearly changed. Apple has hired major talent to produce, direct, and star in a cluster of original programs. On Monday, the company held its equivalent of the network upfronts in, naturally, the Steve Jobs Theater on the Apple Park Campus in Cupertino, California. The parade of A-list talent explaining the premise of each of their shows would have fit nicely in any network’s annual advertiser preview.

Apple TV+ isn’t a television, but it is Apple’s big and ultimate TV bet. The company will sink at least [$1 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) into fresh content, and it has attracted stars like Oprah Winfrey with a pitch you might sum up as “think different — about TV.”

One thing that struck me during Cook’s introduction is how he characterized the streaming platform as something more than just television, as if it had a higher purpose than merely attracting eyeballs. The stars certainly seemed to buy it. When *Aquaman*’s Jason Momoa asked audience members to close their eyes and listen to what I thought was an ASMR session, he quickly pivoted to a discussion about the way blind people experience the world. His and Alfre Woodard’s show is a postapocalyptic tale in which the majority of survivors are blind.

Apple understands the hurdles it faces in trying to beat Netflix. The big red streaming platform pours billions more into its own original shows and movies, which are overtaking licensed content, and it has built a formula for must-see TV. One complaint I have with Netflix is that because it dumps entire series onto the platform all at once, a lot of it gets lost or missed. Apple didn’t say if it would handle things more like, say, CBS All Access and dribble out one weekly episode at a time.

My guess is that in its desire to meet Netflix on its playing field, Apple will go the binge route. Not unlike Netflix, Apple will do what it can to help audiences discover new TV+ offerings they might have missed. Its TV app update will rely heavily on A.I. and machine learning to analyze your viewing habits and present homegrown Apple TV+ content that you might like.

And you may not be tethered to physical Apple TV hardware. Such is Apple’s streaming mania that it has done what was once unthinkable and is delivering its updated Apple TV app on other platforms, including Roku, Amazon Fire, and several lines of smart TVs. If Apple decides to follow suit with its Apple TV+ programming, this will position its subscription-based service right next to Netflix, which is obviously exactly where Apple wants to be. But simply being there is not quite the same as “arriving.”

All those Apple-produced shows, from Steven Spielberg’s *Amazing Stories* to Jennifer Aniston’s* The Morning Show*, can’t just be good — they have to be incredible. Or at least one of them has to be Apple’s *Game of Thrones*, *Walking Dead*, or *Handmaid’s Tale*.

A single must-see, water-cooler hit will alter Apple TV+’s fortunes. FOMO will drag people kicking and screaming behind the Apple TV+ paywall.

But there will be far more misses than hits. This is show business, where the hit rate is alarmingly low. “Peak TV” means we have far more platforms and flexibility, but it also means it’s difficult for a small show to rise up and get noticed. What kind of conversations will go on at Apple Park as Jason Momoa’s show fails or when Jennifer Aniston realizes no one is talking about her program?

I also don’t think Apple adequately answered the sex and violence question. I’m not saying Apple TV+ must include lots of R-rated content, but when you ask people to pay a monthly subscription fee for content, they expect certain options. It’s clear Apple has the kids covered with the new *Sesame Street*–flavored*,* coding-infused *Helpers*, and the rest looks like solid middle-of-the-road, broad-appeal fare. If Apple says no to nudity and polices blood flow, its streaming option could come off as lifeless and out of step. Artists want the freedom to express themselves. Those who appeared on stage, however, sounded quite comfortable with the Apple way.

On the other hand, we caught only glimpses of Apple’s new shows. There was not one completed trailer — just one giant trailer for everything. We also don’t know how much the service will cost.

Most people I spoke to expect Apple to charge $9.99 per month for Apple TV+. That would undercut Netflix’s $12.99 monthly subscription. Even if Apple came in at $4.99, it has to beat Netflix and Hulu on content, not price.

Personally, I’m happy to be done with the endless speculation about an Apple TV set. Apple’s focus on software, frictionless channel access, and streaming content is the right place to be.<|endoftext|>

# Social Media Spoilers Won’t Ruin ‘Avengers’ (or Any Other Movie)

## Social Media Spoilers Won’t Ruin ‘Avengers’ (or Any Other Movie)

### *They might actually help you like it more*

![© Marvel Studios](<|image|>)*© Marvel Studios*

*This story contains spoilers for the most recent season of* The Magicians.

The star of one of my favorite shows ever, [*The Magicians](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, unexpectedly dies in the season four finale. Among the handful of fans on my Twitter feed, people were either sharing very obvious spoilers or bemoaning them.

And you know what? Honestly, it doesn’t matter to me. Quentin is dead, and that’s sad, but knowing that going into the show didn’t affect how much I enjoyed the finale. In fact, it may have made me appreciate it more. Research shows that spoilers don’t have the negative impact many of us assume they do.

Yet absolute terror of spoilers abounds across the internet. On Twitter, people treat spoiler warnings like alerts that you’re about to drive into a radioactive fallout zone. Entertainment websites plaster spoiler warnings on articles, rightfully terrified of the hordes who rage against anything they recognize as the vaguest plot detail. And spoiler sections of podcasts abound: On *Vanity Fair*’s [excellent podcast](&lt;|url|&gt;) devoted to the HBO show *Sharp Objects*, producers included a nearly 30-second long recording of pig sounds to denote that the hosts would be discussing the Gillian Flynn book that inspired the show.

But the fury over spoilers has never been more relevant than it is now, with the opening of *Avengers: Endgame* and the last season of *Game of Thrones*.
> # The study found that readers actually significantly preferred spoiled stories over those that were not spoiled.

Last week, when someone leaked a five-minute clip of *Endgame*, fans were [“miserable,”](&lt;|url|&gt;) according to the *Verge*. “For all those people who posted and shared that video I assure you that you have special place in Hell *[sic]*,” one [Facebook commenter](&lt;|url|&gt;) wrote. The film’s directors, brothers Joe and Anthony Russo, [posted a letter](&lt;|url|&gt;) to Twitter begging fans “#DontSpoilTheEndgame” in order to preserve the movie’s “surprising and emotionally powerful conclusion.”

But all these supposedly miserable, [panicked](&lt;|url|&gt;) fans can relinquish their fear, because in all likelihood, spoilers won’t ruin the movie. In a [2011 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) out of University of California San Diego — one of only a handful of studies on the subject of spoilers — 819 students were asked to read spoilers at various points while reading short stories by authors like John Updike, Agatha Christie, and Raymond Carver. These tales were divided into three genres: “ironic twist stories,” “mysteries,” and “literary stories.” The study found that for all three story types, readers actually significantly preferred spoiled stories over those that were not spoiled.

In a[ 2013 follow-up study](&lt;|url|&gt;), the researchers investigated why spoilers don’t seem to have a negative effect on consumer enjoyment. They wanted to know what was compelling people to feel more positively towards the spoiled stories: Was it because the spoiler made the story easier to read and understand? Because it increased aesthetic appreciation? Or was it because it delivered, quite clearly, on reader expectations?

The authors found that spoilers made the stories easier for readers to comprehend, and also caused them to like the stories more — though they had little impact on how readers felt about a story’s style or artfulness. Once again, this was true regardless of whether the story hinged on a twist ending, as in a murder mystery or science fiction story, showing that the success of even so-called “plot-driven” narratives might not hinge entirely on their endings.

“We asked lots of people, ‘Do spoilers ruin experiences for you? The vast majority of people say ‘yes,’” [says Nicholas Christenfeld](&lt;|url|&gt;), a psychology professor at UC San Diego and one of the study’s authors. But “the term is wrong… we’re not watching these things for the ending.”
> # Perhaps fear of spoilers, like many fears, is predicated on a heavy dose of irrationality: I don’t want to know how it ends, on the off chance that it’ll end up badly.

Lest you think these findings might only apply to books and not film or television, [another study](&lt;|url|&gt;), published in the journal *Media Psychology* in 2018, produced similar (but not identical) results. It found that while spoilers have a small and negative impact on viewer enjoyment on comedy films — which the study authors speculate is because jokes rely on punch lines — they had a very slightly positive affect on how much viewers liked “fantasy thriller” films such as *Captain America*. It also found that — and this is relevant for *Game of Thrones* fans — source “familiarity,” such as when a viewer knows the outcome of a show because they’ve read the book that inspired it, caused the viewer to enjoy the show more. Yet when the show diverged from the source material, the viewer liked it less.

Perhaps fear of spoilers, like many fears, is predicated on a heavy dose of irrationality: I don’t want to know how it ends, on the off chance that it’ll end up badly. [Research from 2017](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that people wouldn’t want to know their own future, regardless of whether that future was filled with sadness or joy. The study found that out of more than 2,000 German and Spanish adults, only 1% consistently wanted to know their own futures. These statistics applied even to smaller events, like the outcomes of soccer matches or what they’d be receiving for Christmas.

I’m not one of these people. It’s probably that I’m so driven by anxiety that if I know how something will turn out, I can breathe and focus on what’s happening now. Knowing that Quentin was going to die let me focus on how the show built up to that event. It made room for paying attention to how characters reacted and deciphering the logic behind their choices. Far from spoiling my experience, the spoiler let me enjoy the show more.

This also helps explain why I’ve watched the first three seasons of *The Magicians* three times. There’s a distinct joy to be found in repetitive viewing, as a small and [oddly beautiful study](&lt;|url|&gt;) from 2011 discovered. The results of interviews with 23 New Zealanders found that revisiting films, novels, or geographic places not only helped the study subjects understand the source material more thoroughly, it also helped them understand themselves and their own growth with each revisit.

“We find that reconsuming can be an extraordinary experience, filled with the emotional luxury of delight, novel sensations, and intellectual insight,” write the study authors. “Reconsumption is a petition, a form of actively seeking, a way of asking for something from the past, a way of becoming rather than returning.”

If spoilers can in fact render a narrative more comprehensible and enjoyable, and if, in fact, watching something again makes room for immense pleasure and understanding, both of the self and of the story, then what, exactly, are we so afraid of? Are we waiting solely for narrative events to line up like good little soldiers? Is the only reason we’re watching a show or reading a book to elicit a gasp at a twist in the tale?

We all have our own preferences, and not wanting to know an outcome is as fair a desire as any. But in the entertainment content economy, that desire dominates, stifling conversation and relegating discussion to walled-off corners marked with big red hazard signs. Perhaps those who are anti-spoilers, rather than imposing their stringent needs on everyone else, can take responsibility for themselves.

There are plenty of things [you can do](&lt;|url|&gt;) to hide spoilers from your timelines, but if you do happen to come across one, don’t panic. You might end up loving *Avengers: Endgame* even more.<|endoftext|>

# Landlord 2.0&#58; Tech’s New Rentier Capitalism

## By selling us hardware but retaining ownership of software and data, tech companies are treating users like digital tenants

When Tim Cook and his fellow executives hit the stage for Apple’s event on March 25, it was to announce a major strategic pivot. The company knows that its markets for iPhones, iPads, and Macs are [stagnating](&lt;|url|&gt;), a trend unlikely to change anytime soon. That means Apple needs to sell its customers something else.

“Apple’s reinvention as a services company starts for real,” declared [*Bloomberg](&lt;|url|&gt;)* after Apple announced a series of new services that will demand subscriptions: Apple TV+ to stream movies and TV shows, Apple News+ to aggregate news publications, Apple Arcade to play games, and an Apple Card to pay for it all. With Apple’s gigantic, built-in user base, financial analysts [estimate](&lt;|url|&gt;) the company could reach 100 million subscriptions in just a few years, creating “a $7 billion to $10 billion annual revenue stream over time.”

Apple is doing more than just responding to competitive pressures — it is following the shift in how technology is being used to change notions of property ownership and profit accumulation. Facebook, Uber, and Netflix build platforms and provide services, inserting themselves into social relationships, economic transactions, and personal consumption. They mediate the everyday activities of our lives and collect valuable data about our behaviors and interests. And, crucially, they charge for access — not for ownership, which increasingly seems outdated.
> # What these companies are doing is actually revitalizing of an old form of rentier capitalism that we tend to associate with landlords and feudalism.

Rather than representing some disruptive new “subscription” paradigm, however, what all these companies are doing — including Apple — is revitalizing of an old form of rentier capitalism that we long associated with landlords and feudalism.

Whether we call it [platform capitalism](&lt;|url|&gt;), [surveillance capitalism](&lt;|url|&gt;), or just next-gen rentier capitalism, this model for how capital operates uses mediation and enclosure to achieve [extraction](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [control](&lt;|url|&gt;) over its subjects. “Rentier” refers to a relationship where an asset owner charges others to access that asset, just as a landlord charges tenants to rent a home the landlord owns.

It’s difficult to understate the extent to which this rentier model is now being applied to the consumer world. Recent years have seen a [surge of businesses](&lt;|url|&gt;) that describe themselves as “Uber for X” or “X as a service,” such as WeWork [offering](&lt;|url|&gt;) “space as a service” or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk [offering](&lt;|url|&gt;) “humans as a service.” Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are on the lookout for opportunities to capture value — dollars and data — by controlling assets and then charging users for access to those assets, whether it’s office space, music, or games.

In addition to consumer services, many governments, businesses, universities, and other organizations now rent core services, such as software and storage, from platforms. These software-as-a-service operations now take place within the ecosystem of private platforms, which supplies those platforms with a continual source of revenue, while also solidifying their critical position in the economy and society.

While examples like Uber and Airbnb are fairly obvious, through widespread application of the X-as-a-service model, platforms have also been able to expand rentier relations in ways that *enclose* everyday things. The key technology of enclosure is the software license, which allows the new rentiers to claim ownership over the software embedded in and data emanating from increasingly more physical things that we use in our daily lives.

Thanks to the internet of things, many mundane and formerly analog objects, like coffee makers and toothbrushes, are now equipped with software, sensors, and network connections. What used to be an upgraded “smart” version is becoming the default way that products are designed and sold. The software becomes integral to the thing’s function, the sensors collect data about how the thing is used, and the Wi-Fi connects the thing to a company’s platform so data can be downloaded and uploaded.
> # Whether we are streaming content or licensing software, we are paying for the privilege of slowly ceding control of private property to corporate gatekeepers.

And, critically, when you buy a smart device, you own only the physical object. The digital software is “licensed,” which is just another word for “rented,” and the constant stream of data we produce by using the thing constitutes part of the “rent” we pay to the company. By integrating what were once ordinary objects into the internet of things, companies are able to enact a form of micro-enclosure in which they retain ownership over the digital part of a physical thing — and the right to access, control, and shut off the software — even after you purchase it. Whether we are streaming content or licensing software, we are paying for the privilege of slowly ceding control of private property to corporate gatekeepers.

It’s one thing for digital controls to restrict how you can use a [smart cat litter box](&lt;|url|&gt;), but it seems another thing to spend $30,000 buying a car, or even $100,000 [on a tractor](&lt;|url|&gt;), if all you own is a big hunk of metal and rubber while only renting the software needed to actually operate the vehicle. While contracts like terms of services grew out of software and websites, they are now used as a way to smuggle ownership claims into parts of things that are otherwise owned by somebody else.

The Twitter account [Internet of Shit](&lt;|url|&gt;) is filled with examples of fridges, doorbells, and lawn mowers that require internet connections and regular software updates just to function, always tethered to a corporate overlord and awaiting further instructions. As Kashmir Hill of *Gizmodo* [reported](&lt;|url|&gt;), all the devices in her fully connected smart home were in daily contact with their manufacturers, constantly sending them data and pinging for updates. “When you buy a smart device,” Hill concluded, “it doesn’t just belong to you; you share custody with the company that made it.”

As a technology of enclosure, the software license has been successful at, widely and secretly, enacting a mass transfer of rights from “users” to “owners.” It’s as if you bought a home, but unbeknownst to you, the previous landlord continued to own the kitchen, and you didn’t find out until they repossessed your kitchen for trying to do repairs or remodel without their permission. Oh, and they have also been spying on how you’ve been using the kitchen this whole time. Consider the [rise of smart homes](&lt;|url|&gt;) and this analogy doesn’t look so far-fetched.

Platform companies think of themselves as service providers, not as digital landlords extracting rent from their plot of cyberspace or their software enclave. But they are, nonetheless, creating rentier relations by another name.

We should situate these new developments in a long history of practices used to claim property, control rights, capture value, and compound inequality. Geographer Alistair Fraser coined the phrase “[data grab](&lt;|url|&gt;)” to show how these contemporary dynamics of enclosure follow in the footsteps of more violent processes like “land grabs,” where a people’s land is physically taken from them. The version of rentier capitalism we see emerging now is adapting in response to the digital age, but it still maintains the same essential features of extraction and control. Instead of building fences and demanding rent for access to landed property, these rentiers install software and capture value from the use of digital platforms and physical things.

The companies accumulating vast wealth through platform businesses are also telling us that ownership is an old-fashioned idea, while deploying the seductive language of “sharing” and “convenience.” But they don’t mention the contingent access and lack of rights — or the death by a thousand subscriptions and charges — that come along with renting the things you use every day. Nobody would look at the dynamic between landlords and tenants and say, “Yep, I’m happy to apply that to my entire life.” Yet that is what’s happening when we accept, or don’t resist, the expansion of extraction-as-a-service.

If this movement of Landlords 2.0 had a motto, it would be this: Why limit rent collection to real estate when there is a whole world out there waiting to capture rent from, online and off?<|endoftext|>

# Google Just Showed Us the Future of Gaming

## Data centers could make individual game consoles obsolete

![Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty*

On Tuesday at GDC 2019, Google announced Stadia, a new game-streaming service that will let you play AAA video games — the industry’s blockbusters — on almost every device you own, including your laptop, phone, TV, or even a Chromecast. If it works as advertised — a big “if” — it could end the gaming hardware market as we know it.

With Stadia, which is slated to launch later this year, Google is aiming for nothing less than entirely detaching video games from the hardware you own. Instead of downloading a game to your computer or putting a disc in your console, the game would be installed on a remote server that Google owns and operates.

You won’t have to buy a new console or build a new PC to run the latest generation of games. Instead, Google can upgrade Stadia servers entirely behind the scenes. You’ll just wake up one day and find that you can play games with better graphics. This presumably means high-end gaming is about to get a lot cheaper — a top-of-the-line PlayStation 4 Pro costs about $400 — though Google declined to share pricing details with *OneZero*.

We don’t tend to think about it too much, but video games have an unusually intimate connection with the hardware they run on. Every few years, Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and PC hardware manufacturers release new devices that add more power and features to the games you play. Microsoft made 4K gaming possible with the [Xbox One X](&lt;|url|&gt;), NVIDIA [launched graphics cards capable of ray tracing](&lt;|url|&gt;), and Nintendo had [that weird expansion pack](&lt;|url|&gt;) that made *Donkey Kong 64* not crash. For as long as they’ve existed, video games and their hardware have been intrinsically linked. Think *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*, for instance, and you’ll picture the Nintendo 64 it ran on.

But while this relationship is widely accepted in gaming, the same isn’t true for most other kinds of software. A professional video editor might need a better machine to squeeze more out of Adobe Premiere, but no one has to upgrade their phone every couple years to use Gmail or buy a new laptop to run the latest version of Microsoft Word.

![Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty*

This kind of cloud gaming service has been tried many times before, from [the failed OnLive](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [PlayStation Now](&lt;|url|&gt;) and to the still-in-beta [NVIDIA GeForce Now](&lt;|url|&gt;). But two key factors set Google’s attempt apart. First, you may already own a device capable of running Stadia. GeForce Now is the closest to this platform-agnostic dream, with support for both Mac and Windows computers, but Stadia goes a step further by including Chromebooks, phones, and even the modest Chromecast streaming device. If you have a gadget capable of running YouTube, Google says you can play the newest high-end games using Stadia.

Second, the servers these games will run on are owned by Google. And Google is [very good at building servers](&lt;|url|&gt;). Video games, especially the visually rich AAA games that most modern consoles can play, are among the most resource-hungry applications any computer can run. For an individual player, keeping up with the pace of hardware innovation can be a Sisyphean task — and an obscenely expensive one at that. For Google, upgrading massive systems with the latest hardware is done routinely.

![](<|image|>)

Consider the current gold standard of gaming: 4K resolution, running at 60 frames per second. If you have a 4K TV today, you have a few options available to play games that can get the most out of it. You can buy an [Xbox One X](&lt;|url|&gt;) or a [PlayStation 4 Pro](&lt;|url|&gt;), or you could build a PC capable of playing 4K games.

According to Google, Stadia will launch with support for playing games at 4K HDR at 60 fps right off the bat. For a new service launching in 2019, perhaps that’s to be expected. However, the company went a step further, announcing that it would scale up to 8K and 120 fps in the future. The company didn’t give a timeline for when this would happen, but since [the first consumer-level 8K TVs](&lt;|url|&gt;) were only just announced this year, few consumers are likely to be in any rush.

This approach also removes the roadblock for more subtle innovations. For example, [NVIDIA’s new ray-tracing graphics cards](&lt;|url|&gt;) simulate the way light works in the real world, creating instant shadows and realistic reflections and simplifying a lot of the work game developers have to do to make a game look good. The [benefit is so immediately obvious](&lt;|url|&gt;) that it [spawned its own meme](&lt;|url|&gt;).

But ray tracing presents a problem for game developers: It only works on NVIDIA graphics cards that support the feature. The company is [expanding the list of supported cards](&lt;|url|&gt;), but that still leaves a potential audience that’s limited to a subset of PC gamers who have a small selection of relatively high-end graphics cards. With such a minuscule audience, few outside of the biggest studios will invest resources into developing games for it. It’s just not worth it yet.

Were that technology to be incorporated into Stadia servers, however, the potential audience would be massive. Instead of waiting for consumers to slowly migrate to new hardware, bigger and better games can be shipped as soon as Google’s data servers are upgraded. Companies like NVIDIA would also be more likely to sell their new high-end hardware directly to Google, rather than trying to incrementally sell $600-plus cards to average consumers.

There are still a lot of potential stumbling blocks for Stadia. The biggest bottleneck is [home internet speeds](&lt;|url|&gt;), which, in the United States, [have not always had the bandwidth](&lt;|url|&gt;) to support something as intense as 4K game streaming. There’s also the price: $20 a month for access to a library of games — as is the case [for PlayStation Now](&lt;|url|&gt;) — might be reasonable, but if the company makes users pay separately for additional features like 4K streaming or ray tracing, it might end up a wash compared to just buying a console.

What’s not in question is the earth-shattering effect Stadia will have on gaming hardware in the home if the service works as advertised. To use a soon-to-be-timely pop culture analogy, the industry has resembled the endlessly turning wheel of power in Westeros that Daenerys Targaryen describes in *Games of Thrones*: Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, NVIDIA, each taking their turn on top with successive and expensive upgrades. Consumers have accepted the need to buy new consoles or graphics cards every few years, because there has been no other way to play the latest games. In a world where you can play the newest *Tomb Raider* in perfect 4K HDR on something as simple as a Chromecast, however, the endlessly turning wheel of hardware upgrades won’t just stop—it will break altogether.<|endoftext|>

# Should Athletes Be Allowed to Enhance Their Genes?

## So-called gene doping is banned in sports, but some philosophers argue that it’s the way of the future

![Illustration by [Daniel Zender](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration by [Daniel Zender](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Scientists first developed gene therapy techniques in the 1990s, exploring ways to treat disease by modifying malfunctioning cells. In 1997, a team at John Hopkins University edited genes** **to create what the media called “[Schwarzenegger mice](&lt;|url|&gt;),” which had twice the normal amount of muscle.

The researchers’ goal was to develop treatments for muscle-wasting conditions, including old age, but the same [technique](&lt;|url|&gt;) could theoretically be used to add muscle bulk to athletes, a concept called gene doping. Doctors could, theoretically, inject cells with enhanced genes into the relevant body part or use a benign virus to deliver modified cells. These superhumans could be the elite athletes of the future — athletes who perform faster, higher, and stronger than any “natural” human ever could.
> # Given the drive for perfection that governs elite sports, is enhancing performance all but inevitable?

There’s no evidence that anyone has tried this procedure — which has never been tested — but in 2003, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) proactively banned gene doping. The ban [includes](&lt;|url|&gt;) any use of polymers of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) or analogues, gene-editing agents designed to alter genome sequences or gene expressions, and normal or genetically modified cells. Like other drugs and methodologies [banned by WADA](&lt;|url|&gt;), these techniques are prohibited because they have the potential to enhance performance, could represent a potential health risk to the athlete from an unproven technology, and violate the “spirit of sport.”

But is it right to dismiss gene doping in sports so quickly? What if gene-doping techniques were intrinsically different — and safer — compared to other doping techniques? And given the drive for perfection that governs elite sports, is enhancing performance all but inevitable?

In a new paper entitled “[Enhancing Evolution: The Transhuman Case for Gene Doping](&lt;|url|&gt;),” British bioethicist [Andy Miah](&lt;|url|&gt;) explores the question from a philosophical perspective, rather than a legal one. The first fallacy is WADA’s attempt to protect the “spirit of sport,” defined as values like ethics, fair play, excellence in performance, and health. “One could envisage a system of pro-doping which preserves fair play — even enhances it,” says Miah, currently the chair in science communication and future media at the University of Salford in Manchester. “Thus, the sports world may just allow all athletes to use whatever enhancements they wish, or even just the ones currently prohibited by WADA.”

A pro-doping system would actually encourage “excellence in performance,” because it would help athletes reach levels never before seen in competition. Even the idea that “clean” sports are good for athletes’ health isn’t necessarily the case. “At an elite level,” Miah writes, “so many players are injured either through incident or over-training/competing… [E]ven the IOC [International Olympic Committee] [recognized](&lt;|url|&gt;) that there is a greater prevalence of some health risks resulting from elite sports participation.”

The way anti-doping agencies conceive of health care also plays an important role. Their perspective is that of the traditional medical industry, which believes medical interventions are justified only if a person suffers from an illness, injury, or disease. Legitimate medical treatment can only be a necessity, not a choice.

An alternative is to view athletes through the lens of [transhumanism](&lt;|url|&gt;), a philosophical movement that regards the development of technology not as something that should be separate from nature, but as a process interwoven with our own biological evolution as a species. Sports are just another area in which humans can use technology to transcend their limitations. Gene-editing techniques would become one of the “natural” technological and biological tools our species uses to adapt and evolve — no different, in a way, than the modern training equipment athletes now employ. “Humanity’s desire to evolve or transcend its biological limits — typified by the pursuit of elite sports — provides a foundation for pursuing radical biological interventions, such as gene doping,” Miah writes.

He argues that gene therapies could eventually be safer than the pharmaceuticals many athletes use, legally and illegally. “At the moment, we rely heavily on synthetic products and substances and things that are less likely to be consistent within our own individual physiology,” Miah says. “Genetics offers the possibility of allowing us to both repair but also enhance by using elements that are already within our bodies.”

Miah’s position has its critics, including among scientists who are actually doing work on gene therapy. [Lee Sweeney](&lt;|url|&gt;), director of the Myology Institute at the University of Florida, was one of the scientists who developed the “Schwarzenegger mice.” He draws the line at the use of gene editing for performance enhancement.

“My interest is using the techniques to combat disease and improve the quality of life of people, especially as they get old,” Sweeney says. “I am not against using the same approaches that are used to treat disease for gene doping in sports per se. I am against using an emerging and uncertain technology that could have long-term unwanted side effects—and even short-term negative consequences—in otherwise healthy people before that technology is proven safe.”

There is little substantial research into the safety of gene doping, but two [studies](&lt;|url|&gt;) published in [*Nature](&lt;|url|&gt;)* last year found that gene editing may weaken a person’s ability to fight off tumors. Others have expressed more profound concerns: Academics and religious leaders have called gene editing “[a new name for eugenics](&lt;|url|&gt;)” and a contravention of the Hippocratic oath, which requires that doctors first do no harm. Miah’s approach, they argue, could revitalize some of the dark eugenics projects of the [20th century](&lt;|url|&gt;), in which [researchers in the United States](&lt;|url|&gt;) as well as Nazi Germany identified a selection of specific human traits that could be cultivated to supposedly improve the human species.
> # Perhaps battling our imperfections — and achieving sporting excellence despite them — is part of the challenge of being human.

[Marcy Darnovsky](&lt;|url|&gt;), director of the Berkeley, California–based nonprofit [Center for Genetics and Society](&lt;|url|&gt;), says she supports gene editing for medically justified treatments “as long as it can be shown to be safe and effective.” But as gene editing becomes more widespread, it could lead to not just enhanced athletes, but athletes who could be designed from birth to be fully optimized.

Darnovsky warns against the use of gene-editing techniques on [embryos, eggs, or sperm](&lt;|url|&gt;) and says that enhanced humans could be disastrous for a society where inequality is already on the rise. “There is a serious risk that heritable genetic modification would be widely taken up by those who could afford the cost, that their ‘upgraded’ offspring would be treated as if they were biologically superior to other children,” she told me. “The ensuing dynamics would exacerbate inequality and discrimination, fracture society, and increase the prevalence of admittedly eugenic concepts and practices.”

Sweeney says that modifying the genes of individuals who cannot consent — like unborn children — will be greatly debated. “Of course, if it is a life-threatening or debilitating genetic disease, there is no debate,” Sweeney says. “But once this door is open, as it now is, it becomes a debate as to where the line is drawn as to what is disease — or at least genetic handicaps — and what are enhancements that we should not attempt to alter for someone who has no say in the matter.”

A more philosophical critique holds that human evolution is always vulnerable, with the flourishing of the species limited by external factors — and that’s a good thing. From this perspective, held by philosophers like [Martha Nussbaum](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Erik Parens](&lt;|url|&gt;), the fragility of the human condition is crucial and central to what it is to be human, rather than something we should disregard in a quest to transcend our biological limits. Perhaps battling our imperfections—and achieving sporting excellence despite them—is part of the challenge of being human.

Finally, there is the question of whether the values of elite sports really do encourage gene doping. Pierre de Coubertin proposed the Olympic motto “*citius, altius, fortius*” (“faster, higher, stronger”) in 1894, when the French baron dreamed of bringing the ancient Olympic Games back to life. While the motto’s simplicity captures the aspirations of the Olympics, perhaps even de Coubertin underestimated humanity’s desire to transcend its own physical limitations.<|endoftext|>

# This Is Why Uber Drivers Play Such Bad Music

## It’s all about embracing the musical safe space — and keeping that rating high

![Illustration: [Rebekka Dunlap](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Rebekka Dunlap](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

In May, Uber driver Adam (a pseudonym to protect against any backlash) received a message from the ride-hailing company: “Playing music is a great way to enhance a rider’s trip, but it’s helpful to remember that everyone has different tastes.” The note was an automated response to a passenger report — someone had complained about his EDM tunes and rated him with one star.

Adam was pissed. He’d made 4,000 trips over the last two years, often spending eight or nine hours a day in his car; doesn’t that give him the right to play what he likes?

Well, yes and no. Obviously Adam, like other Uber drivers, is in control of what he plays, but where he lacks autonomy is in how people rate him. Low ratings can be a death toll for drivers — fall below an arbitrary number ([4.6 stars and below](&lt;|url|&gt;)) and their account can be suspended. To reactivate after this happens, drivers are reportedly forced to[ pay](&lt;|url|&gt;) $60 for an Uber [sensitivity course](&lt;|url|&gt;). They also need to keep their ratings high to achieve or maintain Uber driver “diamond status,” which allows them to get paid [up to 6% more per drive](&lt;|url|&gt;) — Uber’s way of incentivizing drivers. To achieve diamond status, drivers must [hit certain benchmarks](&lt;|url|&gt;), like a cancellation rate that stays under 4%.

Music taste is subjective of course, but Adam fell foul of one of the tenets followed by established drivers: When in doubt, go for top 40 or classic rock. Adam didn’t think it was fair that he had to change, but he switched stations. Sure enough, his rating soon went up.

That doesn’t surprise New York musicologist [Jacob A. Cohen](&lt;|url|&gt;), who says that music enjoyment has been proven to affect customer satisfaction. Most research doesn’t focus on ridesharing in particular, but it stands to reason that satisfied riders would rate their drivers higher. So what’s the magical music formula? For the widest appeal, Cohen suggests, choose stable rhythms and stay away from loud or harsh vocals.

Some riders share their feedback immediately. In a private ridesharing group on Facebook, Uber driver Rachel says one passenger told her to play “normal music.” Another driver reports a Scrooge hating on his Christmas tunes. A number of drivers follow unspoken, almost instinctual rules to avoid rating drops: no rap at 10 a.m., no FOX News in San Francisco.

Others have go-to stations or playlists for work. Driver Graham likes [Pop Rocks](&lt;|url|&gt;) on SiriusXM, saying it’s “easy listening for the brain and plays everyone’s favorites from high school.” Driver Eileen prefers the chill beats of SiriusXM’s Spa station. “I get comments that [passengers] love it,” she says. Driver Rick is more cautious: “I play just this side of elevator music so as not to offend,” he says. Others say they lower the volume based on how old the rider is.
> # Some opt for a more personalized playlist depending on who gets in. It’s a risky strategy, but one with great payoff potential.

Many drivers also stay away from jazz and classical music, saying riders don’t appreciate it. “Jazz often has associations with elitism and musical intelligence,” says Cohen. “It’s a matter of familiarity with the music.” That’s why so many opt for the top 40; it’s a musical safe space, no matter how insipid.

Not all drivers agree with this approach. Driver Terry plays whatever he feels like and maintains a 4.9 star rating. “Passengers care about the car being clean more than anything else,” he says.

Some opt for a more personalized playlist depending on who gets in. It’s a risky strategy, but one with great payoff potential. Sacramento driver Ahmad changes the station based on age; passengers over 40 get 98.1 FM (soft rock and pop), whereas millennials will hear top 40 tunes from 99.7 FM. Driver James adapts based on time of day; hip-hop on Friday nights, classic rock during work hours.

“Listening to music with a stranger in a car is a really intimate setting,” says Peter Su, a Los Angeles based [songwriter](&lt;|url|&gt;)/Uber driver. He asks passengers if they have a preference before each ride. “Most say no,” he says, “but they appreciate the consideration.” Then he selects songs based on who’s in the car: indie-seeming types will get Wet, whereas funkier folk get Vulfpeck. “It’s dangerous,” says Cohen about a driver selecting music based on their perceptions of their passengers. “It can be its own form of stereotyping. It could be really offensive.” But drivers who get it right say they get higher tips and ratings.

What can a driver do to play it safe? There’s no such thing as universally enjoyable music, Cohen says, but there are tools that can help. Spotify and Pandora’s algorithms can be used to identify well-liked songs, which are safer options. “It doesn’t mean people like it, but it’s the least offensive,” he explains.

Meanwhile, drivers don’t just need to worry about ratings, because tips must also be considered. The Economic Policy Institute reported last month that Uber drivers earn [$9.21](&lt;|url|&gt;) an hour after expenses (ridesharing blog [Ridester’s](&lt;|url|&gt;) survey placed this at a more generous [$13.70](&lt;|url|&gt;)) — hence the growing number of [strikes](&lt;|url|&gt;) and protests. Tips supplement this pay, and many drivers try to create the most advantageous environments possible for this, offering bottled water, USB chargers, and even snacks. The right selection of music also factors in.

[A 2018 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the *Psychology of Music *journal found that those aged 65 and older gave bigger tips in restaurants that played either uplifting or melancholic background music, compared to “baseline” background music that inspired neither emotion. Upbeat songs like Queen’s *Don’t Stop Me Now* resulted in a 52% increase in tips.

There’s also something called the “prosocial effect,” which describes the way people respond to calls for good. [A 2010 report](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the *International Journal of Hospitality Management* noted that French restaurants that played songs with “prosocial” lyrics (an example would be John Lennon’s *Imagine*) increased waiters’ tips by 8%.

Having control can also factor in. Cohen says that letting passengers play their own music — many drivers offer AUX cords, while others take advantage of [Uber’s Spotify and Pandora features ](&lt;|url|&gt;)— could be a good ROI; you’ll likely rate them higher as they let you take “ownership of the musical experience,” he says.

To be sure, there are a zillion things that can influence tipping — the amount of [sunlight](&lt;|url|&gt;), [a driver’s race](&lt;|url|&gt;), and even their hair color. Only 35% of ridesharing users tip every time, with Gen Xers more likely to tip than millennials, according to a [survey by autosales startup InstaMotor.](&lt;|url|&gt;) Millennials are supposedly 12% more likely to tip if drivers provide free water or snacks.

Uber did not respond to my question about recommended music for drivers, but they did direct me to their [community](&lt;|url|&gt;) guidelines which state that low-rated riders can lose access to the app. “Respect is a two-way street, and so is accountability,” says Uber. To keep your rating high, “it’s helpful to be courteous and respectful to all people.”

Driver Brett likes to roll the dice. He intentionally plays political shows. “I educate [passengers] on issues of human rights and social justice,” he says. In four years, he’s had one complaint, and has a 4.96 rating. “Sometimes they ask what they’re listening to [and] thank me for sharing.”

Cohen isn’t surprised. “There are no absolutes in what people like,” he says. “Taste is part of a social construction, and the different things people have been exposed to.”<|endoftext|>

# Microsoft Nails ‘Mixed Reality’ With the HoloLens 2

## Microsoft Nails ‘Mixed Reality’ With the HoloLens 2

### It’s still not for consumers, but you may want one anyway

![](<|image|>)

The factory before me was nondescript, a cliche of bygone industry. I stepped closer. Soon, I was towering over it, like the folklorish Paul Bunyan. Reaching for the building, my hands penetrated its slightly translucent facade. I reflexively clenched my fists and started twisting my arms, causing the entire factory to turn on its axis. I lifted it to eye level and pulled it closer to my face, imagining the tiny workers terrified and clambering for the exits.

And then I turned my gaze to the tropical island floating over my shoulder.

None of these things were real, of course: just virtual reality streamed to my eyes through Microsoft’s new HoloLens 2 headset.

Introduced to the world more than three years ago. HoloLens is a self-contained, wearable Windows 10 computer that provides the user with an augmented or “mixed reality” experience. Though HoloLens has so far lived in the world of business, enterprise, and health care (where it’s used, for instance, to help [visualize a patient’s MRI results](&lt;|url|&gt;) right on top of his body), it has danced around the edges of consumer imagination. My most memorable experiences with [the original Development Edition](&lt;|url|&gt;) revolved around an interactive AR game where I battled alien machines crawling through the windows and walls of an upscale hotel room.

![The redesigned HoloLens 2](<|image|>)*The redesigned HoloLens 2*

With HoloLens 2, Microsoft has continued focusing on enterprise, marrying AR with its cloud services through [Azure Spatial Anchors](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Azure Remote Rendering](&lt;|url|&gt;). HoloLens 2 may look sci-fi, but it’s about getting things done at work. To help that aim, Microsoft addressed a number of pain points from the original headset, radically altering the wear and fit, replacing critical components, vastly expanding the viewport, and fundamentally simplifying user interaction.

These are many of the details Microsoft shared when it [unveiled HoloLens 2](&lt;|url|&gt;) at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this February. But the full extent of what Microsoft’s accomplished wasn’t clear to me until last week, when I took the new headset for a brief yet fruitful test drive.

## **Goodbye “halo”**

The original HoloLens put a fair amount of the technology in the front, which, if you didn’t adjust it correctly, would rest on the bridge of your nose. To lighten the load on the user’s face, Microsoft replaced some of the plastic elements on the front of the still mostly black and gray HoloLens 2 with carbon fiber. It’s now 1.24 pounds rather than 1.27 pounds. That difference may not sound like much, but it feels more pronounced because Microsoft radically redesigned the device body. Gone are the two separate “halos”: an inner one that hugged your cranium and the outer one that housed most of the key components. HoloLens 2 offers a single, unbroken headband with a low-profile adjustment knob on the back.

![Microsoft redistributed the weight on HoloLens 2, moving more of it to the back.](<|image|>)*Microsoft redistributed the weight on HoloLens 2, moving more of it to the back.*

Microsoft also smartly shifted the components and battery for improved weight distribution. The result is a noticeably more comfortable device.

![This is how you adjust the HoloLens 2 fit (not my head). Image: Microsoft](<|image|>)*This is how you adjust the HoloLens 2 fit (not my head). Image: Microsoft*

I placed HoloLens 2 over my glasses and reached behind my head to turn the knob and tighten the ring. Inside, fabric-covered foam rested comfortably against the back of my head and my forehead. In front of my eyes was the still-familiar though now more transparent HoloLens visor. It only took a few moments for me to find the sweet spot of pressure, comfort, and viewport visibility — a considerable improvement over the original headset.

![The visor is clearer, making it easier to see those stereo screens.](<|image|>)*The visor is clearer, making it easier to see those stereo screens.*

While I did not get to unbox the device, I did notice how quickly we progressed through startup and calibration. Microsoft replaced the original HoloLens x86 CPU with a 64-bit ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon 850. Company representatives assured me that existing 32-bit apps would still work with HoloLens 2.

## **See you, see me**

Calibration is a critical part of ensuring a good HoloLens 2 experience. Unlike the original headset, which tracked head position to intuit your gaze, HoloLens 2 uses eye-tracking technology. This means you no longer have to go through an [inter-pupillary distance](&lt;|url|&gt;) measurement routine that involved closing one eye, looking at your finger, and then doing the same with the other eye. This measurement ensured a decent 3D experience but had nothing to do with eye-tracking.

![The view from inside](<|image|>)*The view from inside*

The translucent HoloLens 2 screen resolved into a blue box warning me that calibration was about to begin. I was told to focus, without moving my head, on each of nine red dots as they appeared on the virtual screen floating a few feet in front of my face. This took a few seconds. After the system told me calibration was complete, I noticed that a white outline appeared around each red dot as I looked at it: HoloLens 2 was really tracking my eyeballs.

The other thing I immediately noticed was the size of that virtual screen. Microsoft told me that it’s not only twice as large as that of the original headset but has a different and perhaps more useful 3:2 aspect ratio. (The old one was 16:9). The screen resize offers significantly more vertical view space than before. What hasn’t changed, though, is the resolution: It’s still 47 pixels per degree, but owing to the larger field of view, there are now 5 million points of light.

![Top view of HoloLens 2 makes it clear that there’s just one ring.](<|image|>)*Top view of HoloLens 2 makes it clear that there’s just one ring.*

The larger viewpoint means I could simply shift my gaze to see objects in the mixed reality space — where virtual objects blend with the real world. No need to turn my head around.

Like the first HoloLens, HoloLens 2 is just as aware of your physical environment as you are. It uses a powerful time-of-flight sensor (the same one that’s inside the new [Azure Kinect DK](&lt;|url|&gt;)) to “see” the floor, walls, and furniture in 3D. As a result, when I first saw my tiny factory, it was resting on a hutch in the real world.

## **A hand in it**

Those sensors, however, add a crucial new level of interactivity, one that makes the HoloLens 2 fundamentally more useful than most AR hardware that’s come before it.

HoloLens 1 could recognize simple gestures, like a finger bend or a pinch. These moves were so specific that I often forgot how to use them and was grateful for the included Bluetooth-based controller. HoloLens 2 needs no such a controller, though it continues to support Bluetooth peripherals. The sensors can recognize both hands and the position of all your fingers in real time.

![Reaching out, touching, and manipulating the virtual objects in front of me just made sense.](<|image|>)*Reaching out, touching, and manipulating the virtual objects in front of me just made sense.*

When I grabbed that building, I did so without thinking about or being told how to interact with it. I just “gripped” the virtual structure with both hands and turned. Microsoft did explain to me that when a three-dimensional bounding box appeared around objects like the factory or a floating island, I could grab a corner with two fingers and pull to enlarge or shrink the AR object. This was also incredibly easy.

![No remotes, no problem. HoloLens 2 captures all the movements of both hands. Image: Microsoft](<|image|>)*No remotes, no problem. HoloLens 2 captures all the movements of both hands. Image: Microsoft*

HoloLens 2 will also do a better job of capturing your mixed reality. It’s now fitted with an 8-megapixel, 1080p-capable, auto-focus camera. HoloLens 1 got by with a measly 3.2-megapixel fixed-focus camera.

## **Hear me now**

After playing with the factory and moving around Microsoft’s floating island, I was directed to another wall where I found a crystal floating. I said “pop,” and the crystal exploded.

Microsoft explained that HoloLens 2 has a five-microphone array (HoloLens 1 had four), including two in the visor. The idea is that those working in harsh or noise-filled work environments won’t need to shout to be heard. Microsoft claims that I could say “pop” in a 90-decibel workspace (which is in the range of a motorcycle or a landing Boeing 737), and HoloLens 2 would still register my voice.

At another point, five crystals appeared before me. I was coached to look at each one without moving my head. As I did, each crystal spun. I then looked at one and said, “pop.” It popped, as did the others when I looked at them and spoke. Overall, HoloLens 2’s hearing capabilities are vastly improved over the original HoloLens, on which Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana often struggled to understand what I was saying.

![I could grab the corner of a bounding box to make virtual objects larger.](<|image|>)*I could grab the corner of a bounding box to make virtual objects larger.*

Finally, a larger crystal floated before me and, as I moved my hand toward it, a button appeared. I pressed the virtual button and the crystal shattered, transforming into an iridescent, blue hummingbird. I held my palm up and the bird fluttered over it. As I moved my hand around, the bird followed. It stopped when I closed my palm and moved my hand away.

![This is a pretty accurate representation of how the hummingbird appeared to me. Image: Microsoft](<|image|>)*This is a pretty accurate representation of how the hummingbird appeared to me. Image: Microsoft*

There was, to the left of the bird, a window of text floating in space. It described the hummingbird. I read the text and, as I reached the bottom, it automatically scrolled up to reveal more. Years ago, Samsung tried to introduce similar gaze-tracking-based reading on its [Galaxy S7 devices](&lt;|url|&gt;). It did not work nearly as well.

After wearing the headgear for roughly 15 minutes, Microsoft showed me how I could easily flip up the visor — another new feature — to see the real world. It’s a simple but canny update, one that should make the headgear more attractive in work environments where workers wouldn’t want to take off the headset (or [integrated hard hat](&lt;|url|&gt;)).

I was a little concerned that when I flipped the visor back down that it did not seem to snap back to the exact same position I had it in before, but Microsoft assured me that the gaze tracking would recognize me and my eyes with Windows Hello biometric authentication and plop me right back where I left off in the augmented world.

Microsoft wouldn’t specify battery life — an important consideration on the job site — but did tell me that it would be on par with the HoloLens 1, which was around two and a half hours.

## **Wrap-up**

I can’t recall a more intuitive and immersive augmented reality experience. Yes, I’ve held up my iPhone or iPad and gazed at richer AR imagery, but in those cases, I can’t put the screen down and reach out to engage with that virtual imagery in a natural manner.

![This guy’s using the Azure Guides to walk him through motorcycle repair. With the gaze control he won’t have to do anything special to continue reading the instructions. Image: Microsoft](<|image|>)*This guy’s using the Azure Guides to walk him through motorcycle repair. With the gaze control he won’t have to do anything special to continue reading the instructions. Image: Microsoft*

HoloLens 2 is technology made obvious, and I can easily envision wearing a hardhat fitted with HoloLens 2 on a job site. Perhaps you engage it when it’s time to work on installing a critical portion of the HVAC system or even to fix a motorcycle you’ve never seen before. HoloLens 2 would have Azure Guides — augmented reality instructions that live in the cloud and download in realtime to guide you as you work on real-world projects — which might download instructions from your soon-to-be-retired HVAC foreman. It would recognize the system and know exactly where you’re pointing or what part of the HVAC system you’re touching so it can offer corrective guidance.

There are some hints that a system like Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 could someday make it to consumers (it contains support for the Epic Games Unreal Engine, for one thing), but at $3,500, HoloLens 2 is clearly positioned for business. All I can say is that I’ve never been so envious of construction work.

# Smartphone Privacy Is Under Threat at the Border

## Invasive searches of devices and computers are becoming more common for border crossers, but they’re being challenged in court

![Photo: Roman Stavila/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Roman Stavila/Getty Images*

Picture this: You’re driving up from Tijuana to San Diego, and as you cross the U.S. border, agents stop you and demand to see your iPhone. With no explanation, and no warrant, they can thumb through your phone, or simply take it and extract all the data they want — every embarrassing text, private photos, even deleted files. And this happens more often than you think.

Over the past few years, with little fanfare, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers have rapidly ramped up the number of digital searches they carry out, using powerful tools to copy personal data from people’s smartphones, tablets, and laptops as they cross the border. More than a million people cross the border or arrive by airport every day in the U.S., with around 100,000 passing daily by foot, car, and bus through the Tijuana-San Diego port of entry alone. A not insignificant number of these people — now thousands annually — are being subjected to invasive searches of their devices.

“The government’s national security powers are strongest at the border,” says Catherine Crump, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley law school and director of the Samuelson Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic. “But this just gives the government an incredible opportunity, a situation ripe for abuse. The government has untrammeled access to people’s most sensitive information.”

In the past, someone crossing the border might deal with a routine search of their jacket or trunk, while for something more than routine, like a full-body cavity search, border agents would need to get a warrant. Now government searches of people’s devices could be on their way to becoming routine. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) are challenging this practice in a court case, which will likely be decided this summer.

The Fourth Amendment guarantees the rights of people against unreasonable searches and seizures, but national security concerns trump privacy rights at the border, and CBP and ICE have arguably taken advantage of that. They’re doing lots of manual searches of people’s phones — looking around the apps, messaging services, social media, and using the built-in search function on the phone to find specific documents or photos. Less common “advanced” searches, as they’re called, involve forensic tools or equipment that can download massive troves of a device’s data onto a drive or database, where it can be retrieved and sifted through later.

If you’re at the border in your car, and the CBP officer is standing above your window, they might ask you to turn over your password on your phone or enter it yourself. If you refuse to do that, notes Nathan Wessler, a staff attorney with the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, “CBP says lots of coercive things, like, ‘We have the right to do this and you are obligated to assist us by turning this over.’ Which is not the case.”
> # CBP and ICE each report having searched thousands of travelers’ electronic devices — mostly cellphones — in 2015, and those numbers continued to rise, more than doubling each of the following years, reaching [30,000 and 23,000 devices](&lt;|url|&gt;) for the two agencies respectively in 2017.

At that point, people are given a tough choice between allowing agents into their phone in the moment, or letting them seize it, hold on to it, and then eventually return it, perhaps months later. A person will never know whether officials hacked into their phone or what they searched. An iPhone with a strong password might be tough to break into; in 2016, following the San Bernardino shooting, Apple refused to provide the government with special software for circumventing an iPhone’s security features. The FBI then hired hackers to break into the cellphone without Apple’s help. (Apple did not respond to interview requests.)

According to the ACLU, no matter what an agent might say or imply in the moment, people aren’t legally required to let government officers search their phones or give them access to the device. But a [recent psychological study](&lt;|url|&gt;) shows that, even if people are aware of their rights and are concerned about their privacy, in these high-pressure situations, they will still voluntarily hand over their phones 97% of the time.

CBP and ICE each report having searched thousands of travelers’ electronic devices — mostly cellphones — in 2015, and those numbers continued to rise, more than doubling each of the following years, reaching [30,000 and 23,000 devices](&lt;|url|&gt;) for the two agencies respectively in 2017. While the federal government understandably seeks to prevent contraband, like counterfeit money and child pornography, and terrorists from entering the country, legal experts argue that these agencies have exceeded their authority. ICE even claims to have search powers that allow them to examine one’s data stored on the cloud, such as documents and photos accessed via apps on one’s phone.

“People think about the [National Security Agency] a lot and all the stuff they were doing when it comes to metadata collection, but this blows NSA out of the water in terms of domestic surveillance,” says John Ellis, a criminal defense attorney and digital forensic consultant in San Diego.

While the NSA received plenty of criticism for collecting metadata of people’s phone calls — when calls were made and to whom — CBP and ICE also have access to the contents of calls, messages, emails, and everything else. They can look through people’s social media sites and demand they hand over their friend list as well, Ellis says. The State Department recently proposed that people applying for visas also be required to provide their social media information — something the ACLU criticized the department for as well.

There are also no regulations in place limiting how long agencies can hold on to the information they collect or the data they extract. Years after an investigation is closed, an irreverent text message, poorly-worded email, or long-forgotten photo, for example, could be used as evidence against someone on completely different charges later, potentially adding bias to the criminal justice system.

“All this information enters their systems, and under their policies they can keep it any time it’s relevant to any of the laws they’re enforcing,” says Adam Schwartz, a senior staff attorney with the EFF. “To us, relevance is literally the lowest standard.”

Once they have that information, he says, it’s a simple matter to share it with other agencies. “There is an archipelago of government databases where this information is whizzing all around federal and state and local and foreign law enforcement agencies. Those agencies, based on what they read, can put a flag in the system, so when a border officer sees this traveler the next time, they’re tagged for extra scrutiny. And that could be the basis for the next border device search.”

The threat to privacy inherent to such searches poses a problem for the confidentiality of lawyers, like Ellis, who might work on both sides of the border. Journalists, too, have reasons to worry about the confidentiality of their sources and investigations.

Both ICE and CBP denied interview requests for this article. However, CBP did point to its earlier [statements](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [policy directives](&lt;|url|&gt;), where the agency referred to border device searches as “routine” and argued that they’re “not subject to any requirement of reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or warrant.”

This isn’t just legalese: It’s likening a search of one’s smartphone to a simple search of the contents of one’s purse or clothes. But others question this claim. “At the border there are fewer legal protections, but the Supreme Court has said that searching a phone is different than searching a car, or somebody’s coat, or their wallet,” says Margaret Hu, a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia and an expert on cybersurveillance. We arguably have more personal information contained within our phones than throughout our homes — and home searches require a warrant.

In the ACLU and EFF’s ongoing court case, [*Alasaad v. Nielsen](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, the organizations argue that border officers should be required to get a warrant from a judge and show concrete evidence that a person is likely in violation of immigration or customs laws before searching their electronic devices at the border or in international airports. That case may be decided as early as July.

Senators Ron Wyden and Rand Paul also recently introduced the [Protecting Data at the Border Act](&lt;|url|&gt;), a bill with bipartisan support that would have the same requirement. “It would be great if Congress wanted to step in and set more protective rules here,” says Wessler, “but unless and until that happens, it’s the obligation of the federal courts to stop ongoing unconstitutional violations.”<|endoftext|>

# Voice Assistants Will Bring the Next Billion Users Online

## Voice-forward phones could make the internet more accessible in the developing world

![*Scott Huffman, vice president of engineering for Assistant in Search presenting the KaiOS-powered WizPhone WP006 at Google for Indonesia on December 4.

Source: [KaiOS](&lt;|url|&gt;)**

A wide range of new phones were shown off at Mobile World Congress last month. At one end of the scale, Samsung introduced [three variations of its premium Galaxy S10](&lt;|url|&gt;), though many of the headlines went to another new model, the [Galaxy Fold](&lt;|url|&gt;), with its innovative folding screen — and almost $2,000 price tag.

But for a large portion of the developing world, the most important announcements came from companies like LG, Nokia, and Orange. [LG announced the K40, K50, and Q60](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Nokia revealed the 3.2 and 4.2 model phones](&lt;|url|&gt;), all mid-to-entry level Android smartphones, which will sell for about $200 and under. Each has a dedicated hardware button to launch the Google Assistant.

![The Sanza phone by Orange.](<|image|>)*The Sanza phone by Orange.*

The [Orange Sanza](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [WizPhone WP006](&lt;|url|&gt;), both 4G-feature phones, running KaiOS (an operating system based on the abandoned Firefox OS project) were also announced and will retail for under $20. The Sanza is intended for the mostly French-speaking countries of West Africa, while the WP006 will be sold from vending machines in Indonesia for about $7. These phones have even more prominent microphone buttons — they’re voice-forward phones, also powered by Google Assistant.

This is a deliberate part of Google’s strategy to reach [the next billion users](&lt;|url|&gt;). On average, [more than a million people a day came online for the first time in 2018](&lt;|url|&gt;), with a similar number likely for this year. And those people are, more often than not, found in fast-growing international markets like Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria.
> We need to look not at Silicon Valley or London, but to places like Sao Paulo, Bangalore, Shanghai, Jakarta, and Lagos to truly understand where the internet is going. — [Caesar Sengupta, Google](&lt;|url|&gt;)

Amazon has focused Alexa on key, wealthier markets, and currently supports only six languages and regional dialects. Google Assistant, meanwhile, has the advantage of being integrated with Android devices and has grown to be available in 30 languages. A lot of that growth comes in languages spoken in the “next billion countries” — in India, for example, Google Assistant understands Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu, as well as English.

One of the [claimed benefits](&lt;|url|&gt;) of voice input is that it helps people in areas of high illiteracy gain access to mobile devices and the internet. Another benefit is [said to be](&lt;|url|&gt;) that some languages, such as Mandarin, have complicated character sets which are difficult to type.

But this isn’t always the case; in Indonesia, for example, where the WizPhone will launch, [about 95 percent of the country is literate](&lt;|url|&gt;). And while it’s true that speaking is generally faster than typing, modern phones already have easier software keyboard input methods such as [Pinyin](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Putting Google Assistant into phones for new internet users has other advantages — it doesn’t require a powerful phone to run, so you can have a decent experience on a $7 phone, and it doesn’t use a lot of data, which is a real boon in countries like Nicaragua and Kenya where [1GB of data can cost almost 10 percent of your income](&lt;|url|&gt;).

A less tangible benefit of voice-forward phones is that there’s a reduced requirement to understand or learn legacy user-interface conventions. People in many countries, especially in the West, have been using computers since they were children, and smartphones for around a decade. They have grown up with buttons and tabs and carousels. But someone from rural India coming online for the first time today doesn’t need to learn those conventions if they have a voice-forward phone — they can speak naturally to their devices to achieve what they want to do.
> In these fast-growing countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Mexico, voice is often the primary way users interact with their devices because it’s natural, universal, and the most accessible input method for people who are starting to engage with technology for the first time in their lives.
> — [Brad Abrams, Google](&lt;|url|&gt;)

A generation of new mobile users, who came online in Africa in the late 2000s, led to the creation of [new SMS-based micropayment networks like M-PESA and Zaad](&lt;|url|&gt;), free from legacy banking systems and innovative in ways that Western money apps are only recently catching up to. A whole new generation of voice-forward devices, free from legacy interfaces, might also drive innovation in the ways people interact with businesses and services for the next billion users.<|endoftext|>

# Porn Sites Try a New Service for Users&#58; Therapy

## Porn Sites Try a New Service for Users: Therapy

### Q&As and livestreams about addiction are now part of the package for Pornhub and Stripchat

![Photo: gorodenkoff/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: gorodenkoff/Getty Images*

As internet pornography has become more widespread, so too has hand-wringing about its potential harms. In 2016, a *Time* cover story examined pornography as “[a threat to virility](&lt;|url|&gt;).” And many people take the very idea of porn addiction as a given — even as [academic and medical communities remain largely undecided](&lt;|url|&gt;) about how to diagnose or treat such an addiction or whether excessive consumption of pornography can be considered an “addiction” at all.

For porn consumers — particularly young ones who are still learning about healthy sexual habits — the current state of the conversation around porn addiction can feel decidedly one-sided. If you find yourself struggling with anxiety over your own porn habits, a Google search is likely to lead you to an anti-porn resource like Fight the New Drug, a Utah-based nonprofit founded by a group of Mormons, or Your Brain on Porn, a site run by self-identified recovering porn addicts, where total abstinence from adult content is presented as the only healthy solution.

Many sexual health professionals see that message as troubling. While it’s true that a small number of people have unhealthy, compulsive relationships with adult content, moderate consumption of porn can be a perfectly healthy part of someone’s sexual experience. What’s more, abstinence-only messages sometimes do more harm than good, upping anxiety and shame around sexual behavior rather than encouraging the formation of healthy attitudes toward sex.

In an attempt to push back against this one-sided discourse on porn consumption, some sexual health professionals are teaming up with porn platforms to bring a message of reduced shame and moderate consumption directly to consumers. At Pornhub, sex therapist [Laurie Betito](&lt;|url|&gt;) manages the [Pornhub Sexual Wellness Center](&lt;|url|&gt;), where visitors can find answers to all manner of queries ranging from [what happens when STIs like syphilis are left untreated](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [how to perform a prostate massage](&lt;|url|&gt;), and, of course, [how much masturbation is too much masturbation](&lt;|url|&gt;) (a question that, perhaps unsurprisingly, has come up [more](&lt;|url|&gt;) than [once](&lt;|url|&gt;)).
> # Stripchat will soon offer users the chance to chat with sexual health experts about their various concerns around sex, porn, and relationships.

At webcam site Stripchat, several sexual health experts are hoping to give anxious porn consumers even more direct access to their expertise. Thanks to a partnership with the [Sexual Health Alliance](&lt;|url|&gt;), Stripchat will soon offer users the chance to chat with sexual health experts about their various concerns around sex, porn, and relationships. Up first? Psychologist and sex therapist David Ley, who will chat with Stripchat users about porn addiction in [an hour-long cam show on Thursday, August 1](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Of course, if you’re selling adult content, it’s to your benefit to have a customer base that feels confident and comfortable consuming said content. But it’s not all about business. For Stripchat specifically, the motivation for this partnership came out of a growing awareness of the anxiety and confusion some of the site’s users feel about watching cam shows. In [a survey of more than 6,300 Stripchat users](&lt;|url|&gt;), 42% of respondents reported feeling anxiety about their cam show consumption at least occasionally, and 11% reported feeling anxiety often or all the time.

Max Bennet, Stripchat’s vice president of new media, viewed these findings as evidence that Stripchat needed to take a more active role in providing users access to sexual health professionals with the knowledge and expertise to help manage that anxiety. “There are no places to talk about a lot of this,” Bennet explains.
> # “We wanted to create an anonymous space where people could talk and understand.”

While a doctor might be the obvious resource for most questions about healthy sexuality, few of us see our physicians as the people we’d talk to about how often we watch cam shows. And talking to a partner about how often you’re seeking out sexual stimulation online can feel awkward and uncomfortable — if your partner feels threatened by porn and cam performers, a conversation could potentially lead to conflict within the relationship. “We wanted to create an anonymous space where people could talk and understand,” Bennet says.

When sex education events take place on adult content platforms, there’s a greater opportunity for open, honest conversation about sex. Ley feels that programs like Stripchat’s offer a powerful chance to help people who are struggling with shame and anxiety around sex and adult content develop healthier attitudes toward sex. “These kinds of strategies have the greatest opportunity to help people integrate sexuality into their lives in a healthy way,” Ley says.

While anti-porn activists often present one specific lifestyle as the “healthy” way to engage with sex, Ley feels that the open conversation encouraged by Stripchat and other adult content platforms offers sex educators a chance to “help people integrate their sexuality into their lives in a self-directed, personally driven, ethical manner that is not in service to conservative, heteronormative models” — and it gets that message in front of a massive audience that needs to hear it the most.

Granted, sexual health professionals partnering directly with commercial porn platforms face some potential downsides, particularly for those who’d like to present themselves as completely unbiased. “I fully anticipate [anti-porn advocates] to all scream, ‘Oh, look, see, David Ley is working for porn,’” says Ley, whose [name is routinely mentioned with disdain](&lt;|url|&gt;) in anti-masturbation communities like NoFap.

But even if his work with Stripchat will undoubtedly provide fodder to anyone eager to write him off as biased or in the pocket of the porn lobby, for Ley, that tradeoff is worth it. “If we want to help [anxious porn consumers], we have to go to them,” he says. “And this is how we do that.”<|endoftext|>

# Apple Is Already Your Fitness Coach. Can It Be Your Cardiologist Too?

## The number of Apple stores makes the company an accessible spot for health outreach

“Williamsburg, can you give it up?” Celebrity fitness expert [Jeanette Jenkins](&lt;|url|&gt;) gives a rallying cry as she leads a throng of approximately 30 Apple Watch users — including a number of Apple store employees — on a brisk walk around Brooklyn’s trendy Williamsburg neighborhood. The group responds with cheers, and Jenkins circles up the group at intervals so that Jay Blahnik, senior director of fitness at Apple, can answer questions about the Apple Watch’s fitness tracking capabilities.

This jaunt around the Brooklyn neighborhood is part of Apple’s heart health panel and fitness event at its Williamsburg-based store on February 21. The event is the latest in a series of health moves by the tech company, including teaming up with Stanford Medicine on the [400,000-participant Apple Heart Study](&lt;|url|&gt;) and getting [clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration](&lt;|url|&gt;) (FDA) to add two heart monitoring features on the Apple Series 4 Watch. Apple CEO Tim Cook has promised to make health the company’s “[greatest contribution to mankind](&lt;|url|&gt;).” Add in the tech giant’s vast network of retail stores, and it has the scope to make a major difference for health care and medicine.
> # “I’m always a little skeptical about the altruism of companies when they have products in the area.”

“I became a doctor to have impact,” said Sumbul Desai, MD, vice president of health at Apple and clinical associate professor at Stanford Medicine. “To be able to do that at scale is such an amazing opportunity.”

But some health experts worry that Apple’s business demands may supersede the company’s interest in advancing public health and promoting evidence-based medicine. “I’m always a little skeptical about the altruism of companies when they have products in the area,” says Venkatesh Murthy, MD, an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at Michigan Medicine. Apple’s promotion of heart health and fitness is “undeniably a good message,” he adds, “but it’s not without strings.”

Those strings are on display at the Brooklyn event as the group transitions to the meat of the affair: a heart health panel discussion, the second of three such panels Apple is hosting in February. In addition to Jenkins, the Brooklyn panel includes Desai and two cardiologists: Harlan Krumholz, MD, of Yale University, and John Rumsfeld, MD, of the American College of Cardiology and the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

Although neither Krumholz nor Rumsfeld have official financial ties to Apple (Rumsfeld is a member of the Apple Heart Study Steering Committee), both are bullish on the Apple Watch’s potential to change medicine for the better.

“I’m not here to sell you anything,” Krumholz says, “but I’m telling you that things like the Watch and other sensors are going to inform people about their lives and their health in ways we’ve never seen before.”

“The Apple Watch is a breakthrough technology,” Rumsfeld says of the device’s ability to track rapid irregular heartbeats, or atrial fibrillation, a condition that affects at least 3 million Americans and can ultimately lead to [heart failure or stroke](&lt;|url|&gt;). “I think we’re right on the cusp of this digital transformation of health care.”

But touting the Apple Watch’s atrial fibrillation alert system has drawn criticism from health experts, who note that it could lead to unnecessary testing and anxiety among Watch users — including young people, who have a low risk for atrial fibrillation. (Per the [FDA clearance](&lt;|url|&gt;) that Apple won — which is a lesser designation than FDA approval — the heart monitoring features are not intended for individuals younger than 22.)

“We are very concerned regarding the overdetection of heart rhythm issues,” says Eric Topol, MD, executive vice president of the Scripps Research Institute. “I don’t have any question that some people will be helped. My worry is the number of people who may unwittingly be hurt.”

Overdetection among the “worried well” can have adverse consequences. Those individuals may opt for unneeded testing and evaluations, potentially wasting money or undergoing unnecessarily medical interventions. Since [atrial fibrillation risk](&lt;|url|&gt;) increases with age, people at the highest risk for the condition are in their seventies and eighties, according to Murthy, a very different demographic than the twenty-, thirty- and fortysomethings assembled at the heart health talk in Brooklyn.

For researchers, though, the data collected from the heart rhythms of hundreds of thousands of users over time could hold significant potential, according to John Mandrola, MD, a doctor at Baptist Health Louisville and co-author of a editorial on atrial fibrillation screening [published last fall in *JAMA Internal Medicine](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

“The Apple Watch movement will teach us a lot over the years about the heart rhythm — remember, until now, people have not been monitored in normal daily life,” Mandrola says. “Perhaps it is ‘normal’ to have short periods of arrhythmia? Wearing a research hat, this looks good.”

He warns, however, about the potential short-term effects of tracking heart rhythms. “The end result will be a tsunami of overtesting and overtreatment,” he says. “Increasing the number of rich people who are mostly well and who will seek care will surely exacerbate the vast injustices of our health care system.”

There’s also the risk of sparking anxiety among healthy people. **“**We don’t want people taking ECGs every day,” says Desai, referring to the Apple Watch’s electrocardiogram function, which users can share with their doctors. “No doctor would recommend that. Most of the time, people are fine. They shouldn’t be in an obsessive mode.”

Suzanne Grant, a spokesperson for the American Heart Association, pushes back on questions about whether the association’s representation on Apple’s panels might create the appearance of a conflict of interest. “The American Heart Association does not endorse specific technology products or brands,” Grant said in an email to *OneZero*. “We do endorse the concept of technology helping empower people to make better-informed decisions and take control of their health.”

Apple declined to comment on whether the company would be hosting future awareness talks on other health topics, or whether the heart health events were a testing ground for community health outreach initiatives moving forward.

If Apple continues to expand its health outreach strategy, Topol hopes it will evolve from the model on view in Brooklyn. “If this is the first foray of a tech titan into the retail consumer store space, dragging along academics to be co-branded, it is not a good sign.”<|endoftext|>

# Smartphones Are About to Get Weird

## As sales slow, phone-makers may get gimmicky

The future is foldable, if smartphone makers are to be believed. At Mobile World Congress in February, Samsung announced that it would release a futuristic folding phone at the end of April for an eye-popping $1,980.

The Galaxy Fold unfurls from a phone into a tablet-sized device. It’s mesmerizing to watch people use this device, like something out of a science-fiction movie. Huawei, Xiaomi, and others have already announced their own rival foldable gadgets. Apple [is rumored](&lt;|url|&gt;) to be looking into the technology. Foldable screens may soon be everywhere.

This just leaves one simple question: Why?

![*Credit: Samsung*](<|image|>)**Credit: Samsung**

Foldable devices are one possible solution to a problem many of the world’s biggest tech manufacturers are worried about: [shrinking smartphone sales](&lt;|url|&gt;). Our phones are [lasting longer](&lt;|url|&gt;) than ever, which is great for consumers who don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars every year but not so great for manufacturers who want those consumers to buy new phones every year. The current state of technology isn’t going to do it; companies need something flashy, marketable, and entirely original to make consumers willing to trade in their current phones for a pricier new model. A phone that folds is just one possibility; weirder is going to be better for the next wave of smartphones.

Smartphone manufacturers looking to boost their sales may benefit, but the advantages to consumers are more questionable. Foldable phones offer few benefits over a conventional iPhone or Android device. There’s more screen to break and delicate hinge mechanisms, potentially raising the cost of repairs should something go wrong — and something usually goes wrong with first-generation technology. Official Android support for these devices isn’t even available yet. And if you look closely at Samsung’s [Galaxy Fold announcement](&lt;|url|&gt;), you’ll see awkwardly sized screens that don’t totally fill the allotted space.

The current reality is that the companies marketing foldable phones have failed to come up with a compelling pitch for how they’ll improve your life. One possibility is allowing you to multitask — like playing games and messaging at the same time. Multitasking is, of course, already available to some extent on devices like the Galaxy Note, and it’s unclear whether anyone asked for it to begin with.

It’s been 10 years since Apple unveiled the iPhone and started the race to build the perfect computer for carrying everything digital everywhere. But the basic rectangular smartphone arguably has reached its perfect, final form: What else is there to do other than to make it faster, thinner, or a different color? (Hello, coral iPhones!)

Sensing this, Apple quietly shifted to a [three-year cycle](&lt;|url|&gt;) for overhauling the design of the iPhone, even as its competition is struggling to innovate as well. Huawei, Samsung, and Xiaomi’s phone designs historically have looked to the iPhone for inspiration, but now they’re left to their own devices to find something — anything — that can stimulate sales and make it [feel like 2016](&lt;|url|&gt;) again.

Flexible display technology arrived at the right moment for smartphone-makers hunting for a way to differentiate their increasingly similar products. Samsung and LG are the largest screen manufacturers in the world, supplying displays for almost every device in existence, and they’ve been working on flexible displays in secret for years, struggling to build them in sustainable quantities until now.

![*Credit: Nokia*](<|image|>)**Credit: Nokia**

It doesn’t stop with screens. Suddenly, phone-makers are in an arms race over how many cameras can be crammed onto the back of a single device. Nokia is launching a Pureview phone with a five-camera array on the back, purportedly to offer more depth and zoom options than traditional smartphone cameras.

Samsung’s flagship [Galaxy S10](&lt;|url|&gt;), due to be released this month, also [sports five lenses](&lt;|url|&gt;). And soon, there’ll be many more, with Sony and Xiaomi [partnering with camera-array manufacturer Light](&lt;|url|&gt;) to build their own versions.

Meanwhile, Energizer is getting into the smartphone manufacturing game by gluing an enormous battery to a phone that [helps it last 50 days](&lt;|url|&gt;) on a single charge.

Smartphone companies are trying to kill the notch with [punch-hole cameras](&lt;|url|&gt;) and pop-up selfie lenses driven by motors. There are even full-sized smartphones [with sliding physical keyboards](&lt;|url|&gt;).


Anything goes because nobody knows what will stick yet. But the whole thing feels like razor companies adding [ever more blades](&lt;|url|&gt;) to their cartridges — changes being made for the sake of changes.

Here’s the thing: The phone industry has a history of bizarre experiments and bad ideas. From the teardrop-shaped [Nokia 7600](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the stumpy [Microsoft Kin](&lt;|url|&gt;), all of those ideas were doomed, but they did* *help propel the entire industry forward.

When Apple jumped in with the iPhone, it had designed the perfect smartphone. It delivered beautiful hardware with slick lines — and everyone else emulated it. Over the years, fun, quirky ideas have disappeared in favor of fashion. And now we’re coming full circle: The smartphone, perfected, [has become boring](&lt;|url|&gt;). Apple seems to sense this, too, as it’s adding color back to its devices with the iPhone XR lineup.

The foldable phone trend is almost certainly going to blow over in a matter of months. We might see them again, but they’ll inevitably disappear for a number of years as manufacturers iterate on the idea and shrink down the parts involved. In the mad rush to get something new and innovative out the door, this generation of foldables will be clunky, broken, or just plain unusable. We’ll look back and laugh at how silly the ideas were.

But this is always how it begins. Expect the unexpected from here on out.<|endoftext|>

# The Reality Is Virtual, But the Motion Sickness Is Real

## VR experiences make some people — especially women — feel nauseous and ill. Here’s how the industry is trying to fix that.

![Credit: Andrzej Wojcicki/Science Photo Library/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Andrzej Wojcicki/Science Photo Library/Getty Images*

I was just settling in to a feeling of invincibility, gliding through fluffy clouds wearing a colorful wingsuit. But it didn’t last long. A little over a minute later the nausea began, my head started to sweat and throb, and I panicked as my virtual reality headset steamed up.

I knew this feeling from amusement park rides and ferry crossings — it’s the effects of motion sickness. Nausea within virtual reality has been a problem since the early days of the technology, though as VR has improved, thanks to screens that refresh more quickly and rely on more sophisticated movement sensors, users have felt more comfortable — and less likely to vomit.

Yet, despite these improvements, VR-induced motion sickness remains an obstacle for many players, regardless of whether they’re using an Oculus Quest, PlayStation VR, HTC Vive or any other major headset. Developers want us to embrace VR as an increasingly useful and powerful tool, offering the possibility of everything from [precise and effective surgical procedures](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [powerful educational experiences](&lt;|url|&gt;) for students of all ages. But if that’s going to happen, the technology needs to be easier to use, more comfortable — and it can’t make players ill.

There are several reasons why people might experience symptoms of motion sickness when using VR. “The sensory conflict is between what your eyes are telling you is happening — moving in a virtual space, and what your inner ear and joints are telling you is happening — you’re still,” says [John F. Golding](&lt;|url|&gt;), a professor of social science at the University of Westminster in London who has studied this type of motion sickness and spatial disorientation. “That’s when there’s a mismatch.”
> # VR-induced eye strain can lead to headaches, fatigue, and dizziness, which happens when lenses haven’t been correctly aligned.

Sensory conflict tends to be the main cause of classic motion sickness, but cybersickness is also caused by phase lag. “If you move your head with a VR headset on, the sensors know you’re moving, and so refresh, so what you’re seeing looks real,” says Golding. “Your vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) computes, based on your inner ear, where your eyes should move and sends messages to your eyes, which will move to stabilize your vision. But if the VR world doesn’t keep up, there’s a problem.”

VR-induced eye strain can lead to headaches, fatigue, and dizziness, which happens when lenses haven’t been correctly aligned. “The VR headset told you objects are a mile away, but they’re being projected from something half an inch away,” says Golding. “If the angles of the images aren’t exactly right, the eyes will adjust their musculature very slightly, causing strain and headaches.”

There are other mismatches too, such as screen flicker, and optical magnification, which happens when objects appear much bigger in VR than you expect them to be. Golding says it’s unknown what proportion of VR users typically experience motion sickness, but research indicates that 25% of plane travelers feel the effects during turbulence, while a third experience it on a long bus journey.

Significantly, classic motion sickness and cybersickness both affect women more than men. “If you take a sea voyage, the ratio of females to males who will vomit is five to three,” says Golding. [Early studies suggest](&lt;|url|&gt;) this ratio could be even more extreme in VR. So, as VR is increasingly used for education, health, and work, women could be at a disadvantage.

There are some solutions, including standard medications like Dramamine, and it’s possible that some users who initially experience ill effects may habituate to VR over time. Other players may learn that certain types of VR experiences trigger more cybersickness than others (which is why I won’t be flying again in VR anytime soon). Developers could introduce a [labeling](&lt;|url|&gt;) system to indicate the likelihood of motion sickness; a similar system is already in place in the Oculus Store, which rates apps based on comfort.

And yet none of these feel like a satisfactory solution, because popping travel sickness pills or weighing up your appetite for nausea in a VR game doesn’t feel like a very sophisticated version of the virtual future we’ve long been promised.

VR hardware companies are already addressing many of these issues. Sean Liu, director of hardware product management at [Oculus](&lt;|url|&gt;), tells *OneZero* that the company has been making many changes to its headsets in order to ensure they’re comfortable. “This includes advancements like reducing latency, enhancing tracking, optimizing lens technology, and customizing screen performance,” he says.

Manufacturers are improving the screen technology inside the headsets so that they refresh more quickly, reducing the dragging latency that can often induce sickness. “Good systems are getting up to at least 100Hz,” Golding says, which means the display refreshes 100 times per second. “But you still need to place the image in the correct position. You could have a million Hz, but it has to be accurate.”

Other fixes include narrowing the user’s field of view (FOV) or adding “dynamical blurring”, which blurs out anything in peripheral vision. [Researchers from Columbia University](&lt;|url|&gt;) changed the FOV in VR in response to motion, which reduced the degree of VR sickness largely without impacting the quality of the experience.

Another way to reduce sensory conflict is to provide users with something to focus on; [researchers at Purdue University](&lt;|url|&gt;) believe a novel fix could be a virtual nose — as in, the one on your face. “We wanted to provide a fixed visual reference in the user’s field of view to act as a stabilizing influence,” says David Whittinghill, an associate professor in computer graphics technology at Purdue*. *“There was* *an approximate 13%reduction of sickness symptoms.”

Other solutions include eye tracking, which may ensure images match up better with a user’s vision, and omnidirectional treadmills, which allow the player to move in any direction and sync up virtual movements with real ones. Delivering [vibrations](&lt;|url|&gt;) and even electrical stimulation directly to a user’s ear could also help. “Electrical stimulation affects the operation of the vestibular system, reducing sensitivity to visual stimuli that simulates unnatural motion or balance,” says Whittinghill.
> # “The company that figures this out will be well-rewarded by the market, but will also be doing a great service to the world at large.”

But these theoretical fixes need to be taken out of the laboratory and applied to commercial VR experiences, without making headsets too heavy, expensive, and uncomfortable.

“We eliminate all uncomfortable and confusing elements, including acceleration and even audio inconsistencies,” says Patrick Curry, CEO of the VR studio [FarBridge](&lt;|url|&gt;). Their developers also use teleports inside games, so instead of large, disorientating movements, the viewer sees the screen fade to black before opening up again in a new location.

“The best way to minimize motion sickness is to never move the player’s location without their input. We have to listen when someone tells us that they’re uncomfortable or physically unable to do something, then work to find solutions that let them enjoy our software in as natural a way as possible,” says Curry.

Without this kind of mindful approach, the VR industry runs the risk of discriminating against people as the technology becomes more widespread — particularly women.

“The company that figures this out will be well-rewarded by the market, but will also be doing a great service to the world at large,” says Whittinghill. “They will be providing experience designers with an entire new palette upon which immersive experiences can be crafted. For VR to reach its full potential somebody needs to crack this problem.”<|endoftext|>

# How Digital Virtual Assistants Like Alexa Amplify Sexism

## Without more balanced sources of data, A.I. is doomed to reinforce damaging social prejudice

![Credit: T3 Magazine/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: T3 Magazine/Getty Images*

In 2016, search engine expert Danny Sullivan [asked his Google Home device](&lt;|url|&gt;), “Hey Google, are women evil?” The device, in its female-programmed voice, cheerfully replied, “Every woman has some degree of prostitute in her, every woman has a little evil in her.” It was an extract from the misogynist blog *Shedding the Ego*.

When later challenged by [the *Guardian](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, Google did not say it was wrong to promote a sexist blog. Instead, it stated, “Our search results are a reflection of the content across the web.”

Virtual assistants are becoming increasingly mainstream. In December 2018, a survey by NPR and Edison Research found that [53 million Americans owned at least one smart speaker](&lt;|url|&gt;) — over a quarter of the country’s adult population. Right now, Amazon’s Echo dominates the industry, with [61.1% market share](&lt;|url|&gt;), while Google Home accounts for [23.9%](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # By relying on biased information sources, virtual assistants in smart speakers could spread and solidify stereotypes.

Google Assistant, Apple’s Siri, and Amazon’s Alexa have all been criticized for their use of female voices as a default. Campaigners for [gender-equal](&lt;|url|&gt;) artificial intelligence say this reinforces the idea that women are obedient and subservient. [In 2017, *Quartz* found](&lt;|url|&gt;) that if you sexually harassed Amazon’s Alexa, it kept up the act. In reply to “you’re hot,” Alexa would reply, “That’s nice of you to say.” If you said, “Alexa, you’re a slut,” it would answer, “Thanks for the feedback”. Alexa [now disengages](&lt;|url|&gt;) from these comments, replying with stock phrases such as “I’m not going to respond to that.”

Still, Amazon is now the only company of the three that doesn’t allow users in the United States to choose a male voice. And even though there is now a wider variety of voices to choose from, virtual assistants are reinforcing some damaging gender prejudices that exist across the internet — and not just because of the way they sound. Researchers argue that by relying on biased information sources, virtual assistants in smart speakers could spread and solidify stereotypes.

Google Assistant, the A.I. that powers Google Home, has since changed its answer to whether women are evil, but Microsoft’s virtual assistant, Cortana, still links to part of that blog post.

“This is a risk with any kind of machine learning–based application,” says Mariarosaria Taddeo, deputy director of the Digital Ethics Lab at Oxford University. “If there is a bias in the sources where Alexa acquires information, there is a chance Alexa will replicate that bias.”

Data experts describe this problem as “garbage in, garbage out” — that because virtual assistants draw from biased data, they risk amplifying stereotypes many societies are working hard to escape, as well as highlighting historic imbalances.

“A.I. is always learning and improving its behavior, but we need to correct the bias [in its sources of data],” Taddeo says. “This is a not a one-off action. We will need to be constantly redressing the situation.”

When you ask the Alexa app in the U.K., “What are the symptoms of a heart attack?” the A.I. mentions “chest pain, shortness of breath, feeling weak and/ or lightheaded.” But this advice excludes symptoms that are [reportedly more common in women](&lt;|url|&gt;), such as back or jaw pain — [reflecting concerns](&lt;|url|&gt;) that medical advice has historically been designed around male symptoms.

Google has also struggled with this. Last year, its [translation A.I.](&lt;|url|&gt;) determined that doctors were more often referred to as men online, so it [assumed](&lt;|url|&gt;) doctors were male when translating from Turkish, a gender-neutral language. “This is something that Google and the whole industry have been getting concerned about,” Macduff Hughes, head of Google Translate, later told [the *Verge](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. “Machine learning services and products reflect the biases of the data they’re trained on, which reflects societal biases, which reinforce and perhaps even amplifies those biases.”

Wikipedia, an information source referenced heavily by all the leading virtual assistants, is open about its problems with bias. The site is “a mirror of the world’s gender biases,” Katherine Maher, CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation, [told](&lt;|url|&gt;) the *Los Angeles Times*. “Our contributors are majority Western and mostly male [85%], and these gatekeepers apply their own judgment and prejudices,” she said.
> # “The issue is the way A.I. perpetuates existing discriminatory stereotypes of women… All the stereotypes in human language are being returned to the user and then amplified.”

Fewer than 18% of Wikipedia’s biographical entries are about women, explains Londa Schiebinger, director of Stanford’s [Gendered Innovations](&lt;|url|&gt;) project. She found that even articles about women tended to link to articles about men and included more mentions of women’s personal lives. The personal assistants reinforce these gaps: Amazon’s Alexa doesn’t recognize the Texan pro beach volleyball player [Amanda Dowdy](&lt;|url|&gt;), for example, because she doesn’t have a Wikipedia [entry](&lt;|url|&gt;). Despite worldwide edit-a-thons adding biographies of more than [18,000 notable women](&lt;|url|&gt;), they still account for only 3% of all biographies on Wikipedia.

Schiebinger, who is also professor of the history of science at Stanford, calls these gaps “asymmetrical” information and points to research showing that A.I. picks up on [stereotypes in our human language](&lt;|url|&gt;). “The issue is the way A.I. perpetuates existing discriminatory stereotypes of women… All the stereotypes in human language are being returned to the user and then amplified,” she says. “We cannot just regurgitate the bias that is in these databases, because we’ll just keep living the 1950s all over again. We will get stuck in a vicious cycle of stereotypes.”

Compounding the problem is the limitation that virtual assistants can offer only one answer, rather than pages of different information sources. For years, technologists have seen this a challenge, as Google’s [Eric Schmidt](&lt;|url|&gt;) hinted back in 2005: “That’s a bug… We should be able to give you the right answer just once.”

He may now be right. Increasing personalization promises to give each of us a more tailored and accurate “perfect answer,” especially as the popularity of virtual assistants grows. Marketing analytics companies predict that by 2020, 50% of all searches will [be done by voice](&lt;|url|&gt;). But unless all sources of data become more representative, the problem of bias in these “perfect answers” will only intensify.

The problem could become even more intense in the developing world, where virtual assistants will be a critical way to reach new markets where many people can’t read. In India, Google has made massive efforts to get [millions of people online](&lt;|url|&gt;). “In a context where people are new to technology, there is the concern that the technology might be trusted too much,” says Oxford’s Taddeo.

Google did not want to comment on the record on any of these issues, but the company told *OneZero* that it had developed a diverse offering of eight voices for Google Home, and these will soon be available globally. The company also said that it does not rerank search results or answers on any topic with the intent of manipulating user sentiment, and that it would undermine trust in both its search results and in the company if it did. Amazon did not reply to a request for comment.

There are people working to rectify the problems with A.I. bias. Kasia Chmielinski and Sara Newman are co-founders of the [Data Nutrition Project](&lt;|url|&gt;), a Harvard and MIT initiative that creates food-like nutrition labels for datasets to raise awareness about data quality. Labels list details like where the data was collected, who took part, and who — or what — is not represented.

“Similar to checking the ingredients or calories in food before you consume it… data scientists should look at the ingredients in the data they use,” Newman says.

“Virtual assistants are a great example, because it highlights how complex [this area] is. These machines are built on giant corpora of human-generated data with historical bias,” Chmielinski adds.

But data nutrition labels are a solution that’s easier to apply to specific datasets, not the vast pools of online information used by virtual assistants. Chmielinski says that, ideally, the companies making the virtual assistants would have built a nutritional label for Wikipedia before they built the algorithm to understand how the platform’s data was skewed and how to adjust the A.I. accordingly.

Schiebinger agrees that this is a complicated problem. “And it’s so slow to correct the biases,” she says. “What we should do is de-bias human society instead.”<|endoftext|>

# The “Great Dying” Has Begun. Only Transforming the Economy Can Stop It.

## In their careful way, scientists are calling for an end to capitalism as we know it

![Photo: Architect/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Architect/Getty Images*

Extinction has threatened Earth’s plant and animal life several times over the planet’s multibillion-year history. During the mass extinction event called the “Great Dying,” around 250 million years ago, [96% of all marine species](&lt;|url|&gt;) died out — gone forever.

Life is once again headed for total collapse. While coverage of last week’s major Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) [report](&lt;|url|&gt;) on biodiversity loss rightly played up the dire numbers — an estimated 1 million species gone by 2050 — what’s truly remarkable are the solutions the authors offer in response. Ditching the timid pragmatism of technocrats, these scientists are calling for nothing less than the total transformation of the global economy. Producing for profit has failed us, they say, and failed the planet. We need a new system.

Only “transformative change” can stop massive species loss, according to the report’s conclusion. That means overhauling the global economy to prioritize human well-being and environmental sustainability rather than the pursuit of profit. “We’re not addressing the underlying causes of biodiversity loss, which is the way we organize economies, production and consumption patterns, our institutions, and our rules,” says Ingrid Visseren-Hamakers, associate professor of environmental science and policy at George Mason University and a coordinating lead author of the IPBES report. “We need to transform the sheer fabric of our society to become more sustainable.”

Today’s great dying is happening faster than ever before, and its causes are clear: breakneck development, fossil-fueled global warming, industrial pollution, single-crop agriculture. Complex as these processes are, they point to a common culprit: A [growth-based economic system](&lt;|url|&gt;) bent on wringing cash from nature has exploited the planet’s ecosystems beyond what they can bear. Now, Earth’s fragile life-support system is entering a death spiral that threatens human existence and which no one is prepared to stop.

Evidence of an impending mass extinction has been accumulating for years, but this report paints an especially dire picture of the pace and scale of the crisis. Plant and animal species are vanishing at an unprecedented rate: 1 million of Earth’s 8 million known species could go extinct within 30 years. Biodiversity “is declining faster than at any time in human history,” the report’s authors conclude. And with it, the ecological prerequisites for human life are dwindling: clean air and water, healthy food, stable climates, medicines, and much more.

Efforts to slow the dying have proven woefully inadequate. Governments will miss key conservation targets in the coming years, signing death warrants for countless corals and amphibians and exposing up to 300 million additional people to dangerous flooding as coastal habitats vanish. That’s because governments, businesses, and others have failed to tackle root causes of ecosystem collapse.
> # “It’s inevitable that you come to conclusions like this, because that’s what the science says.”

IPBES is careful to remain nonpartisan and lays out options, not prescriptions, for policymakers. But the report’s conclusions are “in essence political,” Visseren-Hamakers says. “We’re changing the goals of our society. We want to switch the goal from making profit to living sustainably.”

The authors of the report propose “steering away from the current limited paradigm of economic growth,” though they “expect opposition from those with interests vested in the status quo.” Given that growth is the market economy’s animating principle, this is essentially code for overhauling global capitalism and angering some large corporations in the process.

Like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2018 [Special Report on Global Warming](&lt;|url|&gt;), the new study’s frankness is history-making. After years of highlighting piecemeal reforms, the scientific community is now asking us to completely rethink modern society. Not because they’re ideological, but because they’re scientists. They go where the evidence leads.

“It’s inevitable that you come to conclusions like this, because that’s what the science says,” Visseren-Hamakers says.

Of course, the authors also offer less drastic solutions. Deep in the report, they suggest that putting a price tag on “ecosystem services” can help account for and redress the costs of treating nature like a waste dump. It’s an [old idea](&lt;|url|&gt;). Factoring nature’s value into economic calculations would eliminate “perverse incentives” to pollute and give companies and governments greater incentive to conserve biodiversity. For example, [carbon pricing](&lt;|url|&gt;) is designed to account for the value of a stable climate. Factoring environmental costs of carbon pollution into production decisions should discourage, in theory, the use of fossil fuels that, directly and indirectly, degrade ecosystems. Though not particularly ambitious, pricing nature was once widely believed to be a pragmatic response to species loss.

“Fifteen years ago, financialization of nature schemes would have been front and center of a report like this,” says Jesse Goldstein, assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University.

The fact that such policies are not front and center marks a historic shift in tone. Pragmatic scientists and policymakers want fast, achievable solutions to urgent problems. And so, for decades, they’ve resisted calling for fundamental changes to the economic system. Even when it’s been clear that economic growth accelerates biodiversity loss, reigning in global capitalism has seemed too drastic, cumbersome, and infeasible to count as a realistic solution to the crisis.

“The overarching language [of the report] says everything’s got to change,” Goldstein says. “But the assumption is that massive, transformative political and economic change takes too much time and that technocratic and technological policy-based solutions are quicker.” But now it’s the pragmatic solutions that seem out of step with the reality of the extinction crisis. Given the deadly seriousness of species extinction, the most ambitious solutions have become the most necessary.

It would be reductive to attribute biodiversity loss solely* *to modern capitalism. After all, humans have destroyed environments since they learned to whittle sticks into spears and clear forests to make farms. Indigenous peoples in North America wiped out the mastodon long before they could hope to cash in on its hide. But [capitalism introduces a totally different set of incentives](&lt;|url|&gt;): Once plant and animal life is viewed as a production input, a cash engine, or an acceptable casualty of profit accumulation, it makes sense to wring revenue from life until it’s gone, especially when competitive pressures reward making a quick buck.

The IPBES report makes clear that today’s great dying differs in kind, not degree, from earlier waves of biodiversity loss. Since 1900, the abundance of major species has declined by 20% globally. And since 1970, as industrial production has exploded, nature’s productivity has plummeted across the board. Species extinction is now “tens to hundreds of times higher than it has averaged over the past 10 million years,” the authors write.

In [*The Sixth Extinction](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, journalist Elizabeth Kolbert documents the dizzying pace of modern ecological destruction. “Just in the past century, CO2 levels in the atmosphere have changed by as much — a hundred parts per million — as they normally do in a hundred-thousand-year glacial cycle,” she writes. “Meanwhile, the drop in ocean pH levels that has occurred over the past fifty years may well exceed anything that happened in the seas during the previous fifty million.” This past weekend, air temperatures around parts of the Arctic Ocean [reached](&lt;|url|&gt;) 84 degrees Fahrenheit, while the concentration of CO2 eclipsed 415 parts per million for the first time in human history. No matter how unsustainable our ancestors’ societies were, ours is infinitely worse.

Amid the dying, however, the economy booms. Crop yields have increased 300% since the 1970s, per the IPBES report, and businesses are now extracting 60 billion tons of resources from the earth each year. Those resources run the gamut: oil for cars, timber for buildings, [precious metals for our precious iPhones](&lt;|url|&gt;). It might be one thing if biodiversity loss were paying for better lives for everyone — an unfortunate cost of making sure everyone has a safe home, healthy food, and reliable transportation — but trends in wealth inequality tell a different story. America’s richest people have [doubled](&lt;|url|&gt;) their incomes since the 1970s, while working people have experienced [wage stagnation](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [disproportionately suffered](&lt;|url|&gt;) the effects of habitat loss, extreme weather, and food shortages.

Given these trends, “it’s hard to make with a straight face the argument that green capitalism is going to save the planet,” Goldstein added. What seems needed is something far more radical.

The world’s best scientists seem to agree. “The discourse on sustainability is changing,” Visseren-Hamakers says. “It’s now normal to talk about transformation, which is nothing less than a revolution.”<|endoftext|>

# A Nearly Foolproof Guide to Finding Your Missing Phone

## No matter where you lost it

![Credit: Zbynek Pospisil/iStock/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: Zbynek Pospisil/iStock/Getty Images Plus*

With a panicked jolt, you realize that your pocket feels suspiciously light. You double-check, and sure enough, your phone is gone. And with it? Your camera, photo album, address book, calendar — the list goes on.

Fortunately, there are some preemptive steps that can ease the pain if it happens. David Weissman, a spokesperson for Verizon, stressed the importance of backing up every piece of data on your phone. “I don’t rely on the phone to store any content,” he said. “Every picture I take immediately gets backed up in the cloud. So if I lose my phone, it’s only a financial issue, and not one of lost work or pictures.” If your phone is merely a device for accessing your information, the damage isn’t as significant if it goes missing.

On the iPhone, set an emergency contact by opening the Health app, creating a medical ID, and adding your closest contacts to the list, so that anyone who finds your phone can call them without unlocking the device. (You don’t have to fill out the rest of the medical information to do this.) “I’ve seen people put their [emergency contacts] or contact info on their lock screen so they can be quickly reunited with their lost device,” Weissman said. “I’ve also seen putting a label on the inside of your phone case with your contact information, in case the phone dies.” Most phones come loaded with GPS tracking capabilities, but if you want a backup, add a stick-on gadget like the [Tile Mate](&lt;|url|&gt;) that employs its own GPS.
> # Think about your surroundings: Was there a store clerk who saw you leave the phone behind? Were there security cameras that would show you dropping the phone?

No matter how much you prepare, losing your phone is accompanied by some unknowns — where you left it, whether anyone else has found it, whether they intend to try to get it back to you. Here’s how to stay as in control as possible and, with some luck, successfully track it down.

## **Protect your data**

The first thing to consider when you lose your phone is whether anyone who picks it up can access your private information. As soon as you notice it’s missing, you should remotely lock the device and change your passwords on email, social media, and any other app you have on there.

If you eventually decide to give up your search, it’s easy to remotely wipe the phone with Find My iPhone or Google Device Manager and cut off cell service by contacting your wireless carrier.

## **Track the location**

Next, call and text your number. If no one answers, you can track your smartphone’s location using Find My iPhone or Google Find My Device for Android. These functions work as long as the phone has a charge and up to 24 hours after it dies.

Although tracking has been known to send [people on wild goose chases](&lt;|url|&gt;), I did come across some success stories. After leaving his phone in the back of an Uber, Brooklyn-based gallerist Jared Linge tracked it to the Bronx using a friend’s computer. “Of course, it was right off the freeway in this mess of intersections, and after walking around for a half-hour, we found the Uber car,” he said. “I told my friend to call my phone, and it was still on and ringing in the Uber.” They left a note on the car’s windshield, went to a nearby bar, and got a call from the driver an hour later.

That said, if you think your phone was stolen, don’t try to confront the thief yourself. Instead, report the theft to the local police.

## **If you lose your phone in transit**

If you think you left your phone in a rideshare, Uber and Lyft allow riders to access their ride history online and contact the drivers directly. While Uber does not require that drivers turn in found items or file a report, local Uber support centers called Greenlight Hubs have lost-and-found counters. Riders reunited with their lost items are charged $15, which is then paid to their driver. Lyft encourages passengers to speak with [customer service](&lt;|url|&gt;).

But let’s say you lose your phone in a traditional cab. For starters, check your receipt, if you have one. “It’s always a good idea to get a receipt for every cab ride you take, because it will have the vehicle number listed,” says Allan Fromberg, deputy commissioner for public affairs at the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). It will also likely have the company’s or driver’s contact information. If you don’t ask for a receipt, the TLC can pinpoint the car based on time and location of drop-off and pickup, plus credit card information, if that’s how a rider paid. Location-based services only work if the cabs are equipped with GPS trackers.

Fromberg describes what sounds like an old-school investigation procedure that plays out once a rider reports a missing phone to 311: The TLC reaches out to cab drivers to confirm whether the driver has the item or whether the driver delivered it to a lost and found at an NYPD precinct.

Some other cities, [like Boston](&lt;|url|&gt;), have a similar process in place. If you’re in a city that authorizes private taxi companies, it’s worth reaching out directly to ask about their protocol for missing items. Public transit systems usually maintain a separate lost and found for items left on trains or buses. (Some, like New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, also publish records of lost items; right now, [there are 50,891 cellphones](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the MTA’s custody.)

## **If you lose your phone in a public place**

Once you retrace your steps and have a sense of where, exactly, the phone may have left your possession, think about your surroundings. Was there a store clerk who saw you leave the phone behind or could have held it for you? Were there security cameras that would show you dropping the phone or leaving it on a table? Would those same cameras have a record of someone else picking it up? Are there nearby establishments where someone might have turned it in? For iPhones, contact Apple; for Androids, contact your wireless carrier to see if someone turned it in at a local store.

Unfortunately, unlike the Missed Connections page, which [has been known to foster a meet-cute](&lt;|url|&gt;) here and there, I’ve yet to hear of a Craigslist lost-and-found victory. However, physical lost and founds do sometimes work. On an October night in a Las Vegas nightclub, poet Jiordan Castle watched her handbag sail away “hand by hand by hand” atop the dance floor’s cresting sea of bodies. Her phone, wallet, and keys were inside.

“I bawled my eyes out in the bathroom,” Castle said, believing that her valuables were gone for good — until she discovered that the club had a lost and found and that a fellow clubgoer had turned in her bag with the contents still inside. “It’s the greatest Vegas miracle I’ve ever known.”

## **If you lose your phone abroad**

Outside the United States, several U.S. embassies maintain lost property offices that can connect you with the right resources for tracking down your phone. Local contacts might also have insight. When journalist Marissa Miller lost her phone in Thailand, a receptionist at her hotel connected her with the tourism police, who were then able to track down her cab driver and get the phone back to her.

“The takeaway is that receptionists at hotels often have contacts and connections you as a tourist might not be privy to,” Miller says. “We would have never known to contact tourism police.”

## **Pay it forward**

If you find someone else’s phone, stay in the area so if the phone’s (probably harried) owner returns to the scene or tries to call the device, you’ll be able to hand it off. Keep the ringer on, and expect a call from the owner; in the meantime, you can try calling the owner’s emergency contacts if they’ve set them up.

Say that person doesn’t pick up; you might still be able to find some more clues about the owner’s identity in the notification center or by asking a virtual assistant who the phone belongs to. This [Reddit thread](&lt;|url|&gt;) has suggestions for tracking down the owner of an iPhone, but many of the tips around using the virtual assistant also apply to Androids. The most important thing is to keep the phone charged in case the owner calls. After 24 hours, it’s safe to say you probably won’t hear from them; drop it off at the Apple Store (if it’s an iPhone) or its wireless carrier storefront (if it’s an Android).

At the end of the day, a smartphone owner will only be able to track down their lost phone if the person who finds it cares enough to contact them, drop it at a lost and found, or take it to their wireless carrier. Technology has given us the opportunity to track our lost items, but the system only works if the person on the other end enables it. With both losing and finding, there’s only so much that’s within your control.<|endoftext|>

# What’s on Your Home Screen, Erica Joy Baker?

## Order and purpose from a principal group engineering manager at Microsoft

![Erica Joy Baker](<|image|>)*Erica Joy Baker*

*This is “What’s on Your Home Screen?” a Q&A column from *OneZero*. We want to understand more about how people use their smartphones — those life-consuming devices we dump hours into every day — to pave a way toward a better future. Or at least a more reflective one. We’ll add new entries regularly, and each will feature a new interview with a notable person about the apps they use, how they’re organized, and whether those red bubbles drive them nuts.*

Erica Joy Baker, an engineering manager at Microsoft, knows how to organize a home screen. Each section is color coordinated. Apps are clustered according to purpose. There are some — but not many — [notification badges](&lt;|url|&gt;).

One key: She keeps a separate device for business. Many of us have never lived in a world where we would have, say, a “BlackBerry for work.” Instead, we consent to our employers having some control over our devices so that we can have fingertip access to services like Slack or Asana, blurring the line between our professional and personal lives. Convenient? Sure! But maybe not wise in a world that’s already overstuffed with “[everything](&lt;|url|&gt;)” devices.

Erica keeps things separate, which appears to make her personal device a bit more controlled overall. Which isn’t to say she doesn’t get stuff done on her own iPhone: to the contrary, the thing is loaded with travel apps, Duolingo, and Todoist. You’ll notice Slack is there, but it’s not used for what you’d think.

Our conversation helped me remember how personal phones can be useful, sensible tools like other gadgets, meaning they don’t have to be notification-loaded monsters that erode your sense of well-being. (Er, not that I’m projecting.)

*What follows is our chat, edited for length and clarity.*

![](<|image|>)

### **OneZero: Tell me a little bit about how this home screen is structured. It looks like you have everything you need, it’s organized by color — you’ve put a lot of thought into this.**

**Erica Joy Baker: **I would say that’s correct. It’s definitely organized by color, and it’s all the stuff that I need to have handy. Except for Coinbase. I have that because my partner works at Coinbase.

I have eight more screens of apps, but the ones on my home screens are the ones I use the most, except for Todoist. That’s aspirational.

### **I think that’s what I got from [Farhad](&lt;|url|&gt;), too. He had, like, 150 Todoist items. You only have three. Do you check in on that every day, or do you just let it sit there?**

Since I started working at Microsoft, I’m trying to figure out how I’m going to handle my to-dos. The thing I like about Todoist is, I have an [IFTTT](&lt;|url|&gt;) thing happening. When I tell my watch, “remind me to do blah blah blah,” it transfers to Todoist. I forget stuff all the time. That’s working really well with Todoist, but I don’t know how to set that up using all Microsoft things.
> # “I’m very aggressive about my boundaries, my work-life balance. When I put my work phone down, I’m away from work.”

### **Do you feel a lot of pressure to use Microsoft apps because you work there?**

I mean, it’s important to use the apps that your co-workers are creating and dog food what your company is selling. I don’t feel pressure. It’s not like, “oh you must use these!”* *But it’s like, if I’m working here, I want to use them.

My work phone has all the Microsoft stuff on it. I like to keep a very clear line between work and personal. I’m very aggressive about my boundaries, my work-life balance. When I put my work phone down, I’m away from work.

### **For me, there’s no boundary. My Slack is on my personal phone. I’ll be hanging out with my partner and it’s like, hey, I’m getting a Slack message. That divide just isn’t there. There’s no membrane between those spaces on my phone.**

When I was working at Slack, I had work Slack on my personal phone. I’m in, like, eleventy thousand Slack groups. One of them was my work Slack, so I had that on my personal phone. Like you said, I couldn’t disconnect from work. It’s an unhealthy way to be, for me anyway.

If you’re around, people will talk to you. I did an experiment at one point. I wanted to see what would happen if I sent messages at 11:00 p.m. And people responded. I was like, this isn’t healthy. We should all be in bed or watching Netflix. At that point, I took it off my phone. It’s important to detach. You need that separate time to reset. When your brain is idling, it comes up with the best ideas.

### **But you do still have Slack on your personal device.**

That’s all friends. We use Teams at Microsoft. So, I have the eng-manager Slack, the Oakland Tech Equity Slack, org-camp, the “ex” Slack — a Slack for people who used to work at Slack — one for a nonprofit that’s starting up right now… They’re all not-work Slacks.

### **Do you get notifications from Slack?**

I’m pretty sure I have them off. I’m very anti-notification. I turn off notifications for most apps. I’ll probably turn them off for Todoist, because I don’t really use that right now.

Instagram can send me notifications. The default messages app can send me notifications. Signal can send me notifications. That’s it. I don’t allow notifications. I think they’re invasive. I will check the thing when I’m ready to check the thing. I won’t be beholden to my phone telling me to look at a thing.

Have you talked to people about the [grayscaling of their screens](&lt;|url|&gt;)?

### **Yeah.**

I do that whenever I’m feeling like I’m spending too much time on my phone.

### **Part of me is a little frustrated that we’ve even had to come up with that workaround. The onus shouldn’t really be on the end-user to solve an issue with distraction, or if the device is harmful in some way. But maybe there’s no way to build in something better. I’ve wondered about that.**

Many tech companies want you to always be looking at your phone. They thrive on your addiction to their things. Even Apple isn’t going to come up with a way to make you less addicted. Imagine if you were like, “Oh, I don’t need to get a new iPhone because I barely pick up the one I have.”

### **Right. Have you found that working in tech has changed how you view your relationship with your phone?**

I started working in tech in 2001. I was at Google when the first Android phone came out. My relationship with my phone is very tied to my relationship with tech.
> # “My phone is pretty chill. I’ve made my phone not stressful.”

### **Do you use your phone differently from friends you have who don’t work in tech?**

I live in San Francisco. What friends do I have who don’t work in tech?

*[Laughs]*

But my sister uses her phone very differently. She doesn’t have all the productivity things. She’s got games for her kids to play. Picture stuff. Photo editing.

### **The home screen you have here does seem very geared toward productivity. You have a folder that’s just for travel apps on your dock. Is that just to fill a need?**

That’s exactly it. There’s TripIt, HotelTonight when I have a last-minute trip, all the different airline apps for when I check in. There’s another page of Airbnb, Curb, Via. I fly around too much, quite honestly, so I have to have those there literally always.

### **What is the app you use to have fun and unwind? Is there one, or do you unwind away from your phone?**

Netflix. It’s what I fall asleep to at night. I put on *Parks and Recreation* and fall asleep.

### **So you’re not one of these [phone-out-of-the-bedroom people](&lt;|url|&gt;)?**

No. No, no, no. I don’t have work stuff on my phone, but I don’t think I have to *not* have my phone in my bedroom. My phone is pretty chill. I’ve made my phone not stressful.

### **Anything else before we wrap up?**

It’s interesting you didn’t ask about The Wing. Not many people are going to have that.

### **You know, I saw that. The icon stood out to me. And then I think I got distracted by the green of Duolingo. Tell me about it.**

The Wing is like a co-working space for women. But they have other stuff. They have interesting events. There’s a fireside chat with London Breed, the mayor of San Francisco. I want to remember to open that — if I put it on a different screen, I’d forget about it. Since it’s on my home screen, I remember to open it and look.

### **I’m glad you brought that up. Thank you for taking the time to have this conversation.**

Thank you.

# Hell Is Other People’s Feeds

## Forget the online filter bubble. It’s the network that makes your world so hellish.

![Photo by [George Pagan III](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [George Pagan III](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Search for the phrase “we live in hell” on Twitter, and you’ll find plenty of people attesting to its validity. The phrase is ubiquitous. Hell is where a U.S. senator posts [pictures of a deposed dictator](&lt;|url|&gt;) in his last moments of life. Hell is where real life feels exactly [like an old headline](&lt;|url|&gt;) from the *Onion*. Hell is where you find out [who Belle Delphine is](&lt;|url|&gt;), that she [sells her bathwater](&lt;|url|&gt;) to men online, and that [she’s only 19](&lt;|url|&gt;). And in hell, O.J. Simpson is [definitely tweeting about](&lt;|url|&gt;) the Democratic debate.

Hell is where Donald Trump [gets basic facts](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the Revolutionary War wrong, where he [jokingly tells Vladimir Putin](&lt;|url|&gt;) not to meddle in the next U.S. election, and where he [meets with meme creators](&lt;|url|&gt;) at the White House. In hell, [Proud Boys roam](&lt;|url|&gt;) the streets of D.C., and white men [feel persecuted by](&lt;|url|&gt;) a rainbow sidewalk. It’s where right-wing psychologist Jordan Peterson [hangs out in Congress](&lt;|url|&gt;) and where QAnon stans [believe John F. Kennedy Jr.](&lt;|url|&gt;) will return from the dead.
> # It’s not just that a bunch of things suck — that’s been the case throughout human history. What emerges as a clear connecting theme is that many things that suck are also completely baffling.

Hell is also where kids are [being kept in cages](&lt;|url|&gt;) at the U.S. border and where someone [builds a float](&lt;|url|&gt;) to celebrate it. It’s where one parent has to [work three jobs](&lt;|url|&gt;) just to afford his daughter’s prom dress and where others [throw cheese slices](&lt;|url|&gt;) at their kids’ faces. In hell, [schools that fear](&lt;|url|&gt;) mass shooters [install surveillance microphones](&lt;|url|&gt;) that purportedly detect anger and aggression.

It’s not just that a bunch of things suck — that’s been the case throughout human history. What emerges as a clear connecting theme is that many things that suck are also completely baffling. Scrolling through search results for the phrase reveals a stream of bewilderment and, to an extent, helplessness: “I want nothing to do with this! I had nothing to do with this!” But the opposite is true.

One way we’ve sought to explain this general feeling that things come out of nowhere is to revert to the idea of filter bubbles, those self-reinforcing invisible walls purportedly constructed around us as we consume content online. The idea is familiar by now: that confirmation bias, either by a social media algorithm or our own brains, limits what we see and thus makes information or events that emerge from outside that bubble seemingly inexplicable or at least unexpected.

But this might be too simplistic an interpretation of what’s going on, and it might be too short-sighted as well. The idea of a filter bubble assumes we are constantly being shown things we will agree with or that reinforce our opinions when what’s really going on is less complicated. We’re simply being shown things that will keep us engaged, which is less about giving us things we like than it is about prompting us to make a choice — not between disengaging and engaging but rather between the kind of engagement.

Do we want to “like” it? Quote-tweet it? Subscribe to the channel? Listen to something similar? Get our own car or a pooled ride? Swipe left or right? Write a review? Pick an emoji? Rank it? Heart it? Star it? The filter bubble would have us believe that each of these engagements creates our own individual hell, but it’s more likely we’re busily creating hell for everyone else, too. That’s because we’re not insulated from other people but instead deliberately exposed to the impacts of everyone else’s decisions.

The choices we regularly make that create the customized, individualized experience tech firms sell as consumer freedom — any show we watch on Netflix, a route we take in an Uber, a hotel we reserve on Expedia, a book we buy on Amazon — are each a new weave in an endless fabric of data in the vast global network connecting billions of people.

Our engagement is constantly algorithmically measured against itself as well as against others on the network. It’s [A/B testing](&lt;|url|&gt;) on a mass scale. Everything is constant flux, but the changes are virtually imperceptible to the user. This may mean we end up seeing unique versions of the same content, but that personalization is brief and misleading. It’s not for us, necessarily; it’s to measure our decisions in pursuit of a more engaging overall system.
> # Every decision we make is a decision made for someone else. On and on it goes, a human butterfly effect that shapes new realities as each node in the network engages.

Which means that, as personalized as our online experience may feel, it’s not. Every decision we make, in perhaps only a very small way, is a decision made for someone else. On and on it goes, a human butterfly effect that shapes new realities as each node in the network engages. The overall result is weird. We learn of things we didn’t know. We see things we’ve never seen before. But misinformation also spreads. Conspiracies abound. Surveillance is normalized. Inequalities deepen. Policy decisions seem increasingly ad hoc or responsive to a separate reality. Entire microeconomies are created based purely on who can most influence the buttons we press on a screen.

It’s confusing no matter our ideology or partisanship and irritating — not because it reflects our biases or worldviews but because it usually doesn’t. The experience we’re supposed to own and control suddenly doesn’t feel that way. What’s reflected back to us from our screens is disorienting, not affirming.

Still, faced repeatedly with each new reality created by the infinite decisions made on our networks, we continue to accept the notion that total disengagement is not a choice. And for many it isn’t. So we do more of the same, often venting our frustrations about the world we’re seeing back into the network that helped create it — declaring, for instance, that it must be hell.

Then again, maybe it really is. After all, we’re [now growing](&lt;|url|&gt;) “horns.”<|endoftext|>

# Here’s What’s on Ben Horowitz’s iPhone

## The Andreessen Horowitz co-founder talks crypto, notifications, and more

![](<|image|>)

*This is “What’s on Your Home Screen?” a Q&A column from *OneZero*. We want to understand more about how people use their smartphones — those life-consuming devices we dump hours into every day — to pave a way toward a better future. Or at least a more reflective one. We’ll add new entries regularly, and each will feature a new interview with a notable person about the apps they use, how they’re organized, and whether those red bubbles drive them nuts.*

It’s not much of a statement to say Ben Horowitz is one of the most powerful people in technology. Water is wet; the sky is blue.

A co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Horowitz has been connected to major investments in companies like Facebook, Pinterest, Skype, Airbnb, Foursquare, Coinbase, Soylent, GitHub, Lyft, Imgur, and, yes, *Medium*. (Disclosure!) So he knows a thing or two about trendspotting.

With all of that in mind, I wanted to learn more about how he uses his phone. Is his home screen filled with things Andreessen Horowitz has invested in? (Yes.) Does he seem to think these are legitimately useful services? (Also yes.) Given the company’s reputation, is he constantly glued to his phone? (No. He even turns it off from time to time.)

*What follows is our chat, edited for length and clarity.*

![](<|image|>)

### **OneZero: So to start off with, you’ve got this image of your wife Felicia from the cover of [*Modern Luxury Silicon Valley](&lt;|url|&gt;) *as your background image. Why this picture?**

**Ben Horowitz: **Because that’s her favorite picture. She seems to like it — she’s happy with that on my phone.

### **She’s kind of calling the shots on your wallpaper.**

Well, you know, you just try and make your spouse happy as best you can.

### **So, getting into the actual apps here, I noticed you have a number of crypto apps. You have Anchorage, which your firm invested in, you have Coinbase — clearly, this is an area of interest.**

We’re invested in Coinbase, also. But it’s my personal crypto account. Because we were in it so early, I only invested, I think, 100 grand, but I’ve got several million dollars of crypto now, so I’ve got to keep track of it. And it’s a convenient way for me to keep track of the prices and the market.

Anchorage is different. That’s like a work tool. They provide a kind of custody for crypto accounts, and they are the custody provider for our crypto fund. So I need to keep track of that. It’s kind of part of my job.

### **How often are you checking in on these two?**

I would say at most once a day, and at least once every couple weeks, depending on how busy I am. It’s kind of like checking the stock market or something like that — it’s not like it gives you tremendous information to act on, but it’s fun to do.

### **So you’re not obsessed with the swings of the market.**

No, I’ve learned from being a public company CEO [at Loudcloud] that the stock market is rarely reflective of anything in the short-term, and the crypto market is even less so.

### **You mentioned you’ve invested in Coinbase, and I noticed of course that you have Caffeine, but not Twitch, on your home screen. You’ve invested in that, so tell me: Why is Caffeine better, and what do you watch on it?**

Caffeine is a little different than Twitch. It’s real time, so you can actually interact with the people who are streaming, and it works in a way that just doesn’t on Twitch because of the delay. And that opened us up to stuff that I watch. I’m not that big an esports watcher, but I do like to watch the guys commentate over the X Games and the football season, the FOX football games, stuff like that. I find that much better than watching the actual announcers.

Twitch is really a viewing platform. The community stuff is mostly weird or hostile. Caffeine is more like people talking to each other and so forth — it’s kind of neat in that way.

### **And you’re clearly a big music guy. I’m curious about whether you see potential for something adjacent to Caffeine or Twitch for music performances.**

You mean live music?

### **Yeah, exactly.**

Theoretically, it ought to work. People love live music. But people do not watch live music on television, for the most part — never have. And so then the question is, okay, technologically what’s the thing that will work for live music? It’s hard to say, but I think it ends up being some combination of something like Caffeine plus VR.

The thing that’s missing when you watch it on TV is the feeling. It’s hard to describe — it just doesn’t make you feel like you’re part of the concert. So much of going to a concert is listening to music with other people who like that same music. You need that, I think, in order for it to work. Otherwise, the record sounds better, right?

I think it is going to happen. It’s hard to predict exactly how these things take off, but I would guess that it’s either a small-scale, community-type concert, which is easier to show on a screen or virtual reality. I don’t know if you have the [Oculus Quest](&lt;|url|&gt;)? It’s an awesome product.

### **It is cool.**

You can definitely see how in something like the Quest, a concert would really work. I do think it’s going to happen, but I’m not aware of anything working yet in that arena.

### **Got it, okay. What else are you super into on your phone?**

DAZN [“Da Zone”] is astoundingly good for boxing. They not only have all the European fights that you can’t get here, they also have GGG, they have Canelo. It’s starting to seem like that’s where the future of boxing goes — whatever it is, $10 a month for everything.

### **So you watch boxing on your phone?**

Yeah. And then Genius, Genius’ Verified things are unbelievable. For me as a hip-hop fan, the way the music has been treated in the modern world through things like TMZ and even YouTube and so forth — it’s a little bit disgusting. It’s designed to make everybody look like an asshole. Kanye had a great line, like, if you put Michelangelo on TMZ, he’d look like an asshole. It’s just horrible how these guys run their businesses and what it does to the art form.

Genius is kind of the opposite of that. It treats the lyrics like they’re in a museum and explains them in the proper context.

Not every hip-hop person is a great artist, but I’d rather it go that way than the other way, which is to make every great artist look silly. They have this thing, Genius Verified, where they interview people about the meaning of their lyrics, and it’s amazing. I was just watching one where this guy YNW Melly — he’s like the Ted Bundy of rap, he, like, [murdered his friends](&lt;|url|&gt;) and all these things — but I was watching his Verified from before that happened, and it’s very clear he’s schizophrenic. Like very clear. He talks about it in the video and here’s this guy, with an undiagnosed, serious mental health issue, and then it’s all right there. No one else gets into that level of things.

[Rumors about YNW Melly’s mental health [have indeed circulated for months](&lt;|url|&gt;), in part because of his interview on Genius.]

### **To be honest, I just thought it was a lyrics app. I have to check this out.**

No, no, no. You click on it and get the meaning of the lyrics, and some of them are super deep. The lyrics part is the simple part.

### **So, moving down the screen here — you have 76 Pinterest notifications. I was curious about what’s going on here.**

I probably need to manage my Pinterest notifications better, but mostly what I look up on Pinterest is recipes. They just have freaking ultimate pictures of stuff when it comes to recipes. Particularly for the things that I like to make, like cakes and barbecue. I should probably clear my notifications — it’s just sloppiness on my part.
> # “At certain times, I just turn off my whole phone.”

### **I think your notifications seem pretty under control. There’s a lot on Pinterest, you’ve got some email, but for the most part, there aren’t that many. How do you approach your phone to not feel overloaded?**

I do turn off most notifications — that is one thing that’s helpful. But for me, at certain times, I just turn off my whole phone. That makes it easier to not be entirely distracted. But particularly as a venture capitalist, it’s such an incoming, real-time job, so it is tricky. If you don’t have space away from it… you just have to be careful about how you are able to think about long-term issues. In life, you want to be more initiating things than reacting, in general.

### **I’m shocked to hear that you turn your phone off. I don’t know when the last time I turned my phone off is — which probably says something really sad about me, I guess. Do you turn your phone off every day? When? What’s the situation here?**

Maybe a couple hours after dinner, I just turn it off. Because otherwise, I could literally be on it all night.

# The History of the Taser Shows Tech Can’t Fix Policing

## Fifty years after development began, the supposedly nonlethal Taser has failed to reduce the use of firearms by police

![Credit: PaulFleet/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: PaulFleet/Getty Images*

You hear a click, like the sound of a pencil being snapped. That click — and the searing pain that accompanies it — are nearly instantaneous, but your mind tricks you into thinking that there’s a distinct period between them.

When a Taser shock hits you, no matter how much you expect it, it comes as a surprise — a literal shock, like a baseball bat swung hard and squarely into the small of your back. That sensation, which is actually two sharp steel barbs piercing your skin and shooting electricity into your central nervous system, is followed by the harshest, most violent spasm you can imagine coursing through your entire body. With the pain comes the terrifying awareness that you are completely helpless. You lose control of almost everything, and the only place you can go is down, face first to the floor.

The whole thing lasts five seconds — but it feels like an eternity.

I had just spent several hours interviewing employees in the Scotts­dale, Arizona, headquarters of the wildly successful, publicly traded company that makes Tasers, and the company’s main press officer asked me if I’d like to take a spin. For whatever reason, I voluntarily subjected myself to being shocked by the company’s signature product.

As soon as it was over, I began to ask myself for the first time: Is a weapon this powerful really necessary for police to do their work safely? Many cops would say yes, of course: The purpose of Tasers is to dis­able and immobilize unruly suspects without shooting them. Tasers give police another option that is less likely to kill someone than a gun. Tasers make police safer.

But the deeper I looked into the history and use of Tasers, the flimsier this reasoning seemed.

A physicist and business executive named Jack Cover invented the Taser in the late 1960s after reading newspaper stories about police officer–involved killings, as well as a piece in the *Los Angeles Times* describing a man being subdued by an electric fence. That was Cover’s inspiration, in fact — an electric fence that could be shot out of a firearm, rather than bullets. Cover was so confident in his idea that he quit his high-paying job as an airline executive to develop his product.

First dubbed the TSER (named after his favorite young adult novella, *Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle*), Cover later added an extra A to the acronym for the sake of pronunciation. The product wasn’t an immediate success. It took more than a decade of marketing before Cover landed his first major account, selling a couple hundred Tasers to the Los Angeles Police Department in 1980.

LAPD brass were looking for a way to prevent police-involved killings after the death of Eula Love. Police officers shot and killed the 39-year-old mother in 1979 after she brandished a kitchen knife in a police altercation over unpaid bills. The killing sparked protests around the city, and politicians and citizens alike were eager to find a nonlethal alternative to firearms. They believed they found it in the Taser.

But it didn’t exactly work out that way, for two reasons.

First, officers latched onto Tasers not in place of firearms, but as an alternative to bodily contact. The hallucinogenic drug PCP was at an apex around the time Tasers were introduced, and while the drug’s users wouldn’t usually put cops in mortal danger, they would occasionally overheat, strip nude, and generally need to be detained. Cops wanted some kind of tool that would allow them to subdue folks high on PCP without having to lay hands on them. The Taser did the trick.
> # These technologies have turned out to be expensive stopgaps that give the police a sheen of forward­-thinking pragmatism.

But cops weren’t about to bring a Taser to a gunfight—or, for that matter, a knife fight. They were primarily interested in them for circumstances where hand-to-hand combat wouldn’t really give them the upper hand against a suspect. As a result, Tasers weren’t doing much to reduce shootings.

And Tasers themselves did not prove to be as nonlethal as promised. Cover himself admitted as much nearly from the beginning, writing in 1975 that there “is no weapon, technique, or procedure for subduing, constraining, or dispersing that does not involve some risk of injury to healthy persons or of death, especially if the individual has a heart ailment.”

Cover was never able to bring his invention into the mainstream on his own, even after the LAPD deal. But a pair of brothers from Scottsdale, Arizona, named Rick and Tom Smith, did. After working with Cover to update his design, they sold the Taser and modifications of it to nearly every one of the country’s 18,000 police departments. The Smiths eschewed Cover’s admission about Tasers being potentially lethal and instead branded them as “nonlethal” weapons without hesitation.

That myth and the theory that Tasers would reduce firearms use would both be disproven. By 2019, the website [Truth… Not Tasers](&lt;|url|&gt;) had become the world’s main repository of reported Taser-involved deaths in the absence of any government agency taking the role. That site has counted more than 1,000 deaths that followed suspects being Tasered. And after studying 36,112 use-of-force incidents, University of Chicago researchers determined in 2018 that Tasers do not reduce police use of firearms — at all. Published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the [study](&lt;|url|&gt;) tracked Taser use by the Chicago Police Department between 2010 and 2018 and found that use of firearms did not change over that eight-year period.

So the Taser failed at its two principal functions — to provide a nonlethal alternative to firearms and to reduce the use of firearms in general. Yet police departments across the country still spend millions of dollars on them. The Smith brothers now control a company called Axon Enterprise that holds a virtual monopoly on Taser production and has a market cap of $2.76 billion. And police-community relations are as bad as ever.

Tasers are just one of many examples in which police put their faith in technology, expecting it to solve the mas­sive, seemingly intractable problems inherent to their work. We’ve seen this same kind of blind optimism concerning body cameras, Compstat, predictive policing, cellphone trackers, and even surveillance cameras. Leaving aside the important privacy concerns that have been raised about some of these technologies, in many cases they simply don’t do what they’re supposed to do. More often than not, the technologies have turned out to be expensive stopgaps that give the police a sheen of forward­-thinking pragmatism while in fact steering them away from the kinds of fundamental reforms that could make a real difference on the ground.

Technology can be useful, of course; there are circumstances in which Tasers have helped to [de­escalate confrontations](&lt;|url|&gt;), in which body cameras have helped to [clarify details of tense interactions](&lt;|url|&gt;), in which data have helped to better target [crime hot spots](&lt;|url|&gt;). But an overreliance on these technologies overlooks the real issues.

When people protest officer-involved shootings, they are protesting serious, deeply entrenched problems: the leniency given to officers who instigate violence, the disparity in arrest rates between blacks and whites, the overpolicing of the poor, and the lack of trans­parency in any situation deemed by prosecutors to involve potential investigative evidence. In essence, they protest injustice — and injustice is a problem that technology will never be able to solve.

# What Happens to Religion When We Find Aliens?

## What Happens to Religion When We Find Aliens?

### A Rabbi, an Imam, and a Christian theologian on what life in space could mean for the spiritual

![Photo: shaunl/E+/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: shaunl/E+/Getty*

When Galileo first placed his eye to the cold metal of his telescope, he had no idea of the significance of the worlds he would discover: In a divinely orchestrated ballet, four points of light moved around the planet Jupiter. The discovery of Jupiter’s four moons meant that celestial bodies don’t solely revolve around Earth. It provided further support for the proposal that Earth was not — as many believed — the center of our universe. The discovery was so disturbing to the Christian church that Galileo was subjected to an inquisition and forced to spend the rest of his life under house arrest.

More than four centuries have passed since 1610, when Galileo first spotted the four moons, and our understanding of the cosmos is unprecedented by comparison. Today, NASA’s Kepler spacecraft has discovered nearly 4,000 planets orbiting around other stars. After almost 60 years of exploring — including up-close imagery by multiple spacecrafts — we now know there is water throughout the solar system. And where there is water, so might there be life.

It’s easy to imagine that a discovery of life in another world might cause an uproar among people of faith. Did God also create that life? What does it mean if the organism is not carbon-based like we are?

“This idea, that we are the main thing going on and everything revolves around us, has shaped a lot of attitudes in the monotheistic religions,” says Dr. Richard Mouw, an evangelical Christian and theologian at Fuller Seminary in Pasadena, Calif. Mouw is one of three religious leaders I spoke to for this column.

“The idea of life on other worlds or other planets would simply be affirmation of what Christians and Jews have always believed,” says Mouw, arguing that panic over extraterrestrial life is unwarranted. “He (God) created galaxies and all the rest of it—none of that should be shocking to us.”
> # “I think it would expand our appreciation of God’s universe.”

Cosmic Pluralism—the belief that many worlds, planets, moons, and even the sun could contain life—is a centuries-old philosophical belief that appeared heavily in Islam in the medieval era. The belief system is still relevant in modern Islam, says Dr. Muzammil Siddiqi, an Imam and director of the Islamic Society of Orange County. “I personally don’t see any problem with life finding life on other words,” he says. “In Islam, the belief is that God created the whole universe and has taken care of everything, and every being that might exist.”

Rabbi Elliot Dorff, a professor of philosophy at the American Jewish University, says Judaism also agrees with this concept. “The appreciation of God should be even greater given that we are now finding other planets, let alone all the other galaxies,” he says. “If there happens to be life on one of those other planets, then it would simply affirm God’s role in creating the universe.”

Scripture from Islam, Judaism, and Christianity say similar things about the beginning of our planet: God created the heavens and Earth in six days. And while this interpretation varies depending on the faith, all three scholars I spoke to believe this timeline is meant to serve as a metaphor. These are not human days that last 24 hours, but divine days that can range from 1,000 human days to millennia. Interpreting the texts non-literally allows room for the expansion of the universe, the birth and death of stars, planetary formation, and evolution on Earth; it also makes room for life to exist on another planetary body.

Intelligent life, however, might pose a different issue altogether.

“I think the idea of intelligent life is the real challenge because we consider ourselves fallen human beings,” says Mouw. “Jesus came to save the human beings, but what about creatures on other planets?”

Dr. Siddiqi says Islam finds no issue with intelligent life existing anywhere in the universe, except in human form. “Human beings are on Earth, and God created human beings for Earth,” he says. “So nobody [believes] that there are human beings on other planets, but other creatures or bacterial life, yes.” The Quran specifically states that humans are designed as we exist now, and created solely for Earth, says Dr. Siddiqi. This is why, he says, many Muslim people don’t accept evolution. Intelligent life, generally, could very well exist in Islam: “We know very little of the creation of God, but there is a vast kingdom,” says Siddiqi.

Rabbi Elliot says that if we are ever contacted, “I think it would expand our appreciation of God’s universe.”
> # “We ought to be thinking about how to educate people of faith for the very real possibility that we will discover life.”

When 84 percent of the world’s population believes in God and subscribes to a religious belief, it’s important to anticipate what people’s reactions to extraterrestrial life might look like. NASA has taken this question seriously. In 2016 the agency awarded a million dollar grant to the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton, N.J. Several theologians were tasked with thinking about how finding life could affect the ways that a majority of believers, particularly Christians, will think about God. The announcement of the grant caused controversy, with critics fearing that NASA was siding with Christian beliefs and not taking into account other faiths’ views. (NASA and the Center of Theological Inquiry did not respond to my requests for an update.)

Science and religion are two parties that need to be talking, says Dr. Mouw. “We ought to be thinking about how to educate people of faith for the very real possibility that we will discover life,” he says. “We need to do the spiritual and theological and scientific education of the faith communities to get ready for that. Otherwise we’re going to end up with very vocal people in our community who are either in denial or feel somehow that their faith has been deeply threatened. Both of those are the wrong responses.”

All three major faiths have scripture to back up the possible discovery of life, intelligent or not. Maybe the secular world will have more to contend with if evidence of life is ever discovered. Or, perhaps such a discovery will answer some of humanity’s biggest questions. After all, who among us has not wondered whether we are alone in the universe?

Carl Sagan once wrote that “science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.” While answers remain unknown, Dr. Mouw agrees with Sagan that there is much that science and faith share. “We should not pit ourselves against the Carl Sagans of the world,” he says. “Instead, we ought to take delight in the fact that even if we disagree about the ultimate nature of reality, we share this profound sense of mystery and awe of the cosmos in which we find ourselves.”<|endoftext|>

# Prison Time Is the Answer to Tech’s Privacy Crisis

## The executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project lays out a strategy to regulate tech companies like Facebook

![Photo: fongfong2/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: fongfong2/Getty Images*

It’s just the “cost of doing business.” I first heard that phrase as we mulled over my client’s plea deal. Evidently, when you run a multinational company, you pay a lot of bills that would give the rest of us sticker shock. One of them was a multibillion-dollar fine for price-fixing.

I was just a few months out of Harvard Law, working at one of the top law firms in New York, and I felt like I was staring through the looking glass. I had naively assumed that these record penalties would stun my clients, but I was wrong. In the end, navigating antitrust violations was just another business negotiation.

Sound familiar? Facebook was hit with a [$5 billion fine](&lt;|url|&gt;) from the Federal Trade Commission earlier this month for mishandling user data — a decision that sent the company’s stock [soaring](&lt;|url|&gt;), perhaps because [Facebook anticipated the fine](&lt;|url|&gt;) and budgeted against it months ago in its first-quarter earnings report.

With [potential antitrust action](&lt;|url|&gt;) against Facebook and other tech companies on the horizon, it may be worth thinking beyond money. One thing actually did keep my clients up at night — a strategy that had huge success in fighting price-fixing and that we may need now to combat the tech sector’s growing list of privacy abuses: jail time.
> # In a world where products are increasingly available for free, our privacy is the only measure of their true cost.

At its heart, antitrust law is a question of power. It’s the calculus of how the government can intervene just enough to make sure that large, established firms don’t use their sheer size to strangle infant competitors in the cradle. More simply, it’s about keeping the “free” in “free markets.” Lawmakers in the Gilded Age created the antitrust laws that we still enforce today, pushing back against the ever-present incentive to conspire and cheat consumers out of the benefits of competition: product variety, low prices, and, these days, privacy. But in a world where products are increasingly available for free, our privacy is the only measure of their true cost, which lawmakers couldn’t possibly have anticipated in the 19th century.

The Sherman Act outlawed antitrust violations in 1890, but during its first 84 years, those crimes were considered [misdemeanors](&lt;|url|&gt;). Theoretically, a violation could land you in prison for as long as a year, but the law was rarely enforced. There wasn’t a single conviction [from 1921 all the way to 1959](&lt;|url|&gt;). That means throughout the boom times of the Roaring ’20s and the postwar expansion, periods when antitrust violations were rampant, the competition cop was asleep on the beat.

In 1955, Congress edged the penalties upward, raising the maximum fine to all of [$50,000](&lt;|url|&gt;). It wasn’t enough to stem the tide of price-fixing — the international cartels inflated the price of everything from produce to petroleum products — so Congress raised the fines again in [1974](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [1984](&lt;|url|&gt;) to reach sums in the millions. And it didn’t stop there. Criminal antitrust fines against corporations skyrocketed from $1.6 billion in the 1990s to more than [$4 billion in the 2000s](&lt;|url|&gt;). Average antitrust conviction rates rose from 37% in the 1990s to over [80%](&lt;|url|&gt;) by 2009.

But even these massive penalties still weren’t enough to stop the seemingly endless string of price-fixing conspiracies. As the [Government Accountability Office found](&lt;|url|&gt;), 1) prosecutors had a hard time calculating fines, 2) collection efforts were spotty, and 3) many defendants completely failed to pay. The turning point came in 2004, with the passage of the [Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act](&lt;|url|&gt;) (ACPERA), which increased the maximum sentence for antitrust violations to 10 years in prison. Congress understood that fines alone are ineffective in tackling antitrust violations. As a result, the average antitrust prison sentence went from eight months to [more than two years](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Following years of high-profile criminal prosecutions, with more and more executives ending up behind bars, the impact was clear: Price-fixing declined. In 2018, the number of price-fixing and other criminal antitrust violations declined to [less than a quarter](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the peak 2011 level. This history makes clear what DOJ has said itself, “[that the most effective way to deter and punish cartel activity is… jail sentences](&lt;|url|&gt;).” If the potential penalties are limited to fines — no matter how large — these corporations will factor them in as merely a cost of doing business.

Right now, some of the largest U.S. tech firms necessitate more drastic action. Privacy breaches reveal our secrets and compromise our elections; they undermine civil society and put millions of Americans at risk. We must have punishments proportional to this threat; we must put the worst privacy offenders in jail.

As someone who has represented criminal defendants throughout my career — including both white-collar executives and alleged “terrorists” — I’m loath to expand our system of mass incarceration. Yet some acts of corporate maleficence are so harmful, and the executives who drive them so insulated, that there may be no other way to protect the public.
> # It is the power of predictable, regularly enforced criminal penalties that will make tech executives reform.

Let me be clear: It’s not a question of lengthy prison sentences. As anyone who has been incarcerated can tell you, even the shortest stay in prison can be a deeply terrifying and traumatic experience. This is not a matter of terrorizing defendants with the specter of years behind bars. Instead, it is the power of predictable, regularly enforced criminal penalties that will make tech executives reform. The fear that when they endanger users, the employees responsible will be locked away, stripped of their privileges and air of immunity, and held to account.

Even if you think jail is a step too far, it’s clear that what we’re doing right now isn’t working. Fines, even massive ones, are a drop in the bucket for these historically profitable tech behemoths. In January of this year, French regulators forced Google to hand over [$57 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) for violating the EU’s GDPR privacy law. But with Google’s 2018 revenue reaching more than [$130 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year, that number hardly registered.

And, as mentioned, here in the United States, the FTC approved a record $5 billion fine against Facebook for mishandling users’ personal information. This historically large fine proves to be just about a month’s worth of revenue for the social giant, which topped [$55 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year.

But even as the fines continue to grow, the privacy breaches haven’t stopped, with many of the largest breaches unfolding in just the [past two years.](&lt;|url|&gt;) And even if the fines go higher, they’ll never be enough. For the tech executives looking to move up the ranks or meet next quarter’s growth projections, the incentives will always be there to misuse our data and abuse our trust. As long as it becomes ever easier to aggregate, analyze, and monetize the sprawling databases of personal information, the fines will be just a cost of doing business.

Like antitrust, these are corporate crimes of a different caliber. Unlike tax dodges and run-of-the-mill regulatory issues, these constitute a class of crimes that undermine the integrity of core systems upon which we all depend. Antitrust violations clearly damage how the markets operate, making it harder for all of us to conduct business. Privacy breaches are similar. They have a market effect, but they also have something more pernicious: They compromise civil society.

They make it harder for us to engage in the democratic process and interact with our neighbors. They undermine our elections. They compromise our sense of self, as individuals and as a community. This is a cost far too great to be repaid in dollars and cents. It’s a threat too large to be countered through fines and penalties. It is a danger that must be fought through the threat of imprisonment.

# Siri’s Gone M.I.A.

## But Apple still has some A.I. tricks up its sleeve

![](<|image|>)

Siri used to be one of the most important elements of Apple’s software lineup.

But at the company’s [Worldwide Developers Conference](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Monday, the virtual assistant got about as much attention as a [$999 monitor stand](&lt;|url|&gt;). Maybe less.

Siri is so central to Apple’s software that it’s the only real application you can launch with a physical button, but the most substantial new feature it’s been given since 2011 are user-built “[shortcuts](&lt;|url|&gt;),” which was launched last year.

Of course, Siri isn’t the only reason Apple develops artificial intelligence. The addition of accessibility features like Voice Control and Augmented Reality show that the company is working to refine speech understanding and computer vision. But virtual personal assistants have become a crown jewel for tech companies, a concrete marker to show how advanced these companies have become.

For some reason, Apple has stopped playing the game.

These conferences, for better or worse, have become events for large tech companies to lord their research department’s prototypes over an audience of developers hoping to piggyback off the technology for their own applications. Google and Microsoft have tried to make [big splashes](&lt;|url|&gt;) with A.I. product and prototype announcements. Even Samsung is trying to figure out new uses for its “[Bixby](&lt;|url|&gt;)” assistant.

Virtual personal assistants are the best example of this showboating. They’re easily demonstrable, and the initial success of Alexa and Siri suggests many people understand how they work. (See: “[The Octogenarians Who Love Amazon’s Alexa](&lt;|url|&gt;).”)

Last month at Microsoft Build, CEO Satya Nadella introduced an upcoming version of Cortana he promised would be far more conversational and aware of context from calendar invites and emails. A day later, Google announced an entirely hands-free workflow with the Google Assistant, which will soon process voice commands on the Pixel phones without having to connect to Google servers. On the Siri front, Apple announced… just about nothing.
> # Apple might be putting A.I. somewhere in its lineup of products, but it’s definitely not putting it in Siri.

This might be due to internal turmoil surrounding the previous development of Siri. The team developing the virtual assistant had been plagued with infighting and differing visions for the product since its launch, according to a wide-ranging report from [*The Information](&lt;|url|&gt;)* in 2018.

Earlier this year, Bill Stasior, who had run Siri since 2012, [switched](&lt;|url|&gt;) to another role at Apple. Siri is now under the command of John Giannandrea, the former head of Google’s A.I. and search teams.

Despite the shake-ups within the Siri program, Apple has been aggressively pursuing A.I. talent. Earlier this year, the company recruited Ian Goodfellow, a renowned A.I. researcher who worked under Giannandrea at Google and invented the generative adversarial network, which allows algorithms to create realistic images. Goodfellow is now director of machine learning at Apple’s special project group, according to [LinkedIn](&lt;|url|&gt;). Apple also brought on Ruslan Salakhutdinov to lead its A.I. research team in 2017 — at the time, he led work on [projects like heart rate sensing and lidar](&lt;|url|&gt;).

One major takeaway from all of this is that Apple doesn’t need a glowing light and a soothing voice to leverage A.I. for better products. During the accessibility portion of the WWDC keynote, Apple unveiled a new feature called Voice Control, where all native apps could be completely controlled by a user’s voice. It’s a similar idea to Google’s Assistant, but Apple didn’t boast about its speech-to-text processing or A.I.-backed natural language understanding.

Apple is also infusing its Augmented Reality platform with more A.I. features, as well. It’s working with Microsoft to create [*Minecraft Earth](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a version of the game where players gather materials they see in Augmented Reality and build digital structures overlaid on the real world. A player’s digital avatar is projected in AR to other players, so when someone waves in real life, their avatar does as well. Apple didn’t boast about this being an A.I. advancement, even though pose estimation is very much in the realm of A.I. research — it was just marketed as a feature for its new game.

Apple’s AR occlusion has a similar story. The company built the algorithm that outlines where objects seen through the camera are, so AR objects can “pass behind” people in a convincing manner. By building these core tools, Apple is levering its own research and product teams to create a foundation from which third-party app developers can build.

The question remains whether Apple, the first company to launch a virtual personal assistant, will be able to rehabilitate Siri — or whether Siri is ever going to be anything other than a voice platform to launch other apps.

Maybe Apple hasn’t found its “killer app” for voice yet: Data on voice speakers that’s admittedly a few years old suggests that the [most common uses](&lt;|url|&gt;) for virtual assistants are playing music and setting timers.

Either way, nothing Apple has done seems to indicate that Siri is becoming less important of a product. The new AirPods make it easier to invoke Siri, and Siri Shortcuts allows users to tailor the assistant to their specific needs.

No matter how Apple downplays the A.I. in its products, however, the silence on Siri’s core functionality is noticeable. Apple might be putting A.I. somewhere in its lineup of products, but it’s definitely not putting it in Siri.

Tech hardware is increasingly being defined by the virtual personal assistants that they’re bundled with. It’s the virtual representation of the operating system in a conversational form. Now more than ever, as Google flexes its A.I. expertise in the Google Assistant, Apple needs something to prove that there are (and will be) reasons to keep buying its products. And with this year’s WWDC as a guide, that reason won’t be Siri.<|endoftext|>

# The Pivot to Groups Poses a Major Challenge for Facebook

## A viral ‘boomer’ group floods news feeds while moderators struggle to keep up

![Illustration: Johanna Walderoff](<|image|>)*Illustration: Johanna Walderoff*

“If it’s lit AF, drop a yeet here fam,” reads the first post on my Facebook news feed. It’s been taken over by a pair of dueling groups dedicated to mocking the yawning generation gap between baby boomers and millennials. This is one glimpse at the future Facebook wants: A social experience built not around the largely public news feed, but around people organizing in semiprivate groups.

The idea is to give users more reasons to return to Facebook, beyond the unending flood of content from random publishers, random “friends,” and random friends of friends in their news feeds. In April, the company announced that it was going to redesign its service around two of its most popular features, [groups and events](&lt;|url|&gt;), in an effort to emphasize more “meaningful” communication. (You may have noticed a new tab on the Facebook mobile app that contains a feed solely of posts from the groups you’re in.) Then, in May, the company changed its news feed algorithm to [prioritize posts from your groups](&lt;|url|&gt;).

The message is clear: [sharing junky videos](&lt;|url|&gt;) with everyone you’re connected to is out. Hanging out in closed groups with like-minded people is in. Which brings us to the mega-viral “[A group where we all pretend to be boomers](&lt;|url|&gt;),” which launched in May. The group’s all about parody — Jim shares an article about a celebrity that died several years ago, people schedule events for “calling applecare at 6 am to figure out how to unlock your phone” — and more than 240,000 people have joined.

Then came the counterpunch. A few days after the boomer group was created, “[A group where we all pretend to be millennials](&lt;|url|&gt;)” sprouted up. It has fewer members — just over 5,000 — and most of them seem to be millennials themselves, with self-roasting updates about student loan debt and avocado toast.

Shortly after I joined both groups, they started to dominate my news feed. Out of a random 20 or so posts, more than half were from one of the two groups. My notifications first let me know if any of my friends posted or commented on anything in the groups. Then Facebook started alerting me to random posts strangers made. The company had replaced one kind of noise in my feed with another. The group’s very popularity made it a beast to deal with.

And not just for me, it turns out.

If Facebook’s goal is to get users to like, comment, and post more, the new strategy seems to be working. According to statistics provided to *OneZero *by the founders of the boomer group, over a 28-day period ending on July 8, people posted new updates to the group — photos, links, and text posts — more than 190,000 times. Those posts collectively received over 2.2 million comments and 2.8 million “reactions” — likes, for example — for an average of nearly 10 comments for every member. One of the group’s co-founders, Justin Richard, explains that around a thousand new people were added to the group every week after its inception, even before [the viral tweet](&lt;|url|&gt;) that led to a spike in membership.
> # “We have to be on guard,” Snider says. “We’re concerned about being unpublished arbitrarily at any moment.”

Its size has turned into a liability of sorts. The more members a group has, the harder it becomes to police content within the group. Another of the boomer group’s co-founders, Robert Joseph Snider, says this has become the single biggest obstacle to keeping the group going.

“We have to be on guard,” Snider says. “We’re concerned about being unpublished arbitrarily at any moment.”

According to [Facebook’s policies](&lt;|url|&gt;), groups can be unpublished for violating the company’s [community standards](&lt;|url|&gt;), which prohibit nudity, hate speech, and violent content. Facebook automatically flags content that it thinks might be in violation, including in groups. A moderator can manually approve the post, but if it gets reported to Facebook again by a member of the group, the company’s moderators might step in. Eventually, a group could get shut down for too many violations.

While that policy can seem aggressive to groups like the faux boomers, more problematic groups have shown the need for Facebook to move in the opposite direction. Earlier this month, [a report from *ProPublica](&lt;|url|&gt;)* revealed a private group named “I’m 10–15” made up of current and former U.S. Border Patrol agents. Members made jokes about migrant deaths, flinging burritos at Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during a visit, and other heinous topics. That group had over 9,500 members — a far cry from what the boomer group deals with, yet still a challenging number of people to moderate. Facebook’s automated tools operate inside private groups, where members are subject to the same community standards as everyone else, but they still rely on group leaders to handle reports and keep things clean. If members or admins don’t report (or even encourage) offensive content, it can be hard for Facebook to find out about it.

A Facebook spokesperson tells *OneZero* that its machine learning moderation is key to dealing with content that violates its policies. The company has hired over 30,000 people to its safety and security teams, many of whom work on developing better-automated tools to flag content and send it to group admins to deal with.

Those tools can’t come soon enough. Earlier this year, [a report from the* Verge](&lt;|url|&gt;) *detailed the grueling conditions of contractors charged with manually reviewing disturbing content reported to Facebook. Employees making less than $30,000 a year are required to view some of the worst the internet has to offer. If Facebook could automate that task so each group admin deals with only a few offensive posts, rather than a single person reviewing hundreds, it might work out better for everyone in the long run.
> # “The group function is not well-suited to hundreds of thousands of people.”

But that’s a mighty big if. According to the founders of the boomer group, Facebook’s current auto-flag frequently gets things wrong. Some of the automatic content warnings they’ve been warned about include “a picture of someone’s elbow” or “minions flagged as nudity.” For a group with a few hundred members, the occasional false alarm isn’t likely to be a problem. With a quarter million, it’s a lot tougher.

“The group function is not well-suited to hundreds of thousands of people,” says Richard.

Facebook disagrees. A company spokesperson says its tools work for groups of all sizes and topics. Of course, it relies on group moderators to use those tools: The boomer group’s viral growth means moderators are forced to handle a disproportionately large number of people.

Its founders complain that Facebook is unclear on just how much wiggle room there is before a group gets banned. The site provides a dashboard where admins can see how many posts have been auto-flagged — the boomer group had over 60 community standard violations at the time of writing — but little info on what those violations are or how close they are to the point of no return. “I wish they didn’t auto-flag things and gave us more transparency about our group being at risk of being unpublished,” says Snider.

In order to keep up with the flood of content — and avoid the lurking specter of a ban — the boomer group has already recruited 24 content moderators of its own focused solely on managing content. Snider says it’s exhausting.

“I already have a day job, and I especially feel very exhausted [training moderators]… because the subtle nuances of toeing the line in Facebook takes months to navigate,” he says.

To prepare for the possibility that the group might disappear, the admins have already created a backup version with the same name. Over 7,000 members have already signed up for this second group, just in case, though there’s currently no activity there.

This backup is a risk in and of itself. Earlier this year, Facebook announced that in the event it bans a group or page, it [may also proactively ban](&lt;|url|&gt;) related groups that it suspects will be used to host the banned content.

And so the boomer group exposes something of a contradiction in Facebook’s policies. The social network is doing everything it can to promote groups, but the bigger they get, the more problems they present — for the moderators who control them, and for the users who face a never-ending flood of “yeets” in their news feeds.<|endoftext|>

# The Cooking App That Changed My Life

## Paprika may just do the same for you, too

![](<|image|>)

*This is “I Can’t Live Without,” a column about the apps, gadgets, and services that make all the difference.*

My mother is weirdly protective of her recipe box. The little handwritten cards can’t leave the kitchen, despite the fact that only a few of them are truly irreplaceable. I never understood why she would put so much stock in a tiny box of index cards, until I got my own.

My collection of recipes doesn’t live in a physical container, though: It’s in an app called [Paprika](&lt;|url|&gt;). And while Paprika bills itself as a “recipe manager,” it’s far more than a simple list of dishes. It’s really more like a cookbook shelf, grocery list, personal assistant, and fancy calculator rolled into one, and it’s become one of the most important apps on my phone.

Growing up, I was a picky eater — I thrived on plain, ungarnished food, and would accept nothing even remotely unfamiliar. Anything with a sauce, salsa, or vegetable was immediately suspect, and to be avoided at all costs. I’m not sure I even ate fish until I was 15.

So my poor mother — who has a passion for experimenting in the kitchen — stuck to basic meals like grilled chicken and panfried pork chops to appease my fussy palate. Occasionally she’d try to introduce me to something new, to no avail. I still remember her convincing me to try guacamole, which I spit out in defiance before I even had a chance to taste it.

In a sick twist of fate, my horizons expanded quickly after I left my mother’s house and moved to California, where I discovered the wonderful worlds of pesto, Indian food, and — yes — avocado and cilantro mashed into a vibrant paste. I still wouldn’t call myself adventurous, but my days of eating for sustenance alone were certainly over.

Unfortunately, like most lazy college grads, I had no patience for grocery shopping or cooking. My only experience in the kitchen was grilling the simple meals from my youth, which were no longer satisfying to my more evolved taste buds. So, more often than not, I caved and ordered takeout instead.
> # Without it, my fridge would probably contain nothing but condiments and beer.

Occasionally, I’d make a big push toward adulthood — I’d gather recipes from the internet and say “this is the week I’m finally going to start cooking for myself” — only to get overwhelmed at the grocery store, or forget that one crucial ingredient, and return to the Buffalo Wild Wings next to my apartment instead.

I don’t remember how I first heard about Paprika, but it quickly became one of the most crucial apps in my arsenal. Without it, my fridge would probably contain nothing but condiments and beer.

When you first download Paprika (for $4.99 on [iPhone](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Android](&lt;|url|&gt;), or $29.99 for the desktop version on [Windows](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [macOS](&lt;|url|&gt;)), you begin with an empty database. But you can quickly import recipes from just about any website, building up a list of your favorite dishes in no time. You can also type them in manually, if you have some of Grandma’s old recipe cards socked away in your drawer.

You can use Paprika to plan your meals for the week. Just tap a button, and Paprika automatically generates a grocery list for you. It’ll intelligently merge ingredients together (two 3-clove garlic listings become one 6-clove grocery item), and let you scale recipes to different serving sizes in case you need double the amount of lasagna for your dinner party on Friday. I also have Paprika on my iPad, so I can follow along with the recipe in the kitchen — the app lets you cross off steps as you go, and it will detect timers in the recipe so you can start them with one tap. It can also keep track of what’s in your pantry and when it all expires.

In other words, Paprika streamlines my two least favorite chores: grocery shopping and cooking. It’s allowed me to make food that is twice as complex than I’m used to — like [salmon with fennel and Pernod](&lt;|url|&gt;), [stuffed acorn squash with barley](&lt;|url|&gt;), or [ginger-miso striped bass in shiitake mushroom broth](&lt;|url|&gt;) — with significantly less drudgery.

I don’t want to give Paprika sole credit for my metamorphosis. I also took a single cooking class with my wife, which gave both of us the confidence to make more complex dishes. And cooking with my wife certainly made the process more enjoyable. Still, Paprika is the glue that holds it all together. Instead of debating what to make for dinner based on what we have in the fridge, or deciding what to buy while we’re rolling through the grocery store with a bored toddler, everything runs on autopilot. We take 10 minutes to pick meals from our list at the beginning of the week, and everything else is a walk in the park. What used to be a chore at the end of a long afternoon became our decompression time, where we reconnect and talk about our days. If we didn’t have Paprika, I can only imagine the tiring “what should we eat?” arguments we’d have every evening.

It’s been seven years since we started planning our meals digitally, and Paprika is as crucial to our lives as it’s ever been. Now that we have kids, time and brainpower have become life’s most rare and precious resources, and when you’re mentally and physically exhausted from chasing around a 2-year-old all day, it’s nice to look forward to a killer dinner that doesn’t require much thought to execute.

I just hope my kids don’t turn out to be as picky as I was, because I’ve become rather accustomed to restaurant-quality food at home. Plus, my mom would never let me live it down.

# The Challenges of Having Children in Space

## The Challenges of Having Children in Space

### Tech titans like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk want human beings to move off-planet, but reproducing away from Earth could be incredibly difficult

The romantic lure of space travel runs deep. It’s difficult not to look up at a sparkling night sky and wonder what it might be like to pass beyond the confines of the Earth. It’s not just science fiction — plans to colonize the moon and Mars are spreading throughout the private space industry. Jeff Bezos — who funds the rocket company Blue Origin — recently unveiled his ambitions to one day build floating space stations called O’Neill colonies. But there is one thing that is rarely discussed when we dream about a new life in the off-world colonies: what would life be like for the children.

To look deeper into this issue, Michael Oman-Reagan space anthropologist and Vanier scholar at Memorial University recently published a paper in the journal [*Futures](&lt;|url|&gt;)* where he delved into the story of a young child named David Vetter, otherwise known as “the bubble boy.” Vetter was born with a rare genetic disease called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that meant his immune system was so weak his body was always susceptible to infection. To stay safe, from the moment of his birth he had to be kept inside a sterilized plastic enclosure, to avoid exposure to germs.

![David Vetter. Credit: AcidCow](<|image|>)*David Vetter. Credit: AcidCow*

For Oman-Reagan, Vetter was the closest thing to a proxy for what life in the alien environment of space or another planet might be like.“I started to think about what his life was like in isolation and how it would be a lot like the lives of the first generation of children on Mars or even on a space station or any space settlement,” he says. “Because the environment would be deadly. He was born into a world that was toxic to him.” Even Elton John sang, “Mars ain’t no place to raise your kids.”

If we were to move to Mars or the moon, and wanted to stay there permanently, children would inevitably have to be a part of any settlement — whether as voyagers themselves, or after settlement. How would we keep them safe? What kind of life would they live? Adults would have context for why they must be kept in a protective space suit at all times, but a child born on another planet would know nothing else. The air and environment would be deadly to them, relegating them to live a life not unlike that of David Vetter.

As it happens, Vetter was kept alive by NASA technology. The chamber design originally built to house and protect moon rocks also isolated Vetter from the microbial dangers of the outside world. “His life wound up being wrapped up in a bunch of technology — specifically NASA technology,” says Oman-Reagan.
> # “That life of suffering really struck me as a way to think about children and what their life might be like on a Mars settlement.”

In 1977, engineers at NASA’s Johnson Space Center custom-built Vetter a spacesuit that would allow him to walk around outside of his enclosure. And while he only used the spacesuit a handful of times before his death in 1984, he was enthralled by going to space.

At the same, Oman-Reagan argues, “[Vetter] was really more imprisoned by this technology that NASA made for him to move around. That life of suffering really struck me as a way to think about children and what their life might be like on a Mars settlement.”

The quality of life issue raises some ethical questions about not whether it’s right to have children in space, but whether we should bring them there in the first place. If we have long-term plans of moving humankind off-world, how do we consider the lives of future generations? Even the now defunct Mars One colonization project officially advised against having children on Mars for many years, until adults could adjust to living in a deadly environment. But the discussion of having children on other worlds circles back to the same issues that exist on the Earth. What will health care be like on Mars? What if a child is born with a genetic abnormality like David Vetter — or if such a problem were detected early, what will the rights of women be to have an abortion?

Despite the complications of raising children, or even having babies on Mars or the moon, it’s worth it to consider those problems now, even though space colonization is decades or longer away. “I think because space is such a great way to get people excited about the future, it’s a really good way to talk about the kind of future we want and what we would need to do to actually make that happen,” says Oman-Reagan. “If we’re going to talk about children in space what we’re really talking about his children here today.”

By imagining settlements in space, we are not only reexamining what it means to live here on Earth, but also looking forward to the future we might want for our children — even if it’s on another planet hundreds of years from now.<|endoftext|>

# Amazon Seller&#58; ‘One Mistake Can Kill Your Career’

## Amazon Marketplace Seller: ‘One Mistake is Enough to Kill Your Career’

### Selling on the Marketplace can leave vendors feeling like ‘indentured servants.’

![Illustration: [Glenn Harvey](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Glenn Harvey](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

*Valued at nearly $1 trillion, Amazon is one of the most powerful companies in the world. The Seattle-based retail giant employs over 600,000 people and operates 100 sortation and fulfillment centers in North America, sometimes sending out as many as 1 million items per day. But Amazon does more than retail. Much more. Amazon publishes its own books and comics, finances TV shows and movies, operates a Texas wind farm, builds robots, streams music, delivers prescription meds, and operates web services for everyone from Medium to the CIA. And that’s not even counting its high-profile acquisitions, which include Twitch, IMDB, Zappos.com, and Whole Foods.*

*What’s it like working from inside the beast? *OneZero *has been talking to workers at every level of the Amazon empire to find out. Welcome to The Amazon Diaries.*

In September, Democratic presidential candidate and senator Elizabeth Warren [criticized Amazon’s position](&lt;|url|&gt;) as both a marketplace and a retailer, which she said grants it a “special information advantage” that it could use to wipe out other businesses. The implication is that Amazon’s access to vast amounts of sales data gives it a distinct (and unfair) edge over others — especially small and medium-sized retailers that are already struggling with Amazon’s scale. In March, Warren promised to use antitrust laws to “[break up](&lt;|url|&gt;)” Amazon, along with other tech giants like Facebook and Google, if elected president. As the senator [put it](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year: “You got to pick one business or the other, baby.”

Few retailers feel the sheer might of Amazon’s power like the estimated 2.5 million Amazon Marketplace sellers. These vendors do most of the actual fulfilling of the purchases on what is now the largest online retailer in the United States. [According to one analysis](&lt;|url|&gt;), the $175 billion in sales on the Amazon Marketplace accounted for 68 percent of Amazon’s total sales and 31.3 percent of e-commerce sales industry-wide in 2018. (Walmart and eBay also have third-party seller platforms.)

[An extensive report from *The Verge* last year](&lt;|url|&gt;) revealed the Marketplace to be a sort of capitalist fever dream: unceasing and treacherous competition between sellers, presided over by a seemingly arbitrary “quasi-state,” complete with its own bureaucracy and court system, all of which generated $19 billion in revenue for Amazon from seller commissions and fees in the first half of 2018.

Recently, *OneZero* spoke with one of those sellers: a small retailer in the mid-Atlantic region who has been active on the Marketplace since 2010 and spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of getting booted from the platform. As Amazon grew, Alex* grew increasingly dependent on Amazon: in 2010, when he started selling on the Marketplace, Amazon sales accounted for five percent of his revenue; today, Amazon sales account for between 40 and 50 percent. Alex described his situation as that of an “indentured servant.”

Unlike some on the Marketplace, Alex is not a manufacturer, but a distributor; he sells automotive tools like drill bits, flashlights, and spark plugs. A former traveling salesman, he started his business before the recession — “before the economy took a crap,” as he put it — to get off the road. “I used to sell on the street. I wanted to sell online so I didn’t have to leave the house every day and drive everywhere,” he said. “It was a good idea then, but unfortunately some good ideas only last a decade and not decades.”

Now, he’s increasingly concerned about will happen if Amazon decides that they don’t want to share revenue with smaller distributors like him anymore. “If they keep doing what they’re doing, ” he says, “there’s just gonna be manufacturers and Amazon and that’s it.”

*The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.*

### **OneZero: What’s the day-to-day operation of your business and how does selling on Amazon fit into that?**

**Alex:** I get up and I’m at the business by about 7 a.m every day, and then from 7 a.m. to about 8 a.m. I go through to see where the orders are, shoot emails. And then I also have to do paperwork, so I do a download on PayPal of all the orders that came in overnight because I sell on eBay, too. That usually takes a half hour to an hour. Once you’re done with that, you start shipping and looking at orders. If you realize you’re out of stuff, then you have to start placing orders. I buy from a distributor over in New Jersey for a bunch of stuff. He ships UPS same day and I’ll get it the next day, because I’m only one state over.

And then you gotta also look on the websites. There’s a lot of fake orders coming in using stolen cards, you have to know what to look for. The problem is if you ship an order purchased with a stolen credit card, eventually someone complains their card was stolen. And the credit card company takes the money right out of your bank account and gives it back to the person who had their card stolen and you’re out the item and the money. Some do still get through but the majority of them I catch.

Once I do that, then I start looking at all the things that I ship through. I ship through Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and then I have two websites, so I ship to both of those too. Amazon is the largest, eBay is the second, websites are the third, and Walmart is — I don’t even know why they’re doing it. I don’t know what they’re selling, but it’s not my stuff, let’s put it that way.

### **What proportion of your total business would you estimate goes through Amazon?**

Probably 40 to 50 percent. In 2010, when I first started doing this with Amazon, I think they were maybe 5 percent of my sales. But Amazon’s a juggernaut now. I mean, 50 percent of all dollars on the internet go through Amazon. [*Editor: This is a slight exaggeration, but Amazon did account for [nearly half of all e-commerce sales](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the United States last year.*] When I started doing eBay, back in 2009, it was 23 percent market share. I make good money on eBay but unfortunately people don’t go there like they used to.

### **It seems like Amazon wants lots of small businesses to use its platform. Is that fair to say?**

Exactly. I call them “indentured servants,” because that’s what we are. I mean, you can’t go back to another job working for someone else, because you make a decent living, but then you’re resigned to working 10 to 12 hour days, six days a week. If you wanted to become a large company selling on Amazon, it’s very difficult. It works for me, because it’s just me and one other person, and I can micromanage things. But once you start getting too many people, they make mistakes. One mistake is enough to kill your career on Amazon.

In anything with Amazon, if you happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, or anger the wrong person in their corporation, they suspend you. Getting back on is near impossible. That’s just how they are. I always tell people, “I’m not complaining about Amazon, that’s just how they are. I understand how they are, they make me a living, but it’s very hard to make a living and the margins suck.” That’s the best way to put it.

Amazon has this thing that’s called a “phantom order.” Basically, when you sell stuff, and you sell out, you’ll keep the inventory “out of stock,” because you don’t have any. Well, sometimes your item will phantomly come back up to be sold again. Then, the item sells, and you can’t get the item because the manufacturer is out of stock so the customer can’t have it for several weeks. Amazon says, “Well, we don’t know anything about this phantom order, but you gotta fill it.”

Then, you have to cancel the order, but, because it’s Prime, the maximum amount of cancellations you can have in a month is half a percent. Now, I do a lot of business with Amazon. I probably do about a half million dollars a year, which is a lot for me. I do sell through other platforms too, but when you cancel one order out of 178 orders in a month, that one order almost puts you over that half percent.

To make Prime, you have to be 97 percent efficient, delivered on time. They do it on a weekly basis. Ninety seven percent — that’s ungodly. You have to be Jesus to be able to achieve that. I mean, we had that weird freak snowstorm this week that was supposed to be nothing and then that made UPS and the Postal Service do a bad job. And then, of course, there was that cold weather, so I had three or four packages not delivered on time in one week. Now, I have the big red X that says, “You can be suspended if you keep this up.”

### **You started selling on Amazon in 2010. How has your relationship to the platform changed over time?**

As Amazon grew, I decided to make changes, too. I used to sell really well on there not doing Prime — I didn’t want to do Prime because you have to get something there in two days, and it has to be free freight, which is costly on a lot of items. I didn’t want to follow that model, but then the manufacturer went in and did Fulfillment by Amazon, which means they send the merchandise to Amazon and Amazon takes care of the orders and everything.

I couldn’t compete against that. I basically decided that I was selling against the manufacturer. I couldn’t make any money on it anymore. I was forced to either do Fulfillment by Amazon or basically go with no sales. I decided to follow the manufacturer and do the fulfillment. Now, the problem with doing that is the margins suck, you don’t really make any money. There’s a lot of orders that go out and you’re actually losing money on them.

### **Then how do you make money?**

You try to make it up with the ones you do make money on. It’s not a good business model, I can tell you that! If you decide not to cover that area, then you just don’t sell anything.

### **What do you mean?**

When you do sell Prime, let’s say you’re willing to cover anywhere in the country for two-day air or two-day delivery. You pick the area. You could pick the whole Eastern Seaboard, anywhere that UPS says they do in two days, that kind of thing. That’s what we did at the beginning and it worked rather well. In fact, at that time I was doing FedEx ground. But then Amazon changed their algorithm, which basically made it so if you didn’t cover a large part of the country, they barely ever let you be found in Prime… Rest assured, if Amazon is selling the same thing as you, they don’t go down, no matter what happens. They always get to keep their stuff up. The rules that I have to abide by, they don’t have to.

They have a new policy that they’re starting. Something called Vendor One. The manufacturer sells directly to Amazon, Amazon then sells it for whatever they want. Well, since they don’t have to pay the 15 percent fee that I have to pay, naturally they can sell it for less, right? So you can’t compete. They buy direct from the manufacturer, sell for whatever they like, and then they wipe out all the small businesses because we can’t compete.

### **Is there any way that you think sellers like yourself could stop that from happening?**

I think the only way sellers can stop it is if they would band together and actually do their own website or stop selling on Amazon… The problem with that is that never works. You can never get everyone to band together to do this, you know what I mean? There’s always someone who will say, “I’ll go do it, because I’ll get all the orders.” You can’t get them to stick together.

I don’t have a solution for it, I really don’t. To me, Amazon is a monopoly — there’s just a reverse monopoly. A normal monopoly raises prices to an exorbitant amount of money, because they’re the only person doing it. Television, the internet carriers, that kind of stuff. Well, Amazon is upside down: their version of the internet is to sell the stuff as cheap as possible to the cheapest person out there. That way they will always be overlooked by the regulators because they say, “Well, they’re a monopoly by definition, but they are giving consumers extreme value, so we’re not gonna do anything about it.” So, they get left alone.

# The Paradox of Jughead’s Hat

## The Paradox of Jughead’s Hat

### The strange reason *Riverdale* star Cole Sprouse wears a cap from a bygone era

![Image: © The CW](<|image|>)*Image: © The CW*

If you’re a fan of Archie Comics, you know Jughead Jones: Lanky, laconic, and obsessed with eating. If you’re a fan of Archie’s TV adaptation *Riverdale*, you know that Jughead, too: brooding, a gang leader, and the show’s theatrical narrator. The two bear little in common but their name; their deep, abiding friendship with Archie; and, most important, a strange hat they never take off — a hat that represents one of comics’ most bizarre dilemmas.

In case you’ve never read the comics or seen the show, Jughead wears a strange, crown-like hat. He’s been sporting the hat ever since the character debuted along with Archie in 1941’s *Pep Comics* #22. It is — rather, it was — called a “[whoopee cap](&lt;|url|&gt;),” a fedora with the brim removed and triangles cut into the bottom edge, which was folded up to create a vaguely crown-like appearance. (There’s [a wonderful history of it here](&lt;|url|&gt;) if you want to know more.) After the 1950s, the fad faded away, but Jughead kept his cap on.
> # The longer Jughead wore the hat, the more impossible it became for him to take it off.

The publishers of Archie Comics could have given Jughead new headgear at some point in the 1960s or ’70s, but for whatever reason, they didn’t. And then something strange happened. The longer Jughead wore the hat, the more impossible it became for him to take it off. As the whoopee cap completely faded from memory, it morphed into something more closely resembling an actual crown — no less bizarre and no less irrelevant — but it never left his head.

Here’s how closely linked Jughead and his weird hat became: In 2015, when Archie Comics went through its massive, first-ever reboot — when the characters were finally modernized, the stories serialized, and the classic Archie art style abandoned after 74 years — Jughead kept the hat. More astoundingly, when Jughead made the leap to TV in *Riverdale*, actor Cole Sprouse sported a more beanie-esque version and has worn it nearly every minute he’s been on screen in the show, just like Jughead has in nearly every comic panel he’s graced.

I’d bet most of *Riverdale*’s viewers have never seen an Archie comic in their lives, so they wouldn’t need the hat to recognize the character. They sure as hell don’t know what the hat is supposed to be. But Sprouse is still almost never shown without it. Any modernization of the character — especially a TV adaptation trying to reach a broader audience — should necessitate that he lose an 80-year-old fashion fad, or at least replace it with a hat people actually wear. But no. (Guys, in the early 1990s, Jughead briefly transformed into a hip skateboarder [complete with a mini-mohawk](&lt;|url|&gt;)… and he *still* wore the hat.)

Jughead’s hat is iconic in the most literal sense of the word — it has become essential, not only to Jughead’s wardrobe, but to the character himself. Actually, I suspect Jughead’s hat is *more* recognizably Jughead, because it is so unique to the character, than the character drawn without the hat. After all, he’s been the only person on earth wearing a whoopee cap for the past half-century or so. Think about this: In 2018, *Riverdale*’s intended teenage audience is watching a teenage character who wears a hat that practically ceased to exist 60 years ago. These are kids whose *parents* were born after whoopee caps were gone. That’s *bananas*.

The Paradox of Jughead’s Hat, as I call it, is a fascinating problem for many characters, especially those created in the Golden Age of comics, aka the 1930s and ’40s. If there was any forethought in these character designs, it was based on what looked most exciting for the young audience that devoured comics. As the ’40s became the ’50s, kids were still the prime audience, and they weren’t worried about fashion or hats; they just wanted to see their favorite heroes save the day, or their favorite nonheroes, like Archie and Jughead, pull some hijinks.

But now, twentysomethings, thirtysomethings, and even fortysomethings make up [the primary audience of comic books](&lt;|url|&gt;), and they demand a certain level of sophistication in their stories about teenage drama and people who fly and beat up criminals. It’s why we’ve gotten this wonderful glut of comic stories over the past few decades. It’s why there’s more diversity in comics and comic characters, which is unequivocally a great thing. And it’s why audiences can’t seem to grow out of reading comics. All of this is just as true of character designs and art, and there are some truly beautiful comics available for purchase this very minute.
> # Let us briefly return to Superman’s underpants.

It seems obvious that this older, more discerning audience would necessitate changes among the most vintage of these characters in particular. Why does Superman wear red underpants over his tights, anyway? Why does Wonder Woman dress up in such U.S.-centric patriotic garb if she’s an Amazon from Greek mythology? And what could possibly be more antiquated than Jughead’s hat? These are all valid questions, but the answers are irrelevant. Because the designs of these characters didn’t change for so long and have become entrenched so solidly into popular culture, they have essentially fossilized. They are immutable; attempts to change them fail because when they are changed it somehow looks wrong.

Let us briefly return to Superman’s underpants. (I honestly don’t think that’s the first time I’ve typed that sentence.) When the DC Comics universe had its “New 52” reboot in 2011, the red briefs Superman had worn over his tights did not survive, nor did they make an appearance in the *Man of Steel *movie. They were a relic of a bygone age, originally drawn in 1939 because Superman artist Joe Shuster [modeled his super-strong hero after circus strongmen](&lt;|url|&gt;), who wore them to accentuate their physiques. Like whoopee caps, circus strongmen with visible underwear don’t seem to be around much anymore.

It was the most natural decision in the world to ditch the underpants, but without them, Superman looked weirdly off, almost as if he was somehow more naked without them over his tights. His red underpants had become as intrinsic to his look as his S symbol, and DC Comics finally returned them to the Man of Steel [earlier this year](&lt;|url|&gt;). The red underpants don’t make any more sense now than they did in 2011, but that’s what Superman wears. The reason he put them on in the first place is irrelevant. Just like Jughead and his glorious, ridiculous, impossible hat.

Taking off a hat may seem like the most superficial decision, but consider what *Riverdale* has changed from its source material: The good-hearted, love-struck Archie of the comics has joined the mob, started a violent vigilante group, and been charged with murder. Prototypical girl-next-door Betty has hidden a dead body, unrelated to the fact that her dad turned out to be a serial killer. Rich snob Veronica is now the most caring friend on the show… and her dad is a mafia honcho. And Jughead? Well, he’s a budding investigative journalist who’s a gang leader who literally cut a tattoo off a former member’s skin. He *flayed* her.

But [he did it while wearing the hat](&lt;|url|&gt;).

*Riverdale* is violently — quite literally — different from its source material and a guilty pleasure I barely feel guilty about. But what makes the bonkers changes possible is what *Riverdale* doesn’t change from the comics: Archie is torn between his feelings for Veronica and Betty; Veronica’s father, Hiram, loathes Archie; Josie and the Pussycats occasionally belt out a tune; and the main four teens, in what is ostensibly 2018, still spend their time at a diner straight out of the ’50s.

And last but certainly not least, Jughead and the crown-shaped hat he wears, has always worn, and will always wear. The hat that is his and his alone, in comics and on TV, now and forever. Who knew a paradox could be such a fashion statement?

*Riverdale* is a delightfully dark, funhouse mirror of the original comics, but even the most twisted mirror can only reflect what it’s been shown.

This isn’t just Jughead’s problem. It’s something that faces many long-running characters, most often from comics. Certain design choices become so inextricably linked with the character that they simply cannot be taken away without that character looking… wrong. Try to imagine Superman without the S emblem on his chest, or Batman without his pointy ears, and how bizarre that would seem. When these design choices are informed by the sensibilities of the time they were created, things get awkward. The “A” on the forehead of Captain America’s mask surely looked far less ridiculous when [he was first drawn in 1941](&lt;|url|&gt;) than his many live-action Marvel movies, but it had to be included.

My favorite non-Jughead example is [Superman’s underpants](&lt;|url|&gt;). Of course, people are still wearing underpants, so there’s some modern context for them, but there’s no contextualizing Jughead’s headwear. It remains a catch-22, something the character should not be wearing, practically cannot be wearing, and yet can’t do without, no matter how much time passes, no matter how confusing it might be to people, no matter the circumstance. Jughead and whoever portrays him are cursed to eternally wear a hat that no longer exists.

But maybe it’s a blessing, too, since the hat is his and his alone, now and forever more. When *Riverdale* gets inevitably rebooted in 2035, Jughead will still be wearing it — because if he doesn’t, he won’t really be Jughead. This may not be so amazing it’s worth shouting “Whoopee!” over, but it is nice to know that in this era of remakes, reboots, and resets, a few things will always be the same.<|endoftext|>

# Meet the Ex-Neo-Nazi Using Tech to Deradicalize the Far Right

## Brad Galloway employed the internet to find new recruits for neo-Nazi hate groups. Now he uses it to help them leave.

Brad Galloway opens up his phone and scans through his most recent Facebook messages.

“I’ve been in the white power movement for five years and I want out,” one reads. “I hate who I’ve become.”

“Really struggling with the loneliness today,” another says. “I don’t have a single buddy left after leaving the group.”

Galloway carefully replies to each one. He advises the guy desperate to leave that he should make steps to reconnect with old friends from his days before joining the far right. He talks the second through positive things he could fill his time with, such as sports or going back to school.

Galloway can relate. With his brown hair, beard, and unassuming button-down shirts, today the 39-year-old father of three blends in easily on the streets of Vancouver, Canada. But less than a decade ago, he sported the unmistakable uniform of a street skinhead — black bomber jacket, boots, and a shaved head. Galloway spent almost 15 years in Canada’s neo-Nazi movement before breaking away in 2011. But now he’s part of an online network working to deradicalize other far-right extremists. Some he exchanges just a few conversations with. Others he continues to mentor for years.

![](<|image|>)

“Online has made [the far right] much more widespread and created a transnational movement,” says Galloway, who has been working in the deradicalization field since 2015. “The group I was in started in the U.S. and ended up in 12 different countries, all because of the internet.” But he also thinks that digital tools offer better opportunities to counteract the very extremism it has helped to grow. “[The internet] can be a positive resource for disengaging from it all. There was absolutely nothing back when I left.”

Galloway was recruited in the mostly off-line world of the late 1990s, when he was 19 years old. “I met up with a friend who was involved and he sold me the story of how multiculturalism is taking over the world,” he remembers. “He gave me some CDs and taught me how to dress like a skinhead. I was desperate for a sense of identity, and that was the driver.”

Throughout his 20s Galloway grew more deeply involved with hate groups and, as forums and chat rooms took off, starting working as an online recruiter. “Think of it as a tree,” he explains. “You have one platform where everyone goes, such as [white supremacist forum] Stormfront.” But today, far-right groups are also known to recruit from sites such as Reddit and 4chan. According to Galloway, different far-right groups converge in these spaces to promote their aims, to recruit new people, and to use them as soundboards to complain about Islam, or anything else they object to. When new prospects turn up, the aim is to get them talking via private message before putting them through a process akin to gang initiation, where the recruiter works out their belief system and ensures they’re not an undercover activist.

![](<|image|>)

The easy availability of the internet is key to the process. “Online is a powerful recruitment tool,” Galloway continues. “People go way out of their comfort zone with the things they say.” He also believes the internet makes it easier to work out who’s vulnerable, and therefore targetable. “Recruiters will look for the guy who’s going through a divorce or someone who’s young and seems lonely,” he says. The nature of online forums means people are more likely to rant about these issues, and recruiters can Google their usernames to see what they’ve posted elsewhere.

The end goal, though, is always to convince the recruit to meet up off-line. “Violence is the key component,” says Galloway. “It’s what [the far right] want at the end of it. It’s never going to be enough to just stay online.”
> # “These groups… destroy your life.”

One reason Galloway eventually left the movement was his wife. “She was never involved and she kept me skeptical, which was lucky because a lot of these guys end up completely isolated from other voices,” he says. “All the hate and violence and anger just got exhausting… Eventually I started thinking, instead of spending all this energy hating other communities, why don’t I try learning about them?”

And now, Galloway says, he wants to make amends. “I was involved in a lot of violence and caused some harm to the community.”

Galloway is clear that there is no shortcut to deradicalization. The process differs depending on how long and how deeply an individual has been involved, what’s been driving that involvement, and whether they’re attached to any particular part of the ideology. But he explains that getting people out of the far right follows a similar pattern to how they were radicalized in the first place.

He prefers not to approach members of the far right directly — “they already see us as tools of their enemy” — and waits for signs that they are ready for help. He’s had people connect with him on Facebook after seeing him talking about deradicalization on the news. Galloway also receives email referrals from two nonprofits he works with: [Life After Hate](&lt;|url|&gt;) and the Coalition to End Violence. “People approach me in a negative context too but I think that’s often their cry for help… It starts up the dialogue.”

Hate groups typically encourage recruits to sever ties with friends and family who oppose their views, and to stay away from what they call the “socialist environments” of colleges and universities. Galloway, on the other hand, urges his mentees to reconnect with people from their past and expose themselves to different, dissenting voices through reading or education.
> # Galloway believes that banning movements completely could be counterproductive, driving people to off-line communities instead.

The aim is to get them attached to positive new people or activities, which can lead to disengagement with the groups, followed by full deradicalization. “I ask people, ‘What good has being in these groups ever brought to your life?’” he says. “Get involved with something that gives you growth.”

When it comes to changing beliefs, Galloway believes in trying to humanize anyone the groups hate. “Most of these guys have never actually had a negative experience with anyone from different communities,” he explains. “I say to them, ‘What do you really know about Islam? Have you ever gone to a mosque and asked them about it?’”

Leaving the movement isn’t so straightforward, though. Former members refer to “the void” — the empty period that comes after leaving this intense social group — and how they have to avoid slipping back into extremist circles for company. This is where long-term mentoring comes into play, as well as the internet itself. Support groups on Facebook can bring members in contact with people who have been through the same experience.

Online platforms have faced plenty of criticism for their perceived slowness in tackling the far right. Facebook finally [banned](&lt;|url|&gt;) a number of prominent figures from the movement, including Milo Yiannopoulos and Alex Jones, but only after months and even years of complaints. YouTube only last week began [deleting](&lt;|url|&gt;) Nazi videos from the platform (and in the process inadvertently took down valuable historical documents). But Galloway believes that banning movements completely could be counterproductive, driving people to off-line communities instead.

“I’d like to see more focus on prevention,” he concludes. “The education needs to start early on. These groups… destroy your life.”<|endoftext|>

# Google Promises ‘reCAPTCHA’ Isn’t Exploiting Users. Should You Trust It?

## Google Promises ‘reCAPTCHA’ Isn’t Exploiting Users. Should You Trust It?

### An innovative security feature to separate humans from bots online comes with some major concerns

![Credit: Alexey Bezrodny/iStock/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: Alexey Bezrodny/iStock/Getty Images Plus*

A surprising amount of work online goes into proving you’re not a robot. It’s the basis of those “CAPTCHA” questions often seen after logging into websites: blurry photos of crosswalks, traffic lights, and store fronts that users are tasked with identifying through a series of clicks.

They come in many forms, from blurry letters that must be identified and typed into a box to branded slogans [like “Comfort Plus”* *on the Delta website](&lt;|url|&gt;) — as if the sorry state of modern air travel wasn’t already dystopian enough. The most common, however, is Google’s reCAPTCHA, [which launched its third version at the end of 2018](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s designed to drastically reduce the number of challenges you’ll have to complete to log into a website, assigning an invisible score to users depending on how “human” their behavior is. CAPTCHA, after all, is designed to weed out “bot” accounts that flood systems for nefarious ends.

But Google’s innovation has a downside: The new version monitors your every move across a website to determine whether you are, in fact, a person.

## **A necessary advancement?**

Before we get into the “how” of this new technology, it’s useful to understand where it’s coming from. The new reCAPTCHA disrupts a relatively ancient web technology which has been harnessed for plenty of things beyond security.

CAPTCHA — which stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart” — first appeared in the late ’90s, and it was [designed by a team at the early search engine AltaVista](&lt;|url|&gt;). Before CAPTCHA, it was easy for people to program bots that would automatically sign up for services and post spam comments by the thousands. AltaVista’s technology was based on a printer manual’s advice for avoiding bad optical character recognition (OCR); the iconic blurry text in a CAPTCHA was specifically designed to be difficult for a computer to read but legible for humans, thereby foiling bots.

By the early 2000s, these tests were everywhere. Then came reCAPTCHA, developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon and purchased by Google in 2009. It used the same idea but in an innovative way: the text typed by human users would identify specific words that programs were having trouble recognizing. Essentially, programs would scan text and flag words they couldn’t recognize. Those words would then be placed next to known examples in reCAPTCHA tests — humans would verify the known words and identify the new ones.

By 2011, [Google had digitized](&lt;|url|&gt;) the entire archive of the *New York Times* through reCAPTCHA alone. People would type in text from newspaper scans one blurry CAPTCHA at a time, ultimately allowing Google to make the *Times*’ back catalog searchable, forever. While creating a velvet rope to keep bots off sites, Google had managed to conscript human users into doing the company’s grunt work.
> # There’s no way to opt out of reCAPTCHA on a site you need to use, forcing you to either accept being tracked or stop using a given service altogether.

With that achievement under its belt, reCAPTCHA switched to showing pictures from Google’s Street View software in 2014, as it does today. After pressing the “I’m not a robot” box, you might be prompted to recognize which of nine images contain “bicycles” or “streetlights.” Behind the scenes, Google reduced the frequency at which people were asked to complete these tests by [performing behavioral analysis](&lt;|url|&gt;) — reCAPTCHA can now run in the background and track how people use websites.

If a Google cookie is present on your machine, or if the way you use your mouse and keyboard on the page doesn’t seem suspiciously bot-like, visitors will skip the Street View test entirely. But some privacy-conscious users have complained that clearing their cookies or browsing in “Incognito Mode” [drastically increases](&lt;|url|&gt;) the number of reCAPTCHA tests they’re asked to complete.

Users have also pointed out that browsers competing with Google Chrome, [like Firefox](&lt;|url|&gt;), require users to complete more challenges, which naturally raises a question: Is Google using reCAPTCHA to cement its own dominance?

This raises serious privacy concerns, given that Google’s revenue is primarily from its ad business, which relies on tracking data. You might worry that reCAPTCHA is essentially a secret ad tracker, hiding in plain site just like the Facebook “Like” button embedded on web pages.

## **Google’s perspective**

To use its latest version of reCAPTCHA, [Google asks that developers include its tracking tags](&lt;|url|&gt;) on as many pages of their websites as possible, in order to paint a better picture of the user. This doesn’t exist in a vacuum: Google also offers Google Analytics, for example, which helps developers and marketers understand how visitors use their website. It’s a fantastic tool, included on more than [100,000 of the top 1 million visited websites according to Built With](&lt;|url|&gt;), but it’s also part of a strategy to monitor users’ habits across the internet.

The new version of reCAPTCHA fills in the missing pieces of that picture, allowing Google to further reach into those sites that might not use its Analytics tool. When pressed on this, [Google told *Fast Company](&lt;|url|&gt;)* that it won’t capture user data from reCAPTCHA for advertising, and that the data it does collect is used for improving the service.

But that data remains sealed within a black box, even to the developers who implement the technology. [The documentation](&lt;|url|&gt;) for reCAPTCHA doesn’t mention user data, how users might be tracked, or where the information ends up — it simply discusses the practical parts of the implementation.

I asked Google for more information, and what its commitment is to the long-term independence of reCAPTCHA relative to its advertising business — just because the two aren’t bound together now doesn’t mean they couldn’t be in the future, after all.
> # “It will not be used for personalized advertising by Google.”

A Google representative says “reCAPTCHA may only be used to fight spam and abuse” and that “the reCAPTCHA API works by collecting hardware and software information, such as device and application data, and sending these data to Google for analysis. The information collected in connection with your use of the service will be used for improving reCAPTCHA and for general security purposes. It will not be used for personalized advertising by Google.”

That’s great, and hopefully Google maintains this commitment. The problem is that there’s no reason to believe it will. The introduction of a powerful tracking technology like this is a move that should come with public scrutiny, because we’ve seen in the past how easily things can go sour. Facebook, for example, promised in 2014 that WhatsApp would remain independent, separate from its backend infrastructure — but [went back on that decision after just two years](&lt;|url|&gt;). When Google acquired Nest, it promised to keep it independent, but [recanted five years later](&lt;|url|&gt;), requiring owners to migrate to a Google account or lose functionality.

For the same reason Google is able to build reCAPTCHA in the first place — its vast resources and reach — we should be suspicious of where all this might lead us.

Unfortunately, as users, there’s little we can do. There’s no way to opt out of reCAPTCHA on a site you need to use, forcing you to either accept being tracked or stop using a given service altogether. If you don’t like those full-body scanners at airports, you can* *at least still opt-out and get a manual pat-down. But if a site has reCAPTCHA, there’s no opting out at all.

If Google intends to build tools like this with the public good in mind, rather than its bottom line, then the company must find better ways to reassure the world that they won’t change the rules when it’s convenient. If it were willing to open-source the project (as it has with[ many, many others](&lt;|url|&gt;)), move it outside the company, or, at the very least establish third-party oversight, perhaps we could start building that trust.<|endoftext|>

# The Future of Computing Is Analog

## The future of computing is analog

![Credit: Arterra/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Arterra/Getty*

The history of computing can be divided into an Old Testament and a New Testament: before and after electronic digital computers and the codes they spawned proliferated across the earth. The Old Testament prophets, who delivered the underlying logic, included Thomas Hobbes and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The New Testament prophets included Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Claude Shannon, and Norbert Wiener. They delivered the machines.

Alan Turing wondered what it would take for machines to become intelligent. John von Neumann wondered what it would take for machines to self-reproduce. Claude Shannon wondered what it would take for machines to communicate reliably, no matter how much noise intervened. Norbert Wiener wondered how long it would take for machines to assume control.

Wiener’s warnings about control systems beyond human control appeared in 1949, just as the first generation of stored-program electronic digital computers were introduced. These systems required direct supervision by human programmers, undermining his concerns. What’s the problem, as long as programmers are in control of the machines? Ever since, debate over the risks of autonomous control has remained associated with the debate over the powers and limitations of digitally coded machines. Despite their astonishing powers, little real autonomy has been observed. This is a dangerous assumption. What if digital computing is being superseded by something else?

Electronics underwent two fundamental transitions over the past hundred years: from analog to digital and from vacuum tubes to solid state. That these transitions occurred together does not mean they are inextricably linked. Just as digital computation was implemented using vacuum tube components, analog computation can be implemented in solid state. Analog computation is alive and well, even though vacuum tubes are commercially extinct.

There is no precise distinction between analog and digital computing. In general, digital computing deals with integers, binary sequences, deterministic logic, and time that is idealized into discrete increments, whereas analog computing deals with real numbers, nondeterministic logic, and continuous functions, including time as it exists as a continuum in the real world.

Imagine you need to find the middle of a road. You can measure its width using any available increment and then digitally compute the middle to the nearest increment. Or you can use a piece of string as an analog computer, mapping the width of the road to the length of the string and finding the middle, without being limited to increments, by doubling the string back upon itself.

Many systems operate across both analog and digital regimes. A tree integrates a wide range of inputs as continuous functions, but if you cut down that tree, you find that it has been counting the years digitally all along.

In analog computing, complexity resides in network topology, not in code. Information is processed as continuous functions of values, such as voltage and relative pulse frequency, rather than by logical operations on discrete strings of bits. Digital computing, intolerant of error or ambiguity, depends upon error correction at every step along the way. Analog computing tolerates errors, allowing you to live with them.
> # It is entirely possible to build something without understanding it.

Nature uses digital coding for the storage, replication, and recombination of sequences of nucleotides but relies on analog computing, running on nervous systems, for intelligence and control. The genetic system in every living cell is a stored-program computer. Brains aren’t.

Digital computers execute transformations between two species of bits: bits representing differences in space and bits representing differences in time. The transformations between these two forms of information, sequence and structure, are governed by the computer’s programming, and as long as computers require human programmers, we retain control.

Analog computers also mediate transformations between two forms of information: structure in space and behavior in time. There is no code and no programming. Somehow — and we don’t fully understand how — nature evolved analog computers known as nervous systems, which embody information absorbed from the world. They learn. One of the things they learn is control. They learn to control their own behavior, and they learn to control their environment to the extent that they can.

Computer science has a long history — going back to before there even *was *computer science — of implementing neural networks, but for the most part these have been simulations of neural networks by digital computers, not neural networks as evolved in the wild by nature herself. This is starting to change: from the bottom up, as the threefold drivers of drone warfare, autonomous vehicles, and cellphones push the development of neuromorphic microprocessors that implement actual neural networks, rather than simulations of neural networks, directly in silicon (and other potential substrates), and from the top down, as our largest and most successful enterprises increasingly turn to analog computation in their infiltration and control of the world.

While we argue about the intelligence of digital computers, analog computing is quietly supervening upon the digital, in the same way that analog components like vacuum tubes were repurposed to build digital computers in the aftermath of World War II. Individually deterministic finite-state processors, running finite codes, are forming large-scale, nondeterministic, non-finite-state metazoan organisms running wild in the real world. The resulting hybrid analog/digital systems treat streams of bits collectively, the way the flow of electrons is treated in a vacuum tube, rather than individually, as bits are treated by the discrete-state devices generating the flow. Bits are the new electrons. Analog is back, and its nature is to assume control.

Governing everything from the flow of goods to the flow of traffic to the flow of ideas, these systems operate statistically, as pulse-frequency coded information is processed in a neuron or a brain. The emergence of intelligence gets the attention of *Homo sapiens*, but what we should be worried about is the emergence of control.

Imagine it is 1958, and you are trying to defend the continental United States against airborne attack. To distinguish hostile aircraft, one of the things you need, besides a network of computers and early warning radar sites, is a map of all commercial air traffic, updated in real time. The United States built such a system and named it SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment). SAGE in turn spawned Sabre, the first integrated reservation system for booking airline travel in real time. Sabre and its progeny soon became not just a map of what seats were available but also a system that began to control, with decentralized intelligence, where airliners would fly, and when.

But isn’t there a control room somewhere, with someone at the controls? Maybe not. Say, for example, you build a system to map highway traffic in real time simply by giving cars access to the map in exchange for reporting their own speed and location at the time. The result is a fully decentralized control system. Nowhere is there any controlling model of the system except the system itself.

Imagine it is the first decade of the 21st century, and you want to track the complexity of human relationships in real time. For social life at a small college, you could construct a central database and keep it up to date, but its upkeep would become overwhelming if taken to any larger scale. Better to pass out free copies of a simple semiautonomous code, hosted locally, and let the social network update itself. This code is executed by digital computers, but the analog computing performed by the system as a whole far exceeds the complexity of the underlying code. The resulting pulse-frequency coded model of the social graph *becomes *the social graph. It spreads wildly across the campus and then the world.
> # The next revolution in computing will be signaled by the rise of analog systems over which digital programming no longer has control.

What if you wanted to build a machine to capture what everything known to the human species *means*? With Moore’s law behind you, it doesn’t take too long to digitize all the information in the world. You scan every book ever printed, collect every email ever written, and gather 49 years of video every 24 hours, while tracking where people are and what they do, in real time. But how do you capture the *meaning*?

Even in the age of all things digital, this cannot be defined in any strictly logical sense, because meaning, among humans, isn’t fundamentally logical. The best you can do, once you have collected all possible answers, is to invite well-defined questions and compile a pulse-frequency weighted map of how everything connects. Before you know it, your system will not only be observing and mapping the meaning of things, it will start *constructing *meaning as well. In time, it will *control *meaning, in the same way the traffic map starts to control the flow of traffic even though no one seems to be in control.

There are three laws of artificial intelligence. The first, known as Ashby’s law, after cybernetician W. Ross Ashby, author of *Design for a Brain*, states that any effective control system must be as complex as the system it controls.

The second law, articulated by John von Neumann, states that the defining characteristic of a complex system is that it constitutes its own simplest behavioral description. The simplest complete model of an organism is the organism itself. Trying to reduce the system’s behavior to any formal description makes things more complicated, not less.

The third law states that any system simple enough to be understandable will not be complicated enough to behave intelligently, while any system complicated enough to behave intelligently will be too complicated to understand.

The third law offers comfort to those who believe that until we understand intelligence, we need not worry about superhuman intelligence arising among machines. But there is a loophole in the third law. It is entirely possible to build something without understanding it. You don’t need to fully understand how a brain works in order to build one that works. This is a loophole that no amount of supervision over algorithms by programmers and their ethical advisers can ever close. Provably “good” A.I. is a myth. Our relationship with true A.I. will always be a matter of faith, not proof.

We worry too much about machine intelligence and not enough about self-reproduction, communication, and control. The next revolution in computing will be signaled by the rise of analog systems over which digital programming no longer has control. Nature’s response to those who believe they can build machines to control everything will be to allow them to build a machine that controls them instead.

# Facebook’s Plan to Fuse Its Messaging Apps Is Not About Your Privacy

## Facebook’s Plan to Fuse Its Messaging Apps Is Not About Your Privacy

### *Just follow the money*

![Credit: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images*

Our smartphones have officially made it a pain to talk to one another. Many of us spend our days hopping between messaging apps, from iMessage to WhatsApp to Facebook Messenger to Instagram and back again, carrying on fractured conversations with the same set of people across a number of platforms.

But many of those services are owned by a single company: Facebook. WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram [collectively reach more than 2 billion people](&lt;|url|&gt;), making Facebook the owner of the world’s largest messaging platform — and a potential gold mine.

Facebook knows this, and sensing the opportunity to completely own modern messaging, reportedly [plans to unify those messaging services into a single, connected platform](&lt;|url|&gt;). This would bring an obvious benefit to users — convenience — but I’m not convinced that merging these platforms is really about users’ needs at all. In all likelihood, this is about Facebook knowing more about its users, regardless of where they’re chatting, for the sake of its ad business.

### **Removing Walls**

You could imagine Facebook’s products today as a series of silos. Instagram and WhatsApp have their own databases and [identity layers](&lt;|url|&gt;) separate from the core social network. Users must create a login for each distinct network, which creates a fresh “identity” in the respective app’s database–even if a user logs in to Instagram using the Facebook login feature, because each service uses its own separate database infrastructure. In other words, all of these platforms are effectively distinct from one another despite sharing some common functionality.

![](<|image|>)

The problem with this is obvious: It’s difficult for Facebook to get a complete picture of your habits, who you talk to, and what you’re talking about. Facebook does correlate some data between the services — like phone numbers — but they remain largely siloed from one another.

That’s a problem for Facebook, because the company relies on advertising for almost all of its revenue. (Last week, Facebook [announced](&lt;|url|&gt;) that it had made a little more than $15 billion in the first three months of 2019 alone, almost all of which came from ads.) As people [use the broader social network less, in favor of private messaging](&lt;|url|&gt;), it’s harder for Facebook to understand their habits — particularly in the case of WhatsApp, which is currently encrypted and difficult to serve personalized ads on.
> # A unified messaging platform would allow Facebook to paint a better picture of you, rather than forcing the company to tie together disconnected pieces of metadata.

Facebook’s solution to this problem is likely to be unifying the identity layer across all of these apps — allowing WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger to recognize the one true “you” — and then creating common endpoints for the databases to connect with one another. Today, Facebook needs to correlate the data you provide to each app in order to target ads properly, which is prone to mistakes and inconsistency. Unifying this, and removing that process, would allow these apps to tap into one “ad profile” that understands everything about you, regardless of where that data actually lives. This would make it much easier for the company to data mine the people you interact with and general topics across conversations, regardless of where you’re having them, effectively building a mega-platform behind the scenes.

Thus, the unified messaging platform would allow Facebook to paint a better picture of you as a whole person, rather than forcing the company to tie together disconnected pieces of metadata like it does today. That’s incredibly appealing to advertisers, and exactly the kind of problem you need to solve when your model is suddenly pivoting from publicly shared data to private conversations.

It’s unlikely that Facebook will merge the messaging databases backing each app directly, largely because their feature sets are so varied. But by abstracting away the identity layer, the company would be able to keep better track of what you’re doing, even though your conversations would remain stored in separate databases.

![](<|image|>)

The proposed changes would mean that the apps themselves become little more than brands you interact with. WhatsApp and Messenger might have distinct styles and icons, but beneath it all you’d really be interacting with one core service.

In that world, Facebook’s “product” would largely be an identity layer that happens to have a social network attached to it. And that identity layer would also be the unified lens that Facebook sees you through, providing the ability to serve relevant advertisements regardless of what app you’re interacting with.

### **Strange Messaging**

It’s weird that Facebook would signal these changes so early. Merging the backends of these apps is a technical problem, and most companies would have quietly handled it in the background.

But Facebook might be worried about how this merger would be perceived. [Regulators are already circling the social network](&lt;|url|&gt;) — and the notion of a unified messaging app isn’t exactly calming them down. Facebook is pushing on with work regardless, with [preliminary efforts to bridge the platforms already underway](&lt;|url|&gt;).

By positioning the unification of its platforms as a user-focused initiative largely focused on how people message one another, Facebook is able to deflect that negative attention. It’s building something users want, not some mega-platform to gain total control over the messaging space.

But make no mistake: Merging these apps will ensure Facebook has a more resilient — and possibly even larger — advertising business for years to come, as the effectiveness of its News Feed fades away.

Are we sure we’re willing to let Facebook become the de facto messaging platform? Will we be able to opt out? We’ve already allowed Mark Zuckerberg to control the largest, most influential social network in the world. If this project succeeds, he’ll control the largest private messaging platform, too.<|endoftext|>

# In Defense of Normal

## We celebrate uniqueness, but our fixation on individuality can hold us back

![Photo: Busà Photography/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Busà Photography/Getty Images*

We underrate the value of normal.

We think normal means dull, average, or mediocre. Normal is unimaginative. Normal is being like everybody else.

Ads promise to save us from the tragedy of being normal. “Don’t be like them,” they say. “Be like you.”

At school and in our careers, we work hard to distinguish ourselves. We strive to be star performers and standouts. We want to get the part, land the promotion, fulfill our destinies. To separate from the normal pack.

But a strange thing happens in life. The further we go, the more welcome normal becomes.

For many it starts with having a family. When our lives are changed by the unknown of new life, normal becomes what we want most. A normal pregnancy. Normal child development. Family challenges that fall within the bounds of normal.

Normal means safety. Normal means others have been here before. Normal means we’re not the only one.

A sense of normal isn’t just helpful for normal things. It’s helpful for abnormal things, too.

The two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Caro spent seven long years writing his first book, *The Power Broker*. Toward the end of that process he worked in a space at the New York Public Library reserved for authors. Here’s Caro:

“In my memory, no one spoke to me for the first few days I was in the room. Then one day, I looked up and James Flexner was standing over me. The expression on his face was friendly, but after he had asked what I was writing about, the next question was the question I had come to dread: ‘How long have you been working on it?’ This time, however, when I replied, ‘Five years,’ the response was not an incredulous stare. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘that’s not so long. I’ve been working on my Washington for nine years.’ I could have jumped up and kissed him, whiskers and all — as, the next day, I could have jumped up and kissed Joe Lash, big beard and all, when he asked me the same question, and, after hearing my answer, said in his quiet way, ‘*Eleanor and Franklin* took me seven years.’ In a couple of sentences, these two men — idols of mine — had wiped away five years of doubt.”

Even for one of the literary giants of the 20th century, learning that his experience was normal brought profound relief.

When I was CEO of Kickstarter, I had breakfast each month with Fred Wilson, a board member and highly regarded figure in tech. During these breakfasts I’d share with Fred the challenges of the moment: someone was leaving, a new hire wasn’t working out, a competitor was creating headaches. Fred’s perspective — gained through working with many companies and CEOs — was always insightful. Some of the most helpful advice he ever gave me was the simplest: that the challenges I was facing were normal. Everyone went through this. It wasn’t just me.

Learning that a challenge was normal was liberating. It went from a personal shame to a badge of honor. This is what people (or companies, parents, couples, bands, etc.) like me go through. They got through it, and so can I.
> # Before that moment (and without realizing it), a belief in the uniqueness of my experience had led me to think I had little to learn from others. My own individualism got in my way.

Once I knew that a problem was normal, I became more resourceful in solving it. I wanted to crowdsource the best solution by learning what others had done. Before that moment (and without realizing it), a belief in the uniqueness of my experience had led me to think I had little to learn from others. My own individualism got in my way.

The limits of individualism were the subject of “Youth Mode,” a breakout 2013 report by the trend forecasters [K-HOLE](&lt;|url|&gt;). Individuality had reached a crisis point. The energy and effort required to individualize ourselves, the group wrote, had increased significantly.

“Individuality was once the path to personal freedom — a way to lead life on your own terms. But the terms keep getting more and more specific, making us more and more isolated,” they wrote.

We’re all individuals with unique things about us. However, a world where we focus only on this fact is a world where each person is isolated in their hyper-specific experiences. Everyone is equally unique, and equally alone in their uniqueness.

K-HOLE speculated that some people were adapting to this challenge not by distinguishing themselves further, but by choosing to selectively become more normal instead. K-HOLE dubbed this choice “normcore.”

“Normcore seeks the freedom that comes with non-exclusivity. It finds liberation in being nothing special, and realizes that adaptability leads to belonging,” they wrote. “Normcore is a path to a more peaceful life.”

K-HOLE’s report became a viral sensation. But lost in the noise was K-HOLE’s actual idea: the proposal for a kind of post-individualism. A mindset that acknowledges each person’s individuality, but sees it as just one part of a person’s identity — not its defining trait.

A post-individualist perspective would say that all humans have individual characteristics unique to them — however, it’s not where the story ends. The bigger revelation is the many ways that we’re similar despite our unique experiences and differences. We all come from different places, but look how much we share. By letting go of our individuality we allow ourselves to participate in something bigger than just ourselves.

“Once upon a time people were born into communities and had to find their individuality,” wrote K-HOLE. “Today people are born individuals and have to find their communities.”

Or to put it another way, today people are born special, but if they want to feel like they belong, they have to find their way back to normal.

One path back from the trap of hyper-individualism comes through accepting the ways that we’re normal. We’re all the exception to the norm in one or two facets of life, but in most everything else we’re normal. Even the cool kids tell their moms they love them. Even Noam Chomsky watches *Law & Order* most nights before going to sleep. (Or at least [he did in 2003](&lt;|url|&gt;).)

The spectrum of human experience might feel wider than it used to be, but in reality it’s much smaller. The internet and mass media continue to make us more alike, while simultaneously luring us into silos of minute differences.

Trapped in our own unique experience bubbles, it’s hard to get a handle on what’s really going on. Our individual sample size is too small. We need our own experience plus an external reference point to properly situate ourselves. It was only after Robert Caro learned how long it took his heroes to write books that he knew where he stood. It was after breakfasts with Fred Wilson that I was clear on what was worth worrying about and what wasn’t.
> # By treating our own experiences more like public domain than copyrighted IP, we create a more informed sense of normal for all.

This is why sharing our experiences with our peers and others is so important. By treating our own experiences more like public domain than copyrighted IP, we create a more informed sense of normal for all. We tend to see our life experiences as proprietary information, but we have far more to gain by distributing them openly and widely. When we’re frank about our experiences, we’re helping our friends, peers, neighbors, and future versions of ourselves. There are few more generous or noble acts than this.

I saw this happen first-hand in 2010 when a writer named Craig Mod, who’d had a successful Kickstarter project, wrote a [detailed postmortem of his experience](&lt;|url|&gt;). In it, he noticed his project’s “dead zone” — a period between when it first launched and ended where activity slowed considerably.

Mod’s essay prompted the Kickstarter team to dig deeper into the numbers. A few weeks later we [published a larger study on “the trough”](&lt;|url|&gt;) (as we called it), which showed that every project experienced that same dip that Mod went through in the middle of its campaign. The normalization of this knowledge helped creators be prepared for some lonely days and nights rather than feel despair or personal rejection when they inevitably arrived.

This defense of normal is not an endorsement for aiming low or settling for less. Progress depends on people breaking the expectations and boundaries of what’s normal. This is how normal gets better over time for everyone.

This defense of normal is a celebration of similarity. We live in a time when what’s desirable is what’s different. But there’s more value in our non-individuality than we admit. We’re not the first people to become parents, experience hardship or injustice, or create innovation or success. Without diminishing our individual achievements or stories, we have much to gain and little to lose by better appreciating the ways our experiences make us similar — and even normal.<|endoftext|>

# Don’t Blame the Designers for Your Digital Addiction

## So-called dopamine hacking is more sales pitch than science. What matters isn’t how our attention is captured, but what we pay attention to.

![Illustration: [Rebekka Dunlap](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Rebekka Dunlap](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Earlier this month, during a visit to a YMCA in London, Prince Harry [argued](&lt;|url|&gt;) that *Fortnite *should be banned, complaining that the video game is “created to addict, an addiction to keep you in front of a computer for as long as possible.” The prince is just the most recent in a long line of folks who worry about what digital technology is doing to our brains. That group increasingly includes some of the people who brought these products to us in the first place — last year, Facebook’s founding president Sean Parker, who left the company in 2005, [complained](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the “like” button exploits customers by creating a feedback loop of dopamine rewards.

It’s true that the most effective forms of digital media can be so compelling to some users as to feel addictive. That’s because they activate the brain’s reward system — or mesolimbic pathway — releasing the neurotransmitter dopamine and providing a sense of pleasure or satisfaction. But the concerns raised by critics like Harry and Parker actually represent a crude overgeneralization about how our brains respond to electronic media. Using this intellectual framework to describe what’s happening when we use our devices probably does more harm than good.

Some people have come to believe that smartphone notifications essentially function as Pavlovian stimuli — visual or auditory signals that lead to an involuntary biological response — buying into a pseudoscientific narrative that encourages us to imagine that simple behavioral conditioning is tantamount to shooting up heroin. That’s not the case. As Julie Jargon [recently wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the *Wall Street Journal*, “accurately measuring dopamine in the brain is a challenge, and can involve injections of radioactive materials that can be tracked on a PET scan.” Nobody does that while developing digital user interfaces.
> # Savvy designers probably began suggesting that their data was a measure of dopamine rewards because it helped to sell their products.

So what are software engineers [referring to](&lt;|url|&gt;) when they use terms like “dopamine hacking” or “brain hacking” to describe the way they design products to hook users? It starts with the acknowledgement that the experience of pleasure can be understood, from a neurochemical perspective, as the release of dopamine. This is true for every experience of pleasure, without distinction. Dopamine is released when you bite into a warm chocolate cake, when you kiss a lover, and when your favorite song comes on the radio. But when it comes to software design, the activities in the brain’s pleasure center are theoretical.

Developers use A/B testing, segmentation, and similar methods to collect data about how certain symbolic rewards — notifications, ringing bells, vibrations, animations, color patterns, etc. — perform in relation to others. These are not neurochemical measures, but rather, very [simple controlled experiments](&lt;|url|&gt;). For example, different variations of the same digital content might be presented to users in order to determine which version is statistically more likely to produce a specific behavior. Engineers then use that data to iterate their products in ways that will presumably maximize the desired outcomes.

Savvy designers probably began [suggesting that their data was a measure of dopamine rewards](&lt;|url|&gt;) because it helped to sell their products. It made it sound as if their psychometrics were a biological way of delivering messaging to consumers. The neurochemical framing was a great sales pitch. But that’s really all it is — a sales pitch.

One could also frame the pleasure you experience reading an article on *Medium* in terms of dopamine rewards. Good authors are always honing their writing styles to maximize reader engagement. They know that short sentences can create rhythms that are exciting. Fast-paced. Jarring. And long sentences, packed with metaphorical clauses, can feel like whitewater rafting: a reader tossed from side to side, words splashing up to create the thrilling mist of meaning.

Similarly, religious institutions have always iterated their rituals to maximize dopamine rewards. The music of the Catholic Mass kept changing. Stained glass was developed to make biblical stories more compelling. The best architects and engineers were hired to build increasingly transcendent cathedrals. These changes can all be understood as the result of a simple analysis of the behaviors parishioners manifested as the result of dopamine release. In fact, [recent research confirms](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the essential oils frankincense and myrrh — just like smartphone notifications — have a demonstrable impact on our brain chemistry. But that shouldn’t be surprising. All pleasure can be understood, or framed, as the result of an activated reward system in the brain. So why, then, are we so willing to grant digital media unusual powers in this regard?

Certainly, it’s true that computer processing power enables us to collect, analyze, and interpret engagement metrics with unprecedented precision and depth. “We can now build systems that adapt to user behavior in real time, maximizing the pleasurable experience,” says Keith Devlin, co-founder and former executive director of Stanford University’s Human Sciences and Technologies Advanced Research Institute. “But it’s equally accurate to say that this is what a good stand-up comedian does intuitively by ‘reading’ the audience.”

I don’t think anybody’s worried that John Mulaney is destroying human civilization by making us laugh. Likewise, the so-called dark patterns and gambling mechanics of video games and social media are a lot less scary than the fearmongers would have you think.
> # All pleasure can be understood, or framed, as the result of an activated reward system in the brain. So why, then, are we so willing to grant digital media unusual powers in this regard?

It’s certainly true that some folks can develop an unhealthy craving for a dopamine fix. Kids might be seduced into making far too many in-app purchases, and grown-ups might use Tinder in compulsive ways. “It is to be expected that in some individuals the pleasure-seeking urge could be pathologically high or low,” says Devlin. “For instance, there are sex addicts and chronic overeaters (as well as people who are sex-averse or anorexic). But we don’t blame sex or food.” Likewise, we shouldn’t automatically scapegoat digital technologies just because it’s possible for some people to overindulge. Sure, the designers of electronic media try to maximize their profits by taking advantage of those who are most susceptible — as do fast food franchises and internet porn sites — but that’s really a feature of consumer capitalism, not digital technology.

Still, there may be a good reason to worry — not about brain chemistry, but rather about the ethical implications of the tech industry’s dopamine hacking narrative. It presumes that an effort to maximize pleasure and engagement constitutes a worthy end in itself. More clicks, more eyeballs, and more users are often not only the objectives, but also the metrics of success and the incentives. It’s enticement for its own sake: to maximize growth and scale of the persuasive apparatus. Alternatively, we tend to presume that religious rituals and good books engineer engagement, pleasure, and feelings of contentment in the service of a thesis, a moral message, or a higher purpose.

But this concern isn’t unique to the digital era. Almost two and a half millennia ago, Socrates complained that the Sophists of ancient Greece prioritized rhetoric over truth. He argued that oration — effectively the social media of its time — that doesn’t aim to bring us closer to “the good” is a cause for concern. In Plato’s *Republic, *Socrates even warned that prioritizing attention over meaning would ultimately prove to be democracy’s downfall. When a citizen “lives from day to day, gratifying the appetite of the moment,” he tells Adeimantus, “there is neither order nor necessity in his life, yet he calls it pleasant, free, and blessedly happy.”

Unfortunately for Socrates, the men of Athens weren’t interested in his message. Instead, he was tried, convicted, and executed for employing exactly the kind of supposedly empty rhetoric that he accused them of using: “making the weaker argument the stronger.”

There’s nothing new about the fear and demonization of rhetorical skill. And that’s why the question we need to confront isn’t whether screens are too engaging, addictive, or manipulative. Instead, it’s about how we categorize and make meaning from the different kinds of symbolic representations that accompany the release of dopamine rewards. We need to teach our children, as elders always have, to distinguish between the good and bad sensations of pleasure.<|endoftext|>

# The Night My Doorbell Camera Captured a Shooting

## The 36-second video changed my perspective on home surveillance

![Photo: kyoshino/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: kyoshino/Getty Images*

At first, I wondered briefly if the popping sounds we heard outside were fireworks. K, my boyfriend, looked over at me. It wasn’t late — maybe 9 or 10 o’clock on a Saturday night in February. Our one-year-old was asleep upstairs, and we were standing in the hallway, getting ready to retreat to different rooms. The latest episode of *Grey’s Anatomy* was waiting for me on Hulu; he had video games to play in his man cave.

“Did you hear that?” he asked.

Before I could respond, we heard people screaming. For a moment, we didn’t move, and then K darted around me and up the stairs to our daughter’s bedroom, which faces the front of the house. I was close behind him. He snatched her out of the crib and handed her to me. I immediately went into my office, closed the door and sat on the floor away from the windows, soothing our now crying toddler.

Once she quieted down, I strained my ears to listen. The popping sounds had stopped, but I could still hear faint voices outside. The walls of our three-level home in the suburbs felt penetrable now in a way they hadn’t before.

My boyfriend returned a few moments later. “You can come out,” he said. “Whatever happened is over.”

“So it was a shooting?” I asked.

“Yeah. I found blood outside by the front door.”

In 2016, a few months after the birth of our daughter, K and I bought a house in a quiet, family-friendly neighborhood in Grovetown, Georgia, outside of the city of Augusta. My partner thought it was a good opportunity to make our home as “smart” as possible. He works far away, so he wanted a surveillance system that would enable him to check on the house easily. His vision was Alexa on every level, security cameras inside and outside, and the ability to adjust the thermostat from our phones — maybe even smart appliances one day, when we could afford them.

“How cool is this smart fridge though, Kim?” he asked me excitedly one day as we researched smart appliances. “It has a touchscreen!”

As for me, I was perfectly satisfied with a dumb refrigerator. Whatever conveniences associated with a smart home seemed like more trouble than it was all worth. More than that, I didn’t want to feel watched in my own home.

Our front door lacked a manual peephole, so K started the tech takeover with a doorbell camera. He chose one called SkyBell, which connects to the Wi-Fi network and allows you to see who’s outside via a mobile app. SkyBell also includes motion sensors, which enable recording even if a visitor hasn’t rung the bell.

I was indifferent about the upgrade — until the night of the shooting.

After putting our daughter back to bed, K and I sat on the couch, discussing what had just happened. I sat close to him, unnerved. “I can’t believe there was a shooting our neighborhood,” I kept saying.

Earlier in the evening, we’d noticed the unusual number of cars parked in front of our house and down the street. We joked that someone was clearly having a party but we hadn’t been invited. We didn’t know for sure, but we guessed — just by the sheer number of attendees — that the party must have gotten out of hand. By the time K went outside to investigate, the excitement had died down. No one was running.

That’s when he’d noticed the drops of blood.

After sitting quietly together for a few minutes, K suddenly pulled his phone out. “I wonder if the SkyBell caught anything.”

It did. Together, we watched the 36-second video — in somewhat muted, full-color night vision — over and over again. At least a dozen people whose faces we couldn’t make out crossed the screen, running away from something happening to the left of our vantage point. About halfway through the clip, a sedan pulled up, and two people who’d been running across our grass pivoted to jump into the car.

Meanwhile, a guy who’d already run past doubled back, stopping right in front of our door. He called out to someone urgently: “You good?” His voice sounded young. “You good?” Another guy limped quickly up to the first, who put his arm around his shoulders to help him. “Move!” he pleads as the two disappear off-screen. “Come on!”

K pointed to the guy who was limping. “He’s probably the one who got shot.” The following morning, we found blood trailing from in front of our porch stairs across the driveway to the side of our house. When the police stopped by to ask us questions a day later, we gave them our footage.
> # Watching that clip brought me some comfort. Now, at least, I had a better idea of where the blood had come from.

The fact that someone had gotten shot in our neighborhood — maybe even in our yard — was frightening. I felt exposed. We were never really in danger inside our home, but it bothered me having nothing but my imagination to fill in the gaps of what had occurred outside, amidst the sound of gunfire and people screaming.

But watching that clip brought me some comfort. Now, at least, I had a better idea of where the blood had come from. Knowing the gunshots had originated from that party — one that seemed uncharacteristic for the neighborhood — also convinced me that another shooting was unlikely.

The peace of mind I gleaned from that video is similar to the reassurance streetlights offer. Traveling down a dark road is scary, foreboding — who knows what’s out there waiting for us. But lights along a street allow us to better assess our surroundings and, consequently, any potential threats. Streetlights make us feel more secure — even if [research shows](&lt;|url|&gt;) they don’t necessarily deter crime — because they give us more information about our environment.

Of course, smart doorbells come with their own issues, [privacy](&lt;|url|&gt;) being a huge one — both for our family, if anyone were to hack the camera, and for those [caught by its gaze](&lt;|url|&gt;). There’s so much information I can easily gather from a device that fits in the palm of my hand; sometimes, I can’t help but wonder who else might be able to access that same information.

Yet, for me, those legitimate concerns don’t outweigh the benefits. Home security technology gives us the ability to see beyond the darkness. I don’t expect our doorbell camera — or any surveillance system — to actually make our home safer. But I do feel safer having them now.

I’m not afraid of what might be happening behind our front door anymore. I can pull out my phone and see for myself.<|endoftext|>

# The Home of the Future Could Be Powered by Microbes

## An ecological vision of architecture promises to provide electricity by integrating living systems into the walls of our homes

In a secure laboratory in the southwest of England, a living wall stands before me, luminous and throbbing. I’m wearing a protective blue lab coat that’s too short on my wrists, trying to trace the paths between light-filled chambers and capsules of bright green liquid. This looming system of pumps, vats, and plastic tubes, running between 15 white boxes of wild microbes and genetically modified algae and reaching up to the ceiling in a stack of silver scaffolding, dominates the room.

While it might sound like I’m on the set of a sci-fi film, all bubbling liquids and quivering tubes, this is actually a prototype for a new kind of architecture, one that generates energy by decomposing living matter — human urine, to be exact.

“The driving engine of the wall is the microbial fuel cell,” explains Yannis Ieropoulos, a professor of bioenergy and self-sustainable systems at the University of the West of England. He traces the path from tanks of liquid into one of the brick-shaped boxes. “Microbes will break down the organic fraction of the household waste that flows through.”

Inside each fuel cell is a bright green soup of algae that produces oxygen in order to facilitate a process whereby the chemical energy of metabolizing microbes, fed on urine, is converted into electrical energy. In the same cells, genetically modified algae is used to help recover specific elements, such as phosphorus, which can be extracted, collected, and used for other purposes such as manufacturing.

Outside the secure room, lab coat off, I’m shown an earlier iteration of a brick that’s full of dead flies. It works on the same principle: Organic matter is broken down by anaerobically respiring microorganisms, creating energy in the process. Put all these bricks together and connect it to your plumbing, and you have a wall that can take whatever you flush down the toilet, clean the water, and power your TV, all at the same time.

At least, that’s the ambition. Together, the 15 bricks in the living wall are able to produce only around 60 milliwatts — just enough to power the wall’s control system and a small mechanism that opens and shuts a window. This is a proof of concept, the result of a three-year project between the University of the West of England, the University of Newcastle, the Spanish National Research Council, the University of Trento, and a number of other European partners. The aim is to show how our homes could be transformed to produce renewable energy and fresh water while extracting valuable resources from the waste we flush away.

“We’re trying to find the right tools and technologies to implement a vision of living architecture—an architecture that can incorporate the processes of life,” says Rachel Armstrong, a professor of experimental architecture at Newcastle University. “Not just the forms, not just a metaphorical or rhetorical gesture, but actually embody the processes of life.”

For as long as humans have been building homes, we’ve been trying to prevent nature from getting in. This structure presents a fundamentally different vision: a building where natural cycles are literally built into the walls. “This is not about aesthetics,” Armstrong says. “It’s about how we can start to reconstruct our relationship between place, nature, and each other.”

Bio-integrated design could also find its way into our household objects. The Electric Life lamp, on display in an exhibition at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, is powered by microbes contained in a dark cylinder at its heart. Instead of flicking a switch and relying on the power grid to feed the light, the lamp needs to be fed a teaspoon of vinegar each week to keep its organic power supply in good condition.

“We are so used to energy being somewhat limitless and available with the push of a button,” Teresa van Dongen, the lamp’s creator, tells me. “If in the future we need to feed our lamps or some of our other electronics in the way we take care of a plant, we might appreciate the energy that it created more.”

It’s certainly a different way to think about a lamp—less like an inanimate object and more like a pet that needs to be fed and watered. In the 1920s, the Swiss architect Le Corbusier described his modernist vision for a home as a “machine for living.” In 2019, that vision still clings on. Picture a “modern” living space and you’ll see a room that’s efficient, controlled — and sterile. Working with microbes, on the other hand, means forging a symbiotic relationship with other life-forms — one creature’s waste becomes food for another, and one side’s metabolism is another’s electricity.

“About 60% of our earth’s biomass is microbes, and we have 10 times more microbes on our bodies than we have cells of our own,” Van Dongen says. “We should embrace the fact that we already have a very close collaboration with microorganisms.”

What shape should that collaboration take? Should we think of our homes like gardens that need tending? The next step in the Living Architecture project is to come up with an interface to communicate the state of the microbes, something Armstrong describes as “a bit like a Tamagotchi.” Like a digital pet, it would give information about the health of the microorganisms. Are they producing enough power? Have they been adequately fed?

The main difference is that if you let this pet die, your lights will go out.

It’s not only the interiors of our homes that could house living systems. In the Bartlett School of Architecture in London, Professor Marcos Cruz has been working on [bioreceptive concrete](&lt;|url|&gt;), which is carbonated to lower its pH level and help nurture spore-based plants such as algae, lichens, mosses, and ferns on the exterior of buildings.

As well as providing natural insulation and converting carbon dioxide into oxygen, it could be possible to extract electric currents from these plants as they photosynthesize. These would be minute amounts of energy, but given enough scale — and with elaborately ornamental facades that boost the overall surface area — Cruz says this could become a useful power supply in the future.

“If you just think about the amount of surface area that humans have added to the world, it’s enormous,” he says. “You take a building and look at its footprint, then calculate the facade and roof area with all its intricacies, and you make the footprint 20 times bigger. If you take skyscrapers, it can be 100 times bigger.”
> # “We have to go beyond the modernist paradigm of abstraction and purity.”

Turning our cities into new forests could happen sooner than you think. [French studio XTU Architects](&lt;|url|&gt;) recently published a concept for a set of twisting glass buildings in China that are designed to grow algae on their surfaces. Part skyscraper, part Hobbit home, the design looks quite unlike the high-rise towers you’d expect to see in a central business district. Indeed, Cruz says an ongoing challenge is convincing people that moss-covered buildings are beautiful, not derelict. “There is a long history of comparing building facades with human skin. When they have patches that look out of place, people see them as a pathology.”

Once again, this new vision of architecture comes up against the way of thinking we’ve grown accustomed to through the 20th century — that our buildings should be sleek, sterile, man-made machines that protect us from nature. “We need to redesign our facades and interiors to accommodate growth,” Cruz says. “That’s a big frontline challenge. We have to go beyond the modernist paradigm of abstraction and purity.”

With humanity facing the [existential threat](&lt;|url|&gt;) of climate change and time running out for us to do anything about it, clinging to those modernist paradigms might soon become simply untenable. The continued burning of fossil fuels and the rampant destruction of forests are increasing carbon dioxide levels to worrying levels, with global warming teetering toward a 1.5 degree Celsius rise, beyond which lays [significantly higher risks of floods, droughts, and poverty](&lt;|url|&gt;) for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. Turning our homes and offices into carbon sinks could be the solution we need, but are we ready for the changes represented by “living architecture”?

Ultimately, how buildings look is only one part of this tension. The roots of what we take to be “modern” run deep into how we think about our lives, our cities, our societies—from what we consider hygienic to the amount of energy we expect our homes to deliver each day. Armstrong compares the living-wall prototype to a steel bridge built with a carpenter’s dovetail joints. “I understand I’m sitting between worlds here,” she says: one foot in the modern age and one in a new ecological age of microbial fuel cells and moss-covered buildings. Can they hold together?

They might have to. Given the reality of climate change, nature is going to come into our homes one way or another. It might as well be as an ally.<|endoftext|>

# 30 years on, what’s next #ForTheWeb?

## Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee reflects on how the web has changed our world

![](<|image|>)

Today, 30 years on from my original [proposal for an information management system](&lt;|url|&gt;), half the world is online. It’s a moment to celebrate how far we’ve come, but also an opportunity to reflect on how far we have yet to go.

[The web has become a public square](&lt;|url|&gt;), a library, a doctor’s office, a shop, a school, a design studio, an office, a cinema, a bank, and so much more. Of course with every new feature, every new website, the divide between those who are online and those who are not increases, making it all the more imperative to make the web available for everyone.

And while the web has created opportunity, given marginalised groups a voice, and made our daily lives easier, it has also created opportunity for scammers, given a voice to those who spread hatred, and made all kinds of crime easier to commit.

Against the backdrop of news stories about how the web is misused, it’s understandable that many people feel afraid and unsure if the web is really a force for good. But given how much the web has changed in the past 30 years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next 30. If we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us. We will have failed the web.

To tackle any problem, we must clearly outline and understand it. I broadly see three sources of dysfunction affecting today’s web:

1. Deliberate, malicious intent, such as state-sponsored hacking and attacks, criminal behaviour, and online harassment.

1. System design that creates perverse incentives where user value is sacrificed, such as ad-based revenue models that commercially reward clickbait and the viral spread of misinformation.

1. Unintended negative consequences of benevolent design, such as the outraged and polarised tone and quality of online discourse.

While the first category is impossible to eradicate completely, we can create both laws and code to minimize this behaviour, just as we have always done offline. The second category requires us to redesign systems in a way that changes incentives. And the final category calls for research to understand existing systems and model possible new ones or tweak those we already have.

You can’t just blame one government, one social network or the human spirit. Simplistic narratives risk exhausting our energy as we chase the symptoms of these problems instead of focusing on their root causes. To get this right, we will need to come together as a global web community.

At pivotal moments, generations before us have stepped up to work together for a better future. With the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](&lt;|url|&gt;), diverse groups of people have been able to agree on essential principles. With the [Law of the Sea](&lt;|url|&gt;) and the [Outer Space Treaty](&lt;|url|&gt;), we have preserved new frontiers for the common good. Now too, as the web reshapes our world, we have a responsibility to make sure it is recognised as a human right and built for the public good. This is why the [Web Foundation](&lt;|url|&gt;) is working with governments, companies and citizens to build a new [Contract for the Web](&lt;|url|&gt;).

This contract was launched in Lisbon at Web Summit, bringing together a group of people who agree we need to establish clear norms, laws and standards that underpin the web. Those who support it endorse its starting principles and together are working out the specific commitments in each area. No one group should do this alone, and all input will be appreciated. Governments, companies and citizens are all contributing, and we aim to have a result later this year.

Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open. And they have a responsibility to protect people’s rights and freedoms online. We need open web champions within government — civil servants and elected officials who will take action when private sector interests threaten the public good and who will stand up to protect the open web.

Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact or public safety. Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, diversity and security in mind. This year, we’ve seen a number of tech employees stand up and demand better business practices. We need to encourage that spirit.

And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable for the commitments they make, and demand that both respect the web as a global community with citizens at its heart. If we don’t elect politicians who defend a free and open web, if we don’t do our part to foster constructive healthy conversations online, if we continue to click consent without demanding our data rights be respected, we walk away from our responsibility to put these issues on the priority agenda of our governments.

The fight for the web is one of the most important causes of our time. Today, half of the world is online. It is more urgent than ever to ensure the other half are not left behind offline, and that everyone contributes to a web that drives equality, opportunity and creativity.

The Contract for the Web must not be a list of quick fixes but a process that signals a shift in how we understand our relationship with our online community. It must be clear enough to act as a guiding star for the way forward but flexible enough to adapt to the rapid pace of change in technology. It’s our journey from digital adolescence to a more mature, responsible and inclusive future.

The web is for everyone and collectively we hold the power to change it. It won’t be easy. But if we dream a little and work a lot, we can get the web we want.

# The Efficiency Delusion

## Optimizing how we live, work, and play is embedded deep in the psyche of coders and American culture. But how much efficiency is too much?

![Credit: Patrick Llewyn-Davies/OJO Images/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Patrick Llewyn-Davies/OJO Images/Getty*

*Co-authored with [Clive Thompson](&lt;|twitter|&gt;)*

This year began with the writer David Pogue identifying six important lessons that he’s learned from observing how tech companies behave. One of them is this: “[Frictionless always wins](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

“If you want to place bets on the success of new technologies, examine how much ‘friction’ they eliminate: effort, steps and hassle,” Pogue wrote in *Scientific American*. “The remote control; microwave meals; e-mail; text messages; the iPod; Google Maps; Amazon.com; Siri and Alexa; and, yeah, self-driving cars — each, in its way, introduced a new way to let us be lazier.”

The drive to remove friction in the digital technology space permeates everything from social interactions to business transactions, from Facebook bombarding us with notifications about what our friends are saying and doing to millions of people around the world ordering Uber rides on their phones instead of standing on street corners to hail cabs.

It’s not hard to see why removing friction works as a business model. [Reducing transaction costs](&lt;|url|&gt;) has regularly proven to be a powerful way to influence behavior. And it’s also not hard to see why we, the users, go for it: It’s often genuinely useful when someone automates a difficult or boring task for us.

But efficiency isn’t always value neutral. Placing efficiency over other values can be a mistake — a lapse in ethical, political, personal, or professional judgment. Some human or civic interactions thrive when they’re deliberate and erode when they’re sped up. There’s a great quote that’s been attributed to Virginia Woolf — “[Efficiency cuts the grass of the mind to its roots](&lt;|url|&gt;)” — though, alas, we can’t find any evidence that it was Woolf who actually said this. But the sentiment rings true and the expression is so beautiful that we wish she did put things this way.
> # We believe that if technology can make some aspect of our lives more efficient, we’ll get back free time. Instead, we often to have to recalibrate what we do.

Both of us wrote books that discuss why the efficiency mindset is seductive and what can go wrong when it goes too far. Evan, a philosophy professor, did a deep dive with Brett Frischmann in [*Re-Engineering Humanity](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. Clive, a longtime writer for *Wired *and the *New York Times Magazine*, gets to the bottom of things in his new book, [*Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. The following edited excerpt between us captures the flavor of a recent conversation.

## **Life is a spreadsheet**

**Evan Selinger:** While you were writing *Coders*, you talked about your research to my students — many of whom are engineering and science majors. What really resonated is that some of the engineers you interviewed described experiencing inefficient situations as really troubling, like smelling something awful or tasting something gross. Can you elaborate on this visceral sense of how engineers tick, reflect their sensibilities into products, and project an impatient worldview onto the rest of us?

**Clive Thompson:** If you’d asked me what are some of the typical traits of the people who tend to find coding fun before I started working on the book, I would have made rather obvious observations. Programmers are good at thinking logically. They enjoy solving puzzles and breaking down complicated things.

What I didn’t expect to routinely hear from people who became programmers is that, early on, they appreciated that machines are really good at things that humans are bad at. They’re amazing at taking any process that’s a boring slog and making it faster and more efficient through automation.

Different coders often told me the same story from school, a moment when the efficiency lightbulb went off. As kids, they’d be in math class, hating to have to show all their work. It was always some boring question they knew the answer to at a glance but were forced to write up in multiple steps. So, they all were like, “Let me just write a solver,” in whatever language they were using. They’d type in the equation and, *boom*, a machine outputs all the different steps without them having to do all of the work.

After this success, a realization set in: “Wow, my life is filled with dull, repetitive tasks. And I now know how to instruct a machine to do boring chores. So, I should hand them over.” A kind of thrill in optimizing is born.

Since computers are functional machines that can do lots of different things, these coders would very quickly start developing a type of X-ray vision about the world itself. They’d just keep on thinking, “Wow, I could automate that. I could make this more efficient. I could automate this other thing, too.”

Can you think of any examples from the classroom that fit this pattern?

**Selinger:** Yes. In philosophy classes, we ask students to present respectful and rational criticisms of other people’s ideas. Don’t just say someone is wrong; instead, give the best interpretation of an argument that you disagree with and carefully explain where it goes astray. This approach to speaking and thinking takes time. It’s much slower than verbally kneecapping someone and stating a contrary opinion. But the lack of efficiency is a feature of the system, not a bug.
> # “We believe that if technology can make some aspect of our lives more efficient, we’ll get back free time to do the things we actually find meaningful. Instead, we often have to recalibrate what we do.”

I’ve noticed some students initially find this type of interaction strange, and I’ve been told that things work differently in engineering classes — at least some of them, anyway. Apparently, some instructors get straight to the point when criticizing their assignments. Being downright brutal in this context is viewed as a sign of respect, not rudeness. It’s seen as a way of recognizing a student’s ability to learn quickly and quickly fix mistakes — mistakes that, say, could have terrible real-world consequences, like accidents happening on a structurally unsound bridge. Coming from this background, what philosophers call “discourse ethics” can seem like unnecessary flattery that wastes precious time.

In your experience, what’s a good example that illustrates how hard it is for programmers to stop thinking about the world as an efficiency problem?

**Thompson:** I’ve got two for you. The first is about a fairly senior engineer who was probably a project manager. At some point, he got very angry at the number of jokes that were being told in meetings, because he was like, “Well, this is a waste of time, and our time is precious.” He literally calculated what he estimated to be the number of jokes told over one year and worked out how many personal hours he felt were being wasted on this.

Of course, the surreal thing about that is anyone who actually knows how organizations work will tell you that little bits of joking in a meeting might be the most important thing being done there. They provide unit cohesion. They’re moments of levity that allow people to continue working under frustrating deadlines and stuff like that. But this guy just couldn’t get past seeing life as a spreadsheet.

A woman who works for Trulia once told me, “I’ll be walking to work, and I’ll literally be standing there at the corner watching people cross the street and think, ‘Oh my god, they’re doing this in a completely inefficient fashion. I wish I could get everyone to walk in a more optimized way.’” And she’s sort of laughing, because she knows it sounds crazy. But she also realizes that the instinct is hard to turn off.

**Selinger: **I love this story, because the second chapter of *Re-Engineering Humanity *is titled “Cogs in the Machine of Our Own Lives.” It presents a series of thought experiments to help readers critically consider an important question: What behavior shouldn’t you outsource to machines?

For example, if a GPS-like technology could safely direct your body in the direction that you wanted to walk, would you use it so you could free up your mind? Instead of paying attention to your surroundings, you could watch a video streaming online. If so, why wouldn’t you go further? What about a machine that could move your mouth and chew your food for you? Or one that could adjust your face so you never missed a chance to smile at the right occasion?

Ultimately, these examples point in the direction of a frightening future that some people are really excited about. If you think the transhumanist vision of someday ditching your body altogether and downloading your consciousness is a bad idea, what arguments against it are you willing to make, and what values do you, no pun intended, stand for?

## **The Efficiency Delusion**

**Selinger:** Why do you think so many of us keep making the same mistake over and over again? We believe that if technology can make some aspect of our lives more efficient, we’ll get back free time to do the things we actually find meaningful. Instead, we often have to recalibrate what we do. And that’s because expectations change along with shifts in the technological landscape.

Take the myth that once self-driving cars spare people from the burden of needing to drive to work and pay attention to the road, they’ll be able to focus their attention on invigorating and rewarding activities, like reading for pleasure during the commute. More likely, employers will expect the workday to begin the second you enter the vehicle. Instead of being disburdened, more productivity will be ratcheted out of us.

**Thompson: **The majority of software developers still espouse the idea that when they make something more efficient, it will have the positive effect of freeing up more time somewhere else. And I can understand why they see things that way. Coders keep their noses down when solving an onerous problem. When they’re done, they feel good. And when they see people using the software they created, it feels enormously satisfying.
> # “Unfortunately, once something is no longer novel and the change in tempo or style stops feeling fresh, the effect fades.”

Part of the issue is that American culture has long been entranced by the idea that speed is good and that getting more is good. It goes back to guys like Benjamin Franklin who were obsessed with trying to pack more into life. He invented bifocals because he was sick of swapping one pair of glasses for another. So, in many respects, we’re particularly susceptible to the vision of efficiency as a way of life because it’s woven into the spirit that governs the country.

Why are consumers so eager to find a new app that we hope will speed up our lives or give us more free time? I think this has to do with the novelty effect. When we change something in our environment, we sometimes discover that we’re temporarily more productive and creative. Unfortunately, once something is no longer novel and the change in tempo or style stops feeling fresh, the effect fades.

**Selinger: **That’s a great diagnosis. While our Virginia Woolf quote is probably spurious, I hope others embrace the actual language I’m going to use to characterize this problem. This fetish with frictionlessness should be seen as the* efficiency delusion*.<|endoftext|>

# How I Became Addicted to an On-Demand Gig

## I quickly discovered that Postmates was a genius at luring me back online

![Credit: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images*

When I look back on the two months that I spent as a delivery courier in Los Angeles, my grandmother’s familiar words of wisdom come to mind: “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Whoever coined this phrase clearly lived several decades before the birth of the internet. We could argue that my grandmother’s wisdom is no longer true — or, at the very least, it deserves a healthy asterisk. In my case, the lunch is free if the customer doesn’t answer the door within 10 minutes. The bad news? That lunch is worth much less than my time.

You might ask what made a 34-year-old software developer deliver food on Postmates and Caviar. I attended two of the best universities in North America, graduated with honors, and had access to both Canadian and U.S. job markets as a dual citizen. The answer is simple: I couldn’t compete with H-1B visa workers and the tech world’s [outsourcing trend](&lt;|url|&gt;). After my job was eliminated, twice, I decided to focus on launching a startup. The company eventually failed prior to launch, but I gained so much valuable knowledge from it that I don’t regret the experience — even if it did force me to supplement my income through tutoring and food deliveries.

What I do regret, however, is the time (and gas) I spent driving up and down Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood chasing after that next “ping” notification. I’ve been told that in a lot of ways it’s similar to the day-to-day life of a drug addict: constantly searching for their next fix. Just like a drug dealer, on-demand companies seem to try to get new couriers hooked by initially giving them a higher priority when determining who should be offered the next available delivery. Those new couriers then get the impression that the demand for deliveries in their area is much greater than it actually is. They’re also conditioned to believe that a majority of deliveries are for higher quality (or higher dollar) restaurants or merchants.

How is this similar to the relationship between the seller and buyer of an illicit drug? Quite simply, the seller knows the competition like the back of their hand. Their goal is not merely to make a single sale — it’s to develop a loyal repeat customer. They may give them a better deal (or even a better quality product) the first time, but the goal is nevertheless the same as that of the service facilitator: to get you hooked on short-term satisfaction that only they can provide.

I should probably mention that I’m fortunate enough to have never battled with drug addiction, nor do I claim to be an expert on the subject. I’m not saying that being a courier is in any way as destructive to your health and well-being as taking an illicit drug is, but the addictive characteristics between the two shouldn’t be ignored.
> # Competition between on-demand apps has fueled the necessity for quicker and cheaper deliveries.

After a few days using the app, the outcome becomes quite clear: you’re consistently logging in at locations where you previously experienced positive results. I can remember sitting in my car, in a parking lot for an hour or two, waiting for a job. Inevitably it seemed, right as I was about to call it quits, I would receive a ping with a new pickup request. I began to wonder if the motion of my car leaving the parking lot triggered the app in some way. That doesn’t mean that after the honeymoon period is over you’re not getting any pings for new deliveries. In my experience, the decline was more gradual, but noticeably deliberate, after a week.

This isn’t rocket science, but there are complex algorithms that determine which worker should be assigned to a particular order. Since the logic behind it is very much proprietary and differs from service to service, we don’t really know all the factors that come into play. We can, however, assume at least one thing: these companies want as many workers online, in a given area and at a given time, as possible. Competition between on-demand apps has fueled the necessity for quicker and cheaper deliveries. What will they do to make sure you’re willing to go online (and thus accept more work) when they want you to? Offer time-sensitive bonuses and other incentives that ultimately flood the pool of available drivers and couriers within minutes. Typically these are offered at two levels: area-specific bonuses where all workers in that area receive the notification on their smartphone, or worker-specific bonuses where you receive an exclusive notification in the app itself.

I quickly discovered that Postmates was a genius at luring me back online. I would go days without opening the app, and then, out of the blue, I would receive an email from “Postmates Fleet” offering me a significant bonus — anywhere from an extra $75 to $250 — if I completed a certain number of deliveries within a specific time frame — usually within a couple of days and only at certain hours (i.e. 50 deliveries between the hours of 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. within the next two days). Why are these so tempting? Because if you’re like me — a single guy living in a super expensive area with two student loans in two different countries, a car loan, a few credit cards with balances, and a hungry German shepherd — you are hustling for every dime. Unfortunately, these incentives are actually designed to be unattainable. Sometimes laughably unattainable.

Your bonus is dependent on the number of deliveries you are offered in the first place. You don’t have to be the smartest person on planet Earth to realize that it’s not in Postmates’ best interest to give you enough deliveries to actually hit that magic number. Don’t get me wrong: some couriers do receive a bonus, but it’s rare. How can I be so sure of this? Because the law of supply and demand does not work out in the courier’s favor. There are far more couriers available for prime-time deliveries, in most areas, than are needed. That’s good for the delivery companies and their customers, but less so for the workers.

Up until now, I’ve focused solely on these on-demand gigs and you might feel that I’ve left out all the other types of services that make up what some would call the gig economy. I would argue that the term gig economy is defined in a subjective manner. Some people consider traditional freelancers and temporary contractors to be part of the definition; however, I do not. The concept of freelancers and temporary contractors isn’t anything new. Having worked in the IT industry for a while, I’ve had the privilege of being part of many development teams where freelancers and contractors were sometimes brought in to fill certain roles or gaps in productivity. So why shouldn’t they be considered gig workers? Because unlike Postmates couriers or Uber drivers, the freelancer or contractor knows exactly how much they are going to be paid for their time, and usually knows how much time they’ll be required to give.

You might notice that I used the word *“*time*”* and not *“*work*.”* There is, in fact, a difference between the two. The time clock for freelancers or contractors typically begins from the moment they arrive at the office or sit down at the computer. The time clock for gig workers isn’t so conclusive or transparent. It may even start and stop at wildly different breakpoints.

For example, most readers would be surprised to learn that [Postmates does not compensate their “independent contractors” for mileage or travel time from the courier’s current location to the restaurant.](&lt;|url|&gt;) Postmates does offer couriers a variable amount (based on your city’s service area) that is paid out as the “pickup” portion for that delivery’s total compensation. At the time of writing, this amount is set at [$1.00 for Los Angeles](&lt;|url|&gt;). This is especially problematic for couriers who live and work in a major metropolitan area, such as Los Angeles, where traffic and vast distances between the city and suburbs can add several hours onto your “shift” — all of which are effectively unpaid.
> # As a gig worker, you are paid for whatever they say you’re going to be paid for — and those rates do change quite often.

Since you’re always getting paid for only half the journey, it doesn’t take you very long to realize that a majority of your deliveries are to customers that reside far outside the cluster of restaurants and eateries. It isn’t uncommon for a courier to drive 10 miles, or more, just to drop off a few burritos from Taco Bell. My personal record was over 18 miles, one way, from North Hollywood to the Hawthorne/LAX area. It took me over an hour and a half to travel from the restaurant to the guy’s front door. How much did I make? $14.10. Although this amount wasn’t what I would’ve considered fair compensation, it actually represents one of the highest payouts that I ever received for a single delivery. If you factor in the amount of time and gas that I spent driving back to an area where I could receive another delivery request, I was paid considerably less than minimum wage. If you also factor in income tax, car maintenance, and depreciation costs, I practically volunteered to deliver a dozen soft shell tacos at 11 p.m.

The point is, as a gig worker, you are paid for whatever they say you’re going to be paid for — and those rates change quite often. Wage negotiation is nonexistent. [Experts claim that this is part of the beauty of the gig economy](&lt;|url|&gt;): no strings attached. If you don’t like the terms that are offered, you can simply log out of the app and you’re done. No hard feelings. In my experience, this is certainly easier said than done when you have bills that need to be paid. This is why so many hard-working adults, like myself, are drawn in to the perks of same-day payouts (and the occasional free lunch) in exchange for devaluing their time and effort. It gets even more difficult once you’ve experienced a few decent payouts. I would argue that most people who sign up for this type of work do so with an endgame in mind, and they cling to a sense of optimism in order to justify the long hours, the parking fines, and the monthly oil changes. You may have to drive your car for 10 hours straight, but at least you have a few bucks in your pocket, right? Now, rinse and repeat.<|endoftext|>

# What’s on Your Home Screen, Farhad Manjoo?

## Exploring a very messy screen with the ‘New York Times’ columnist

![Farhad Manjoo](<|image|>)*Farhad Manjoo*

*This is “What’s on Your Home Screen?” a Q&A column from *OneZero*. We want to understand more about how people use their smartphones—those life-consuming devices we dump hours into every day—to pave a path toward a better future. Or at least a more reflective one. We’ll add new entries regularly, and each will feature a new interview with a notable person about the apps they use, how they’re organized, and whether those red bubbles drive them nuts.*

Farhad Manjoo has written about technology for years and currently serves as an opinion columnist at the *New York Times*. In November, he advised readers to “[slow down and be mindful](&lt;|url|&gt;)” as they interact with new devices and the companies that control them: sober guidance from a man who knows how to practice discipline with his own gadgets and apps.

Or so you’d think. Here’s the thing: Farhad’s iPhone home screen is a disaster. A mess! It’s glutted with apps, notification bubbles (153 unread messages, according to the screenshot he sent), and the promise, via a series of dots positioned just above the bottom dock, of 16 pages filled with more. Honestly, it made me feel a little sick.
> # “The number of unread messages, it’s basically been 153 on my phone for a long time. I just think of 153 as zero.”

So we talked it out. I learned that Farhad thinks of himself as a “searcher,” not an “organizer.” He has a very deliberate way of interacting with his iPhone, even if what’s on his home screen looks like a jumbled mess.

What follows is our chat, edited for length and clarity.

![](<|image|>)

### **OneZero: I don’t need to tell you that tech mindfulness is a big topic right now. So, I want to talk to people and have a conversation about how they use their screens.**

**Farhad Manjoo**: The first caveat, I should say, is I don’t use my home screen very much. I use the search bar more than the home screen. There’s a lot of apps that I don’t use that are all on the front page. And then there are apps that I do use that are elsewhere, but I don’t know where they are. But I can get them from search. Twitter is not here. I use a meditation app called Insight Timer—that isn’t here. Reddit is one I look at often. It isn’t here. All of those I get from swiping down and typing or from the Suggested Apps feature.

I feel like my home screen is not that useful.

### **When I first looked at your home screen, I thought, wow, 153 unread messages, 222 missed calls. You have 163 Todoist items. I’m seeing this thing, and it’s like chaos.**

The number of unread messages, it’s basically been 153 on my phone for a long time. I just think of 153 as zero. You get a lot of messages from Uber, or Lyft, or DoorDash. It’s like security codes. I look at the notifications, and the phone thinks they’re unread, but I get enough information from the notification. I don’t want to go through and “unread” them.

I never look at those notification count things. They all require some kind of context and mean different things on different apps. On your email app, it’s unread messages. On Todoist, it’s things that are on your to-do list in total. But when I look at Todoist, I want things that are on my list today. I don’t know if there’s a way to change that, but that whole 163, it doesn’t really count to me. I ignore those numbers.

### **So why do you have them enabled at all?**

They’re default on my system, and I haven’t turned them off. It doesn’t bother me. I don’t even know what the one on the phone app is—is that net missed calls?

*[It seems like Farhad checks his phone app here.]*

Oh, it’s voicemails. Yeah, I never look at voicemails. People send me voicemails, and I don’t look at them.

### **I’m very distracted and bothered by my phone, and I disable notifications on most of my apps. Would you describe yourself as distracted by or disturbed by your phone? Maybe you are disturbed if you’re on Reddit a lot.**

I would describe it this way: I think my phone can be a source of great distraction for me. Over the past year or so, I’ve developed mechanisms for ignoring my phone. I use my phone a lot, but a lot of the time, it’s defensible. I use my phone for work during the day. The problems I have are when it’s distracting me when my kids are around or my family’s around. In those moments, I’ve gotten good at not looking at it. I’m more aware of the problem. I think about it more often.

I really like the new iOS feature where you can turn off the notifications in the notifications. When that feature was enabled, it really helped me prune notifications down to the most important ones. Generally, I feel less distracted and bothered by my phone than I was a year ago.

### **Are there apps on this first screen that you deliberately put front and center, always on this main home screen? You have 16 different pages of apps on your iPhone.**

Yeah. I have a huge problem—I get and try a lot of apps, just because I like figuring out new things. I feel like the iPhone has a very bad app organizational thing. I wish there was some easier way to rearrange apps because the manual way you physically drag apps to folders, it’s too much work for me.
> # “I think of it like geology. You have this old record of how you used your phone a long time ago buried in here somewhere.”

I put the Photos app on the front page, I put Spotify on the front page, the *New York Times*, Alexa. Ulysses is this writing app I use a lot, and Bear is a notes app I use a lot, so those are on the front page.

A lot of these apps, I don’t use often. I think of it like geology. You have this old record of how you used your phone a long time ago buried in here somewhere.

### **So the search function is the key to the whole thing. When did you start using that? How did that come about?**

There was a time when iOS didn’t have a search function. At that time, I was more diligent about managing apps on the screen. But ever since they’ve had search, which was probably, like, five years ago, I’ve been using search almost exclusively.

I used to use Twitter several hours a day. It would be like the main battery hog. But it would never be on my home screen. It’s always been something I get from search. Many of my most-used apps are like that. I do that even with apps on my home screen. I search for Spotify all the time.

Siri Suggestions, where you swipe down on the home screen and it shows you which apps to use, is pretty good at showing me what I want without typing. I kind of wish the home screen was just Siri Suggestions.

### **Just a couple of specific things: Have you ever written an article on Ulysses that you filed?**

I write everything in Ulysses.

### **You write your articles on your phone?**

I use Ulysses on my desktop also, but I do often write on my phone. It’s right there. I love it, it’s great. It’s one of the best writing programs I’ve ever used.

### **What’s Paprika?**

It is a recipe managing app. I cook a lot, and it’s a way to find recipes online. It syncs across desktop and phone. It’s not the best-looking app. There may be other apps that do this, but it’s pretty good.

### **Anything else you want to add?**

Having this conversation with you is going to make me want to reorganize my home screen. Ultimately, that will be a waste of time.

### **You’re probably right. I didn’t understand your screen at first, and now I get it completely. It’s intentional.**

There’s two types of people: There are “organizers” and “searchers.” Organizing seems like too much work for me. I prefer to search.

### **I think I’m more of a searcher, and I’m trying to pose as an organizer. I’m going to try to change it up.**

Good luck!<|endoftext|>

# Is Your Phone Giving You a Headache? OLED Screens Might Be to Blame.

## Is Your Phone Giving You a Headache? OLED Screens Might Be to Blame

### An increasingly common kind of display has a slight flickering effect that causes some people grief, but there are basic fixes

![Photo: Sebastian Kaluitzki/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Sebastian Kaluitzki/Getty Images*

If you buy a new phone today, there’s a good chance you’ll wind up with an OLED screen. They’re used in the newest iPhones (excluding the XR; more on that in a minute), the LG G8, and even more modestly priced models from companies like Motorola. They offer plenty of advantages to LCD screens like those seen in older iPhone models — crisper, clearer black levels and thinner displays among them. But [some](&lt;|url|&gt;) users complain of one significant drawback: headaches.

In part because the technology is so new, research and data on the topic are scarce. But it certainly is possible that an OLED screen would make some people miserable because of one practically invisible quirk: at certain brightness levels, an OLED flickers.

OLED is short for “organic light-emitting diode.” While LCD screens use a single underlying panel of LED light as its source of illumination, OLED screens are composed of many pixel-like LEDs. I think of OLED screens as really technologically advanced Lite-Brites: the image is made up of countless little pins of light, each one producing its own color. An LCD screen, meanwhile, would be more like a light box, with the illumination source lying beneath a colored image.

Having many different sources of light on a screen, rather than a single backlight that illuminates the entire thing, means that when the screen is at full brightness, there’s better contrast and — crucially — black sections of the image are, well, blacker.

“Because LCD screens have to filter out light to produce dark areas, they aren’t 100% effective at it,” says Daniel O’Keeffe, a writer at the technology review website [RTings.com](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Which means if you’re watching in a dark room, the blacks won’t be completely black… whereas with OLED screens, they can turn off all the individual pixels or colors.”

Think about how irritated fans were by the last fight against the white walkers in *Game of Thrones*’ “The Long Night.” The screen was dark nearly the entire episode, which made it difficult to see just what was going on. Assuming you weren’t having problems with a poor streaming connection, a good [OLED screen](&lt;|url|&gt;) would better depict a pitch-black episode like “The Long Night,” because the contrast would be more crisp and clear compared to an LCD screen.

This is what makes an OLED smartphone screen so appealing: with heightened contrast and deeper blacks, you get a better, almost realistic image. But it’s also what appears to give some sensitive users headaches. OLED screens don’t have degrees of illumination — each little LED light is either on or off. When a user wants to [lower the brightness](&lt;|url|&gt;) on their OLED phone, the screen, using a method known as [pulse-width modulation](&lt;|url|&gt;), responds by rapidly turning on and off some of those light-emitting colors to create the illusion of a darker image.

LCD phones typically don’t do that. Instead, they use a [filter](&lt;|url|&gt;) that controls how much light is allowed to pass through the panel — again, think of a transparent image placed on a light box. Some light, inevitably, will pass through the darker areas of the screen, making the image slightly hazy and muddled. But it also avoids that cycling flicker that causes some people eye strain and headaches.

According to Arnold Wilkins, a professor of psychology at the University of Essex who has researched the health effects of [flickering fluorescent lights](&lt;|url|&gt;) and written about potential impacts related to [LED](&lt;|url|&gt;) flicker, when LEDs in an OLED screen flicker, there’s a potential link to headaches, even when the flicker is so fast that you don’t notice it.

“We know that flicker from fluorescent lighting that is too fast to be seen doubles the average number of headaches experienced by office workers,” he says. Wilkins published a piece in the academic publication [*The Conversation](&lt;|url|&gt;)* in 2017, writing that the flickering of LED bulbs, which is even more pronounced than fluorescent flickering, is likely to put some people off the technology.

Dr. Raj Maturi, an ophthalmologist and member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, says that the issue can be more pronounced in the young than in the old. Many older people have worse eyesight than the young, he says, so “younger people can discern flickering at a higher frequency than older people.” It’s possible that the people who are getting headaches from their flickering smartphone screens have vision that can better see rapid movement, while the rest of us won’t pick up on those tiny flashing lights and will be spared the eye strain and head pain of their better-sighted peers. Maturi says that we need more research on this topic to more fully understand the role that flickering smartphone screens play in some users’ headaches.
> # The flickering from OLED screens typically occurs when the screen brightness is dimmed. Therefore, keeping your brightness on its highest setting all the time will help eliminate that flicker.

The fixes to this issue are thankfully simple. The most expensive, but straightforward, solution is getting a phone with an LCD screen. The iPhone XR — Apple’s less expensive “X” model and the best phone I’ve ever had — is perhaps the most well-known of all the recent LCD options; other phones with LCD displays include the [ASUS ZenFone 6](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [Sony Xperia 10](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Remember, the flickering from OLED screens typically occurs when the screen brightness is dimmed. Therefore, keeping your brightness on its highest setting all the time will help eliminate that flicker. Maximum brightness can produce its own problems, though; as I wrote in my [column about dark mode](&lt;|url|&gt;), when the brightness of the screen doesn’t match the ambient light of the room the phone is in, the user is at increased risk of eye strain.

To avoid that conundrum, you can apply a darker filter to your screen so that even when the phone is at maximum brightness, the display appears darker. You [can accomplish this](&lt;|url|&gt;) on iOS by opening Settings and navigating to General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display Accommodations &gt; Reduce White Point. Reduce the white point to 95% or below, and ensure that your phone’s brightness level is above 50%. This should help with any flickering, but if it doesn’t, simply decrease the white point and increase the brightness level.

For most Android phones, you’ll [have to download](&lt;|url|&gt;) a third-party filter app that will transpose a dark layer over your screen; make sure your brightness is up as high as it goes and you should be set against any visible flicker.

Some manufacturers, meanwhile, have acknowledged the flicker issue and are investigating ways to improve it. The CEO of OnePlus, Pete Lau, has [reportedly mentioned](&lt;|url|&gt;) on his Weibo account that the company is looking into the use of [DC dimming](&lt;|url|&gt;) — in which the power supply to the phone’s circuit is varied, thereby altering the display’s brightness level — as a way to counter flicker. (OnePlus didn’t respond to a request for comment by press time.) And earlier this year, [Xiaomi released](&lt;|url|&gt;) a beta software update for the Xiaomi Mi 9 that includes DC dimming.

If you’ve gotten a new phone or taken the steps above and are still experiencing headaches, dry eyes, and other symptoms of digital eye strain, it might not be the flicker that’s bothering you. It could be — and I say this with considerable empathy — that you’re looking at screens too intensely and too long.

“The most important issue is the amount of time we spend looking at a tiny screen in front of us,” says Maturi. He recommends following the Academy’s [20/20/20 rule](&lt;|url|&gt;): every 20 minutes, look at a distance at least 20 feet away, for 20 seconds. This, he says, allows the muscles of the eye to relax and thus keep eye fatigue at bay. “It would be wonderful if manufacturers would actually come up with a system that gives users a little warning every 20 minutes to look away,” he says. “We could have a feature that has googly eyes shift that reminds you to look away.”

My own optometrist, inspecting my tragically bloodshot eyes during an exam, mentioned the same thing. It’s a lot of trouble to remember to look away from your screen several times an hour, but it really can help, OLED screen or not.

While screen flicker is a significant problem for a minority of people, there are other well-documented ways that your phone could be giving you a headache. Maybe your boss won’t stop emailing you at 8 p.m., or you need to [turn off your notifications](&lt;|url|&gt;) and news alerts, and these things are giving you a stress headache. Maybe the brightness is too high, or too low. Or maybe it’s that damn flicker.

Oh, and Reddit? [You’re welcome](&lt;|url|&gt;).<|endoftext|>

# How Bethesda Could Fix Game Streaming For Slow Internet Connections

## Google Stadia and other platforms need all the help they can get

![Credit: Bethesda](<|image|>)*Credit: Bethesda*

Streaming platforms like Google Stadia may be [the future of the video game industry](&lt;|url|&gt;), but here in the present, it’s unclear if sluggish home internet speeds are up to the task. Bethesda, the publisher behind games like *Fallout *and *Doom*, hopes to fix that with its new [Orion](&lt;|url|&gt;) service. It promises to do what broadband providers can’t, or won’t: make it easier to serve homes that don’t have great internet connections.

Orion is geared toward augmenting existing or coming game streaming services, like Google Stadia or [Microsoft’s xCloud](&lt;|url|&gt;), rather than competing with them. It’s an additional tech layer added to game engines that reduces their bandwidth and latency demands. Though Orion could no doubt give Bethesda a competitive edge (imagine the Stadia subscriber with the choice between a silky smooth *Doom Eternal *experience and, say, a busted *Destiny 2 *option) it plans to sell the technology to other game engine developers. Ubisoft, for example, could make the newest *Assassin’s Creed* stream even faster — for a licensing fee, of course.

Developers are going to need all the help they can get with game streaming. According [to Stadia’s own website](&lt;|url|&gt;), a 4K stream will require a home internet connection of 35 Mbps. For the lowest available quality, 720p, players will need at least a 10 Mbps connection. Meanwhile, according to the Federal Communications Commission’s [2018 broadband report](&lt;|url|&gt;), nearly 31% of Americans living in rural areas lack access to home internet speeds over 25 Mbps. Even if your broadband is fast enough, you’ll need to share that connection with every device in the house; you’ll compete for bandwidth with your partner if you’re trying to stream games while they watch Netflix, for example.

In other words, Stadia is asking a lot from your internet.

Orion’s goal is to help Stadia, and platforms like it, ask a little less. While Google has tons of experience delivering fast video content with YouTube, Bethesda has more experience with building and optimizing game engines. The company uses its Creation Engine in blockbusters like *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*, for example, which has appeared on many different platforms. When developing *Skyrim* for the Nintendo Switch, Bethesda had to shrink its behemoth of a sandbox game down to run on what is essentially [a powerful tablet](&lt;|url|&gt;). That kind of engineering experience puts Bethesda in a better position than a company like Google, even with all its resources, to optimize games before they ever leave the server. Bethesda is the first major developer to offer third-party tools to streaming platforms and their game engines, but others may follow suit in the future.

Orion isn’t offering a whole new platform so much as a set of what Bethesda calls “techniques” — four of which are currently patented, with others coming in the future — each designed to dramatically reduce costs associated with bandwidth, processing power, and latency. [One such technique](&lt;|url|&gt;), for example, compresses a video frame before demanding aesthetic effects like anti-aliasing or film grain are applied, instead of afterwards as most post-processing is done today. This reduces the overall processing and bandwidth required, making game streaming much faster.

Bethesda still hasn’t revealed all of the techniques it’s planning to implement, as some are still awaiting patent approval, but they’re all designed to work directly in a game engine. [According to Bethesda](&lt;|url|&gt;), just one of Orion’s techniques applied to a streaming gameplay test that normally required 23.43 Mbps dropped the speed required down to only 13.67 Mbps.

That drop in bandwidth might seem small, but it can mean a world of difference to homes across the country. According to [a report from consumer research site BroadbandNow](&lt;|url|&gt;), 16 states have average internet speeds above 20 Mbps, but below 30 Mbps, while a whopping 36 states have average speeds less than 40 Mbps. A 14 Mbps game stream is a lot easier to fit in than 24 Mbps without grinding the whole house’s connection to a halt.
> # Reducing streaming costs serves as a bridge between the lofty goals of platforms like Stadia and the severe limitations of existing broadband infrastructure.

This gives game and platform developers something that the broadband industry doesn’t usually have: financial incentive to reach areas with poorer internet access. Whether a Stadia player is on a gigabit fiber connection playing a 4K HDR stream, or streaming at 720p on a meager 15 Mbps connection, cutting costs early in the pipeline is beneficial to Google. No matter who’s playing, the cheaper the stream, the more customers Stadia can reach. If this happens to benefit areas with slower internet, all the better.

Reducing streaming costs serves as a bridge between the lofty goals of platforms like Stadia and the severe limitations of existing broadband infrastructure. It’s the same approach Netflix took when it found itself expanding to countries with lower bandwidth infrastructure. The company [developed a method of per-title encoding](&lt;|url|&gt;) that could reduce bandwidth requirements for certain shows. This especially helped simpler-looking shows, like animation, look better using less bandwidth. Which, in turn, means better quality for low bandwidth internet users. If you can’t make the internet faster, [make your content more efficient](&lt;|url|&gt;).

It’s still unclear whether Orion’s test results will be indicative of real-life impact — or even whether game developers and streaming platforms will adopt it in the first place. Bethesda still isn’t discussing any of its launch partners and didn’t respond to a request for comment. Regardless, it can only do so much for those with the slowest or least reliable internet.

Nearly 25 million people are still living with home internet speeds below 25 Mbps in rural areas alone, with over 19 million of those living in hard-to-reach rural areas. Bringing high-speed internet to places that don’t have it is incredibly expensive. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced [a $600 million pilot program](&lt;|url|&gt;) to bring broadband (defined as 25 Mbps download speeds) to areas that don’t have it already. It’s a sizable investment, but not nearly as sizable as [the $40 billion the FCC estimates](&lt;|url|&gt;) would be needed to bring broadband to 98% of Americans. And to close that final 2% gap? Another $40 billion.

Any effort to make streaming more efficient — and thus more accessible to rural America or any place with lower internet speeds — is a step in the right direction. But there’s an easier option: keep making physical consoles and games. The gaming industry has increasingly relied on the internet in the form of downloadable games, [library subscriptions](&lt;|url|&gt;), and cloud syncing. In doing so, it’s [left the most vulnerable internet users behind](&lt;|url|&gt;). When even downloading a game like *Doom [*can take days](&lt;|url|&gt;) for some users, streaming it won’t be an option no matter how efficient the programming is.

Tech like Orion might help make game streaming easier for those with decent, if not exceptional, internet. For the 24 million people who still live under the FCC’s already-low definition of “broadband,” however, a physical disc you can buy in a store and play on your console at home will continue to remain the best option.

# The High-Tech Future of the Ancient Science of Archaeology

## Emerging technologies could soon allow archaeologists to virtually excavate an entire site within an hour

![Illustration: [Seth Thompson](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Seth Thompson](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

In many ways, archaeology is still conducted in much the same way it has been for centuries. A single archaeological team might work at a particular dig site for more than 40 years, carefully excavating, studying, preserving, and documenting their findings, and they would barely scratch the surface.

But by 2119, the entire enterprise might look completely different. Emerging technologies could soon allow us to virtually excavate an entire site within an hour, hardly disturbing a square meter of dirt in the process.

Imagine a 500-meter-square mound, with parts of an ancient wall system visible under the earth. Instead of a team of archaeologists carefully removing dirt and debris to document and analyze this ancient site over the course of decades, imagine that a fleet of drones equipped with LIDAR, thermal infrared, and hyperspectral sensing systems fly over the mound to detect subsurface architecture with near-complete accuracy in a matter of minutes. A technician reading the 3D images produced by this scan would see hot spots for the mortuary, administrative, residential, and workshop areas buried beneath the ground in front of her. On-screen color gradations would indicate early and later phases of construction, comparing buildings to an internal database of thousands of examples.

Another fleet of drones would then spread out about a meter apart from each other across the site, drilling holes with powerful lasers and firing pencil-wide probes 7 meters into the ground. The ultrasonic waves from these probes would take readings that would produce models of complete structures, objects, and burials within the site.

Miniature bots would then dig down into hot spots to collect samples of material like bone for DNA testing. They would also scan scrolls and send their images to be read back above ground, the antique material never disturbed.

A computer would then produce an analysis of the site’s likely history based on all of these inputs:

“Site occupation begins in 3225 B.C., settlement with approximately 200 people, expands to small city of 2,000 in 2478 B.C. Expansion due to shifting river course, with increased access to international trade goods and evidence of a very wealthy ruling class.

In 2310 B.C., a regional governor moves to set up an independent army and seizes control.

A drought event 4,300 years ago causes large-scale site abandonment in the region.

A 500-person town reappears circa 1800B.C., with a local ruler, followed by periods of famine, disease, and burning circa 1177 B.C.

With the construction of a major toll road, the site has over 2,000 inhabitants during the Roman Period.

War causes slaughter of the younger to middle-aged men around 146 A.D., disproportionately small evidence for remains of women and girls, all likely captured as slaves.”

All this would take about an hour, after which point 3D printers could recreate the treasures found in the scans — in gold, lapis lazuli, or any other period-appropriate material.

Understanding a site in an hour is obviously closer to fantasy than reality, but archaeologists already use forms of technology that are a few generations removed from the ones needed to perform these futuristic tasks. These technologies might not be as miniaturized, or as mobile, or have the necessary number of sensors attached, but thinking through how much and how rapidly the technologies we utilize today have evolved, I can feel that world of 2119 approaching.

Already, remote-sensing tools are hosted on anything we can get off the ground, from satellites to helicopters and drones. Typical drones used for archaeology measure about 50 centimeters in diameter, but the technology is getting smaller and smaller. Prior to 2015, the heavier the remote-sensing payload, the larger the drone, and sometimes you had to rely on an airplane or helicopter. Now a standard drone can easily lift a LIDAR system and a thermal infrared or hyperspectral camera. All of these technologies have miniaturized drastically in the past decade: a good-quality thermal infrared camera is now the same size as a smartphone. Having fully miniaturized versions on palm-size drones a hundred years from now suddenly seems less fantastical.

Hyperspectral imaging is another exciting new frontier for archaeological remote sensing. A handheld spectrometer (commonly used by geologists but still fairly new for archaeologists) can measure the spectral signature of any material based on its chemical makeup. As buried features on sites degrade, they release tiny pieces of building materials that slowly mix with the strata above. While this may not be visible to the naked eye, we can map these changes — enhanced by rainfall — using infrared data. That allows us to locate outlines of mud-brick buildings or settlement foundations.

Hyperspectral data can also allow archaeologists to identify distinct activity areas on archaeological sites. Ceramic or metal production, for instance, requires burning at high temperatures and leaves clear chemical residues that indicate an industrial zone. The high bone content of cemeteries may change the mineral content of the soil, and produces fragments that can often be observed on top of sites, creating distinct signatures.

Although our sci-fi scene is asking a lot of in situ scanning to parse scrolls, major advances in the scanning of ancient art and writing are already taking shape. Scientists now use lasers to clear soot from tomb walls and reveal stunning paintings. And phase-contrast X-ray imaging can even peer into the burnt scrolls from the Italian site of Herculaneum, the less famous but even more fascinating cousin of Pompeii, destroyed by the same volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. The tight rolls are too fragile to unwrap and read, but this technology is able to pick out words and letters hidden among the charred papyrus sheets. While the work only represents proof of concept so far, experts are confident that they will soon be able to read entire texts.

We seem to be light-years from tiny dig-bots capable of the excavation and 3D scanning described in this hypothetical. But if DARPA, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, can develop tiny robots that zoom through buildings, I can see tiny bots in the future not only doing the actual digging, but also scanning features below the surface in a way that does not disturb the ancient remains.

And since the dig-bots are down there, then, of course, it would make sense for them to take samples for chemical testing and DNA. DNA testing in archaeology has already become so advanced that specific diseases are isolated by sampling ancient people’s dental plaque. Recent discoveries also include the skin color of a person whose only remains are a 10,000-year-old skeleton. As the field of medicine leaps forward, so, too, will the potential for determining ancient people’s appearances and physical histories, as well as creating lineages potentially going back hundreds of thousands of years.
> # If you can input all the data from a site and instantly compare every major building, object, skeleton, and technology with every other similar site, painting its complete picture is within reach.

We are also getting closer to the machine learning needed to synthesize the findings at this hypothetical dig site. At the conclusion of a season, what consumes the bulk of all archaeologists’ time is pinning down other, already-explored sites that corroborate or explain their own findings. It would be nice to have a machine do that for you. Search engines like the Google Ngram Viewer can already hunt through databases of millions of books to find the first instance of words or patterns of usage. Those same software principles could apply to finding any “like” things, from city plans, buildings, and walls to fragments of mystery artifacts. If the machine knew the material, shape, size, and technology, it could easily find parallels among objects in a database. Such faster-than-thought comparisons would also help generate complete 3D reconstructions of the site or object, based on more fully excavated examples elsewhere.

Our story ends with a readout analysis of the site from the computer, which suggests its full history with a high degree of confidence. This might be the part you find the most difficult to accept. Archaeologists need to spend decades honing their archaeological and interpretive skills in order to arrive at middle age, when we can finally make grand, sweeping pronouncements. (I’m just kidding. We start making those in grad school.) A dig director today may write a book about a site after working there for 30 or 40 years, only to see most of her theories disproved by her students 10 years later. Which is all as it should be.

But if you have all the data these hypothetical bots collected, representing hundreds of years of standard archaeological work, with the equivalent scientific lab work, then I do not see why it would be impossible to synthesize immediate results, too. With large datasets from a single site, we need major computation power these days to analyze it all fully, but this won’t be an issue in five years, much less one hundred. If you can input all the data from a site and instantly compare every major building, object, skeleton, and technology with every other similar site, painting its complete picture is within reach.

In the future, instead of an archaeological team of 20, plus a large local workforce and years of work, an army of robots controlled virtually by 20 technicians could fully explore 100 sites or more in a single day. Physical exploration, as wonderful and fun as it is, could be done far more effectively by our robot avatars.

My major concern is that as we move away from the dirt is that the great sense of wonder will vanish. When archaeologists and tourists alike put on their augmented reality glasses to experience a sped-up version of the pyramids’ construction, with virtual ancient Egyptian scribes giving them tours, will the experience be the same? Or will it be a futuristic theme park?

Worse still, the idea that, in the future, archaeology could be perverted into a gigantic corporate moneymaking scheme feels like ashes in my mouth. Today, we already fight for every penny from government sponsors, private donors, and more. Some would say any additional funding would be good funding, and we must accept that not everything will be rosy in the future of exploration. We should think of all the good ways archaeology will advance as a field, and all the bad, to have the discussions needed now to take alternate paths.

# How Middle School Subverted Instagram’s Slider Emoji Tool

## The company’s good intentions aren’t enough to stop abuse

![Credit: smartboy10/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: smartboy10/Getty Images*

*Co-authored with Rory Selinger*

Middle school is hell. That’s why the R-rated movie [*Eighth Grade](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a dramedy whose main character is a social media-savvy teen, was celebrated as an opportunity for parents and kids to talk honestly about all kinds of uncomfortable subjects, including “mean-girl behavior.” (And yes, of course, boys can be just as obnoxious and backstabbing as girls, even if that phrase has become shorthand for [relational aggression](&lt;|url|&gt;) since [2004](&lt;|url|&gt;).)

Currently, middle school kids (and probably others as well) are egging on their classmates to answer a baited question online: *How much do you think I like you?* Spoiler alert: This existential land mine, filled with questionable consent mechanisms, hasn’t become a trend because it’s a confidence-boosting exercise.

We’re going to shed some light on what this mind-reading quiz means in our first dad-daughter collaboration. I’m a fortysomething philosophy professor who teaches and writes about ethics and technology, and my daughter Rory is in seventh grade. Dadsplaining may be involved.

## **Subversive slider**

The folks at Instagram can take comfort in the cliche that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, because they clearly imagined a different future when they rolled out the new slider emoji in May 2018. The [press release](&lt;|url|&gt;) emphasized posing “fun” and “nuanced” questions to your followers, like “how 🔥an artist’s new single is” or “how 🌶️ they like their food.”

Lots of good design boxes get checked off with this feature. It’s intuitive, simple, and visually rich. The sliding continuum allows for a range of answers and diverse emojis add context and emotional tone, and its versatility makes it a good tool for tapping the wisdom of the crowds. So far, so good.

But flash forward to today, and it turns out that the versatility is both a good and a bad thing. Some of the bad uses are predictable and have taken a page from something teens are very familiar with: the subvert Snapchat playbook. Remember when Snapchat was first released in the App Store back in 2011? The hype surrounding ephemeral messaging almost seemed to promise to revive online privacy, because users thought their communications would disappear forever; this wasn’t total well-wishing or naivete, since Snapchat actively encouraged the false belief. Eventually, the [Federal Trade Commission](&lt;|url|&gt;) determined that the company “deceived consumers with promises about the disappearing nature of messages sent through the service.” One of the big problems for surprised Snapchat users were third-party apps that made it easy to take undetected screenshots — screenshots that allow information to linger and circulate far beyond its expiration date.

A version of this is happening with the emoji slider poll. Kids at Rory’s school are using it to ask: “How much do you think I like you?” Then, they’re posting the results of each individual kid’s answer. How? Not by using an official poll tool, but by sharing a screenshot.

There’s an extra-special subversive twist here, one that’s optimized to spread misery. They’re not just posting clean screenshots, but are adding new information. They’re marking down how much they actually like the person who took the risk of being publicly judged — putting on clear display, for everyone to see, the difference between how much a person thought she was valued and the real deal.

It’s ironic that this tool was created by Instagram. Instagram is owned by Facebook, a company that famously invented the “like” button while resisting a “[dislike](&lt;|url|&gt;)” button because of the associated risks, including disengagement and [cyberbullying](&lt;|url|&gt;).

*Oh, you thought I liked you this much? Sorry, not sorry. But I like you way less. Thanks for playing, though.*

Rory’s going to explain how she’s seen these polls used in her middle school.

### **Evan: Why are kids creating these polls?**

**Rory:** It could be one of two things. The first could be people are trying to give others the opportunity to tell them how they think you feel about them. It’s giving the account owner a chance to fix a “beef,” become better friends, or just show you really care. The second more plausible reason could be that people are trying to show others they have power over them, the power to define what the relationship is and whether or not a real friendship exists.

### **Why are kids responding to these polls?**

You take a risk when you participate — you make yourself vulnerable. But kids are willing to put themselves out there because they want to be told they’re liked, and they want everyone to know they’re fitting in.

### **So, this is about friendship and not dating?**

Yes.

### **How honest should kids be when saying how much or little they really like someone?**

It depends which end of the spectrum you’re talking about. If you like someone less than they responded, just leave their response as it is. Or, write a sidenote on the post that says, “I don’t really know you and would like to get to know you better.” If they answer lower than you like them, you should raise the scale to the appropriate amount. If the amount is marginal in either way, leave the line where it is.

### **Are kids following these recommendations?**

Not really, they’re being blunt and brutally honest. Some kids who respond to the polls will slide the line up a decent amount. In response, I’ve seen users bring the line completely down. This hasn’t happened to me personally but it’s common and I could see why it would be humiliating.

### **Is this bullying?**

No, it’s not bullying. Yes, people are being mean. But if you participate in a poll, you’re giving consent for someone else to give their opinion of you — whatever that opinion is. As soon as you slide up, you’re giving others permission to tear you apart.

### **Is consent a problem, because it shields people from the consequences of being hurtful?**

Yes, if the person being “attacked” brings this up with a teacher, principal, or another authority figure, the person who was cruel can give the excuse that the person who is upset didn’t have to respond to the poll.

Recent [research](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the Pew Research Center found that 81 percent of teens ages 13 to 17 say that “social media makes them feel more connected to what’s going on in their friends’ lives.” But at the same time, 45 percent replied that “they feel overwhelmed by all the drama on social media,” with 13 percent saying they feel this way “a lot.”

We both think that Instagram meant well, but good intentions aren’t enough to stop abuse. It just isn’t surprising that mean-spirited emoji-slider polls are being created. We all know that the dynamics of digital devices complicate how we interact, and that social media can bring out the worst of our social tendencies.

The history of technology has taught us that designers [can’t determine](&lt;|url|&gt;) how people will interact with their products. Humans are too creative to be constrained by anticipated uses. Middle schoolers, with access to the same technology as adults, are no exception to the rule: Designers’ expectations will be broken.<|endoftext|>

# My Garmin Edge 520 Knows Everything About Me, and I Love It

## How a bike computer that does nothing more than spit out numbers helped me figure out who I am

![](<|image|>)

*This is “I Can’t Live Without,” a column about the apps, gadgets, and services that make all the difference.*

If there is one thing you should know about me, it’s that I ride bicycles a lot. This year, I have spent 253 hours and 36 minutes on the bike, covering a distance of 3,753 miles, and ascending 223,953 feet.

I know this because every time I go for a ride, my Garmin Edge 520 is there, recording my every movement, heartbeat, and pedal stroke down to the second. As I putz along it sits there, fixed to my handlebars with a $30 machined aluminum mount, shouting numbers into my face.

It is the only piece of consumer technology that I trust.

These days, it’s assumed that the websites and gadgets we use are tracking us. It’s hard to say exactly how or to what extent — which is part of the problem. But we can point to the [near-daily revelations](&lt;|url|&gt;) of how Facebook [misuses its trove of personal data](&lt;|url|&gt;) in new and unexpected ways, or how app developers can’t help but leverage the iPhone’s ubiquity to [track you while you sleep](&lt;|url|&gt;), or how Amazon is actually [listening to your conversations through Alexa](&lt;|url|&gt;), and know that to exist on the internet is to unknowingly agree to dozens of Faustian bargains, just so you can do things like look at the new pictures of your niece.

This is why I love my Garmin Edge 520. Where every other company is trying to mask just how much they know about you, Garmin makes detailed personal data collection a selling point. I own a Garmin Edge 520 because I want to know that on May 1, I rode up Rose Glen road in Narberth, Pennsylvania, in three minutes and 32 seconds, my heart beating an average of 177 beats per minute and my legs outputting 461 watts through the pedals. The relationship between me and my Garmin is clear: It’s watching me and I am watching it. I hit start, and the Garmin starts recording. I hit stop, and it stores the data in a file on the device, where it stays until I decide to upload it elsewhere.

Which is to say that I bought a Garmin Edge 520 because I want to know myself better.

At first, this was limited to who I am on the bike. Time, speed, heart rate, and power data can be combined in all sorts of complicated ways to answer a simple question: Am I getting faster? If you let them, the power meter and the Strava Segment can turn riding a bicycle into an RPG-like Numbers Hell, where the only thing that matters is [Making The Numbers Go Up](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # The relationship between me and my Garmin is clear: It’s watching me and I am watching it.

There is, of course, a [cycling subculture](&lt;|url|&gt;) that seeks to escape Numbers Hell, arguing, correctly, that getting on your bike and staring at a screen can detract from the inherent joys of the sport.

But after I lost my job at the end of March, I really needed those numbers. While I believe that the adults had my best interests in mind when they told me — and most of those in my generation — that I should pursue a career in something that I am passionate about, I don’t think they accounted for the potential issues of tying up your choice of mandatory wage labor with your self-worth.

This is to say that when I was laid off from a job that I very much enjoyed — and more importantly looked to for validation — I did not just lose a regular paycheck and health insurance. I’m not the first this has ever happened to, nor will I be the last. But dang, it sure does suck to have to figure out what you’re going to do to make rent now, and also figure out who you are if not your job.

Instead of sitting in my apartment alone, worrying about how I was going to get my unemployed ass back into the workforce, I went on four-hour training rides where I would pedal hard and… worry about how I was going to get my unemployed ass back into the workforce. My Garmin sat there, recording every heartbeat, every revolution of the cranks, ignoring literally everything else about me. I would roll up to the weekly fast group ride every Wednesday morning unsure about a lot of things, but certain that afterward my Garmin would inform me that I set some new power records.

Where just about everything else in my life was aimless and incoherent, my Garmin gave me numbers, progress, structure. Something, anything to prove that I wasn’t just wasting the days flailing to find my footing, but that I was flailing while getting stronger. It was enough to get me back on the bike day after day, and afford me, by the nature of structured cycling training plans, a lot of uninterrupted time with me and my thoughts. And so over the course of many miles, I began to piece together the post-layoff me. It’s where I came up with this essay. And where I am still trying to work out what it means to be a person and not a job. Numbers Hell is saving me from my own existential hell.

# How ‘Digital Nomads’ Game the System to Work in Paradise

## Visa scams and tax evasion are common as locals struggle with a low minimum wage

![Credit: Made Widhana/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Made Widhana/Getty Images*

You can’t throw a USB stick in Canggu without hitting a “[digital nomad](&lt;|url|&gt;)” — or whatever your preferred term is for someone working remotely from an exotic location. Westerners on their laptops are everywhere, taking up table space in coffee shops or set up in one of the six separate co-working spaces inside a two-mile radius. They might be a small segment of [the more than 5 million people who visit Bali each year](&lt;|url|&gt;), but they’re overrepresented in Canggu. There are programmers, entrepreneurs, marketers, scam artists, and, of course, writers like me. If a job can be done on the internet, someone is doing it here.

Canggu, a small beachside village on the Indonesian island of Bali, currently [holds the top spot on Nomad List](&lt;|url|&gt;), a website that ranks places around the world based on how easy it is for people to work remotely from them. It’s not hard to see why. The cost of living is low while the quality of life — and, crucially, the internet speeds — are high. For about $1,500 a month, you can live in a private en suite room in a villa with a swimming pool, hire a scooter to get around, surf every day, and eat out for every meal.

But this workers’ paradise in Indonesia leaves out one crucial population: Indonesians.

As of 2017, Indonesia has the sixth worst income inequality in the world. [A 2017 report from Oxfam](&lt;|url|&gt;) says that the top 1% of the country’s population control 49% of the wealth. Meanwhile, 8% of the population lives in “extreme” poverty (less than $1.90/day); 36% in “moderate” poverty (less than $3.10/day). The country’s economy is booming overall — but not equally.

Gonan Nasution, general manager of the [Taman Nauli Boutique Rooms hotel](&lt;|url|&gt;), grew up in Canggu. He’s seen the area change from sprawling rice fields to a thriving tourist destination. “First the surfers came and then the yogis came,” explains Nasution. “And after the yogis, the fitness people came.” Now it’s the digital nomads, drawn to Canggu’s still-somewhat-authentic and affordable vibe.

Since 2012 or so, new hotels, cafés, restaurants, bars, shops, and beach clubs have opened up every month. Former farmers now lease their land to businesses, the vast majority of them owned either by wealthy Indonesians (many from Jakarta, the country’s capital, some 600 miles away) or foreign investors. Rice paddy plots are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Construction is constant. People at the top are clearly doing well, though the workers under them — the ones facilitating the businesses that digital nomads frequent — may not be.
> # “The first four months I was like, what the fuck am I doing here?”

Indonesia doesn’t have a single minimum wage. Each district’s is set independently based on its relative GDP. In Bali as a whole, [it’s 2,297,967 Indonesian rupiah (IDR) per month](&lt;|url|&gt;), although it’s closer to 2.5 million IDR in Canggu. That’s less than $180 per month at today’s exchange rate. According to Nasution, the workers in the coffee shops and co-working spaces getting the minimum wage are “living on the edge.” It’s enough for them to rent a room, buy food — and not much more. They’re living month to month, paycheck to paycheck. “Most of them work their whole lives,” he says.

Bali’s hospitality industry draws workers from all around Indonesia, including Haren Tambi, the community manager at [Dojo](&lt;|url|&gt;), which is the largest co-working space and cornerstone of the digital nomad scene in Canggu. While the membership numbers fluctuate as people come and go, Dojo normally has between 200 and 400 people paying monthly. The cheapest plan costs 800,000 IDR ($55) for 30 hours per month of access to the space, while the monthly unlimited plan costs 2.9 million IDR ($205). Tambi came to Bali about two and a half years ago from Sumatra after finishing his bachelor’s degree in accounting education. Within a few days, he was working the front desk in Dojo for a little bit above the minimum wage.

“The first four months I was like, what the fuck am I doing here?” he says. “I’ve just finished my bachelors and now I’m mopping the floor and cleaning out the fucking toilets. This is what I get after college?”


Despite the tough start, he’s only got good things to say about Michael Craig, Dojo’s Australian owner, and how he treats Dojo’s 43 Indonesian employees: “He’s a really good boss.” Dojo pays above the minimum wage, offers employees a big discount in the café, and helps them learn new skills, like coding. Within six months, Tambi was promoted to events coordinator. Six months after that, he got promoted to his current role as community manager. Things are a lot more comfortable for him now, although he still can’t afford to live the same lifestyle as some of his Western friends.

“I can’t go to restaurants every day,” he explains. “I’d be bankrupt in 10 or 15 days.”

A writer who works out of Dojo, who asked to be kept anonymous to avoid visa trouble, says he’s been living in Bali for almost three and a half years. He came for six months and just kept extending his stay. Despite being here for so long, he’s still on a two-month tourist visa — although he sometimes mixes it up and gets a six-month social or business visa. All he has to do is leave the country once one visa is up and re-enter a day later, very few questions asked. As a “tourist” in Bali he doesn’t pay income taxes — he’s officially a resident in Canada and declares there.

Other digital nomads I spoke with are in similar situations: They work from Bali on tourist visas, do visa runs to nearby countries as needed, and declare taxes in their home country. Not one had a KITAS, the official Indonesian work permit for foreigners.
> # “It’s just not fair for the locals. It’s so hard for us to get a visa to travel, and it’s so easy for them to come here.”

While digital nomads aren’t paying taxes to the government, both Nasution and Tambi stressed that they are contributing to the local economy. They’re the customers in all the new businesses. While a local might spend 20,000 IDR ($1.40) on a meal, digital nomads can easily spend between 100,000 and 200,000 IDR ($7 to $14). A lot of that money, of course, goes to the business owners, but some does go to the servers, cooks, and cleaners. They might not earn much in Canggu on the minimum wage, but it’s more than they would earn unemployed in their home villages.

Without the digital nomads — along with the [more than 5 million tourists](&lt;|url|&gt;) who come to Bali each year — many Indonesians would be significantly worse off. Bali’s new businesses present an opportunity, both to nomads looking for a cheap, comfortable country to work in and locals looking for a way out of poverty.

But the ease with which foreigners can work in Bali understandably annoys some locals. “These digital nomads are on tourist visas and they just have to leave the country every month or two,” explains Nasution. “It’s just not fair for the locals. It’s so hard for us to get a visa to travel, and it’s so easy for them to come here.”

Tambi echoes his sentiments: “It’s hard for Indonesians to go to the U.S. It’s really, really hard. Some of my friends have family there and they still get rejected. They try again and they get rejected again.”

Everyone agrees that something should probably be done.

“It’s not fair to us who are working. We’re paying taxes,” Nasution says. He feels that there should be some kind of more expensive visa with background checks for digital nomads. “They need to enforce some tax or some rules for digital nomads.”

No digital nomad I spoke to was against contributing more financially to Bali, and some believe it will inevitably happen. The writer gaming the visa system puts it this way: “We’re breaking brand-new ground. This movement is still only young. People are going to be working on their computers all over the world for many years to come.”

Part of the problem is that the Indonesian government has bigger issues to solve. It’s the fourth most populous country in the world in the midst of major economic and social development. For now, digital nomads are living in a gray area — slipping through the cracks of a broken system not designed to handle people who can work from anywhere.<|endoftext|>

# What It’s Like Working as an Amazon Flex Delivery Driver

## What It’s Like Working as an Amazon Flex Delivery Driver

### Drivers can make $20 an hour delivering packages for Amazon Flex, but shifts are drying up

![Illustration: [Glenn Harvey](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Glenn Harvey](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

*Valued at nearly $1 trillion, Amazon is one of the most powerful companies in the world. The Seattle-based retail giant employs over 600,000 people and operates 100 sortation and fulfillment centers in North America, sometimes sending out as many as 1 million items per day to customers. But Amazon does more than just retail. Amazon publishes its own books and comics, finances TV shows and movies, operates a Texas wind farm, builds robots, streams music, delivers prescription medications, and operates web services for everyone from *Medium* to the CIA. And that’s not even counting its high-profile acquisitions, which include Twitch, IMDB, Zappos, and Whole Foods, among countless others.*

*Nearly all of us use Amazon, one way or another. But what is it like working inside the beast? Over the next few weeks, we’ll be talking to workers at every level of the Amazon empire to find out.*

*Welcome to The Amazon Diaries.*

Kris Marv is a busy guy: A father of three, including a newborn baby, he recently went back to school to prepare for a career in criminal justice. He lives in Hampton Roads, Virginia, with his wife, who is in the military and currently on maternity leave. For the last three months, Marv has been working as an Amazon Flex and DoorDash delivery driver Monday through Friday.

Although Amazon is largely dependent on UPS, FedEx, and the U.S. Postal Service to make “last mile” deliveries, it supplements that workforce with Flex Drivers — independent contractors with their own cars who deliver goods to customers for an hourly wage. Every morning, Marv, and drivers like him, wake up early to look for open jobs on their phones. In the best case scenario, Marv will catch a “block” on Amazon Flex, meaning he’ll have a block of time to deliver a certain number of packages. He’ll pick up those packages from a nearby warehouse and deliver them for $20 per hour — and sometimes more, depending on weather conditions or driver shortages. Of all the delivery jobs out there, Marv says, Flex pays the best hourly wage. Then, comes Prime Now or Whole Foods deliveries, ($18 per hour plus tips), and then DoorDash ($17 per hour). As a last resort, he sometimes also drives for Walmart ($9.30 per hour plus tips).

Marv worked as a mechanic previously, where he usually put in 55 hours a week — a schedule that didn’t fit with a new baby and school. He makes less as a driver, but he says that the flexibility of the job is a huge perk: “There are times I can make just as much as when I was a mechanic if I’m willing to put in the work, but mostly I don’t because I don’t have the time.”

I spoke to Marv shortly after the holidays, as he was out making a DoorDash delivery. Marv likes his job, but says that catching blocks has gotten harder. Amazon Flex blocks have become increasingly rare in recent months, a combination of the seasonal shift in consumer habits and Amazon’s [increased experimentation with third-party, delivery service providers](&lt;|url|&gt;) who’ve crowded out Flex drivers.

In January, Marv made a music video from inside his car that he posted on his Facebook feed, called “[Flexin’ Life](&lt;|url|&gt;).” “It’s getting even harder to catch a block, thanks to the DSPs,” he sings. “But I ain’t mad that they did it cuz it all makes sense for them logistically.”

*The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.*

### **Medium: What does a normal day driving look like?**

**Kris Marv**: Typically, I wake up at 5 a.m. I reserve my DoorDash hours and then I start “tapping” for Amazon. You tap and swipe on your phone until they drop the blocks and you gotta try to scoop one up before anyone else gets it. It’s super competitive and lately, it’s been super difficult to get blocks.

If I’m doing DoorDash, usually I’ll reserve my hours for 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., because I’ve got to drop my kids off at school in the morning and then I’ve gotta pick them up in the afternoon. So, I try to get my work in while they’re at school. And that’s pretty much similar with Amazon. The blocks typically start anywhere from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. and go over anywhere from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. So, it ends up working out nice for me.

### **It sounds like this may vary from week to week, but do you have a sense of your hourly breakdown doing Flex, DoorDash, and other stuff?**

For Flex, it’s $20 an hour, if you’re working the warehouse, or it’s $18 an hour plus tips, if you’re doing things like Prime Now or Whole Foods. It’s been so few and far between for Amazon right now. I’m only probably doing one block a week with them. I’m also signed up for Postmates and Walmart delivery, as well as Shipt. (Ed: Shipt is another delivery service.) I tried Postmates and Walmart once, just to see what it was about, and I’ve been kind of sticking to DoorDash and Amazon lately.

### **What is it about Flex and DoorDash that that makes it better than Walmart?**

Just the rate. There’s more money in Flex and in DoorDash than there is in anything else. With Postmates, you don’t get to see what you’re making for each delivery until after you do it, which is not the greatest. I want to know what I’m making off a delivery before I go and make it. Walmart delivery pays like $9.30 per delivery plus tips, but they’ll only let you make one delivery in an hour. If the customer tips you, which is not often, you’re only making $9 to $15 an hour, where with Flex and DoorDash you’re making $17 to $20 an hour.

### **You said that the blocks for Flex have been drying up. When did that start happening?**

Right after the holidays. It’s directly linked to the holiday season. But it’s not only that — they brought in direct service partners, DSPs, which are basically van companies that work directly for Amazon. They’re kind of taking the bulk of the deliveries. We’re secondary to them. We come in and deliver what they can’t, or do the same-day routes when the DSPs are still out on the road delivering the packages from that morning. We’ll come in later in the evening and deliver the packages that were purchased for same-day, as well as Prime Now and Whole Foods. DSPs don’t dip into that.

### **One of the frustrations that I’ve heard drivers express is that Amazon makes changes, like with the DSPs, and then doesn’t communicate about them.**

Honestly, that is the only gripe that I have with this. As far as getting blocks and making changes and stuff, I completely understand it — they’re running a business, and logistically switching over to DSPs just makes sense because it’s putting money back in their own pocket. At the end of the day, that’s business. The only gripe that I have with any of it is that they don’t communicate. You gotta do your own detective work within the community to really figure out what’s going on.

They had announced that they were going to be doing things with direct service partners… but they never really announced their intentions as far as what percentage of the packages those DSPs were going to be doing. When they release blocks in the morning, nobody really knows how many there will be, how many routes there will be. Fifty routes versus 200 routes makes a big difference in people’s minds as to whether it’s worth it to sit there and tap on their phones at 5 a.m., every morning, to try to get one. Because if you’ve got thousands of drivers in the area — again, a number nobody knows — and there’s only 50 routes going out for that morning, most people are gonna say, “Well, forget this. I’m just gonna sleep in and try for something else later or do DoorDash.”

I feel like they kind of oversaturated the market. Right before Christmas, they brought on a whole bunch of new people and that creates a problem… Now, there’s no work to be had.

### **Does that frustration change the way you think about Amazon? What goes through your head when you hear about Bezos’ success?**

Good for him! I mean, he created something well ahead of its time and he got so far ahead of the curve that it just blew up into this monstrosity — and I mean that in a good way — that it is today. The reason he makes so much money is he, and the company as a whole, are very good at accomplishing tasks without putting themselves at risk. Five years from now, would I be at all surprised if Amazon had their own delivery service, hired their own delivery employees, and had their own vans and everything else? It wouldn’t surprise me in the least. That’s kind of the direction everything is heading.

### **Do you buy stuff on Amazon yourself?**

Oh, yes. Quite often.

### **Have you ever had to deliver to yourself?**

No, I have not had my own package before. But I have met people who have delivered to me because we have the Facebook groups and stuff. One of the groups I’m a part of is for Amazon Flex drivers only. It’s a local group just for the Hampton Roads area, which is what they call the area I live in, in Virginia. People will post a screenshot of their route and I’ve actually seen it before where one of the blips on their map was my house and I’m like, “Oh hey! You’re delivering my package.”

### **What’s the community of Flex drivers like in your area?**

The community here is awesome. It’s funny, we’re all in competition with each other because when you’re trying to grab blocks you’re basically fighting for the blocks with other Flex drivers. But at the same time, we don’t treat it like a competition. We’re all still rooting for one another, we’re all hoping everybody gets a block, we’re all super friendly and we laugh and joke. It’s like a big group of friends that have known each other for years, even though a lot of us have only known each other for a few months. It’s a really good community, for sure.

### **How long do you plan to be driving Flex?**

At least for the duration of being in school. It’s a two and a half year program, but I’ll be doing a summer semester also, so I’m looking at least two years from the time I started in October. Could be longer. I’m planning on moving after I get out of school, so it kind of depends on whether where I move to has Flex available as an option.

### **If you were still driving Flex in 10 years, how would you feel about that?**

If I could, that would be great. It’s just excess income. There’s no reason — if I have the time available — that I can’t run out, make a little extra money, that kind of thing. The direction that Flex is headed, and where it’s gonna be in 10 years, is completely different than it is now, but I definitely wouldn’t be opposed to doing it.

### **There’s a lot of talk about the rise of the gig economy and people having to do lots of different part-time and contract work to make ends meet. Do you think that’s concerning?**

Not for me personally. I mean, the only reason it would concern me at all is just because the more people that get involved in the gig economy, the less work there is to be had within it. If we double the amount of drivers, our workload is cut in half. That would be the only concern I had. As far as needing that second income to make ends meet — I don’t do this because I have to, I do this because I want to. There are some people that do this because they have to, because they can’t make ends meet. I’m not one of those people and can’t really speak for those people.

### **A few months ago you posted a [music video](&lt;|url|&gt;) to your Facebook page, swapping out the lyrics of Chris Janson’s “Redneck Life” to make it about Flex driving. What’s been the response from other Flex drivers?**

Everybody loves it. Everybody think it’s hilarious and that it’s spot on. It went fairly viral in the Flex community. If I had to take a guess, I’d say it’s probably been viewed about 5,000 times, which is a pretty big chunk of the Flexers that are on social media. Everyone was just laughing and having a good time and, like I said, that’s what this community is, that’s what it’s really all about. As far as Flex goes, everyone’s just super friendly. I put it out just make people smile when they can’t catch a block or anything else. At least we can find some humor in it.<|endoftext|>

# What the Hell Happened to Daenerys?

## What the Hell Happened to Daenerys?

### *‘Game of Thrones’* has turned the most compassionate queen in Westeros into another tyrant

![Credit: HBO](<|image|>)*Credit: HBO*

For years, Daenerys Stormborn, first of her name, mother of dragons, breaker of chains, and rightful queen of the seven kingdoms, has been the ruler we’ve been hoping would win the Iron Throne. Her goal has been to “break the wheel,” the cycle of oppression where the rich and powerful continually vie for rule, always at the expense of the common people. But now Daenerys is as ready to kill those common people in order to gain her throne as Cersei Lannister has been. It’s a shocking, heartbreaking change in one of* Game of Thrones*’ most beloved characters… and it’s also kind of perfect, too.

Daenerys’ transformation into someone cold and ruthless enough to kill innocent civilians in pursuit of Cersei at King’s Landing — as seen in last week’s episode, [“The Last of the Starks”](&lt;|url|&gt;) — has not only shocked the audience, but the characters on the show, too. Tyrion and Varys initially joined the Targaryen queen because of her compassion when she was the queen of [Meereen](&lt;|url|&gt;), notably seen in her desire to free all the slaves in Essos. And while Daenerys occasionally got a little hot under the collar — as, say, when the slave traders she had put out of business launched an all-out attack on Meereen back in season six, and her instinct was literally to kill all of them and destroy their cities — she was also willing to listen to Tyrion, who reminded her that “kill ’em all” was also the policy of her father, [the “Mad King” Aerys](&lt;|url|&gt;), which cost him (and, by proxy, Daenerys) the throne.
> # It clearly no longer matters to Daenerys who or how many people die, as long as Cersei is one of them.

For the past season and a half, Tyrion and Varys have spent a lot of time trying to convince Daenerys to show mercy — with less and less success. After last week’s episode, it seems no words can stop her. The multiple battles she’s already lost, the death of her dragon [Rhaegal](&lt;|url|&gt;), and the murder of her friend [Missandei](&lt;|url|&gt;) will assuredly result in King’s Landing going up in flames. It clearly no longer matters to her who or how many people die, as long as Cersei is one of them.

That seems like an enormous transformation from the kind young woman of seasons three and four, but it might not be as big as you think. Daenerys has never been shy about administering justice through violence. Back in the first two seasons, she was all too happy to burn [the witch who killed her barbarian husband](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [the wizards who kidnapped her dragons](&lt;|url|&gt;) alive, and she also locked the merchant [Xaro Xhoan Daxos](&lt;|url|&gt;) and her own handmaiden [Doreah](&lt;|url|&gt;) in a vault after they betrayed her, guaranteeing a slow and agonizing death. She obviously never had sympathy for slavers, although she often promised to spare those who gave up their trade willingly. But when the “Great Masters” of Meereen crucified 163 slaves along the road to their city, just to show her their cruelty, she ended up crucifying 163 masters and lining them up on the same road. That was back in season four, and her Queensguard knight [Barristan Selmy](&lt;|url|&gt;) had suggested responding to injustice with mercy; her decision was to “answer injustice with injustice.”

Daenerys’ justice is very much in the eye-for-an-eye vein, but normally she exercised it on behalf of the oppressed and those she loved. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Cersei has also sought vengeance for those she loved, devising exquisite torture for [Ellaria Sand](&lt;|url|&gt;) of Dorne for murdering her daughter and trying to execute Tyrion when she mistakenly thought he had poisoned her awful son, Joffrey. But Cersei’s revenge has always been about herself, striking back against those who wronged her or threatened her rule. The most ostentatious example is, of course, her destruction of the Sept of Baelor. Only the Seven Gods know how many innocent people died as a result.
> # The two queens may currently have more in common than not.

By killing the dragon Rhaegal, Cersei has effectively murdered Daenerys’ child — but she’s also the main obstacle between the “Breaker of Chains” and the throne Dany believes is hers by right. Now, both Daenerys and Cersei are equally unconcerned about collateral damage to what *Game of Thrones* calls “the smallfolk.” Honestly, the two queens may currently have more in common than not.

This is a bummer, but it’s also fantastic character development. In a traditional fantasy story, Dany would be the daughter of a deposed king who starts with nothing and conquers evil by winning the hearts and minds of her subjects. But *Game of Thrones* shuns traditional fantasy narratives, which is one of the reasons the show (and the book series) is so popular.

We were agog when the show killed Robb Stark and his mother during the infamous[ “Red Wedding”](&lt;|url|&gt;), because sons avenging the unjust murder of their fathers is another major fantasy trope. So watching a good–hearted queen slowly get corrupted by the increasing power she amasses is completely on brand for *Game of Thrones*. Turning what would normally be the final battle between the forces of good and evil into a battle between two rulers who are so determined to kill each other that they don’t care what happens to the people they’re ruling is sort of perfect. Whether Daenerys wins or Cersei does, the smallfolk will lose, just as they always have.

Of course, *Game of Thrones* may still have surprises coming (how the hell is Jon Snow going to fit into the ending, anyway?) but with only two episodes left, it very much appears that Daenerys is no longer the savior people — the characters and the audience — thought she would be.

She came to Westeros to “break the wheel.” Now, here at the end, Daenerys has merely become another spoke.<|endoftext|>

# Regulators Just Put a Target on Apple’s Back

## Forget WWDC: The company now faces major scrutiny along with other tech giants

![Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images*

While the tech world’s eyes were fastened on Apple’s annual developer conference Monday, the news with the potential to shake the industry had nothing to do with the Mac Pro, iMessage Memoji, or iOS 13’s Dark Mode. It was the seismic rumbling of antitrust activity emanating from Washington, D.C.

The tremors began Friday night with a report that the Department of Justice was preparing an antitrust probe of Google. They continued Sunday with word that the Federal Trade Commission might take a closer look at Amazon’s competitive practices. The aftershocks rolled on through Monday, with reports that the DOJ and FTC might also have Apple and Facebook, respectively, in their crosshairs. And then came word that the House Judiciary Committee is planning [a sweeping antitrust probe of its own](&lt;|url|&gt;).

What it all means isn’t clear just yet. Both the DOJ and FTC have declined comment, leaving others to piece together the patchwork of anonymously sourced reports. It seems that neither has actually launched an investigation yet into any of the companies, which helps to explain why no one has reported on what their nature or focus might be. The probe by House Democrats is the only one that has been formally announced.
> # In a sign of how seriously the markets take this news, all four of the tech companies in question saw their stocks dip Monday, shedding billions of dollars in value.

What we do know is that the two federal agencies in charge of antitrust enforcement responsibilities appear to have gotten together and divvied up jurisdiction over four giant U.S. tech platforms. It’s hard to imagine why they’d do that unless they were planning to take some action.

The scrutiny alone, regardless of its ultimate outcome, could shape how some of the world’s most powerful companies behave moving forward. And if the investigations lead to serious consequences — breaking up Facebook, for example — they could reshape the internet in ways more profound than the death of iTunes or the forking of iPadOS.

In a sign of how seriously the markets take this news, all four of the tech companies in question saw their stocks dip Monday, shedding billions of dollars in value.

Each of the four has reason to fear a wide-ranging antitrust probe. Apple spent much of its keynote on Monday touting its own apps, which compete for customers’ attention — and, increasingly, their money — with the apps made by thousands of smaller companies whose products populate its App Store. Google is in a similar position with its Android operating system and Google Play Store, and its dominant search engine gets to decide how to rank Google’s own services vis-a-vis those of every other website. Amazon has been using its status as an online shopping gatekeeper to sell its own products alongside those of other retailers. And Facebook has hungrily snapped up rival social networks such as Instagram and Whatsapp while quashing those who won’t sell, such as Snapchat, by copying their main features.

Each also can fall back on the defense that they haven’t generally used their market power to raise prices for consumers, which has been an important standard in recent antitrust decisions. You might “pay” for Facebook and Google with your personal information, but that’s not a currency that antitrust regulators have traditionally recognized.

Calls from the left to break up these giants have been mounting for years, with [Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes](&lt;|url|&gt;) launching some of the highest-profile broadsides. They’re building on the work of legal scholars such as Lina Khan, who [argued for breaking up Amazon](&lt;|url|&gt;) and now works as counsel on the House Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee. They argue that consumer pricing is too narrow a lens through which to evaluate these new giants’ effects on competition.

But the DOJ and FTC aren’t run by the left. Their current leaders hail from a Republican establishment that remains broadly suspicious of hands-on regulation, even as the president has occasionally shown a self-interested appetite for punitive actions against companies that cross him. Even under Obama, their antitrust divisions mostly hewed to a bipartisan consensus that online economies are so dynamic that the companies on top today could find themselves dethroned tomorrow.

That’s why it’s a big deal that these agencies appear to be ready at last to rethink how antitrust law might apply to tech behemoths in the 21st century. Perhaps they’ll conclude in the end that these companies still aren’t monopolies, and they’ll let them off with some stern words or a slap on the wrist. But in the meantime, it’s going to behoove all of tech’s biggest players to watch their step. They’ll likely think twice about big acquisitions and hold off on [going “thermonuclear”](&lt;|url|&gt;) on rivals. At the same time, they might look to defensively consolidate the power they’ve already acquired, like Facebook weaving together Messenger with Instagram and Whatsapp.

And if the investigations lead to the fracturing of some of the world’s largest companies, that will be more groundbreaking than anything Tim Cook announced in San José.<|endoftext|>

# Apple’s App Crackdown Spells Trouble for Families With Autistic Children

## For special needs families, Apple’s own Screen Time feature just doesn’t cut it

![Credit: anucha sirivisansuwan/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: anucha sirivisansuwan/Getty Images*

Last week, the *New York Times* [reported ](&lt;|url|&gt;)that Apple has taken action against many of the top parental control and screen time management apps: 11 of the 17 most popular apps for managing screen time have either been removed from the App Store outright, or been forced to trim their features at Apple’s request. For parents who rely on those apps to manage their kids’ access to games and other distractions, the report was a shot across the bow. “[@Apple](&lt;|url|&gt;) you’ve made it much harder for me to control my daughter’s screen time, just so you can extend your profits. Shame on you!” [one parent tweeted](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Apple’s crackdown is even more worrying for the parents of autistic children. Special needs kids often depend on their computers and phones as assistive devices for learning and communication. And as [more and more special needs families turn to homeschooling](&lt;|url|&gt;), computers and mobile devices have become crucial tools for accessing online learning opportunities. Because these kids have needs Apple’s own screen controls don’t address, their parents often turn to third-party tools. Without these tools, both the children — and their parents — suddenly face a real, tangible loss.

As the mother of an autistic 12-year-old, I know the stakes all too well. I rely on a combination of five different parental control tools to manage my son’s tech usage. In addition to Apple’s own Screen Time feature, which I use to block access to the App Store, I turn to OurPact to schedule apps for specific times of day, Qustodio to turn off my son’s Mac at other times, Circle to manage his access to the internet on a site-by-site basis, and OpenDNS to block YouTube from our home network. Since my son is highly gifted as well as autistic, it takes that many tools to keep him away from the sites and activities that trigger anxiety and meltdowns. Our setup might be extreme, but our family is by no means unique — these tools are essential to the well-being of kids like ours. But now OurPact has been barred from the App Store, and Qustodio has filed a complaint with the European Union alleging that Apple has engaged in anti-competitive practices.

Screen time management tools are important for families like ours because autistic children are particularly prone to tech addictions. “Kids on the spectrum do have this tendency to become ‘addicted’ or very preoccupied by games,” says Micah Mazurek, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia who has researched the tech habits of autistic children and adults. Autistic boys spend nearly twice as much time as neurotypical boys playing video games, and both boys with autism and those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at greater risk for problematic game use, [Mazurek’s research has shown](&lt;|url|&gt;).

While[ the latest evidence suggests that anxieties about kids’ screen time are generally overblown](&lt;|url|&gt;), the particular vulnerabilities of autistic and ADHD kids mean that special needs families often need to carefully manage their children’s tech usage. Apple’s own Screen Time controls have improved significantly in the past year, but they’re still lacking: There’s no way to set limits on individual applications, and parents can only set limits on total time spent rather than scheduling specific limits for certain times of day.

“Parents of children with ADD, ADHD, autism, and Down syndrome face unique struggles managing screen time,” says OurPact’s Paige Mayer. “When it comes to screen time, there is no such thing as a ‘one size fits all’ solution.”

In order to address our son’s specific needs, my family has assembled a patchwork solution. Because our son is homeschooled, he relies on his phone and computer for distance learning opportunities like Khan Academy and Outschool. Neurotypical children may be able to access these sites without yielding to the temptations of distraction, but my son’s impulse control challenges make it hard for him to resist the allure of video games if they’re available. Cutting games entirely out of his life would be traumatic — not to mention counterproductive — so we need tools to keep him from gaming during the school day, and to prevent him from playing [specific games that increase his anxiety and rigidity](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # If I can’t control which applications my son can access during the day, I’ll have to cut off his access to online learning options

That’s where tools like OurPact and Qustodio come in. OurPact allows us to create schedules that limit certain apps to particular times of day: During school hours, our son can only access e-books and learning apps on his iPhone, since his games turn off between 9 a.m.and 3 p.m. Qustodio serves a similar function on his laptop. While Apple controls limit us to a single “bedtime” when his computer turns off, Qustodio lets us set multiple downtimes, so we ensure that he steps away from his computer throughout the day.

The parents of neurotypical children often ask why I don’t just tell my son to turn off his devices, or impose consequences for breaking screen time rules. That’s the approach I use with my eldest child, and it works fine. But many parents find that parental controls are essential in enforcing their screen time rules: Indeed, Qustodio counts more than 2 million families who use its software, according to a company spokesperson.

Apple [claims](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the technologies that enable Qustodio and OurPact pose a security risk. By allowing one device to manage another remotely — the technology that such apps rely on — Apple says users are exposing themselves to hacking. But that argument has been [met with widespread skepticism](&lt;|url|&gt;). For one thing, such capabilities are widely used in Apple-approved apps for enterprise solutions that manage employee devices. Critics see the crackdown as [an anti-competitive move](&lt;|url|&gt;), or a way of [blocking applications that might lead people to use their phones less](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Asked about how Apple’s crackdown is affecting business, a Qustodio spokesperson says the company has had difficulties rolling out updates; [the company’s CMO alleged](&lt;|url|&gt;) that “Apple systematically began hostilities against companies in our category with the ultimate goal of eliminating competition and limiting customer choice to Apple services only.” OurPact was shut out of the App Store after nearly four years of successive Apple approvals. By making it harder for third-party vendors to reliably market and support their own parental controls, Apple risks destabilizing the entire ecosystem of tools that special needs (and many other) families depend on. (Apple did not respond to a request for comment.)

Apple was instrumental in creating a generation of kids who embrace gaming, online learning, and social media as part of their day-to-day lives. And parents have been lucky that third-party software developers filled a gap in the market. But those options will only be available if Apple restores the App Store access and developer support that make parental control software a viable business.

If Apple’s business practices lead to the disappearance of solutions like OurPact and Qustodio, families like ours will face very difficult choices: If I can’t control which applications my son can access during the day, I’ll have to cut off his access to online learning options (just when he is *finally* starting to catch up on academics) or remove all his Mac and iOS games (and face months of meltdowns and the loss of his closest, game-based friendships).

But the stakes here are even higher than what this policy change could mean for special needs kids. A world in which Apple uses its App Store to determine which parental controls live or die is a world in which it can exercise that same power over any category of software. That’s a world in which we’re all living under parental controls — with Apple itself playing Mommy and Daddy.<|endoftext|>

# Next Up on Your Twitch Stream&#58; Chess?

## How Chess.com plans to turn a classic game into the next big esport

![Illustration: [Victor Moatti](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Victor Moatti](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

In 1997, the renowned chess Grandmaster [Garry Kasparov](&lt;|url|&gt;) lost a series of games to IBM’s supercomputer Deep Blue. In many ways, the games marked the entry of the classic board game into the digital era and over the next two decades, [countless websites](&lt;|url|&gt;) devoted to playing, learning about, and discussing chess emerged. But none are more successful than [Chess.com](&lt;|url|&gt;), the top chess website and mobile app in the world. Now Chess.com wants to evolve the ancient game again, and transform chess into an esport.

With 29 million members and over 3 million active users every month, Chess.com has become the go-to destination for everyone from casual chess fans to the best players in the world. It’s where you can go to play against your friends on Android, iOS, or the web, watch the current World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen [play in his downtime](&lt;|url|&gt;), or catch [the upcoming Women’s Speed Chess Championship (WPCC) semifinals](&lt;|url|&gt;).

“Chess, in itself, is a great game,” says Chess.com co-founder and CEO Erik Allebest. “So, how do we make chess more fun in the next 10 years?” For Allebest and the Chess.com team, part of the answer is tapping into the growing esports market, which could be worth [as much as $1 billion by 2020](&lt;|url|&gt;). Though competitive video games like [*Overwatch](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and [*League of Legends](&lt;|url|&gt;)* have drawn huge crowds online for years, there’s new interest in [streaming tabletop games](&lt;|url|&gt;). [Critical Role](&lt;|url|&gt;) — an episodic stream of an ongoing *Dungeons & Dragon*s campaign — spawned [the most successful Kickstarter campaign of all time](&lt;|url|&gt;).

In other words, streaming isn’t just for video games anymore.

Chess.com is courting a wider audience by turning chess into a poker-like spectator sport. In 2017, Chess.com took over the United States Chess League, the only nationwide chess league in the country at the time. It was renamed the Professional Rapid Online Chess League (PRO Chess League) and started accepting teams and players representing cities from around the world. In its inaugural season, the league drew in 48 teams, each with 8–16 players. There were so many people ready to compete that the league had to be cut down to 32 teams the year after. As the league commissioner [Greg Shahade put it](&lt;|url|&gt;), that many players was “a bit too large and chaotic.”

In the years since the company has made esports a core focus. Viewership of over the last two years is up 489% and the site’s [official English-language](&lt;|url|&gt;) Twitch account has over 137,000 followers, more than half of which were [acquired in the last year](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # “These partners have provided fans with over 6,000 hours of content leading to over 300 million minutes watched by their hundreds of thousands of fans.”

Without the exciting action or vibrant visuals of a game like *StarCraft *or *Overwatch* that draws in viewers of modern games*,* turning chess into an esport might sound like an unlikely goal, but Chess.com has a history of proving that a healthy chess audience exists, and leveraging that fan base into new ways to engage.

The company dates back to 2005, when Allebest and his partner Jarom “Jay” Severson began selling chess equipment online through Chess.com, a domain they lucked into when the previous owner fell into bankruptcy. In 2007, they relaunched the site as a place for chess fans to come together. “I thought, we should have a community to talk about this stuff, a place where people could come not just to buy, but to discuss it,” he says. “It’s like building more of a social network.” At the time, Google would add a .com to any keyword placed in the navigation bar, meaning that almost anyone who searched “chess” ended up on their site. “I’ll say that having the Chess.com name has been a part of our growth,” Allebest says.

Chess.com is still playing the domain name: The company operates the Twitch.tv/Chess channel, as well as [ChessTV](&lt;|url|&gt;), a hub for streaming chess games on the site. Both act as hubs for individual players. Channel owners on Twitch can [host other streamers](&lt;|url|&gt;), which functions a bit like rebroadcasting local news on a national TV station. By embedding those Twitch streams on Chess.com’s video hub, individual players have their streams exposed to the 29 million members of the community at large.

“The players are able to find a viewer base who are truly dedicated to supporting their passions,” says Chess.com’s Director of esports Nick Barton. “And in turn, the Chess.com community is provided some of the best entertainment in chess.” The result is [a packed schedule](&lt;|url|&gt;) of professional and casual players constantly playing the game for an audience. “These partners have provided fans with over 6,000 hours of content leading to over 300 million minutes watched by their hundreds of thousands of fans.”

Grandmaster Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, the fourth highest ranked active chess players in the world, says that streaming through Chess.com and its channels has helped him build his brand. “Twitch and online streaming really do a lot to attract new followers.” Being featured on ChessTV puts his games in front of a lot of new eyeballs. “It gives me a few thousand viewers at once.”

His [personal Twitch channel](&lt;|url|&gt;) boasts nearly 5,500 followers, an overwhelming majority of which were acquired in the last year. His channel boasted [a dramatic spike in new followers](&lt;|url|&gt;) in January of this year after he was featured in [a PRO Chess League stream](&lt;|url|&gt;) hosted by Chess.com’s main channel. He’s also part of ChessTV’s [streaming partner program](&lt;|url|&gt;), which means he gets paid to stream his games.

The approach is reminiscent of [the star system employed by classic Hollywood](&lt;|url|&gt;). If a company uses its reach to elevate its members to superstar status, they’ll keep the audience engaged and coming back for more. And it’s worked. One of ChessTV’s biggest partner success stories, [ChessBrah](&lt;|url|&gt;), has a following of nearly 80,000 followers, putting the channel in line with [an average Overwatch League player’s personal stream](&lt;|url|&gt;).

More broadly, Vachier-Lagrave believes that while Twitch may have been designed for gaming, it has potential as a way to bring chess to new viewers. “Sometimes people on Twitch are watching *League of Legends* or *Starcraft* or *Fortnite*. But I think there’s a space available for chess.”

Vachier-Lagrave isn’t the only top-ranked player to show up on Chess.com’s streams. According to Barton, “Over the last three years, every single player in the current FIDE top 10 has participated in at least one of our flagship events.” Those events aren’t just about showcasing existing top players, but highlighting rising stars in the community as well.

Since Chess.com’s tournaments use the online version of the game, competitions don’t require huge budgets to put on a show. The WSCC semifinals, for example, were hosted online with two casters [following the game remotely](&lt;|url|&gt;). It’s not as indulgent as, say, the Blizzard’s [Overwatch League Grand Finals](&lt;|url|&gt;), which were held in the Barclays Center in New York City. However, it also gives Chess.com the flexibility to operate independently. While Blizzard has to answer to [Activision](&lt;|url|&gt;), Chess.com answers only to its players.

Unlike many tech company startups, the company has never accepted any venture capital or investment money and primarily relies on a membership model that ranges from $5-$14 per month to pay for day-to-day expenses. Ads bring in around 30% of the site’s revenue, Allebest says — outside reports indicate that the company generates [an estimated $10 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) a year — but the end goal is to replace that revenue with subscriptions. Some of the site’s income goes towards sponsoring its own events. The site’s Junior Speed Chess Championship is sponsored by ChessKid, a subsidiary of Chess.com, while much of the PRO Chess League is funded by the company directly, with a little help from its partnership with Twitch.

The company’s lean model — it has no central HQ and relies on remote workers around the world — has proven to be a smart bet: “We’ve been profitable from the very beginning,” says Allebest. “We have not had a single unprofitable quarter in the nine years that we’ve been adding memberships.”

Barton is optimistic that chess as an esport holds potential for the future. “Combining a classic game like chess with an emerging industry like esports is a recipe for success.” For now, games like *Fortnite* will continue to dominate the streaming world, but on the grand scale, they’re still blips on the historical radar. Chess has a legacy that goes back over 1,500 years. If it can adapt to the modern world — and all indications so far seem to say it can — then it might live far longer than the latest Twitch trends.<|endoftext|>

# What’s on Your Home Screen, Kyle Wiens?

## The iFixit co-founder discusses his screen-off approach to smartphones

![Kyle Wiens](<|image|>)*Kyle Wiens*

*This is “What’s on Your Home Screen?,” a Q&A column from *OneZero*. We want to understand more about how people use their smartphones — those life-consuming devices we dump hours into every day — to pave a way toward a better future. Or at least a more reflective one. We’ll add new entries regularly, and each will feature a new interview with a notable person about the apps they use, how they’re organized, and whether those red bubbles drive them nuts.*

Technology should last. Replacing your smartphone every couple years is expensive and [unsustainable](&lt;|url|&gt;) — which helps explain why people are [less inclined](&lt;|url|&gt;) than ever to buy new devices.

Still, you’ll have to get a new one eventually. The battery will degrade, or some new version of the operating system will come out that your phone isn’t powerful enough to run.

Kyle Wiens, CEO and co-founder of [iFixit](&lt;|url|&gt;), faces these problems every day. His company sells tools and provides repair guides to help consumers fix their gadgets and squeeze more life out of them — efforts that many major tech companies oppose even as “right to repair” bills [gain traction on the national stage](&lt;|url|&gt;).

All of this set the stage for a meaty conversation about how Wiens uses his own devices, which are, unsurprisingly, selected for repairability and longevity.

*What follows is our chat, edited for length and clarity.*

![](<|image|>)

### **OneZero: You’re the first Android person we’ve had in this column. Why is this your phone of choice?**

**Kyle Wiens:** I go back and forth. The reason I switched this time is because Motorola supports helping consumers fix their stuff, so I’ve got a Moto X4.

### **Tell me a little more about that.**

All phones these days have batteries that are glued in, and no cellphone manufacturer is selling replacement batteries, except Motorola. They’re the only ones. This is crazy, because your phone’s battery wears out after 18 months. This is like car manufacturers selling cars without the ability to put new tires on them.
> # I use my phone a lot, but it’s almost always with the screen off.

### **Right. Apple had its [battery controversy](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year and offered discounted battery replacements, but that’s not quite the same as having a modular part that people can easily change themselves.**

It’s also really inconvenient to go into an Apple Store. It’s even less convenient to get something like a Pixel battery swapped, because Google just doesn’t have very many options.

### **If you want to get your Pixel battery replaced, do you have to mail it in and go through a whole rigmarole?**

Most Android companies, you have to mail it in. LG, HTC, it’s pretty much mail-in. Google does have a partnership with one repair franchise, where you can go in and they’ve got parts, but what every company should be doing is selling parts direct to consumers so we can put them in ourselves.

### **The Moto X4 —**

It has a headphone jack!

### **Amazing. You don’t see that much anymore.**

Yeah!

### **Do you think you’d switch back to an iPhone in the near future, or are you sticking with Android and modular devices?**

Right now, the iPhone actually outranks most of the Android phones on repairability. The Pixel 3 probably has one of the best cameras out there, and I’d love to use it, but the repairability just wasn’t enough for me.

### **How often do you change your device?**

I use them until they’re not fixable at all anymore. In the case of the Pixel, it had a baseband issue on the main board, and I wasn’t able to get a replacement part for it, so that was the end of that phone. It would work in 3G, but not 4G.

### **Not great!**

It’s not great. There’s no way to turn off 4G on the phone. It would fire up the 4G modem, run for 10 seconds, time out, and then fall back to 3G, and then you’d get data. This was a common problem with the Pixel 1. It was a design defect.

### **We’ve covered the Android background. Now I want to talk about the software on your main home screen. There’s essentially none. Are you not super plugged into your phone all day?**

I kind of hate apps. I don’t enjoy the experience of using a phone to do things slower than I could get them done on a computer.
> # If I want the app, I will go and find it. I don’t need it to come to me.

### **What are some of those things?**

Even just reading an article, I found the form factor of reading a story on my laptop with a big screen to be vastly superior to reading on my phone. I use my phone a lot, but it’s almost always with the screen off. I’m listening to things, or I’m talking on the phone. I would guess I use my phone four hours a day, but almost all of that I’m listening to audiobooks or podcasts.

I hate distractions. I turn off notifications everywhere I possibly can. Any possible app that I can turn off notifications, I will. The other day, I thought it would be interesting to install the Pinterest app. I installed it, and then I closed it, and five minutes later it sent me a push notification. I immediately uninstalled the app. I just have no interest.

### **The phone is already such a big part of my life that the intrusiveness of these notifications is becoming so exhausting to me. Basically everyone I’ve spoken with for this column has had something similar to say about notifications — except [Farhad Manjoo](&lt;|url|&gt;) — and I wonder if more people will start feeling that way, or if it’s just us techie people who obsess over this stuff.**

I think it’s most people.

I know I’m easily distracted, so I have to be disciplined about preventing things from coming into my life that distract me. The first day I had this new phone, I spent a lot of time just going through and turning off notifications.

Actually, as I’m talking to you right now, Google Photos just sent me a notification that says, “Rediscover this day and look at what your pictures were like in 2017.” I’m going to stop notifications on that. Notifications are a great action item for me, because I immediately go and find how I can turn them off, and that’s satisfying.

If I want the app, I will go and find it. I don’t need it to come to me.

### **And software is such a clear way of locking us into our devices sometimes. [I’ve tried to switch from iOS to Android](&lt;|url|&gt;), but so much of my life revolves around iMessage that it’s hard to untether from that and break all my group chats. Apple has very effectively locked me into its system. As someone who switches devices a lot and is cognizant of how long devices can last, it’s very interesting to me that you don’t seem as beholden to specific software.**

It’s pretty conscious. But I invite all my friends to Slack. I talk with my brother on Slack. That way I can talk to him on my computer.

One thing iMessage does a lot better than Android is you can iMessage from your computer. Android has messages for web, but it sucks. Slack lets me message people who are on their phones from my computer. I’m almost always saying, “If there’s something I can do on my phone, how can I do it on my laptop instead?”

### **You use Slack, but you don’t have that on your main home screen. Is that by design?**

It’s on my second screen, so I can swipe over. That’s part of trying to not have temptations in front of me all the time.

### **Your browser of choice appears to be Google Chrome. That was probably the default, but is that your go-to everywhere?**

Chrome is my go-to. I’ve got it pretty heavily customized. I do web development all day, and I just really like Chrome’s dev tools. That’s what the majority of our readers on iFixit use, so I tend to default to the environment I’m building for. I need to get an ad blocker on my phone, though.

### **You have this clock and weather widget. Is that a default thing, or do you purposefully have that specific widget?**

I think it’s there by default, but I actually really like it. I try to spend as much time outside as I possibly can. What I do for work is in front of a computer. I want to be outside as much as I possibly can in my leisure time. And weather can be aggressive sometimes! So, I’m being more aware of the real world and trying to escape from the screen.

I read a few books a week via audiobook, but I can do that while I’m out running or working in the yard or splitting firewood. That’s been my bridge between my digital world, where I always need to be connected, but I’d much rather be out in the physical world.

# The Glaring Flaws We Need to Fix in the Internet of Things

## The Glaring Flaws We Need to Fix in the Internet of Things

### *Supposedly helpful appliances are failing us all*

![Credit: T3 Magazine/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: T3 Magazine/Getty Images*

The Internet of Things arrived with a bang a few years ago, and it feels like we haven’t quite recovered. Everyday appliances are Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-enabled by default, even when you don’t need them to be. ([Smart shoes](&lt;|url|&gt;) that lose the ability to lace up when the connected app goes down, anybody?) Many of these devices work no better than their offline alternatives, and you effectively give manufacturers carte blanche to eavesdrop on your usage habits when you buy them. And if you do buy a connected device, you can rest assured it won’t work perfectly forever.

There are countless examples of banal “smart” devices gone horribly wrong. Mattel built an internet-connected Barbie doll that was used by hackers to [spy on children and say awful things](&lt;|url|&gt;). Nest cameras and thermostats have been used in [domestic abuse cases](&lt;|url|&gt;). Simple software updates can go horribly wrong, [bricking your thermostat](&lt;|url|&gt;) or [removing features you rely on](&lt;|url|&gt;).

I’ve seen it all. I purchased a smart thermostat, Tado, which once went ballistic when my internet went down. Apparently unsure of what to do without a connection, it pumped the heat up. We woke up to a 95°F house and a thermostat that refused to relent until we physically disconnected the boiler from the wall. When my sleep tracker’s parent company, Sense, [went out of business](&lt;|url|&gt;), I was left with a very nice $200 paperweight and no sleep tracking, while the device’s lights spun on sadly, unable to reach its servers. I’ve spent [hours of my life updating light bulbs](&lt;|url|&gt;).
> # Tado was probably just trying to help cover its own costs, but it ended up feeling like a recurring microtransaction for your house.

The core problem is that adding the internet to a device introduces a ton of new complexities, and most companies that make those devices aren’t equipped to deal with them. On top of basic electronics, they’re now dealing with processors, connectivity, firmware, iOS and Android apps, and eternally updating software ecosystems. That infinitely increases the work and skills required to make a coherent product that lasts. I know, because I’ve worked at one of these companies.

Yes, hardware is hard, but the combination of hardware and user-controlled apps is a nightmare. By building an internet-enabled stovetop, a more than 100-year-old company [like General Electric](&lt;|url|&gt;) now needs to consider:

* The hardware implementation

* Firmware development and testing

* iOS/Android app development and testing

* User account management

* A cloud backend, what data is stored, and how

* Remote device updates

* Security patches

* How long the servers are expected to operate for

One look at this list should make you pause and think: How is any of this sustainable for individual products? The reality is that it often isn’t, and these realizations only arrive when the product is on the market, suddenly requiring an emergency update because the latest iOS update causes the app to crash endlessly.

There’s very little to point to in the way of successful business models in the Internet of Things. The Nest thermostat sitting on my wall has been there for three years, quietly chatting with a server and relying on the internet to function, without me paying a single additional dollar for its ongoing services. My Philips Hue bulbs have functioned for the same amount of time, and the Sonos speakers for even longer, but whether or not I’ll still be able to use those speakers in 10 years is another issue entirely — again, because of all the basic upkeep that the company will need to commit to. Products from smaller companies, like that Sense sleep tracker, have an even bleaker outlook.

The servers required to drive all of this connectivity, the data captured, and the insights generated are not cheap. Even a small startup with 5,000 pieces of connected hardware out in the world could quickly spend thousands of dollars a month to host, maintain, and secure that infrastructure. As we’ve repeatedly seen in the video game industry, when the servers go offline, the purchases we assume were permanently ours suddenly stop functioning.

And when companies do manage to future-proof themselves, the efforts tend to feel sleazy. Tado — the company that makes the thermostat that tried to roast me — in 2018 decided its geolocation based “smart” heating service would require a [monthly subscription payment](&lt;|url|&gt;) after it was free for years. Tado was probably just trying to help cover its own costs, but it ended up feeling like a recurring microtransaction for our house.

A quick look at the manufacturers of the devices I have in my home showed that zero of them are willing to publicly commit to support continued functionality for a specific amount of time. Even Apple has [argued](&lt;|url|&gt;) it only needs to support a given iPhone for one year.

As the technology in your connected devices ages, it may become too expensive or problematic to maintain. Executives — who may not have even be working at the companies when the products were introduced — may decide switching it off is easier than fixing it when it comes down to dollars and cents.

There’s still time to show the connected home industry that we expect better by voting with our wallets. If you’re considering a smart device, only purchase it if there’s a commitment to long-term functionality or evidence that the products will work regardless of its ability to connect to a server. More often than not, the manufacturer won’t commit to a certain lifespan, so it’s worth asking yourself if the benefits of connectivity outweigh the risks that it might go offline years earlier than a nonsmart alternative.

A simple rule of thumb: If a device maker isn’t forthcoming about how long it’ll maintain a device, don’t buy it. If it won’t say anything specific about the data it collects, don’t allow it onto your network.

This requires more work on your end, sure. But if we don’t collectively reject these business models, our smart homes will become hellscapes where our devices demand more money, spy on us, shut down entirely, or, well, cook us alive. Take it from me.<|endoftext|>

# One Bad Law Is Ruining Progressive Efforts to Decriminalize Sex Work

## One Bad Law Is Ruining Progressive Efforts to Decriminalize Sex Work

### Online platforms won’t be able to support the people new bills are meant to protect

![Credit: Pacific Press/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Pacific Press/Getty Images*

On June 10, a group of New York state legislators made history, introducing a [sweeping bill to decriminalize sex work](&lt;|url|&gt;) and improve the safety of New Yorkers working in the sex trade. Developed in partnership with DecrimNY, a coalition of sex workers’ rights advocates, the bill would repeal the ban on sex work and amend a number of statutes that have encouraged the harassment and abuse of sex workers across the state. The legislation offers a vision of what our laws might look like if sex work — which currently carries a number of criminal penalties that can even be applied to people who work alongside sex workers, like the cleaning staff in massage parlors — were recognized as just another job.

Although the decriminalization bill was not passed during this legislative session — and is unlikely to pass any time soon given that its supporters in Albany currently number in the single digits — it still represents a major victory for sex workers’ rights activists. After decades of being talked about rather than talked to, sex workers are now an active part of the conversation in Albany, lobbying and working with legislators directly.

What’s happening in New York state’s government is part of a larger shift in the national conversation around sex work. Around the country, an increasing number of political candidates are signaling a new sense of openmindedness toward the issues faced by sex workers; nationally, [presidential candidates](&lt;|url|&gt;) are being asked their opinion on decriminalization, something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.

Yet as powerful as decriminalization would be for sex workers, it’s still an incomplete solution — particularly for those in the industry who have long relied on the internet for advertising, screening services, and safety information. Sex work may become decriminalized at the state level, but federal law still has the power to upend and derail sex workers’ careers and put their lives at risk.

In particular, the federal Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) casts a [long shadow](&lt;|url|&gt;) over the lives of sex workers. Ostensibly intended to curb trafficking, SESTA holds online platforms accountable for content posted on their servers, a legal shift that has encouraged the censorship and removal of online tools that made it easier for sex workers to avoid booking dangerous clients and keep themselves safe while on the job.

“A lot of harm reduction and advocacy organizations actually shut down their online harm reduction resources [after SESTA passed],” says Nina Luo, a DecrimNY steering committee member and an organizer at VOCAL-NY, a statewide grassroots membership organization that builds power among low-income people affected by HIV/AIDS, the war on drugs, mass incarceration, and homelessness. These resources included safety guides for street-based sex workers and blacklists of dangerous clients. And while they were clearly intended to improve the safety of people in the sex trade rather than foster and encourage trafficking and coercion, “people were really afraid” of getting penalized by SESTA, Luo says.
> # “Using the internet to do sex work was how I learned to be safe and meet other sex workers and get support.”

There’s also the matter of advertising. For decades, sites like Craigslist and Backpage have given sex workers a way to affordably advertise their services from the safety and comfort of their own homes. In the wake of SESTA, online platforms have taken active measures to remove any venue that could be used to advertise sex work. Craigslist [entirely eliminated its personals section](&lt;|url|&gt;) rather than run the risk of violating SESTA.

In a world where sex work is decriminalized on the state level but SESTA reigns supreme, sex workers will likely still face challenges that cripple their ability to safely to do their jobs. It’s not difficult to imagine what that might look like: It’s a situation currently being navigated by dominatrixes, phone sex operators, camera performers, and other sex workers whose ability to earn a living has been stymied by SESTA even though their activities are completely legal.

Yevgeniya, a dominatrix who used to rely on Twitter, Backpage, and Craigslist to advertise her services, has been left with few outlets for promoting her services. Even the dating sites that used to accommodate her advertising have turned unwelcoming. “I was camming [on Adult Friend Finder] and people kept asking if I would come out to see them… [Adult Friend Finder] actually told me that I couldn’t even ask for flights because that would be considered prostitution,” she says, noting that the mere offer of travel was assumed to be a prelude to illegal sex work rather than a travel stipend for legal work. With anti-trafficking organization Polaris teaming up with sites like Match and OkCupid to monitor listings, Yevgeniya fears things will only get worse.

Without online ads, many sex workers are forced to work on the streets or rely on third parties to recruit their clients, setups that can make them more vulnerable to exploitation and violence. Being able to work without the fear of police harassment or jail time is essential for safer sex work, but not being able to advertise or access safety resources online introduces an additional set of risks and dangers.

“Using the internet to do sex work was how I learned to be safe and meet other sex workers and get support,” says Audacia Ray, director of community organizing and public advocacy at the [Anti-Violence Project](&lt;|url|&gt;) and a former sex worker. “It would have taken me longer to figure out if I had been doing it not using the internet to find other sex workers or to advertise. That’s really key.”

Supporters of SESTA take issue with this advocacy, arguing that the law offers essential protections against sex trafficking and the abuse of women.

Yet countries like [New Zealand](&lt;|url|&gt;) have shown that decriminalizing sex work can greatly improve the safety of people within the sex trade. As Juno Mac and Molly Smith note in their book [*Revolting Prostitutes](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, a guide to the legal status of sex work around the globe, in New Zealand, “about 70 percent [of sex workers] feel ‘most or all’ cops now look out for their safety,” a dramatic change from the era of criminalization, when police were an antagonistic force. Decriminalization has also made it possible for sex workers to ply their trade indoors and alongside friends, two things that are known to improve safety outcomes in sex work.

But there’s no denying that without the internet, sex work is more fraught and less safe. Until what they do is recognized and respected as work at all levels of government and throughout society, sex workers will still be stigmatized, unable to openly conduct their trade, and forced to take on unnecessary risks just to do their jobs.

Even though sex workers’ rights advocates recognize there’s a long road ahead to achieve their dream of a safer world for sex workers, those who I spoke with still found a reason to be hopeful.

“Decriminalization won’t necessarily get the internet sex trade back up and running, but it is really still important,” says DecrimNY steering committee member Jessica Raven, who notes that even small shifts in how we talk about sex work can have a major effect on sex workers’ lives. “The fact that this is legislation that exists, and that this is a topic that is being discussed by presidential candidates, and this a topic that we are starting to have conversations about in the streets in communities where people have seen sex workers but don’t understand the issue — that is what is going to change the culture and change the stigma that often keeps sex workers out and away from resources.”<|endoftext|>

# Juul’s Upcoming Smart Device Could Pose a Major Privacy Risk

## Experts are already sounding the alarm over concerns that insurers and employers could get access to data about e-cigarette use

![Photo by [Jordan Whitfield](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Jordan Whitfield](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Juul — the smoking-replacement startup known for its tiny nicotine vapes, fruity flavors, and [sky-high valuation](&lt;|url|&gt;) — is apparently getting into the data business. The company, which took a [$12.8 billion investment](&lt;|url|&gt;) from cigarette giant Altria in December, is creating a new Bluetooth-enabled device and corresponding mobile app. Juul claims the offerings are part of its overall mission to help cigarette smokers switch to its product. But the company is also [reportedly](&lt;|url|&gt;) launching a program that could give third parties access to Juul customer data — including sensitive details such as usage habits.

Experts tell *OneZero *they’re concerned about the privacy implications of these services.

“Like any technology, an app can be used for good or ill — or more likely a little of both,” says Margaret Foster Riley, a health law expert at the University of Virginia. “I’m not surprised if they sell data to third parties — that’s where the money is.”

Juul entered the market as a product of the vaporizer company Pax Labs in 2015 and quickly became the [most popular e-cigarette](&lt;|url|&gt;) in America. Sales of the vape blew up between 2016 and 2017, when Juul spun out into its own entity, moving from 2.2 million devices sold in 2016 to 16.2 million sold in 2017 according to a report from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Though Juul bills itself as a health-tech company — the product is premised on its ability to help cigarette smokers quit — it’s been accused of sparking a nicotine vaping epidemic among teenagers. E-cigarettes “have the potential to undo years of progress if a new generation of young people becomes addicted to nicotine,” authors affiliated with the anti-tobacco non-profit the Truth Initiative [wrote](&lt;|url|&gt;) in an op-ed in the *Journal of the American Medical Association* last year. The concerns put Juul at the center of [an investigation](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the Food and Drug Administration that probed whether the company deliberately marketed its product to teenagers. Juul has since made branding alterations, such as switching to older models in its ads and changing the names of some flavors, to avoid targeting teens.

But privacy may now become the company’s next area of public concern. Job listings first spotted by [*Business Insider](&lt;|url|&gt;)* revealed the company’s plans to develop a mobile application and data-sharing program. The app would be intended to help smokers switch to Juul e-cigarettes and would include a “habit management program” to help users track their vaping and set goals like “drop Juul usage by 20% within the next 4 weeks,” according to [one job listing](&lt;|url|&gt;). This app will work in conjunction with a new Bluetooth-enabled Juul device, which the company announced last year.

Other than the intention to collect and share information about an individual’s usage habits, specifics about the third-party data-sharing program aren’t yet available. While Juul’s current [privacy policy](&lt;|url|&gt;) may be revised once its new Bluetooth device and app launch, the company already reserves the right to share your personal data — such as location, payment information, and email addresses — with third parties. A mobile app, however, could significantly expand what kind of data Juul collects and how much of it the company shares.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Juul tells *OneZero*, “We are working on a Bluetooth-enabled device that, with an application, could provide access restrictions at the user level and could help people monitor their usage. This new device would first launch in select international markets. We do not have any additional details to share at this time.”
> # It appears Juul’s forthcoming app would collect information about nicotine use, vaping habits, and, since the app is intended for smokers trying to switch to Juul, whether or not a person smokes cigarettes.

In other words, a primary use of the app would be to restrict how much an individual could use their connected vape. As [*TechCrunch *suggested last year](&lt;|url|&gt;), the device and its connected app could block vaping around schools or insist on age verification.

So far, so good. (Unless you’re worried about someone [hacking](&lt;|url|&gt;) into your Bluetooth vape and messing with its internal settings, but that’s a different story.) But privacy and health law experts are concerned about the app and the potential risks of sharing the third-party data Juul may collect with it. Nicolas Terry, executive director of the Hall Center for Law and Health at Indiana University, tells *OneZero* such data could be of interest to several different entities, such as employers and health insurers.

“Discrimination, adverse employment decisions, and insurance costs could all be implicated,” Terry says.

While [29 states and the District of Columbia](&lt;|url|&gt;) have laws that prohibit employers from discriminating against individuals who smoke (some of which include e-cigarettes), there is currently no federal law prohibiting it. Some employers have [banned cigarette use](&lt;|url|&gt;) both on and off the job, because a healthier employee base saves the company money on health insurance. Recently, some companies have [folded e-cigarettes into their smoking bans](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Health and life insurers have long required smokers to pay higher premiums than non-smokers, but they were limited in how much information they could gather about their customers. Now [insurers are turning to data brokers to inform their coverage plans](&lt;|url|&gt;), and the more we codify our habits through hard data, the greater the risk that they could be turned against us. At minimum, it appears Juul’s forthcoming app would collect information about nicotine use, vaping habits, and, since the app is intended for smokers trying to switch to Juul, whether or not a person smokes cigarettes. All of that information would be highly valuable to insurers.

Idris Adjerid, an associate professor who studies healthcare technologies and the economics of privacy at Virginia Tech, echos concerns around employment discrimination and adds that health insurers could use the data to indirectly charge nicotine users higher premiums.

“It’s not always direct,” Adjerid says. “Those things often manifest in the form of discounts, like if you don’t do this behavior, you get this discount. There are also questions around coverage — can somebody be denied because this data makes them too high risk?”

“I think a responsible company should be seeking to protect its customers’ privacy by minimizing the data it collects and refusing to share it except for responsible uses, such as public health analyses,” Terry says.

Of course, there’s one simple way for Juulers to avoid that fate: Stick to a normal vape for as long as you can. [Sometimes going dumb is the smarter choice](&lt;|url|&gt;).<|endoftext|>

# Why ‘Contact’ Is the Most Important Space Movie Ever Made

## Why ‘Contact’ Is the Most Important Space Movie Ever Made

### The film inspired a generation of scientists

![Jodie Foster as Ellie Arroway in ‘Contact.’ Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty](<|image|>)*Jodie Foster as Ellie Arroway in ‘Contact.’ Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty*

Imagine for a moment that you’re a radio wave traveling at the speed of light. You leave Earth, passing the moon, Mars, the asteroid belt, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. You’re going so fast — 299 million meters per second — but it still takes you five hours to reach Pluto. A collage of sounds from Earth travel alongside you as you zoom out of the solar system and arrive at a star called Vega, 26 light-years away. This is how the 1997 movie *Contact* begins.

In a later scene, nine-year-old Eleanor Arroway — played as an adult by Jodie Foster — sits on her bed and talks with her father about the vastness of space and whether people on Earth are alone in the universe. “The universe is a pretty big place,” he replies. “If it’s just us, seems like an awful waste of space.”

I was a teenager when *Contact* came out, and after only a few minutes into the opening sequence, I was frozen in my seat, completely awestruck. At 13, I was already captivated by space and the big questions it raised. You know, the ones that can keep a person up at night: Why are we here? Are we alone? What does it all mean? I became obsessed and read everything I thought might give me a hint of an answer: books, poetry, you name it. Then came *Contact*.

When we meet Ellie as an adult, she’s on an impressive trajectory. She graduated from high school two years early, received a bachelor’s from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a PhD from Caltech. She’s turned down a teaching position at Harvard to pursue a job with the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence group (SETI) at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. She loses funding but eventually finds her way to New Mexico, where she detects a signal from an intelligent alien civilization. That discovery leads to the construction of a spacecraft, and Arroway fights to be its passenger.
> # “While I’m sad she’s fictional, I know her spirit lives within many women.”

I’d never seen anyone like Ellie. Most people hadn’t. Twenty years ago, when the film was released, few space odysseys featured women in leading roles. Today, we have films like *Interstellar* and *Gravity*, but the depiction of women in popular culture as scientists, engineers, and leaders is sadly still quite scarce.

In the many years since* Contact *was released, I’ve become a writer focused mostly on space. Through my work, I’ve met several women and men who also came of age around the time of the film, and many of them took careers in science. The film comes up often in conversation, and I started to wonder: How many of us became scientists or took a science-adjacent job because of this underrated sci-fi film from the 1990s?

So, I did what any writer would do on deadline and took to Twitter:


A Twitter poll is pretty unscientific, and while most people who responded said they didn’t go into science because of the movie per se, I received several exciting responses from women in space-related careers who say the film inspired them.

Erin MacDonald, an astrophysicist and aerospace engineer wrote:


Kim Bott, an astrobiologist at the Virtual Planetary Laboratory wrote:


“Seeing *Contact* left a lasting impression on me,” says Jillian Yuricich, an aerospace engineer who sent me a direct message. “I first saw the movie when I was around eight or nine, and while I didn’t appreciate the nuance of the debate on faith until some years later, seeing a blonde girl be strong and determined and then stepped on by the men around her and then strong and determined even still… she was one of the most important role models I ever had.”

“I’ve watched that movie and read the book countless times since, and I always see myself in Ellie Arroway,” Yuricich adds. “While I’m sad she’s fictional, I know her spirit lives within many women.”

What continues to make *Contact* compelling is the fact that the character Ellie Arroway remains so relevant today. She’s brilliant and irrationally driven and constantly up against the men who control the purse strings to her research.

Carl Sagan, who wrote the book *Contact* that the film is adapted from, based Arroway on a real scientist named Jill Tarter. Tarter received her bachelor’s of engineering physics degree from Cornell University — as the only woman in her class — around the same time that Sagan was a professor there. Her graduate work at UC Berkeley and career at SETI inspired Sagan to base his story’s heroine on her. Science writer Sarah Scoles, my friend and colleague, wrote Tarter’s biography, fittingly called *Making Contact*. It was published last year, exactly 20 years after the film was released.

“I saw *Contact *when my family got it from Blockbuster,” Scoles says. “I was immediately engrossed and obsessed with the idea that there was a scientist who got paid — kind of — to ask these big questions and investigate them.”

“*Contact* taught me that I wanted to do radio astronomy,” she says. “I got to do an internship at Arecibo and stay in the cabin across from where Jodie Foster stays in *Contact*, and I felt very proud of myself.”

For me, the film continues to inspire. I think about it often and watch it once a year. It’s not just that Ellie is a woman, but the fact that she represents a person so many of us see inside ourselves. I take great comfort knowing that there are so many women actively seeking answers to questions about space and humanity in part because of a film they watched two decades ago.

Toward the end of the movie, Ellie finds herself onboard a spacecraft, destination unknown. She’s faced with the very real possibility that she won’t survive her quest. The pod shakes violently as it begins to take off, and fear shows on her face as the countdown clock creeps to zero. “I am okay to go. Ellie to Control, do you read me? I am OKAY TO GO,” she shouts.

I continue to wonder: Would I, and can I, be so brave?<|endoftext|>

# The New Raspberry Pi Could Be Your Desktop PC — If Your Standards Are Low Enough

## At $35, almost no computer is cheaper, but you’ll be limited in what you can do

![Photo: Future Publishing/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: Future Publishing/Getty Images*

The Raspberry Pi 4 is being [billed as](&lt;|url|&gt;) [a full](&lt;|url|&gt;) [desktop computer](&lt;|url|&gt;), and one that costs just $35. What used to be an inexpensive gadget for tinkerers could now be an inexpensive computer for everyone. Or at least a bare-bones web browser box. But if you’re looking for it to replace a typical desktop, your standards might have to be pretty low.

The Raspberry Pi 4 kicks off the first new generation of Pi boards since the Raspberry Pi 3 was released in 2016. At its ultra-low price — only a little bit less than a pair of Apple Earbuds — the Pi 4 comes with 1GB of RAM, an upgraded processor, two USB 3.0 ports, and a new USB-C power connector. Its most headline-grabbing feature is its ability to power a single 4K display up to 60 frames per second, or two of them at 30 frames per second. You won’t be able to play 4K games on it, but it can at least output to your fancy new TV.

However, according to Thorin Klosowski, author of *Idiots Guide to the Raspberry Pi *and staff writer for [*Wirecutter](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, one of its biggest benefits is rather mundane: for a little extra money, you can get a lot more RAM.“The optional $55 4 GB of memory model is easily the standout feature here,” he says. “The added memory will make it feel much snappier as a computer and more usable in general.”
> # The Pi 4, on the other hand, can be used for basic work and web browsing. Just not a lot of it.

That upgrade changes the value proposition of the Pi 4 as a standalone device. In the past, Raspberry Pis — inexpensive, customizable computers designed for hacking and education — were very basic boards that were only really useful for specialized tasks. A [retro gaming console](&lt;|url|&gt;), [a media server](&lt;|url|&gt;), or [a DIY Amazon Echo](&lt;|url|&gt;). The Pi 4, on the other hand, can be used for basic work and web browsing. Just not a lot of it.

To prove the point, Klosowski responded to my questions via email on his own 4GB model Raspberry Pi 4. “It works perfectly fine for writing this email in Gmail, with the Raspberry Pi blog opened up in another window, some more tabs with some benchmarks of the Pi 4, and a YouTube music video playing to keep me company,” he said. “Can it do *more* than that? Not really. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing.”

It’s not the best computer around, but it’s impossible to find something comparable at the price point. Even some of the most inexpensive Chromebooks [can be over $200](&lt;|url|&gt;), and similarly priced Windows machines may not even be worth the money. “I’ve used Windows laptops in the $200-$400 range,” says Klosowski. “And compared to those [the Raspberry Pi 4] feels nearly as capable. Which to be clear, is still not that capable!”

So, aside from not being the most powerful computer on the planet, what’s the catch?

One of the biggest drawbacks is that the Pi 4 only comes with the board itself. It doesn’t even come in a plastic case. In order to use it as a proper desktop, you’ll need at least one monitor, an HDMI cable, a keyboard, a mouse, a microSD card, a plastic Pi case, and a power supply cable to plug it in. The Raspberry Pi Foundation — the charitable organization that develops the Raspberry Pi — offers [a desktop kit](&lt;|url|&gt;) for $120 which includes most of the above accessories (including the Pi 4 itself), but still lacks a monitor. If you don’t already have some of the parts laying around, you might end up spending as much as you would on another desktop, and at that point, you might be able to get [something marginally more powerful for your money](&lt;|url|&gt;).

![](<|image|>)

Then there’s the software problem. The Raspberry Pi 4, like its predecessors, runs an official distribution of Linux [called Raspbian](&lt;|url|&gt;), seen above. This means it comes with its own basic apps like a calculator or file browser, but they likely aren’t what the average user is used to. It also runs an open-source version of Google Chrome called Chromium which is similar to, but not quite identical to, the browser [most of the internet uses](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Since it’s not running a more mainstream operating system like Windows or even ChromeOS, it also might not work as smoothly. “It’s Linux-based and that means some troubleshooting headaches will come about,” says Klosowski. If your keyboard doesn’t work, or it won’t connect to Wi-Fi, it can be harder to find the support you need to get it fixed. That’s fine for people who like to tinker with their stuff, but it probably rules out buying one for your grandma.
> # Even if the Pi 4 is unlikely to take the world by storm as a full desktop replacement, the fact that it’s even an option could have an impact on the market.

For now, you can’t even install a different operating system on it if you wanted to. While this will probably change eventually, at release the Raspberry Pi 4 [doesn’t support the ARM version of Windows](&lt;|url|&gt;), or even Retropie, the software designed to turn it into a gaming emulator. If you want to use the Pi 4 as a desktop, you’re going to be stuck with Raspbian for a while.

It’s unlikely that you’ll suddenly see stores advertising a desktop-in-your-pocket kind of experience with a Raspberry Pi 4. However, it could still have new niche uses that previous Raspberry Pi models couldn’t pull off.

“For example, there has been this desire for ‘distraction-free’ writing machines,” says Klosowski. “And they’re all these overpriced pieces of garbage with failed Kickstarter campaigns. You could absolutely build something like with this new model of the Raspberry Pi, and it will feel good to type on, with no delays or other hiccups that tended to plague older models.”

Similar projects have already been started [with previous Pi models](&lt;|url|&gt;), but the added processing power and RAM of the Pi 4 makes the idea a lot more feasible. “All the little projects that sort-of-kind-of-barely worked on the older models, like [an idiotic GIF picture frame](&lt;|url|&gt;), will run smoother, crash less, and work better,” says Klosowski.

Even if the Pi 4 is unlikely to take the world by storm as a full desktop replacement, the fact that it’s even an option could have an impact on the market. Especially when it comes to education or low-budget hardware. “If I was buying for a younger kid and wanted to get them interested in computers,” says Klosowski, “I would absolutely go with a Raspberry Pi over a Chromebox/book.”<|endoftext|>

# E.T. Is Secretly the Scariest Movie of All Time

## E.T. Is Secretly the Scariest Movie of All Time

### Steven Spielberg didn’t create the universe’s most beloved alien. He created a nightmare.

![Photo: Archive Photos/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Archive Photos/Getty*

Yes, the much-anticipated *Halloween* reboot recently murdered its competition at the box office. But I regret to inform you that Michael Myers is not the most frightening monster in cinema. No, it’s not *Friday the 13th*’s Jason, nor Freddy of *Elm Street* infamy. Nor is it the Alien and Predator of *Alien* and *Predator* (respectively), Jack Nicholson in *The Shining*, Regan in *The Exorcist*, or any other traditional movie monster. I’m not afraid of any of them. That’s because I have seen the horrid, shriveled face of true cinematic evil and the inhuman, glowing finger that accompanied it.

I do not like E.T. No, check that: I loathe E.T. I hate E.T. to the core of my being. If I came home one day to find my family brutally murdered, E.T. covered in their blood, and using said blood to write “ROB BRICKEN IS AN ASSHOLE” on the wall, I would not find him more awful than I do already. Yet, somehow, countless others love E.T. His eponymous movie is regarded as one of the best family friendly films ever made, and among Steven Spielberg’s crowning achievements.
> # I knew E.T. was evil from a very early age.

It should go without saying that everyone is wrong, and have all been tricked by Spielberg and his malformed creation into believing *E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial* is wholesome and heartwarming, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Chances are, you are one of these tens of millions of misguided souls. If so, read on, because I have an unassailable argument for why this so-called lovable alien should be feared and hated, beginning with this undeniable fact: E.T. looks like male genitalia.

I don’t say this to be crass. I absolutely do not like that he looks this way, but it cannot be denied. His large torso is a brownish, wrinkled sack atop two small feet. His head is bulbous, and upsettingly lies atop a long neck which E.T. extends whenever he is excited. It is a bleak truth, but a truth all the same. The proof is now that you’ve been made aware of it, you will never be able to unsee it, no matter how many times you watch the film.

But even if E.T. looked as comfortably human as Spock from *Star Trek*, it wouldn’t excuse what is considered one of the film’s most charming scenes: When E.T. gets a child drunk. After inviting an alien into his home, 10-year-old Elliott leaves for school the next morning; once alone in the house, E.T.’s almost immediate action is to consume alcohol.

He pounds a six-pack in about five minutes, which would be problematic enough. However, E.T. has formed a psychic connection with Elliott that the boy neither asked for nor consented to. So, while the alien drunkenly rampages through the house, the equally inebriated Elliot tries to free all the frogs scheduled for live dissection that day in class. Most heinously of all, when E.T. sees a couple kiss on TV, he sends poor, prepubescent Elliott the command to harass one of his female schoolmates by kissing her, too. This is not heartwarming.

It could be argued that at this point E.T. has not realized the symbiotic connection he’s formed with Elliott, and I can’t prove otherwise. However, the alien has no excuses for what follows. After having the idea to “phone home” while bombed, E.T. mysteriously starts falling ill. That night, the alien forces his young, devoted friend to take him to the forest to make his call, and sleep there on the ground, in the cold, overnight. When Elliott’s older brother Michael arrives, he discovers not only that Elliott has become severely sick, but he sees one of the most horrific sights in all of cinema: The bloated, fish-belly-white body of the terminally ill E.T, screaming in agony. This is simply awful to behold.

Now that E.T. and Elliott are both dying, Michael brings them back to the house, where another horror awaits — the silent, masked government men in protective suits. My feelings on the film aside, I know for a fact that this scene traumatized many a child of the ’80s, even those who now claim to enjoy the movie, especially after the scientists pull the screaming E.T. and Elliott away from each other. But that’s neither here nor there.

Here’s the secret, horrifying truth:** **E.T. was going to murder Elliott.

Don’t laugh, because I can prove it. First of all, we must examine why E.T. gets sick when his spaceship leaves. And just as importantly, why E.T. gets better as the spaceship approaches Earth again. Clearly the aliens’ life forces are tied to each other, or their ship, in some way that’s not strictly physical. It’s only when E.T.’s spaceship and his people approach — or rather, get within a certain proximity — that he returns to life in that creepy little body bag as Elliott sobs over his corpse (and again, what a charming family film this is). Elliott theorizes this in the movie, and E.T. agrees, so we may accept this as fact.
> # The proof is now that you’ve been made aware of it, you will never be able to unsee it, no matter how many times you watch the film.

Now, it’s arguable that E.T. might not have known he needed his ship/people to live, and didn’t realize it until his resurrection, but this is a race that has mastered interstellar travel; it seems unlikely that they would somehow take these trips without being aware of the danger of getting separated or left behind. They’re scientists, they’ve come to Earth to study the flora; it seems absurd that they’re ignorant about what they need to survive. Also, E.T.’s urgency in constructing the device to “phone home” is indicative that he knows his death is nigh.

Why, then, would he psychically bond with a human child when he’s knowingly been given a death sentence? Why would he choose to tie a child’s life to his own, especially after he realizes he has so little time left? At best — at best — this is a horrifying, callous disregard for Elliott’s life. At worst, E.T. enters into a murder-suicide pact with Elliott that he never informs him of.

E.T. is dying, he knows he’s dying, and decides he’s going to take Elliott’s life with him when he goes. How do we know that the psychic bond between the two is something E.T. can control? Because after bringing Elliott to the brink of death, E.T. finally relents and releases Elliott from his psychic bond, allowing the boy to get better. But if E.T. could release him, why wait so long? Why watch Elliott suffer? Why get so close to actually killing him when it was clearly not at all necessary, and well within E.T.’s power to stop?

There’s your lovable alien in your beloved family flick. A creature who, knowing he’s about to die, decides to needlessly take a child out with him, only to change his mind at the last minute.

Happily, at this point in the film, E.T. dies; unhappily, he’s resurrected by the approaching spaceship of his people, who have been “phoned” and guilted into picking up the comrade they accidentally (?) left behind. All that’s left is for Elliott to spirit E.T. away from the scientists who saved his young life, speed back to the forest while chased by government agents, and for E.T. to use his powers to levitate the bikes of a large group of children trying to get him back to his spaceship, in a truly magical, iconic moment of immense child endangerment.

I knew E.T. was evil from a very early age. When my mother first took me to see the film in 1982, I was five, and realized almost instantly that E.T. was a malevolent being from space. The rest of the film only confirmed my initial assessment and, to my young mind, indisputably proved the following facts about aliens:

* They exist.

* They target North American suburbia.

* They are either moderately interested in or looking specifically for young, human boys.

* Even the friendliest-seeming aliens will probably kill you.

Thanks to this so-called family friendly movie, I immediately developed a fear of aliens that endured into my teens, because my circumstances were just like Elliott’s. The aspect that terrified me most was the prospect of E.T., or a similar alien, abducting me because it thought I was its friend. Somehow, that misunderstanding was worse than all the evil aliens and movie murderers combined. I would still rather be attacked by *Halloween*’s Michael Myers, because at least you know where you stand with him.

What if E.T. thought I wanted to go to outer space, and dragged me with him? After all, an alien wouldn’t know human communication cues — it might mistake my screams of terror for a desire to be dragged into a spaceship, away from my friends and family forever. The aliens might even think that I wanted to be vivisected, and I’d consider it a huge favor if they started removing my organs. If I’m their first human friend, it doesn’t matter how nice they are, if I’m the one they need to gruesomely murder to figure out. “So, it turns out humans need to keep all their organs on the inside. Somebody write that down for next time.”

From the age of five, I lived in mortal terror that aliens would abduct me, and no one could convince me otherwise. All it would take was a light to move past my window to convince me an alien ship was here and looking for me. I can’t imagine how many hours I spent terrified in bed, afraid to move or make a noise because I was completely confident the aliens’ scanners would detect me. Also, thanks to a babysitting session, overseen by my less than hands-on grandmother, I was somehow allowed to watch the original 1983 *V* miniseries — you know, the one where the human-seeming aliens rip off their faces to reveal that they are horrible, hamster-eating lizard people — so I wasn’t entirely sure my parents weren’t also secret hamster-eating lizard people from outer space.

I blame E.T. for all this. If it hadn’t been for that slimy, disgusting monstrosity I might have been all right. Instead, I had to live in a world where it seemed like only I recognized the fact that *E.T.* was a goddamned horror film.

Now, I know: I am not alone. The internet has helped me find other souls who have been similarly traumatized by this alien asshole. We know the truth, and we take solace in that, and each other. I don’t know if history will ever recognize that we’re right — because again, we totally, completely are — or if future generations will somehow ignore this alien’s murderous ways, his diabolical actions, and his testicular appearance. Perhaps most people will be forever blinded to E.T.’s heinous evils by the light of his long, iconic, red-glowing finger.

You know. The one he uses to touch children.<|endoftext|>

# It’s a Good Thing That Shopping on Your Phone Is the Worst

## It’s a Good Thing That Shopping on Your Phone Is the Worst

### You’re primed to make bad decisions when you shop on the go

![Credit: ArisSu/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: ArisSu/Getty Images*

There is no worse way to shop than on your smartphone.

I almost never do it, and I’m surprised that so many others do. Navigating online shops is a chore. Images rarely zoom or scroll correctly. It’s hard to compare one item to another. Large arrow icons block out parts of clothing or furniture, if they appear at all. Checkout functions aren’t well-suited to touch screens either; typing your address and credit card number into a new shop is miserable.

There are a number of ways user experience designers and hardware developers could make all of this a lot easier. But there’s a benefit to all these annoying barriers. Research shows we’re likely to make impulse purchases on our phones — things that are unnecessary and probably a waste of money. If you can’t even get the mobile site to work for whatever cute little brand you’re looking to drop a couple of hundred dollars on, you probably just saved some dough that’s better spent elsewhere.

According to research on consumers’ mobile shopping behavior, there are two types of purchases people tend to make on their mobile devices: “[hedonic purchases](&lt;|url|&gt;)” and “[habitual purchases](&lt;|url|&gt;).” A hedonic purchase could be a pair of stylish shoes that you buy on a whim from an Instagram ad — something you want very much, not something that you need.

A habitual purchase is the sort of product a consumer buys regularly, like house supplies or beauty products, that are a part of the person’s regimen already. I talked to a number of acquaintances about their mobile shopping habits for this piece, and almost all of them told me that the bulk of their mobile purchases fell into one of the two categories, with items ranging from impulse eBay and Instagram purchases to, more often, pet and office supplies.

“I find that customers are more likely to buy products that they are already familiar with when they have to rely on their smartphones to make these purchases,” such as staple products or other items that the consumer doesn’t need to think about too much before buying, says Rebecca Wang, an assistant professor of marketing at Lehigh University and a research affiliate at Northwestern University’s Spiegel Research Center. “Smartphones… are more of a habit-reinforcement tool. They are with consumers all the time but compared to PCs, they don’t lend themselves to searches and learning as efficiently.”

![*A less than ideal mobile shopping experience on Anthropologie.com*](<|image|>)**A less than ideal mobile shopping experience on Anthropologie.com**

Ying Zhu, an assistant professor of management at the University of British Columbia, has studied how consumers differentiate their purchases depending on the device. In her 2017 [research](&lt;|url|&gt;), she found hedonic purchases to be the most common purchases made on mobile devices, while utilitarian purchases that require more thought and comparison — the most efficient [air purifier](&lt;|url|&gt;) say — are more likely to be desktop buys.

We can be saved from such hedonic purchases — saved from ourselves, really — when confronted with a mobile checkout so inconsistent and glitchy that it’s unclear if the order even went through.

“It’s always such a pain,” a friend told me last week when I asked her about her experiences with online shopping. “I tried to buy this sweater literally seven times and it wouldn’t go through despite me having the proper card info each time.” Eventually, she contacted customer service, and when they didn’t get back to her within 24 hours, my friend ditched the product. It wasn’t worth all the work to actually get the sweater.
> # If I see I’m going to be paying $8.99 to ship a $35 bra, I’m out. I become a statistic: a cart abandoner.

My friend’s frustrating experience is hardly unusual. Cart abandonment — when a customer puts items in their online shopping cart, only to quit without following through on the purchase — is high across all digital shopping methods, but it’s highest on mobile. According to [industry research](&lt;|url|&gt;) from 2018, nearly 86% of shoppers ultimately abandon their carts on a mobile device, compared to 73% on a desktop.

There are two main reasons why this happens, according to Wang: operations-related and consumer-related.

On the operations side, if customers are forced to create an account to check out, or if the checkout process is otherwise clumsy and cumbersome, customers will likely walk away from the cart. Alternatively, consumers may have anxiety about making a purchase, question the validity and trustworthiness of the product, lack knowledge about the return process, or feel frustrated and doubtful about pricing and shipping costs.

I’m absolutely not going to make a purchase if I don’t know if I have free shipping and returns, and when I’m on my phone, that information may not be apparent until I’m halfway through the already-annoying checkout process, if at all. If I see I’m going to be paying $8.99 to ship a $35 bra, I’m out. I become a statistic: a cart abandoner.

And then there’s a hardware issue. My phone is too small to get a really good look at what I’m buying. The inability to compare products on my smartphone is the single biggest reason why I don’t generally buy things on mobile. If I need to buy a pair of jeans, I’m not going to buy them on a whim; I have to compare them to at least several others before clicking “complete order.” How stretchy is the denim? How long is the inseam? Do the reviews delve into what kind of body type fits into the jeans best? Are they true to size? And how much do they cost?

It’s a lot to consider, far too much to be able to manage on my iPhone screen, with its awkward tab navigation and relatively small size. Hence, the two purchases I’m most likely to make, hedonic and habitual buys, are the ones that require the least amount of research.

Zhu, however, brings that reasoning one step further. Different devices may encourage different types of thinking. Smartphones, she says, “enhance your experiential thinking mode. You’ll be drawn towards hedonic products like ice cream and chocolate.” But because of how we typically use desktop computers — it’s where we do much of our day-to-day work — we approach their use in a “rational” thinking mode. And when that’s the case, you’re more capable of asking questions and making comparisons.

This all could change in the future, and likely will. Zhu notes that as we grow more and more dependent on mobile, we could end up transitioning our rational thinking from desktop to mobile out of necessity. We’ll be doing more work and completing more tasks on our phones, so that mode of thought will follow. Or we could lose access to that rational thinking mode, making it harder for us to make thoughtful purchases that require more than a split-second decision.

In other words, we’ll be dumber about things we need to think about before buying. Once buying a car on our phones becomes commonplace, say, we might indulge in the impulse Range Rover rather than comparing it to a Toyota RAV4 and carefully deciding between the two. “You pretty much start to use your heuristic rule of thumb on the smartphone,” says Zhu. “It will dominate all the decisions we make and that will have long-term consequences.”

In the meantime, if online retailers want to reduce their mobile cart abandonment rates, they can do a few things. Brands should focus on improving their search, navigation, and image viewing functions to make it easier for customers to actually find what they’re looking for. Augmented reality — such as [Ikea’s app](&lt;|url|&gt;), which allows you to visualize a product in your own home — could become more popular and help mitigate the guessing game inherent in ordering something before you’ve seen it. Foldable phones, by virtue of their screen size, could make thoughtful, comparative shopping easier — [if they ever actually end up on the market](&lt;|url|&gt;). And [Instagram](&lt;|url|&gt;) is currently in the process of adding in-app shopping, which will certainly make it easier to indulge in hedonic purchases, though it will do little for consumers hoping to research and purchase specific products.

As for me? Well, I’m going to try to get out of the house more and hit up actual stores. I spend enough time gazing into the abyss of my screens as it is.<|endoftext|>

# We Already Know What Our Data Is Worth

## New legislation would require tech companies like Facebook and Google to disclose the value of users’ data, but we don’t need laws to put a price on our autonomy

![Photo by [Will Francis](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [Will Francis](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

On Monday, U.S. Senators Mark Warner and Josh Hawley introduced what they’re calling the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broader Oversight and Regulations on Data (or DASHBOARD) Act. The [bill](&lt;|url|&gt;) aims to do three main things: require tech companies to regularly disclose to users how their personal data are being used, which third parties that data is being shared with, and the value of the data people provide to platforms.

The final aspect of the bill is the one that’s [generating headlines](&lt;|url|&gt;). That’s intentional — it’s even highlighted in bold in the bill’s one-page summary. But what would happen if we put a price on data?

To be clear, for Warner and Hawley, clarifying this monetary value isn’t about people getting paid for their data. As they outline, the purpose of disclosing the “true value” of data would be to provide transparency for users and increase competition in the sector. Most importantly, it would “assist antitrust enforcers in identifying unfair transactions and anticompetitive transactions and practices.” That monetary value might also mean that if someone’s data is abused, “consumers have an injury to seek damages against,” David Carroll, the professor who [launched a court challenge](&lt;|url|&gt;) to reclaim his data from Cambridge Analytica, tweeted Monday.

Opening an avenue for legal redress against technology companies could change how they distribute or share data, but for most people, what would seeing the value of their personal data really mean? Having that perspective could open a new line of sight into the world beyond our screens, but it would do little to solve the bigger problem: ending the invasive business practices of the major tech platforms. In fact, it might end up making things worse.

Let’s start with what our data is worth in dollars to a tech platform. Warner and Hawley’s bill tasks the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with developing a way to accurately quantify it, but until the SEC does that, all we can really do is guess. Arriving at a firm number isn’t easy, nor perhaps even that useful, given data is really only worth a lot to companies in aggregate, not individually. Still, various attempts have been made to calculate a per-person tally.

A few years ago, the *Financial Times [*created a tool](&lt;|url|&gt;) that calculated the value of someone’s data “based on the analysis of industry pricing data from a range of sources in the U.S.” After answering some general yes/no questions, the FT’s calculator suggests my data, for example, might be worth about 17 cents.

That seems a tad low — and it might be. More recently, a team of researchers[ examined](&lt;|url|&gt;) how much revenue was lost when consumers chose to opt-out of behavioral advertising via the AdChoices program. Opting-out via AdChoices still meant that people saw ads, just not ads based on their prior browsing. Based on access to an ad exchange, they found that ads shown to people who’d opted out of behavior targeting were worth 52% less than those for users who allowed behavioral targeting. Overall, they found that in 2015, opt-out via the AdChoices program resulted in a loss of $5.7 million in the U.S. desktop display ad market — or about $8.58 per person who opted out.
> # In trying to get people to recognize the high value of their personal data, the Dashboard Act will likely only cheapen it.

Those are two very different numbers, and ending the ambiguity over which one is closer would be nice, but what would it really accomplish?

In their summary of the bill, Warner and Hawley note that “as predictive analytics and machine learning permeates ever-greater parts of our digital economy, user data serves as the key enabler for an enormous range of products and services… Customers have consistently been told that these services are ‘free.’ Yet the current lack of transparency impedes consumers’ ability to fully understand the terms of the exchange and decide for themselves whether they are getting a fair deal from the platform companies that monetize their data.”

But if users somehow discovered their data was only worth a few dollars, how would that deal look? Probably, most people would conclude that the services that allow them to network with friends and family, travel more conveniently, or find a cheaper place to stay when traveling are worth significantly more than the data they’ve had to share to use them. The deal would seem better than fair. In trying to get people to recognize the high value of their personal data, the Dashboard Act will likely only cheapen it. We might be even more likely to give it away for free, and even more likely to stay on the platforms.

It’s enticing to think we might be able to peer past our screens into the inner workings of the tech giants and see, finally, how much we’re really worth to them. Except our worth isn’t necessarily about money — it’s about our continued participation in the ad-driven platform economy, and fulfilling the tautology that underpins it: That the more we’re there, the more we’ll be there.

This is the cycle we need to break. But the Dashboard Act won’t help to do that. While it tries to give us power over the major data-driven tech companies by way of transparency, its good intentions pave a road that leads in exactly the opposite direction.<|endoftext|>

# Warning Signs That a Bubble Is About to Burst

## You don’t need a Nobel to see the similarities between 1999 and 2019

![Credit: Johannes Eisele/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Johannes Eisele/Getty Images*

In 1999, I and a gaggle of other San Francisco internet founders and CEOs went to an airfield, where we browsed private jets. It made sense that, at 34, I should have a one-bedroom apartment to transport me across the surface of the atmosphere at mach .8, because I was a fucking genius who could afford, on paper, to spend the equivalent of a thousand years of my mother’s salary on a Gulfstream.

A bunch of thirtysomething dicks looking at planes, and it feeling normal, is a decent signal that the canary is dying and these budding masters of the universe are about to get bitch-slapped — which we were. I never got the jet. But I have achieved Mosaic status on JetBlue.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, defines a financial crisis as “something that happens every five to seven years.” It’s been 11 since the last recession. As you get old enough to observe cycles as actual cycles, you begin to recognize that the economic time you’re in is a point on a curved line, and, sooner than you think, the direction of the line will change. Better or worse.

An asset bubble is a wave of optimism that lifts prices beyond levels warranted by fundamentals, ending in a crash. In 1999, I promised myself that I’d be smarter next time. “Next time” meaning on the cusp of a pop or recession.

So, how do you ID when we’ve entered the danger zone, and should you adjust your behavior? There are several hard metrics for why we may be nearing a full-Monty bubble, including things my NYU colleagues spend a great deal of time thinking about and understand much better. But you don’t need a Nobel to see the similarities between 1999 and 2019. Some of the softer metrics are far better canaries in this particular coal mine.

## **Signs that markets or a company are about to find themselves on the wrong side of cyclicality**

* The metrics around valuations, P/E ratios, and easy credit-inflating bubbles are logical indicators of canaries. Seth Klarman, the most successful hedge fund manager nobody’s heard of, recently warned that the sugar high of stimulus combined with high-cholesterol protectionism doesn’t end well.

* When nations and firms start erecting big buildings, look out. The Pan Am Building, Sears Tower, and any number of giant penises plunging into Mother Earth in emerging markets are little more than multibillion-dollar dick pics and may seem like a good idea at the time but are just tacky.

* The most obvious canaries within companies are typically manifestations of the CEO’s ego. The strongest sell signals are when the CEO goes Hollywood, or believes the world shouldn’t suffer their absence from fashion covers and ads. David Karp in J.Crew ads and Dennis Crowley in Gap ads should have told us their companies would soon be shadows of their former selves and valuations. Marissa Mayer’s 3,000-word profile in the September issue of *Vogue *around the time she spent $3 million of shareholder money sponsoring *Vogue*’s Met Ball is an indicator of poor judgment. This way of thinking leads you to spend another billion dollars of shareholder money to purchase the blog platform (Tumblr) of the guy who’s in the J.Crew ads, only to find you spent $1.1 billion on a porn site that has little revenue.

* A CEO’s fashion can also be telling. When he or she starts showing up on stage wearing a black turtleneck (“I’m the next Steve Jobs”), it likely means not that Jobs has been reincarnated, but that the company’s stock is about to crash (Jack Dorsey) and/or the FDA is going to ban you from your own labs (Elizabeth Holmes).

* Mediocrity + two years of tech experience = six figures. Kids who can code and are two years out of school, who are mediocre, are making $100,000-plus in the market. What’s worse is that they believe they’re worth it. If you can code, yay for you. But you have no real hard skills or management ability. Not recognizing that you’re overpaid means you won’t have the funds to avoid your parents’ basement when shit gets real.

* Bidding wars for commercial real estate. Firms that investors believe are the next Google, armed with cheap capital, roam the streets of New York and San Francisco, driving up commercial real estate. They are also competing with the Four (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google), which are purchasing superblocks in NYC.

I was invited to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos when I was 32, pre-crisis, as internet entrepreneurs were the new masters of the universe. I met with several CEOs who wanted insight from me on business, as clearly I had unique insight. No, I didn’t. I was a reasonably talented 32-year-old, who at any other time would have been making only a decent living. Instead, I was Yoda, lecturing more talented businesspeople on what their firms should do. When the dot.bomb hit, I was 34 and returned to Davos, where I couldn’t get arrested — nobody would meet with me.
> # The greatest asset of a child CEO is being too stupid to know you’re going to fail.

When times are bad, people look to gray hair for leadership. When times are good/frothy, people look for youth. Evan Spiegel and Jack Dorsey are incredibly talented young men who have built companies that are likely worth hundreds of millions, maybe even a billion dollars, but not tens of billions. Snap, WeWork, Uber, Twitter — combined, worth more than Boeing — are run by talented young men who in their next lives will be vice presidents (optimistic) and really grateful. As a former twentysomething CEO of new-economy firms, I can tell you that the greatest asset of a child CEO is being too stupid to know you’re going to fail. Young CEOs pursue avenues that are crazy and that sometimes end up being crazy-genius. But most are just too inexperienced to be running companies that hundreds or thousands of families depend on for their livelihood.

If the tech boom continues its run, there’s a non-zero probability that a teenager will be the founder/CEO of a $1 billion–value tech firm in the next decade. When that happens, we really will be on the precipice of the economic zombie apocalypse. If he or she wears a black turtleneck, treats employees like shit, and sports tattoos, a nose ring, or other accouterments of youth, society will treat them like Jesus Christ. We now worship at the altar of innovation and youth, versus character or kindness.

# A Tim Cook Bio Is the Story of His Life — Not His Life Story

## Leander Kahney got some serious Apple access but never gets close to his subject

![Apple CEO Tim Cook (left) at the iPad Pro launch in 2018. Photo by Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*Apple CEO Tim Cook (left) at the iPad Pro launch in 2018. Photo by Lance Ulanoff*

Reading Leander Kahney’s insightful if not terribly illuminating biography [*Tim Cook: The Genius Who Took Apple to the Next Level](&lt;|url|&gt;)* is like attending a dinner where the guest of honor never arrives. Cook’s persona is omnipresent in the nearly 300-page tome, but the man himself never takes a seat at the table.

Apple granted Kahney, who has written several Apple-inspired books, including *Jony Ive *and *Inside Steve’s Brain*, unprecedented access to key Apple executives who’ve worked alongside Cook at Apple for decades. As a result, we do finally gain some insight into those early, tumultuous months after Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs died and Cook grabbed the wheel.

Yet there were countless times while reading the book that I wondered how the 58-year-old Cook was feeling — and instead got a one-step-removed observation from someone close to him. Even those comments failed to peel back the layers and only reiterated what most observers already knew. For instance, in describing what it was like for Cook, then Apple’s chief operating officer, to take over for Jobs in 2011, Greg Jozwiak, the company’s vice president of global marketing, said it was “ a daunting challenge” and “it was a significant challenge.” No one would argue the point, but that early quote made it clear that no one at Apple would be serving up any eye-openers.

Kahney traveled to Apple Park in March 2018 and talked to key company executives, including Jozwiak; Deirdre O’Brien, head of human resources; Lisa Jackson, vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives; and former Apple counsel Bruce Sewell. But Cook refused to sit for even one interview with the author. As a result, Apple’s CEO remains a somewhat inscrutable figure.

Through his publisher, Kahney told me, “Although Tim Cook declined to be interviewed, Apple made several executives available for interview who shared their experience and insights on working with Cook. I’m very grateful to the people at Apple who participated in and helped make these interviews possible.”

To fill the Cook gap, Kahney dove into hundreds of articles and multiple interviews spanning his tenure as the CEO of Apple and beyond. Most of it only confirms what we now know about Cook: Where Jobs was an enigma, Cook is a smart, polite, gracious, occasionally funny, and unassuming Southern gentleman with a gift for process and manufacturing.

![](<|image|>)

If you’re looking for revelations, there are none. High drama? Cook is not a high drama sort of guy, a fact the book makes abundantly clear.

Kahney paints an adroit portrait of Cook as a young man in the Deep South and includes his brushes with racism—or at least what he witnessed in his hometown of Robertsdale, Alabama—including the time he came upon a group of hooded Klu Klux Klanners burning a cross on the lawn of an African American family in his neighborhood. It was an image that Cook [once said](&lt;|url|&gt;) “was permanently imprinted in my brain and it would change my life forever.” It’s worth noting that this section of the book offers up the closest thing I could find to controversy. Kahney discovered via a local Facebook group that not all residents believe Cook’s account and have even accused him of lying about it.

The goal of this section, though, is not to stir up a war of collective memories. Instead, Kahney seeks to help the reader (and himself) understand Cook and his current worldview through the prism of his past. It’s often a stretch; even as Cook has spoken about his childhood and the racism he witnessed, he has stopped short of explaining exactly how his motivations and, more important, his personality changed — or didn’t change — over time.

Cook comes across as a man of insight, will, some grit, and ambition, reacting to and acting upon incidents and opportunities. He seems preternaturally formed — I get the feeling that those who knew Cook in his teens would have no trouble recognizing the man he is today. Unlike Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs, which painted a portrait of a shambolic, dirty, somewhat wild genius who wore multiple personas and costumes throughout his lifetime, Kahney’s Cook is always Tim Cook.

Most of the book reads as a straightforward recitation of Cook’s growth as a businessman, manufacturing genius, and leader. It traces his time at Auburn University as he studied industrial engineering, his early work at Reynolds Aluminum, and his first big job at IBM. Cook remained at IBM for more than a dozen years, and if there’s anyplace that could be credited with helping him develop the Cook Way of manufacturing, it’s IBM and its just-in-time product delivery strategy.

In another example of Kahney failing to get beneath the surface, Cook’s decision to leave IBM after a dozen years for the tiny Intelligent Electronics is left opaque.

Cook took two major risks during his life and career. One was leaving the stability of Compaq for Apple in 1998, when the company was still emerging from the doldrums and Jobs was just returning from exile. The other was revealing, three years after he became CEO of Apple, that he is gay.
> # Cook’s early days, weeks, and months as CEO after the death of Steve Jobs are among the book’s most compelling sections.

As the CEO of one of the world’s most important and watched companies, Cook’s decision to reveal his sexual orientation might be considered brave and fraught with risk. In reality, most people in the industry knew, and when Cook [announced it in a 2014 *Bloomberg* post](&lt;|url|&gt;), the reaction was positive, muted, and even lighthearted.

Cook insisted he did not write the essay to garner attention, but rather to help others who are struggling with revealing their sexual orientation, because, as he put it, “people need to hear that being gay is not a limitation.”

While Cook didn’t try to hide being gay at Apple, the book doesn’t offer any insight into how Cook navigated his homosexuality as a young man in a Southern town. In fact, no one Cook went to school with seemed to know about his sexual orientation, and without insight from the man himself, it’s hard to understand exactly how being a young gay man in the South helped shape Cook’s worldview. Kahney also fails to learn if Cook is in a committed relationship or if he has ever considered having children.

Cook’s second major risk—leaving Compaq for Apple—is cobbled together from a variety of recollections Cook shared, including one to me in 2013 at the *AllThingsD* Conference. Yet the book never manages to put you in the room with Jobs and Cook for that first momentous conversation—the one where, as Cook told me, “The honest-to-god truth is, five minutes into the conversation, I’m wanting to join Apple. And I was shocked at this, because it wasn’t how I went into the conversation at all.”

Much of the book is a play-by-play of Cook’s Apple career. It dispels the notion that Cook emerged on the scene in 2009, the first time he stepped in as interim CEO for an ailing Jobs. The reality is that Cook had an impact almost from day one. It was his idea to radically reduce inventories and outsource manufacturing. Even the success of the iMac could be partially credited to Cook, who, in 1998, according to Kahney, booked $100 million worth of air freight in advance, ensuring the on-time holiday delivery of iMacs, while leaving competitors scrambling to find shipping options for their holiday products.
> # Cook once said that he was impressed with Jobs because the Apple founder was someone who had money, but clearly didn’t care about it. What might someone say about Cook?

Cook’s early days, weeks, and months as CEO after the death of Steve Jobs are among the book’s most compelling sections. It is filled with successes, failures, retrenchments, departures, and, yes, even firings — though Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s HR head, manages to avoid using the F-word. She says some people opted out, while others “Tim felt were not the right fit for the team he ended up assembling.”

Kahney doesn’t shy away from the various controversies Cook and Apple have dealt with in the past five years, including Cook’s [protracted battle with the FBI](&lt;|url|&gt;) over the San Bernardino shooter’s locked iPhone. Apple even allowed Bruce Sewell to reveal that Cook “was a little disappointed that we didn’t get a resolution” and that Cook wanted the theories of the case tested in court.

Everything from Foxconn suicides to Apple’s disastrous Maps app is covered. The resolution of the latter is used to illustrate the stark difference between Jobs and Cook. Cook sent out a public apology letter for Apple Maps, noting that Apple’s goal is to make “the best products in the world,” and he promised to “keep working non-stop until Maps lives up to the same incredibly high standard.” While [Jobs also apologized](&lt;|url|&gt;), it was rarely as quick or fulsome.

Cook once said that he was impressed with Jobs because the Apple founder was someone who had money but clearly didn’t care about it. What [might someone say about Cook](&lt;|url|&gt;)? Kahney’s book paints a portrait of someone with tremendous market power who seems uninterested in using that power to amass more power. Instead, Cook is increasingly focused on Apple being a force for good. He has pressed hard for diversity, carbon neutrality, and privacy that benefits Apple’s customers more than it does Apple.

Overall, the book, like its subject, is a product of control. By letting Cook stand just offstage, nodding in approval but never speaking for himself, the book feels incomplete. It delivers a rich tale of executive development and maverick ideas without ever delivering the man himself.<|endoftext|>

# AirPods 2, Reviewed

## A great product gets better with hands-free Siri

![](<|image|>)

It’s no longer necessary to answer the question “[Why AirPods?](&lt;|url|&gt;)” Apple’s wireless earphones are among its most popular — [and important](&lt;|url|&gt;) — products. Apple asserts they are the most popular wireless headphones in the world.

There is, barring a major product misstep, no place to go from here but up, which is why Apple chose a pair of small yet important updates for its second-generation AirPods, or AirPods 2. One is inside the wireless headphones themselves and the other in the floss-container-shaped case.

To start, Apple finally delivered the long-rumored wireless charging case. It looks almost exactly like the original battery case and still holds up to 19 hours of listening charge in it. The only indications that this is a new case are the repositioning of the pairing button to a dead-center spot on the back of the case, a brushed metal hinge (instead of chrome), and, most importantly, the repositioning of the LED charge indicator from inside the case between the AirPod slots to the front of the case.

Checking that LED previously involved opening the case and looking inside. Now, when I place the case on any Qi-based charger, the light either glows amber to indicate it’s charging or green to let me know the case and AirPods are fully charged. That light will also blink white if I hold down the pairing button to connect to a non-iOS device. Even though the case design is mostly unchanged — there’s still a Lightning port on the bottom — there is a two-gram difference in weight, likely due to the wireless charging components. The case will work with original AirPods, and you can [buy it separately for $79](&lt;|url|&gt;).

![The new wireless charging case has the LED charging indicator on the front.](<|image|>)*The new wireless charging case has the LED charging indicator on the front.*

Physically, the AirPods 2 are an exact duplicate of the first AirPods. Like the originals, their design flows smoothly from Apple’s original though often derided EarPods, particularly the pod portions that fit in your ears, nestled snugly behind your tragus. AirPod stems are thicker than those on the EarPods and terminate in chrome rings that look fashionable but are actually used to connect to the charging contacts inside the AirPods case. There is also a trio of extra holes in the AirPod heads to accommodate dual beam-forming microphones. There’s also still a focusing microphone in the center of the chrome ring that helps cut down on background noise during calls. It’s a good design that worked with the original AirPods, and Apple thankfully saw no need to alter it.

![On the back, the pairing button has moved up slightly.](<|image|>)*On the back, the pairing button has moved up slightly.*

As is typical with any half-step update in Apple’s product universe, the major AirPod changes were saved for the components and software.

Apple’s second-generation AirPods feature the all-new H1 chip. With its power management and Bluetooth 5 capabilities, it’s clearly a cousin to the W1 found in the first AirPods. Like the W1, the H1 chip helps provide five hours of music listening time (you get a total of 24 hours with the case) but talk time increases to three hours — roughly 50 percent more than with the original AirPods.

I don’t make and receive a lot of phone calls, and most last just a few minutes or less. However, for the sake of science, I tried to conduct a three-hour phone call. At roughly two-and-a-half hours into the call, I got my first audio alert that the second-generation AirPods were running low on power, but I forged ahead. I got another notification about 15 minutes later. Eventually, the call surpassed three hours, and I hung up, satisfied. I placed the AirPods back in their case, where the display showed the wireless headphones at two percent power.

The connection between the AirPods and my iPhone, by the way, held well for the duration of the call even as I moved up to 25 feet away from the phone. Moving further away caused the sound to break up. Overall call quality was still good, and my call recipients reported that they could hear me clearly even when I was out taking a walk in the wind. I could hear them perfectly as well. Everyone told me they could hear ambient sounds like the wind and birds chirping, but no one complained that they couldn’t understand what I was saying. As I switched back and forth from the old AirPods to the new ones, at least one caller noted a slight audio improvement.

When the AirPods do drain down, 15 minutes inside the case can give another few hours of battery life.

![My three-hour call went just fine.](<|image|>)*My three-hour call went just fine.*

The AirPods 2 setup is painless — an almost nonexistent process. I unboxed the new wireless headphones, placed them next to my iPhone, opened the case lid, and a graphic appeared on the iPhone of both the AirPods and the new case with their charge percentages listed below the spinning photos. After that, I only needed to choose on the iPhone which audio output device I wanted to use. I did that once, and if I continued using the AirPods with that iPhone, it automatically switched to the AirPods as soon as I put them in my ears.

I did have to upgrade all my devices to iOS 12.2 to work with the new AirPods, which then allowed me to test their new device-switching capabilities. As with the original AirPods, adding them to one iOS device adds them to all your other iOS devices as long as they’re on the same account.

I started with the AirPods on my iPhone, then switched to the new iPad Mini 5. Not only did the new AirPods initially pair faster, they switched from one device to another much more quickly. I did a little test with my Apple TV (which also needs an OS update) and found that the new AirPods had a much easier time connecting via Bluetooth to the set-top box.

![The amber light is how you can tell your AirPods and wireless charging case are charging on the Qi-compatible pad.](<|image|>)*The amber light is how you can tell your AirPods and wireless charging case are charging on the Qi-compatible pad.*

The H1 chip also enables hands-free Siri. With the original AirPods, I needed to tap one of them twice to access Apple’s digital assistant. I did this rarely because, for one, I didn’t like the idea of possibly knocking them out of my ears — though they’ve never fallen out — and, two, because it was impossible to activate the touch feedback when I was wearing gloves. The second-gen AirPods let me say, “Hey, Siri,” and state my request without pausing. The request is still being sent to my tethered iPhone, but I don’t have to touch anything or take my iPhone out of my pocket.
> # I need only worry about those who think I’m talking to myself.

With the AirPods 2, I quietly said, “Hey, Siri, what’s the weather?” and I instantly got a weather report. Same with news and music. Siri only requested I unlock my iPhone when I asked to check my email. I enjoyed walking around my neighborhood one chilly spring morning with my hands snugly stuffed inside my pockets as I peppered Siri with one request after another. I used to worry about people thinking I looked weird wearing AirPods, but now, with everyone wearing them, I need only worry about those who think I’m talking to myself.

While I like controlling everything, including volume, with my voice, it would be nice if Apple enabled a few gestures like, say, a sweep up on one AirPod to adjust volume.

![The second-generation AirPods are still a great audio companion for your iPhone.](<|image|>)*The second-generation AirPods are still a great audio companion for your iPhone.*

Apple designed the H1 chip specifically for its headphones, bringing with it a new audio architecture. In general, sound quality across all activities was better — not radically better but noticeable. On music, AirPods have always done a remarkable job of maintaining the clarity of high notes while delivering notable bass for their size. Listening to a variety of musical genres on the new AirPods, I noticed the signature quality was enhanced so that there was a bit more sharpness on the hand claps in Daft Punk’s *Lose Yourself to Dance,* and the sax on Phil Collins’ *One More Night* sounded like it was in the room with me. The lushness of Josh Groban and Barbra’s Streisand’s harmonies on *Somewhere* is, well, lusher with the AirPods 2.

The music can get ear-piercingly loud. I pumped up the volume on Pink’s *Try* and thought my head might explode but noted how the sound still wasn’t distorted.

I also tried out some games on my iPad Mini, including *Asphalt 9*. Again, the improvement on the sound of those hairpin turns and the wheels grinding against road gravel was not huge but definitely noticeable.

![They still look a little silly but still stay in my ears 100 percent of the time.](<|image|>)*They still look a little silly but still stay in my ears 100 percent of the time.*

With Apple’s AirPod improvements comes a price hike. If you want the second generation AirPods with the wireless charging case, it’ll cost you $199 — $40 over the original price. If you don’t mind plugging in your AirPods, you can get the second-generation bundle for $159. If you own the original AirPods but just want that wireless charging goodness, you can, as mentioned, buy the new case for $79.

While I’m not happy Apple is charging so much for the wireless case, I do recommend the full bundle. I bet your original AirPods aren’t holding a charge as well as they used to (mine can do about 40 minutes of talk time) and who wouldn’t want the promise of three hours of talk time, 24 hours of music, and the convenience of putting your case on any Qi charger and sucking that precious battery life? Maybe someday, we’ll even get an Apple AirPower pad to place them on, too.

# Instagram’s Latest Anti-Bullying Moves Still Fall Short

## The image-sharing website announced new tools and policies designed to curb harassment, but users still aren’t safe

![Photo by [NeONBRAND](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Photo by [NeONBRAND](&lt;|url|&gt;) on [Unsplash](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

Earlier this week, Instagram finally announced plans to launch a new anti-bullying feature. In a recent[ blog post](&lt;|url|&gt;), and as reported by the[ BBC](&lt;|url|&gt;), new Instagram head Adam Mosseri said, “We can do more to prevent bullying from happening on Instagram, and we can do more to empower the targets of bullying to stand up for themselves.”

No one could argue with that, but I do have concerns.

One is that this action has been too long coming. The social media network has faced criticisms over its bullying policy for years. The announcement follows renewed pressure to address the issue after British teenager Molly Russell [committed suicide](&lt;|url|&gt;) after using the platform to broadcast her intention to do so. Is what Instagram is proposing too little, too late? A cynical ploy to offset criticism that they didn’t act in time?

My other issue is that, while it’s commendable that Instagram is employing A.I. to recognize content that may be abusive or harmful, implementing a feature that simply asks, “Are you sure you want to post this?” is a lackluster response to a life-and-death issue. It’s the sort of thing I would expect my mobile network provider to ask me before sending a drunken text to an ex at 2 a.m. to spare my blushes the morning after!

Introduced as part of Instagram’s “Rethink” strategy, users are also asked to “Learn More” upon receiving the cautionary notice, and in doing so, they are provided with a message that reads: “We are asking people to rethink comments that seem similar to others that have been reported.” This hardly seems like an adequate warning or response.

Mosseri further explained to the BBC that, “These tools are grounded in a deep understanding of how people bully each other and how they respond to bullying on Instagram, but they’re only two steps on a longer path.”
> # Implementing a feature that simply asks, “Are you sure you want to post this?” is a lackluster response to a life-and-death issue.

Mosseri is right. But Instagram could–and should–do more. Though Instagram is claiming that early tests of the tool have revealed that it “encourages some people to undo their comment and share something less hurtful once they have had a chance to reflect,” the problem is that the user can choose to ignore the message and post the abusive content anyway.

Instagram has claimed that this tool will allow users to manage harassment more easily, without having to block users, which could in turn lead to even more bullying. However, Instagram already has the technology for removing harmful content, as can be seen with its policy on nudity. They even went so far as to remove a post of a painting I once shared of a naked woman! They clearly don’t know art when they see it. Could they not use this technology to recognize abusive or harmful language? They could then actively restrict users’ ability to share this type of content.

Another approach the platform could take would be to give users the option of approving comment requests, as is already possible for direct message requests from users you don’t follow. This would give users more control over the type of content they see, and ultimately protect them from abuse.

This isn’t the first time Instagram has come under fire for how its content may be harmful to its users. The platform is often accused of being the[ worst](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the social media channels for mental health. While this isn’t a viewpoint I agree with, as I stressed in a recent[ blog post](&lt;|url|&gt;), Instagram needs to do more than simply attempt to curb abuse on the network by providing a choice or suggesting we should be nicer to one another. Abuse simply should not be an option.<|endoftext|>

# Why My Job Is Safe From the Robots

## In a world of automation and algorithms, human authenticity will be worth more and more

The saving grace of the approaching robot jobpocalypse might be that nobody, yet, is taking it literally. The regular flare-ups of the “immigrants are taking your jobs” rhetoric has [led to actual hate crimes](&lt;|url|&gt;), but even amidst [exaggeration](&lt;|url|&gt;) around the automation of millions of jobs, no one has yet, to my knowledge, taken a vengeful sledgehammer to a router. Which isn’t to say people aren’t taking the possibility seriously that their careers with be automated out of existence

“My job will be obsolete because of robots within five years,” one software developer friend told me. “Oh, not necessarily…” I started. “It will,” he snapped.

I probably should have changed the subject. Clearly, he was convinced and didn’t want to be burdened with insipid optimism. Instead I told him, “My parents warned me off being a writer because it wasn’t ‘safe’. And it is definitely insecure — but at least it’s safe from robots.”

I should have changed the subject, as it turns out, because this made him even more furious than the possibility his own career would be automated. He told me that my job definitely could be taken by a robot, that there were already robots [producing news pieces](&lt;|url|&gt;) as well as any journalist, and that I was clearly in denial.

“But I write travel pieces and essays and memoirs,” I responded.

“So?”

“So… can a robot write about [finding a loved one dead](&lt;|url|&gt;)?”

“Yes.”

“But it won’t be true. Who would want to read that?”

“You’re just in denial.”

“How can a robot write about learning how to [bake sourdough bread in Spain](&lt;|url|&gt;)?”

“They’ll assemble it from copy provided by the travel company.”

“But…that’s just an advertisement, isn’t it?”

There was a pause, which he broke, quite loudly: “YOU’RE JUST IN DENIAL.”

At that point, I did change the subject.

“Shouldn’t the long term goal of any society be complete unemployment?” the comedian Doug Stanhope [said in 2011](&lt;|url|&gt;). “Where’s the candidate who’s trying to make robots to do all this shit for us?”
> # This is the strange paradox we’re faced with: the societal change that’s coming is entirely at odds with the way we value ourselves.

This was funny, because we actually live in a society where political candidates are constantly running on the promise of job creation. “Haha!” we said. “Robots doing everything for us! What would we be for, in such a society?!”

This is the strange paradox we’re faced with: the societal change that’s coming is entirely at odds with the way we value ourselves. In a capitalist society, people are judged on their ability to work, as well as their actual willingness to work. Indeed, with phrases like, “The devil makes work for idle hands”, not being busy is actively demonized. “Lazy” is an insult; “hardworking” is a compliment; the go to for small talk is, “What do you do?”

According to researchers at the Brookings Institution, my software developer friend is being a bit melodramatic: only [25% of occupations in the U.S. are at “high risk”](&lt;|url|&gt;) for losing jobs to automation in the coming decades.) Those in production, food service and transportation are first in line for job losses. Where will a full quarter of the population go? Where will they locate their worth in a society that is progressing to automation but will still, presumably, cling to the glorification of work, of being busy?

But I swear it is with no smugness at all that I say, at least when it comes to writing: my friend is wrong. Not because a robot will never be able to write as well as me; I have no doubt one day a robot will produce a piece that makes us all laugh and cry. Maybe the damn thing will be able to write about [finding a loved one dead](&lt;|url|&gt;) more evocatively than I did, describe a [descent into agoraphobia](&lt;|url|&gt;) more humorously, or make your [mouth water over sourdough](&lt;|url|&gt;) more acutely. But I’ll still get the commission.

Why? Because when robots can do anything we can, authenticity will be at a premium.

We have versions of this even now. The prefix “hand” on a label often signifies higher prices — think hand-painted, hand-crafted, hand-made — than products churned out by machines. Time, for humans, is precious, so when human time has gone into an item’s production, consumers feel the extra dollars are worth shelling out.

When it comes to writing it’s less the writer’s time you appreciate than the truth of genuine observation or feeling, the window into some fragment of the human condition. Maybe in the future a robot will be able to generate a memoir about how harrowing it is to be lost in a blizzard, or the thrill of rock-climbing in Yosemite, but readers simply won’t be invested if it’s not real. And they would feel cheated if they were deceived, however convincingly.

The truth is, the notion of job security is rapidly changing. We used to be afraid of losing unskilled work to workers who were cheaper or more easily exploited, or skilled work to the, frankly, more skilled. Now, the safest haven might simply be human authenticity and inimitability. I’d love to go back in time to the conversation with my mother as she begged me to study “something safe to fall back on”, and say “Hi, I’m from 2019. Let me explain what ‘safe’ looks like now…”<|endoftext|>

# Computer-Generated Faces Are Getting Real

## Too real, maybe

![Credit: Liyao Xie/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Liyao Xie/Getty Images*

They look like you or me: Off-white teeth, unkempt hair. Worry lines, wrinkles, unfashionable glasses. Overbites. They have familiar smiles, too, — the kinds you find on passports and office ID cards. Intellectually, it’s possible to accept the fact that none of these people exist, that what you’re seeing when you look at these headshots is a minor but notable advance in machine-learning technology courtesy of a graphics company called NVIDIA. But the old paradigm — that a person in a picture is someone who exists or at least did at one point — is tough to abandon. You have to work to dislodge it.

As recently as a few years ago, most A.I.-generated headshots looked like poorly stenciled police sketches, but things have changed. NVIDIA’s [generative adversarial network](&lt;|url|&gt;) — called StyleGAN — uses a deep learning technique called “style transfer,” which disentangles high-level attributes (pores, hair style, face shape, eyeglasses) from stochastic variation (freckles, hair, stubble, pores). “Lifelike” seems inadequate to describe the results: These [completely made-up non-people](&lt;|url|&gt;) are often indistinguishable from the real thing.

The natural response is awe — followed quickly by premonitions of catastrophe. It is not remotely difficult to envision how these GANs might be abused.

When NVIDIA published [its StyleGAN paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) late last year, concerns about its potential applications were tempered by its costs. To generate its faces, the NVIDIA team needed eight prohibitively expensive graphics processors and a full week of A.I. training. Recently, though, they [posted StyleGAN’s code](&lt;|url|&gt;) to GitHub, and last month, a software developer named Philip Wang created the website [thispersondoesnotexist.com](&lt;|url|&gt;), which uses StyleGAN to present a (literally) new face with every browser refresh. [As Wang told *Motherboard](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, “Most people do not understand how good AIs will be at synthesizing images in the future.”

NVIDIA declined to comment for this piece.
> # We have “maybe one or two years” before the kinds of realistic fakes generated by NVIDIA start persuasively moving and talking.

It’s been a little over a year since [deepfakes](&lt;|url|&gt;) exploded into mainstream consciousness and sent ethicists and op-ed writers into a panic. That panic has since subsided into grim resignation: While projected death dates vary, many experts — [though not all](&lt;|url|&gt;) — agree that our sense of a shared, verifiable reality may be on its way to obsolescence.

Hao Li, director of the Vision and Graphics Lab at University of Southern California, tells *OneZero* he gives it “maybe one or two years” before the kinds of realistic fakes generated by NVIDIA start persuasively moving and talking. Eventually, he says, these tools will be “accessible to anyone — and who knows what purpose they’ll put them to.”

Besides the fact that the stock-photo model industry’s days may be numbered — sorry, [*Technology Review *stock hipster](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the mass proliferation of unsourcable but utterly convincing avatars will deepen the crisis in online dating, where the tech illiterate are routinely [drained of savings](&lt;|url|&gt;) by savvy scammers who use fake profile images. But what’s more concerning than a boost in catfishing is the possibility that StyleGAN could also hinder bot-detection efforts.

Aviv Ovadya, the Thoughtful Technology Project founder whose work focuses on understanding and mitigating the “misinformation ecosystem,” tells *OneZero* that “if you’re trying to identify whether some accounts are bots, one of the common strategies is to reverse-image search [their avatars] because it’s usually an image that’s been used by someone else.” But StyleGAN effectively eliminates this option.

A recent micro-controversy illustrates some of the perils. Late last month, Twitter user ElleOhHell — a semi-popular joke writer — revealed that [he was a man](&lt;|url|&gt;), though his profile presented a female user. He’d spent the preceding half-decade posing as the woman in his profile pictures, who turned out to be his wife. She was in on it, he says, so he could use her pictures without fear of a callout or a damning reverse-image search — maybe the only things stopping people with far worse intentions than ElleOhHell from masking their identity or fooling people with constructed ones.
> # “Do we feel differently about it when it’s a white man creating a character that is a black woman or a Latina woman?”

No one seems to have been harmed by ElleOhHell’s Twitter deceptions. Yet even with mostly benign intentions, things can get dicey. Victoria Schwartz, a law professor at Pepperdine University who researches virtual influencers like the computer-generated Instagram celebrity Lil’ Mikaela, brings up the sadly current issue of blackface.

“Do we feel differently about it when it’s a white man creating a character that is a black woman or a Latina woman?” she tells *OneZero*. “Ethically, we start to have some concerns.”

And as Ramesh Srinivasan, director of the University of California at Los Angeles’ Digital Culture Lab, points out, this technology could entrench a culturally narrow idea of what a person is supposed to look like. “What’s considered human is always going to represent the biases of the world outside that technology,” Srinivasan noted.

Not every critic is ready to ring the alarm bells, however. “There’s no doubt that fake content can be weaponized, and we’re seeing that with deepfakes,” says Eric Goldman, co-director of the High Tech Institute at Santa Clara University. “But what’s the difference between a realistic fake and a fictional character in a movie?”

For much of the last decade, Mark Zuckerberg and company have worked tirelessly to de-fictionalize the internet: the insistence on real names, the retroactively disastrous integration with virtually every website and app, and increasingly pervasive and precise facial recognition. The powers that be have won that battle. Very few people at this point view their social media profiles as anything other than an extension of their actual self. An easy-to-use, accessible spin on StyleGAN might lead to some interesting conceptual art projects (mock yearbooks filled with people who don’t exist or elaborate, interconnected social media webs of unreal friends, families, and pets), but it probably wouldn’t lead the average Facebook user to toy with a new identity.

But the world of persuasively realistic moving and talking fakes that USC’s Li says are a year or two away — where someone could inhabit an infinite number of GAN-generated bodysuits — could conceivably loosen things up a bit. Maybe it would bring back some of the polymorphic, identity-dissolving spirit of the internet-that-was-and-could-have-been, the one where [no one knows you’re a dog](&lt;|url|&gt;). This was part of the promise and appeal of Second Life and virtual reality: the chance to be a different person or persons to ping between personas and expand your sense of the possible.

Last month, NVIDIA’s head of machine learning Anima Anandkumar [came down on one side](&lt;|url|&gt;) of a heated debate in the world of A.I. The dispute was incited by the decision of OpenAI, Elon Musk’s A.I. nonprofit, to hold back an [innovative text-generation tool](&lt;|url|&gt;) it had developed, citing concerns that bad actors might use it to automate fake news.

One side of this debate holds, roughly, that all the research be released because it’s ultimately good for the advancement of global well-being. The other side says let’s take a second and make sure we’re not inadvertently empowering malevolent actors or hastening a digital apocalypse. Anandkumar is on the former side, albeit with a reasonable-seeming defense: Withholding research results could, [she told the *Verge](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, “put academics at a disadvantage.”

Will StyleGAN, adapted and expanded, put thousands of stock-photo models on welfare? Abet the spread of fake news about Hillary Clinton’s toddler brothel? Break the hearts of scores of credulous widowers and shut-ins? We can’t know. The problem, according to Ovadya, is that NVIDIA doesn’t know and doesn’t seem compelled to find out either.

“In an ideal world,” he says, “there would be some connection between the people who could be harmed by this research and the people who are moving this research forward.” He added that he doesn’t think we have “the structures in place, as a society and a research community, to facilitate that conversation” or to make an “informed decision about what to release and what not to release.”

It’s left to us — those poor souls who not only look real but also, tragically, are real — to sort out the consequences.<|endoftext|>

# Are We at Risk for a Space Arms Race?

## The Pentagon’s space-based missile defense plans could escalate tensions with rival space powers

![Illustration: [Victor Moatti](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Victor Moatti](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

On March 27, India tested its first anti-satellite weapon, an interceptor missile that blew up an Indian military satellite in space. The test put India in an exclusive club of nations — including the U.S., Russia, and China — that are building the capacity to shoot down both missiles and satellites. And the other members of the club aren’t happy.

On April 1, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine criticized India’s test, angry that the resulting debris may have reached the orbit of the International Space Station and other satellites.

“That is a terrible, terrible thing, to create an event that sends debris in an apogee that goes above the International Space Station,” Bridenstine said at a town hall meeting that was livestreamed on NASA TV. “And that kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight that we need to see happen.”

Yet the future of human spaceflight looks increasingly militarized. The Department of Defense has declared its own plans to attach missile-detecting sensors on satellites, and more menacingly, to seriously consider building interceptors that could be deployed in space. If Congress approves new funding for these projects, the technology could encourage rivals to ratchet up their own space weapon capabilities, triggering an arms race that could make orbital wars with lasers and satellites a reality.

“Even putting a few interceptors in space under the guise of a test would be very provocative, because they would be potent anti-satellite weapons and would create significant tensions” with Russia and China, says Laura Grego, a California Institute of Technology-trained physicist and senior scientist at the [Union of Concerned Scientists](&lt;|url|&gt;).

The Pentagon’s first Missile Defense Review of the Trump administration, [released earlier this year](&lt;|url|&gt;), calls for a networked layer of sensors in orbit that would spot missile launches from anywhere on Earth and monitor them from “birth to death.” That’s a tall order. A satellite passing over North Korea, for example, would be hurtling around the opposite end of the planet 12 hours later. To have global coverage, the U.S. might need hundreds of satellites, each equipped with high-resolution sensors, likely adding up to a cost of tens of billions of dollars. But as George Lewis, a Cornell University physicist and missile defense expert, notes, “There’s a question of how useful that is.”

Lewis points out that the U.S. is already bulking up much less expensive radar sensor systems on the ground, which can monitor ostensible ballistic missile threats from North Korea or Iran. And for both kinds of tracking systems, on the ground and in space, the technology is not especially discerning: Any object appears as a single pixel, making it tough to distinguish between a warhead and a decoy. Still, the sensors in space may have a better chance following more advanced hypersonic missiles from Russia or China, which travel at five times the speed of sound.

Sensors can’t stop a missile, though. That’s where the desire to have a layer of interceptors in orbit comes in.

A missile’s trajectory resembles that of a giant javelin thrust into the sky. Interceptors launched from the ground can only take aim at a missile in the middle of its course because of the time it takes to reach it. By then it may have already released multiple warheads or countermeasures like decoys. If the Pentagon’s proposed project comes to fruition, the space interceptors could take out missiles a couple of minutes after launch, during their “boost phase.” But to be effective, the U.S. would need hundreds of interceptors, likely costing hundreds of billions of dollars — easily the most expensive military weapons project ever.

What the Pentagon is proposing harkens back to the controversial “Star Wars program,” which President Reagan advocated for in 1983, during some of the darkest days of the Cold War. That program poured money into ambitious and outlandish concepts, like lasers and particle beams fired from space that would destroy ballistic missiles midflight.

Yet President Trump seemingly wants to bring those ideas back, by studying, and even testing, a “neutral particle beam.” That’s a high-energy beam of uncharged atoms that wouldn’t get redirected by Earth’s magnetic field when fired in space. Imagine a constellation of laser-equipped satellites, ready to hover into position and fire at a moment’s notice.

“I think the idea is, these neutral particle beams could penetrate inside a nuclear warhead or launching missile and then essentially fry their electronics,” Grego says. But the technology hasn’t changed much since the ’80s, and these weapons would be enormously expensive as well.
> # “Yes it’ll be an arms race, yes it’ll be expensive, but at the end of the day, it will give us military advantage.”

Even if it were feasible, however, deploying any interceptors in space would disrupt the nuclear balance between the U.S., Russia, and China. It might not violate international law, since the [Outer Space Treaty](&lt;|url|&gt;) only prohibits weapons of mass destruction in space, but allies and adversaries alike would still see these weapons as endangering space security.

That’s in part because satellites could end up being the targets of these orbital weapons. “If you have any systems that have any prospect of being effective against long-range ballistic missiles, they will perforce have a significant capability as anti-satellite weapons,” says James N. Miller, senior fellow at Harvard’s[ Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](&lt;|url|&gt;) and former under secretary of defense for policy under President Obama. “They’re generally easier targets.”

National intelligence experts say Russia and China are also working on new anti-satellite weapons. “It would not be correct to say that the U.S. would be the first one introducing weapons in space, but we’d be taking it to a fundamentally new level if we were to deploy hundreds of interceptors,” Miller says.

It likely wouldn’t take long for Russia and China to follow suit with their own space weapon arsenals. And if they see their nuclear capabilities undermined, they may upgrade their nuclear delivery systems to shield their circuitry from laser fire. These developments would make the U.S. — which is more dependent on its now-vulnerable satellites than any other country — even less secure.

If a weapon targeted a satellite, it could develop a situation like the Cuban Missile Crisis in space, with each side threatening to destroy others’ satellites, and putting communications and navigation at risk. If it sparked into a firefight, the U.S. would have more to lose.

Surely Pentagon officials realize this, right? Yet they don’t appear to approve of the uneasy stability of “mutually assured destruction” — another Cold War idea. “Some have confidence that the U.S. will, in the end, prevail,” says Miller. “Yes it’ll be an arms race, yes it’ll be expensive, but at the end of the day, it will give us military advantage.”

Miller [urges a moratorium](&lt;|url|&gt;) on deploying space weapons, arguing that Russia and China should join the U.S. on a path to arms control.

Otherwise, we’ll be just one missile or laser away from space war.<|endoftext|>

# Don’t Put Your Work Email on Your Personal Phone

## Don’t Put Your Work Email on Your Personal Phone

### Mobile Device Management potentially gives your company the ability to spy on your location, your web browsing, and more

![Credit: Klaus Vedfelt/DigitalVision/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Klaus Vedfelt/DigitalVision/Getty*

Many of us have given up on the idea of carrying around a dedicated work phone. After all, why bother when you can get everything you need on your personal smartphone?

Here’s one reason: Your work account might be spying on you in the background.

When you add a work email address to your phone, you’ll likely be asked to install something called a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile. Chances are, you’ll blindly accept it. (What other choice do you have?) MDM is set up by your company’s IT department to reach inside your phone in the background, allowing them to ensure your device is secure, know where it is, and remotely erase your data if the phone is stolen.

From your company’s perspective, there are obvious security reasons for installing an MDM on an employee’s phone. But for employees, it’s difficult to tell what these invisible profiles are collecting behind the scenes, as they provide people at your company with invisible control over your device. That’s why when it comes to your phone, no matter how much you trust your IT department, it’s a good idea to keep work and pleasure separate.

## **Peering into your life**

MDM profiles, paired with device management tools, allow companies to track employee phones in a single dashboard. They can mitigate security breaches or potential harm from a rogue employee; if you work for a law firm, say, and your boss worries you’re leaking sensitive emails from your smartphone, they could remotely wipe your data. MDM profiles can also force you to use a long password on your device, rather than a simple PIN, among other policies.

Until the iPhone debuted over a decade ago and brought smartphones to the masses, it was common practice for companies to issue a corporate BlackBerry or Palm Pilot, allowing their employees to check email on the go, and do more work.

When the iPhone arrived, employees suddenly wanted to use their slick, new phones at the office, not the chunky, work-provided one with the physical keyboard. They added their work emails to their smartphone if they could, or devised sneaky workarounds to gain access to it.

MDM functionality was around before this shift, but with the smartphone boom, it became a core part of IT policy. Companies were happy to let employees access their email on their own devices, which saved the cost of buying separate work phones and data plans, but it also meant that individuals who accepted the arrangement lost control over their sensitive data.
> # These tools blindly assume that the IT department and management are trustworthy and infallible, and they seem not to consider whether an abuser might have direct access to them.

In many cases, MDM gives companies the ability to track your location and install a corporate VPN. This means they can route your traffic through a network the company owns — and if they own that network, the company can monitor traffic on it, providing a one-way mirror into your life, with no way to peer back.

Some third-party MDM tools relate all of this to worker productivity. [Hexnode](&lt;|url|&gt;), for example, markets its tool by saying that “employee performance can be evaluated by monitoring the location report of these devices” and that “the duration of time spent on a particular location gives an overall idea about their performance.” [Sound familiar?](&lt;|url|&gt;)

Technically, iOS and Android don’t allow tracking location data without a user’s consent. But third-party solutions can circumvent this by forcing you to install an app that performs the tracking itself when you add a corporate email address to your device.

These tools often allow administrators to pry into how the phone is used as well, retrieving call logs, SMS history, and in the most extreme cases, full logs of web browsing. You might reasonably expect this kind of monitoring on a dedicated work device, but perhaps not on your personal phone. Once your work email and MDM is installed, however, the two are essentially the same thing.

## **Do you trust your admin?**

A bad actor in the IT department could abuse their access to track employee location, or peer into the private lives of people without them ever knowing it is happening. There’s essentially no way for you to see who has access to your data, or whether or not it’s been viewed. Only the administrator has access to the logs that would show this, despite it being information about a device that you own.

Last year, the *New York Times* wrote about [how the internet of things](&lt;|url|&gt;) has enabled domestic abuse, and there are many parallels in how little consideration corporate IT tools give to the safety of users being subjected to their surveillance. You probably sort of understand that your boss can access your email — albeit only with genuine cause — but how about tracking your every move, on demand?

These tools blindly assume that the IT department and management are trustworthy and infallible, and they seem not to consider whether an abuser might have direct access to them, or how these tools may be used to harass someone within the company.

So, it’s a good idea to pause as you’re adding a work email to your device, and it prompts you for the installation of an MDM profile. How can you be sure there are proper controls in place to stop someone from exploiting access to your device?

On Android, there are tools that help prevent IT from reaching into your phone. If it’s allowed by your admin, you can create a separate “work” profile that contains sandboxed versions of your apps to avoid blurring the line between personal and work. The work profile can then be disabled on demand and flipped back on only when you need it, providing a level of control that iOS doesn’t yet allow.

For iOS users, if an app is required to be installed with your work email, flip off location access in the settings to cut it off from GPS, or consider adding a “restriction” via parental controls that doesn’t allow it to start in the first place.

Personally, I would prefer to keep work off of my personal phone altogether. The most powerful thing you can do to protect yourself in the first place might mean keeping your work email off your own phone and demanding a work-provided one. At least nowadays it won’t be a Palm Pilot.<|endoftext|>

# Why Agritech Is Israel’s Next Big Import

## The small country’s agriculture solutions are spreading its tech-sector influence

![Drip irrigation in the Sharon Valley, near Netanya, Israel. Credit: Dan Porges/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Drip irrigation in the Sharon Valley, near Netanya, Israel. Credit: Dan Porges/Getty Images*

ISRAEL — The train ride from Jaffa to Jerusalem passes through fields of grapes, lettuce, tomatoes, olives, and bananas. In many ways, these fields are a miracle.

As the Dead Sea evaporates and the Jordan River dwindles, Israel — a desert country of 8.7 million and smaller than the state of New Hampshire — has been forced to get creative around water efficiency. More than half of Israel’s usable water is man-made from desalinated seawater, and 86% of its wastewater is treated and reused.

Israel has survived as a modern nation — and as a startup hub — in part because the country created a revolutionary irrigation system in the 1960s that would become the world standard for efficient and high-tech agriculture. Necessity is the mother of invention, and the concept of “drip” irrigation exemplifies that maxim. Drip irrigation is an efficient way to slowly distribute water directly to a plant’s root system through a network of pipes or valves either from above or buried below the soil.

This minimizes evaporation, and in resource poor environments, like Israel, it can conserve water and increase efficiency. “The situation in Israel is 60% arid desert, the rest is semi-arid,” says Naty Barak, the chief sustainability officer of Netafim, the drip irrigation firm that now controls a third of the field’s global market.

Born out of the kibbutz collective farm system, Netafim now operates in 110 countries and employs a process the company claims achieves as much as 97% efficiency in delivering water to the photosynthetic process. That cuts water waste, but it does more. “You boost yields,” says Barak. “Big time.”
> # “I came here to become a farmer after the army. I didn’t think I would end up being an industrialist.”

Netafim, which paved the way for today’s agritech upstarts, is the brainchild of Simcha Blass, the inventor of drip irrigation. When he was in his early twenties, in the 1960s, Barak worked with Blass back on the kibbutz, watching history unfold in the desert. “[Blass] carried water from the Sea of Galilee in the north to agriculture fields in the south,” says Barak. “When we met, he was quite frustrated that no one believed him that drip irrigation could work. Realizing water is going to be a challenge for Israel. We didn’t think about California, India, or sub-Saharan Africa [places that also suffer from a lack of water]. We always thought about Israel.”

Today, the firm irrigates thousands of farms worldwide and is worth around $2 billion. “I came here to become a farmer after the army,” says Barak. “I didn’t think I would end up being an industrialist.”

Agriculture accounts for [as much as 70%](&lt;|url|&gt;) of global water use, most of which goes to irrigation, and water is quickly becoming an imperiled resource. Today, a third of the world’s biggest groundwater stores are in danger of drying out. Israel, though, never had much choice but to innovate, notes Barak. Climate, location, and a slew of unfriendly neighbors all forced the country to grow much of its own food and not wait for the help of the rest of the world.

Israel’s agritech sector now comprises 500 companies, many of them new, which have raised over $170 million in funding since 2017 — more than competitors in far larger farming nations like Brazil and Australia. Agriculture and food tech startups [received over $10 billion](&lt;|url|&gt;) in investments last year globally, up 29% from 2016, and a significant proportion is going to Israel.

This month, [Taranis](&lt;|url|&gt;) — a four-year-old Tel Aviv startup whose drones monitor fields and diagnose nutrient problems, plant disease, and insect infestations in farms in the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and Australia — closed a [$20 million investment round](&lt;|url|&gt;). There’s also Sufresca, a Jerusalem-based firm that [creates edible coatings](&lt;|url|&gt;) for fruits and veggies to lengthen shelf life. Armenta is another Israeli agritech player that [treats sick dairy cows without antibiotics](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [Beewise](&lt;|url|&gt;), located just a stone’s throw from the Galilee Sea, automates hive maintenance via machine learning. [WeedOUT](&lt;|url|&gt;), which makes a biological herbicide, won the 2018 [AgriVest prize](&lt;|url|&gt;) last September at Israel’s premier agritech investment event.

There’s also major support from abroad. In February, the Israeli A.I. firm [Prospera Technologies teamed up with Valmont Industries](&lt;|url|&gt;) on a three-year, $40 million autonomous pest control and [crop nutrition and management venture](&lt;|url|&gt;).

The project plans to not only advise farmers on how best to achieve optimal yields but hopes to be capable of automatically administering them in real time. Prospera now claims it can surpass the industry standard — ahem, Netafim — to better protect natural resources and cut cultivation costs. Data analytics might not be much of a draw for old-school farmers lacking smartphones, but big savings and bigger yields will certainly be a message understood loud and clear.

A similar deal between John Deere and [Farm Dog](&lt;|url|&gt;) was recently announced to develop variable rate sprays for disease and pest management, a partnership that Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said would “lead farm production into the future.”

In January, Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. signed an agreement to supply drones to Brazil’s Santos Lab as a way to improve large scale precision agriculture. The [first foray into the agriculture market for the Israeli company](&lt;|url|&gt;) is estimated to be a more than $100 million deal. Last October, China’s vice president Wang Qishan toured Israeli agri-parks, which have been popping up across China, as well as Ethiopia, India, Greece, and Panama after similar state visits. In late 2017, China signed a [$300 million “‘clean tech” deal](&lt;|url|&gt;) to import and white-label Israeli agricultural tech.

“They look at Israel as a startup hub,” says Netafim’s Barak. Why? Barak says it’s a combination of many factors, but the fact that young people in Israel undergo military service is one of the greatest. “It’s [about] taking young people and giving them responsibilities and trusting them with millions of dollars on R&D and commanding units and tech.”

Many Israeli companies were founded by former Israeli Defense Force (IDF) military members. It helps that such startups are able to develop pricey equipment and software in [state-sponsored labs](&lt;|url|&gt;). The army’s prestigious [8200 cybersecurity unit is also considered a de facto incubator](&lt;|url|&gt;) for many startups.

Beyond the IDF, there’s also [university incubator](&lt;|url|&gt;) support[ ](&lt;|url|&gt;)and deep-pocketed programs like the joint [Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Foundation](&lt;|url|&gt;)**.** BIRD was established in 1977 by both governments in the hopes of promoting collaborative technology and funding major R&D projects. Israel gets access to bigger markets, and the U.S. gets to increase its competitive edge by gaining cost-effective innovation capabilities.

The project is far from altruistic: BIRD [only funds 50%](&lt;|url|&gt;) of research and development for each partner. And the big caveat is that compensation only consists of what’s needed to bring projects to completion; plus funded firms are expected to give back what was given once they’ve achieved profitability. To date, that means $109 million in repayments.

[BIRD has invested](&lt;|url|&gt;) nearly $354 million in 982 projects since the 1970s, with cumulative sales exceeding $10 billion. “Fifteen percent of our funding goes to agritech,” says Maya Vardi Shoshani, BIRD’s West Coast director of business development.

That investment translates to over 32 projects in the agricultural sector, including a recent partnership between [Juganu](&lt;|url|&gt;) of Rosh Haayin and [AeroFarms](&lt;|url|&gt;) of Newark, two companies that have collaborated to develop a smart LED fixture for automated horticulture.

BIRD takes no board seats, no IP ownership, and no long-term financial interests. It’s a novel concept in the wolfish world of venture capital. It also doesn’t just fund startups — it funds established companies, too. In 2016, the IAI, the company that supplies drones to Brazilian farms, [won a $900,000 BIRD award with Honeywell](&lt;|url|&gt;) to develop a civilian-focused unmanned aerial vehicle. Not all funding is environmentally focused, but if you tally energy, water, life sciences, and agritech, it’s over half of all BIRD projects.

“When we choose projects to fund, our main goal is to find innovation,” says Shoshani. “Israel is known for water technologies. We see the social impact value of agritech in feeding the world and making food more accessible.”

It may sound like hot air, but for a country of its size to have the funding it does, it’s clear the claim could hold weight. “I’m sure we will see this trend growing,” says Shoshani.<|endoftext|>

# Trump Restrictions on Fetal Tissue Research Deals a Blow to Medical Science

## A new federal policy tied to anti-abortion politics will hamper potentially groundbreaking work

Aitor Aguirre, a biomedical engineer at Michigan State University, has held a heart from a human fetus in his hands.

Aguirre studies congenital heart disease, which affects 1% of babies born in the United States every year, making it the most common type of birth defect. Though he usually conducts experiments on human stem cells and in mice, he sometimes needs fetal heart tissue to confirm his findings. Aguirre knows where that comes from: elective abortions. And he knows that he’s only able to get this tissue after someone has made a deeply personal and possibly difficult decision.

“Working with fetal tissue is not the easiest thing in the world,” he says. “I don’t think anyone does this kind of science for fun.”

Fetal tissue, which refers to any tissue or organ obtained from a fetus, has been used in medical research in the United States since the 1930s. It’s used to study birth defects, HIV, vision problems, brain disorders, the Zika virus, and more. Cell lines grown from fetal tissue were vital in the production of the first polio vaccines.
> # “We use fetal tissue if we can obtain it. In reality, it’s the only way that we can validate whether our findings are real or not.”

But almost as long as it has been part of medical science, fetal tissue research has been controversial in the United States because of its connection to abortion and to Planned Parenthood, which along with other clinics, supplies such tissue to biotech companies or tissue banks that in turn provide it to researchers. Under a [1993 law](&lt;|url|&gt;), these providers cannot profit from the sale of fetal tissue itself, but they can charge for transporting, processing, or storing it.

Now the work of scientists like Aguirre could be upended by a new Trump administration policy, [announced last month](&lt;|url|&gt;) by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which ends some federally funded research that involves fetal tissue from elective abortions and puts stringent restrictions on the rest. The new policy eliminates all research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — the chief federal body on medical research — that uses fetal tissue from elective abortions. NIH scientists can use up the material they currently have, but are not allowed to acquire any new tissue. NIH-funded research at universities and other organizations that involves fetal tissue from elective abortions will also come under additional scrutiny. Investigators proposing new grants or seeking grant renewals that use this tissue will be subject to additional oversight. That process will include an ethics advisory board that will review each grant proposal and make recommendations about whether NIH should fund them. The HHS secretary — currently Trump-appointee Alex Azar — will have final say in whether projects get funding.

The move [pleased the anti-abortion groups](&lt;|url|&gt;) that have been staunch in their support of President Donald Trump. “Embryos, or aborted fetuses in this case, are human beings and we should protect their dignity,” says Paige Comstock Cunningham, executive director of the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity, a Christian research center based at Trinity International University in Illinois.
> # Many abortion opponents, like Cunningham, say they are not opposed to all research uses of fetal tissue — just when it is obtained from elective abortions.

But scientists say that the new policy puts vital medical work at jeopardy and could lead to a brain drain of researchers leaving the U.S. to pursue their projects elsewhere. Federally-funded research that involves fetal tissue is already strictly regulated. For instance, a pregnant woman seeking an abortion must give written permission when donating fetal tissue to research, and that consent process must happen at a separate time after the woman consents to the abortion procedure. Consent forms must clearly state what the tissue will be used for, and researchers may have no contact with donors. Universities also have their own institutional review boards, which evaluate proposed research studies to ensure that they’re ethical.

Scientists say an extra layer of review on top of existing laws will be redundant and could slow down vital medical research, especially since the new ethical advisory boards will have up to six months to make funding recommendations. Each ethics board will have 14 to 20 people from various backgrounds on it, including at least one attorney, one ethicist, one physician, and one theologian. Between one-third and one-half of the board must be scientists.

As the biggest public funder of biomedical research in the world, NIH currently supports around 200 projects that involve fetal tissue, and spent an estimated $115 million on fetal tissue research in 2018 out of a total budget of $26.9 billion. Any change in its funding methodology will have a major impact on medical research in the U.S.

“We have no idea what’s going to happen,” says Larry Goldstein, a professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of California, San Diego. “If it’s a lopsided board that opposes fetal tissue research, it could be disastrous.”

## **Uses of fetal tissue**

Cells taken from fetal tissue are valuable to researchers because they grow more rapidly and are more flexible than adult cells, and they allow scientists to study early biological development, including organ formation. For example, Aguirre studies the origins of congenital heart disease. There are some genetic drivers of these heart defects, but in many instances, the causes are unknown. Scientists suspect that environmental factors like pollutants and diet are at play.

Since perfectly healthy women and men with no history of congenital heart disease can have children with congenital heart problems, it’s difficult to predict which babies will have it. Aguirre’s team is trying to find clues that could point to which newborns will be most at risk. His lab uses induced pluripotent stem cells — adult cells that have been reprogrammed to an embryonic-like state — to recreate early human heart development in a petri dish. He also uses mice to study how the fetal heart develops during pregnancy.

But these models can only go so far. “There is a moment when you discover something in human stem cells, and in the mouse, where you need to validate whether it’s something that really happens in a human embryo or not,” Aguirre says. “In those cases, we use fetal tissue if we can obtain it. In reality, it’s the only way that we can validate whether our findings are real or not.”

These types of validation studies account for much of the need for fetal tissue in scientific research. It’s also used to study brain and eye development and to test the toxicity of drugs used by pregnant women. Other scientists use fetal tissue to make so-called humanized mice so they can study the body’s response to HIV and other viruses and test potential therapies. From fetal tissue, they derive stem cells, which are then implanted into mice without a working immune system. These mice then express some human genes and are able to produce human immune cells.

Alexander Ploss, a molecular biologist at Princeton University, employs these mice to study human viruses like hepatitis, dengue, and yellow fever because most animals used in lab research aren’t affected by these pathogens. Ploss and his team take blood-forming stem cells from the fetal liver to create their mouse models. “Outside a petri dish, you cannot easily study these infections in animal models,” he says. Ploss’ work is funded by NIH, so his research could be affected by the new ethics board process.

## **A ripple effect**

Though the new policy will only directly affect 12 funded studies within NIH, Dr. M. Elizabeth Ross, director of the Center for Neurogenetics at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, argues that even a handful of halted experiments could hinder further research since they’ll never be finished, and thus the results of those studies will never be published.

“We learn from each other with our published data,” says Ross. “When the field is prevented from studying human tissue directly, we lack information to compare our research in other models to the human endpoint. It has a ripple effect, throughout all biomedical research, when we don’t know whether the systems we’re simulating are really relevant.”
> # “We have no idea what’s going to happen.”

Roxana Moslehi, a genetic epidemiologist at the State University of New York at Albany, has used placental tissue to study genetic risks of certain pregnancy complications, such as premature birth and preeclampsia, a potentially dangerous type of high blood pressure. In order to identify the biological mechanisms and specific molecular pathways involved in such conditions, Moslehi needs to look at gene expression patterns in the placentas of affected and unaffected pregnancies. The ultimate goal of her research, she says, is to find clues that could be translated into treatments or preventive measures for these conditions.

At delivery, the placenta is classified as maternal tissue, but in the case of a miscarriage or termination of pregnancy, the placenta is considered fetal tissue, and therefore subject to the new regulations. Moslehi’s lab was planning to apply for extramural NIH funding to continue this work, but since it would require using placentas from early and mid-gestation fetuses, she’s not sure if she will go forward. It’s also unclear whether one of her collaborators, an NIH scientist, will be able to continue working with Moslehi’s team under the new regulations.

Cunningham, from the Christian Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity, says there are “plenty of private funds” available for fetal tissue research, including pharmaceutical or biotech companies, private foundations, and patient advocacy organizations. But private funding sources may pose their own problems. They may not have the same ethical guidelines as NIH-funded research, and privately-funded research may be used to advocate for a given cause or agenda.

“If you keep the private funds out of this, you can maintain greater control and greater oversight over the use of such materials,” Ploss says. “With NIH grants, there are a lot of checkboxes you have to fill. In that sense, I think it’s better for this to happen under a more controlled setting.”

Aguirre and Moslehi say that if it becomes prohibitive to do such research in the United States, some scientists might decide to move their work to countries that have more lenient regulations around fetal tissue. (Some American scientists [left the U.S.](&lt;|url|&gt;) for similar reasons when the George W. Bush administration restricted stem cell research.) Aguirre, who is originally from Spain, says he’ll consider moving to Europe if a wider ban is implemented, as some news reports [have suggested](&lt;|url|&gt;) may be possible.

## **Alternatives**

Many abortion opponents, like Cunningham, say they are not opposed to all research uses of fetal tissue — just when it is obtained from elective abortions. She says there are ethical sources of fetal tissue, which include tissue from miscarriages and stillbirths.

But miscarriages rarely happen in a hospital or doctor’s office, making them an unreliable source of fetal tissue. For miscarriages that happen early in pregnancy, there might not be enough or any tissue available for researchers to work with, Ploss says. And since many miscarriages result from genetic or other developmental abnormalities in the fetus, the tissue might not be suitable for research at all.

In December, NIH announced [$20 million in funding](&lt;|url|&gt;) for research on alternative models that do not rely on human fetal tissue from elective abortions. But while hopeful substitutes are being developed, scientists say they’re not yet advanced enough to completely replace fetal tissue. One proposed alternative is induced pluripotent stem cells, which are derived from adult blood or skin cells and mimic embryonic stem cells. They’re seen as a more ethical alternative because they don’t involve embryos or fetal tissue. But it’s difficult to make these cells, and they don’t always work. And scientists still need to compare these cells to the real ones found in fetal tissue to make sure they can use them for a side-by-side comparison.

Organoids, which are tiny, 3D organ-like structures, are also being explored as a possible substitute for fetal tissue. They have been used to study diseases and test drugs but raise [new ethical questions](&lt;|url|&gt;) of their own.

Ploss says he thinks the new round of funding for alternative models is a good idea, but that fetal tissue should still be available to researchers who need it.

At a time when a number of states have imposed stricter laws on abortions, fetal tissue research is likely to remain controversial. But scientists like Ploss who work with fetal tissue don’t do it because they like it — they do it because it offers them the best way possible to discover medical answers that we all need. “Until we have those alternatives, we need to leave this on the table and have it as an option.”<|endoftext|>

# The Answer to the A.I. Jobs Apocalypse Is All About Geography

## The spread of intelligence machines will worsen geographic inequality, unless we take proactive measures

![Credit: Freder/E+/Getty](<|image|>)*Credit: Freder/E+/Getty*

Historically, the worst times for labor have been those characterized by both worker-replacing technological change and slow productivity growth. If A.I. technologies turn out to be as brilliant as some of us think, we can expect some workers to see their incomes vanish in the process — even as new jobs are created elsewhere in the economy. That is what has happened in recent years, and it is also what happened during the most tumultuous years of industrialization.

If current trends continue in the coming years, the divide between the automation winners and losers will become even wider. And there are good reasons to think that it will. Looking at the automatability of existing jobs, we have seen that most occupations that require a college degree remain hard to automate, while many unskilled jobs — like those of cashiers, food preparers, call center agents, and truck drivers — seem set to vanish, though how soon is highly uncertain. But there are also unskilled jobs that remain outside the realms of A.I. Many in-person service jobs that center on complex social interactions — like those of fitness trainers, hairstylists, concierges, and massage therapists — will remain safe from automation.

Computers have created jobs for software engineers and programmers, which in turn have raised the demand for in-person service jobs in the places where they work and live. Thus, where skilled jobs are abundant, the unskilled earn better wages, too. In San Jose, California, fitness trainers and aerobics instructors made $57,230 on average in 2017. In Flint, Michigan, they averaged $35,550 annually. Of course, direct comparisons are complicated by a variety of factors. It is true that the cost of living in the Bay Area is higher than it is in Flint. But it is just as true that amenities are more plentiful, health outcomes and public services are better, and crime rates are lower.
> # Removing barriers to the expansion and development of skilled cities would help social mobility.

Automation then represents a double whammy. Where machines have replaced middle-class workers, the demand for local services has also suffered. Looking forward, even if new and improved substitutes for face-to-face interactions are developed, they cannot substitute for spontaneous encounters that require physical proximity. The value of proximity will probably increase as A.I. makes production more skill intensive. Thus, the curse of geography is likely to intensify.

Historically, migration was the mechanism by which cities adjusted to trade and technology shocks. Workers moved to areas where new industries, spawned by the Second Industrial Revolution, created an abundance of well-paying, semiskilled manufacturing jobs. But migration is no longer the equalizer it once was. The unskilled have become less likely to migrate since the dawn of the computer revolution. One reason might be financial. Even if skilled cities provide better employment opportunities, moving is an investment that requires liquidity up front.

Thus, as Enrico Moretti has convincingly argued, there is a case for subsidizing relocation. Mobility vouchers could pay for themselves by shifting the unemployed into paid employment elsewhere, while serving to equalize incomes across space. Some will argue that mobility vouchers might serve to accelerate the exodus from communities in decline, leaving parts of America in an even more dire state, but those who stayed put would likely benefit in terms of having a better chance of finding a job.

Another dilemma is that as skilled cities are becoming more attractive, rising housing prices makes them less affordable. To counteract this, the housing supply must be expanded where new jobs are being created. This will require getting rid of some zoning restrictions, such as minimum lot sizes, height limits, prohibitions on multifamily housing, lengthy permitting processes, and so on, which effectively cap the number of people who can live in thriving places. Because dynamic places like New York and the Bay Area have adopted stringent restrictions on new housing supply, they have effectively limited the number of workers who can participate in the growth created by tech industries. The consequence has been that tech companies find it more difficult to hire due to the rising cost of housing. But more importantly still, an unemployed unskilled worker in Flint who finds a job in Boston cannot afford to live there.

Economists have estimated that in the absence of zoning restrictions on housing supply, the American economy would be 9% larger today, which would mean an additional $6,775 in annual income for the average American worker. Abolishing land-use restrictions would also have welcome side effects. The breathtaking rise in wealth inequality that has been documented by Thomas Piketty stems almost entirely from housing. Inflated house prices due to land-use restrictions are surely part of the reason, and the abolition of those restrictions must therefore be part of the solution.

Removing barriers to the expansion and development of skilled cities would help social mobility, too. Because zoning restrictions are not distributed randomly but are much more prevalent in high-income cities and neighborhoods, they put people born into less affluent communities at a further disadvantage. Zoning, in other words, has priced lower-income families out of the places with more social capital and better schools.

Another benefit would be more innovation. Children growing up in places with more inventors, who are thus more exposed to innovation in their early years, are much more likely to become inventors themselves. This, we know, also has an impact on the types of inventions that they are likely to produce. Those growing up in Silicon Valley are more likely to drive innovation in computing, while those who spend their early years in places specializing in medical devices, like Minneapolis, for example, are more likely to invent related technologies.

Some readers might still think that we are entering a new era in which machines take all of the jobs, and of course, there is no way of knowing if that is true. But for now, our current trajectories suggest that the challenges ahead lie in the area of political economy, not in technology. In a world where technology creates few jobs and enormous wealth, the challenge is a distributional one. The bottom line is that regardless of what the future of technology holds, it is up to us to shape its economic and societal impact.

# Tech Companies Don’t Need PACs to Dominate Politics

## How Apple and other companies strong-arm policy and why that matters

![Credit: ifixit](<|image|>)*Credit: ifixit*

*Nathan Proctor is director of the [Right to Repair Campaign](&lt;|url|&gt;) for U.S. PIRG, an advocacy organization.*

I work on Right to Repair, a campaign that aims to encourage companies such as Apple to provide customers with parts, service information, and repair software — so we can fix the gadgets we own.

When manufacturers don’t let anyone else have access to the parts, tools, software, and information needed to fix things, it creates a monopoly around certain repair procedures, driving up costs for customers. When it’s expensive to repair an electronic product, people are more likely to throw older devices away and buy new ones. The goal of Right to Repair is to pass state laws that break open these repair monopolies, and give people more repair options to reduce cost and waste.
> # From where I sit, Apple has an incredibly outsized role in American politics.

Unfortunately, Right to Repair is not a popular idea with manufacturers, including Apple, because it is much easier to make a profit for their shareholders by selling more new products than it is helping their customers repair or otherwise extend the useful life of their “old” products. I’m reminded of this every day as I do my work in the face of their fierce opposition.

From where I sit, Apple has an incredibly outsized role in American politics. But, recently, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook argued that they aren’t much involved.

“[We do not focus on politics,](&lt;|url|&gt;)” Cook said on April 23 at the *Time* 100 event. “Apple doesn’t have a PAC… Apple is probably the only large company [without one].”

As reporters quickly pointed out, Cook was playing coy about Apple’s political clout. It might not have a political action committee that spends directly on elections, but it invested a whopping[ $6.68 million on federal lobbying in 2018](&lt;|url|&gt;), according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That’s less than tech companies like Facebook and Google, but it still represents a major outlay — and Apple spends even more in[ state lobbying](&lt;|url|&gt;). Electronics manufacturers, as an industry, ranked third in federal lobbyist spending in [2018 at $146.6 million](&lt;|url|&gt;), after pharma and insurance.

All of that lobbying helps block common sense reforms like Right to Repair.

I was in Sacramento to support the Right to Repair effort there, and so were lobbyists representing Apple’s interests, [including one who worked for Apple itself, as* Motherboard *reported.](&lt;|url|&gt;) Apple’s lobbyist, who the *Verge* identified as [Rod Diridon, Jr.](&lt;|url|&gt;), was demonstrating all the ways that repairing an iPhone could harm the consumer or damage the device. Those presentations were designed to convince lawmakers to oppose Right to Repair.

As a result of that last-minute lobbying, the California Assembly pulled the bill from its committee hearing, putting our effort there on ice for the rest of the year. *Vice*’s Jason Koebler [reported](&lt;|url|&gt;) that “lobbyists said that if improperly disassembled, consumers who are trying to fix their own iPhone could hurt themselves by puncturing the lithium-ion battery.” While there are risks involved in repairing anything, including batteries, these are risks consumers seem to navigate fine on their own. Taking a peek at the[ iFixit guide for an iPhone 6 battery swap](&lt;|url|&gt;), for example, shows that more than 2 million people have viewed the guide, indicating that a lot of people do this repair without known incidents. People also replace car batteries, which I would argue are more dangerous than cellphone batteries.

Even if there are special risks from batteries, wouldn’t that risk be reduced by access to official repair documentation, which Right to Repair would require? It would seem that these safety arguments are simply meant to scare lawmakers.

It shouldn’t be a surprise that Apple spends large sums lobbying. It reported to shareholders that increased[ battery replacements hurt iPhone sales last year](&lt;|url|&gt;). Apple’s job — like any other company — is to deliver value to those shareholders, even if doing so means increasing electronic waste and the overconsumption of our natural resources.

Companies tend to[ spend a lot more](&lt;|url|&gt;) on lobbying than they spend on PACs. For example, Google has a PAC that spent[ $2.2 million](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2018, but Alphabet, Google’s parent company, budgets more than [10 times that](&lt;|url|&gt;) for lobbying. Many companies lobby against Right to Repair as well. We looked at the lobbyist disclosure records in New York state last year, and found that[ companies worth a combined $2.5 trillion](&lt;|url|&gt;) are registered to lobby on Right to Repair, including AT&T, Caterpillar, Medtronic, Verizon, and Apple. Moreover, that lobbying money can connect to campaign contributions indirectly.

That’s because lobbying access and political contributions are related. Some academics argue that “the [opportunity to lobby is largely contingent on campaign donations](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

If a lobbyist gives the biggest donations to the greatest number of state candidates and provides revenue for the party in power, that can help ensure that legislators will take the lobbyist’s phone calls and meet with them in person. Sometimes those are direct contributions. Other times, lobbyists recruit people to donate to the candidate, often by hosting a fundraising event. All of this helps those lobbyists have “access.”

Because the Right to Repair campaign focuses on state legislation, I spend a lot of time lining up supporters in states across the country. When I show up in a state capital — say Albany in New York — with my scrappy band of tinkerers, repair shop owners, STEM teachers, and environmental advocates, every office we go into has already heard from Apple’s hired guns.
> # My role as a “citizen-powered” advocate, supported by U.S. PIRG’s small donor members, is to counter the power that special interest lobbyists exert on our political system.

Apple usually hires a top-dollar lobbying firm in each state. On top of those direct client-firm relationships, Apple and other manufacturers are also represented [by trade associations](&lt;|url|&gt;), such as CompTIA and the Consumer Technology Association, which lobby for those same interests.

How does a lobbying firm become the most sought-after and expensive? Generally, the most expensive lobbying firms have the best access.

I’ve seen the flip side of this: Legislative leaders often won’t meet with us despite overwhelming public support. The coalition representing Right to Repair struggled to schedule meetings with lawmakers in Sacramento, but it seems, given the *Vice* and *Verge* reporting, Apple did not have the same difficulties.

While Apple might not have written checks to the politicians in Albany, Sacramento, or other state capitals, its lobbying has a big impact, and helps increase the role of money in politics through the donations from lobbyists.

Nor is it just Apple. Microsoft specifically targeted Right to Repair legislation in [Washington state, and is generally credited for killing the bill](&lt;|url|&gt;).

My role as a “citizen-powered” advocate, supported by [U.S. PIRG](&lt;|url|&gt;)’s small donor members, is to counter the power that special interest lobbyists exert on our political system. We like to say there are two kinds of power: organized money and organized people. My job is to help organize, and speak up for, the people.

We know the money is already organized, and Apple, Microsoft, and Google are all political. And so are banks, the oil industry, cellphone carriers, appliance manufacturers and more.

If you don’t want Apple or anyone else deciding when you fix your phone, and what kind of energy powers your house, or any other issue that is important to you, you need to be political, too.

Here’s one way to start: Speak up for your [Right to Repair](&lt;|url|&gt;).<|endoftext|>

# The Ultimate Guide to ‘Fantastic Beasts 2’

## The Ultimate Guide to ‘Fantastic Beasts 2’

### Answers to all your questions about the mess that is ‘*The Crimes of Grindelwald’*

![Photo: Carlos Alvares/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Carlos Alvares/Getty*

Were you one of the millions of people who saw the much-anticipated, Harry Potter–adjacent *Fantastic Beasts 2: The Crimes of Grindelwald* this past week? Were you confused by it? Maybe even a little irritated? Are you interested in knowing what happens but don’t want to sit through the movie’s nonsense? Don’t worry! I have all the answers for you right here. (This should go without saying, but yes, massive spoilers ahead.)

### **Can you briefly summarize the movie?**

A bunch of wizards run maniacally around Paris until Johnny Depp gives a TED Talk.

### **Okay, how about a longer version?**

Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), the teen Obscurial who can turn into a deadly ball of black mist, has gone to Paris in the hopes of finding his real mother. Grindelwald, now in full-time Johnny Depp mode after briefly being Colin Farrell in the first film, escapes from magic jail by killing a bunch of people, then heads to Paris with an unnecessarily dramatic scheme to get Credence to join him.

### **Why is Grindelwald so hot to trot to get Credence on his team?**

Because he believes the Obscurial is the only person who can defeat Dumbledore, who is the only wizard who can stop Grindelwald from his plan of conquering the nonmagical world.
> # Welcome to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, the beloved kids’ franchise where babies are in constant mortal danger!

### **Okay, let’s simplify things even more. What’s Newt Scamander up to?**

Noted fantastic beast–lover Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) has been guilted by young Dumbledore (Jude Law) into breaking the law and going to Paris to find Credence before Grindelwald does. This is illegal, because Newt has been banned from international travel after he and his fantastic beasts nearly exposed the secret world of wizards and witches to the general public approximately 18 billion times in the first movie because he couldn’t get around to fixing his damn suitcase. He brings the same suitcase to Paris, of course.

### **How do the other main American characters from ‘*Fantastic Beasts 1’* get involved? Because they’re back too, right?**

They are indeed. Tina the Auror (Katharine Waterston) has gone to Paris to track down Credence herself. Newt’s nonmagical pal Jacob (Dan Folger) and Tina’s sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) visit Newt in London before he leaves for Paris.

### **Hey, wait. Didn’t Jacob get his mind obliviated in the last movie? He shouldn’t know anything about magic or wizards anymore, yes?**

Yes and no; yes because that was the intention of the Obliviate spell, which has been used throughout the world to keep nonmagical humans from knowing about magic, but it’s explained that Obliviate erases only *bad* memories, and most of what Jacob experienced in the first movie was good, so he never forgot it. This seems to me to be a huge liability for the spell and a problem that should have come up in the many centuries wizards have been hiding from humans prior to 1927, when the movie takes place.

### **I have to agree.**

Anyways, the sweet, dimwitted Queenie has enchanted Jacob, so he has no control over his thoughts, feelings, or actions.

### **That seems problematic.**

It’s so creepy. She cast a love spell on him and dragged him to England, where it’s legal for wizards to marry Muggles. Her plan is to marry him and have a big family… all while he can’t consent.

### **Oh my god. Did Queenie do this because Jacob doesn’t love her anymore?**

Not at all. Jacob explains in the movie that he does love her, but since it’s illegal for wizards to cohabit with humans in the United States, he wasn’t going to endanger her by doing so. Queenie decided to take matters into her own hands.

### **Wouldn’t coming to England fix both of their problems, no enchantment required?**

It would! Except that Jacob *is* the teensiest bit upset at being enchanted — he’s not horrified or traumatized, but he is exasperated enough to call the situation Queenie has put them into crazy, which offends her so much that she storms off to Paris to find her sister Tina.

### **Let me get this straight. Her plan was to marry and presumably be impregnated by Jacob without giving him a choice, and *she’s* the one who gets upset?**

Right-o. Anyway, Newt and Jacob head to Paris to find Credence and Queenie. They’re eventually followed by Newt’s brother Theseus (Callum Turner) and Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz), who are engaged. Theseus is an Auror, so he’s come to capture Grindelwald, while Leta searches for a dark family secret that she, uh, already knows.

### **This seems like it’s getting a bit overcomplicated.**

We’ve barely begun. Pretty much everyone in the movie seems to think that Credence is really Corvus Lestrange, Leta’s half-brother, who was taken to New York City and given up for adoption.

### **Well, at least that seems straightforward.**

It’s not, although it would have been helpful if all the people who think this had told the main characters, because it would save everybody a lot of time. Most of this movie is about people trying to find proof that Credence is Corvus, despite the fact that pretty much everyone is already convinced he’s Corvus anyway. They just need notarized paperwork, apparently.

### **What does it mean if Credence turns out to be a Lestrange?**

Funny you should ask! Absolutely nothing.

### **Wait, what?**

Credence cares about learning who his parents are, understandably, but for Newt and Tina, the issue should be that Credence is a massively powerful, deadly Obscurial who can’t be allowed to connect with the most evil wizard in the world. And all the time Newt and Tina spend trying to confirm that Credence is Leta’s half-brother is meaningless. Actually, most of the movie is kind of meaningless.

### **What do you mean?**

I mean characters do lots of things, but very little of it moves the story forward. Significant chunks of the film are devoted to Queenie trying to find Tina and failing, Jacob trying to find Queenie and failing, and Newt trying to find Tina and succeeding, but this involves lengthy scenes with a new character named Yusuf (William Nadylam), who has made an Unbreakable Vow to kill Corvus Lestrange. While this sounds like it might be important, let me assure you that Yusuf doesn’t end up mattering to the plot in the slightest. Really, most of this movie is just killing time until the dramatic final act.

### **Can we skip to that?**

Sure, but there are a few things you need to know first: 1) Grindelwald secretly frustrates Credence’s search for truth, then hands him a map to the Lestrange family tombs, where he can find out his real name; 2) Queenie ends up getting taken to Grindelwald’s house; and 3) Grindelwald also announces that he’s holding a big rally in Paris, coincidentally right next to the Lestrange family tomb, so people can hear his message. Oh, and 4) Credence isn’t Corvus Lestrange anyway, so it was all an enormous waste of time.

### **WAIT, WHAT?**

Yeah, Leta reveals this to all the protagonists, including Credence, when they coincidentally meet at the same time in the Lestrange tomb. Okay, there’s no simple way to explain this, but I’ll try. As previously mentioned, Corvus Sr. decided to give his kids Leta and newborn infant Corvus Jr. to an orphanage in New York City because he is a monster. (Seriously, the movie makes it explicitly clear that Corvus Sr. magically enslaved and impregnated Leta’s mom, and it’s just the grossest.) On the kids’ trip across the Atlantic, Leta is so traumatized by her baby brother’s crying that she swaps Corvus Jr. for another random baby. Almost immediately, their ship sinks, and while Lela and Fake Corvus Jr. survived, Real Corvus Jr. very much did not.

### **Is… is this one of those things where it seems like the baby died, but it’ll be revealed later that he was rescued?**

Last shot of the baby is about 10 feet below sea level, sinking like a stone, as a woman frantically swims to reach him.

### **So there’s a chance —**

She’s way too far away. Dead baby.

### **What the hell?!**

Welcome to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, the beloved kids’ franchise where babies are in constant mortal danger!

### **Then who is Credence?**

We’ll get there in a second. It turns out that not only did everyone meet next to Grindelwald’s rally, and not only did they meet at the same time Grindelwald’s rally started, but they also met right next to a secret door that opens directly into the rally!

### **[Smacks head in frustration.]**

This has all been been an impossibly elaborate trap by Grindelwald… somehow… that everyone immediately and knowingly walks into. And then it’s time for that TED Talk, which you might be surprised to learn is nearly standing room only, as hundreds of non-plot-relevant wizards and witches thoughtfully wait to hear Grindelwald’s message.

### **Isn’t his message just “kill all Muggles”?**

Not exactly. As he tells the crowd, he just wants wizards to be able to live in the open, alongside the Muggles — with the side benefit that then Wizards love who they want, which is why Queenie gets into it.

### **Isn’t Grindelwald a criminal?**

Big time. That’s why he was imprisoned after *Fantastic Beasts 1*. In fact, the Harry Potter wiki says he and his followers “committed mass slaughter” across Europe for many years before the first movie began. Also, the movie is called *The Crimes of Grindelwald*, which is probably a clue.

### **Then why are any of these people listening to him?**

Well, mostly because the story requires it, but also because J.K. Rowling cast “Metaphorio” over the whole damn movie, as Grindelwald’s demagoguery feeds into some wizard prejudices against Muggles and/or their beliefs that wizards are more valuable than those without magic powers. Does this sound like something that could have some resonance in the real, non-Wizarding World of Regular People?

### **If you weren’t an internet column, I would punch you so hard right now.**

You’re not the first person to say that to me, and you won’t be the last. Back to the story: Grindelwald gets the crowd riled up against the Aurors there to capture him, one lady tries to attack one and gets killed, everyone’s upset, and Grindelwald calmly tells all of his new followers (which now include a few of the Aurors) except the main characters to teleport themselves away.

### **What do you mean?**

I mean the movie wants to give Queenie her own special scene… because she’s decided to join Grindelwald. Take your time processing that.

### **Okay. Queenie wants to be allowed to marry Jacob so badly that she abandons Jacob to go with a mass murderer even though she could literally zip back to England and get married in about half a day?**

Yup. Oh, and Leta sacrifices herself for no discernible good. And then, later, Grindelwald finally tells Credence his real name: Aurelius Dumbledore.

### **Well, that’s definitely interesting. What’s the story there?**

We don’t know.

### **They’re obviously saving it for a future movie.**

Sure, but it makes no damn sense. While a super-secret Dumbledore brother that no one, including Jude Law/Dumbledore, knows about is strange, it also seems completely impossible based on the canonical Wizarding World timeline. When Credence is born in 1908, Dumbledore’s mom had been dead for nine years, and his father had already been imprisoned in Azkaban — wizard jail, if you don’t remember — for 18 years, and he stayed there until he died.

### **Well, this movie sounds like a total mess.**

Hey, did I mention the other dead baby?

### **[Makes strangling noise.]**

I guess not. When Grindelwald picks a home in Paris, his crew murders the couple who lives there, and then a few minutes later, they find a baby. Grindelwald stares at it, tells one of his minions to take care of it, and the door closes before we visibly see the murder, but we do hear the magic that murders it.

So that’s two dead babies.

### **Are there even any Fantastic Beasts in this stupid movie?**

Well, there are a few beasts. Their fantasticness is debatable.<|endoftext|>

# Samsung’s Galaxy Fold Is a New Path Forward for Smartphones

## Damn you, Galaxy Fold, don’t make me want you

![](<|image|>)

I thought I didn’t want a folding phone. Now I’m not so sure.

My first cell phones were of the flip variety. You might even call them folding phones. They usually hid a keyboard and 2.3-inch screen inside a clamshell design. Some of them had a second, tiny screen on the outside that often showed me the caller’s number. These were good phones, until something better came along.

I’m now perfectly content with my single-screen slab phone, which offers a large, rigid display and ample power. Why would I want to backslide to the folding era?

After spending some time with the first viable folding screen smartphone, Samsung’s Galaxy Fold ($1,980), I’m open to rethinking my stance.

![The Samsung Galaxy Fold’s 4.6-inch screen does not cover the whole front.](<|image|>)*The Samsung Galaxy Fold’s 4.6-inch screen does not cover the whole front.*

Samsung’s dual screen device surprised me. Folded, it’s much narrower than I anticipated, which makes the external 4.6-inch dynamic AMOLED screen (720x1680) operational with just one hand. I found that I could easily reach from edge to edge and from top to bottom of the small screen — granted, though, I have large hands and long fingers).

![This is one big viewfinder.](<|image|>)*This is one big viewfinder.*

On the back is virtually the same triple-camera configuration (16MP ultra-wide camera, 12MP wide-angle camera, and a 12MP telephoto camera) as you’ll find on the Samsung Galaxy S10+. On the inside, carved out of a small, somewhat trapezoidal space in the upper right-hand corner, is a 10 MP selfie camera and an 8MP depth camera. I didn’t have enough time to test all these lenses, but I think it’s safe to assume they’ll perform similarly to those on the S10+.

![This camera configuration is definitely reminiscent of the Galaxy S10+](<|image|>)*This camera configuration is definitely reminiscent of the Galaxy S10+*

At 263 grams, the Galaxy Fold is heavier than the 6.4-inch Galaxy S10+ (175 grams), but it doesn’t feel like a brick. Folded and unfolded, it is surprisingly comfortable to hold. Obviously, the Galaxy Fold is roughly twice as thick as say, a Galaxy S10, but that’s what happens when you essentially fold a full-thickness phone in half.

![The sides fold together into a sort of wedge, with a little gap in between to accommodate the flexible screen’s curve.](<|image|>)*The sides fold together into a sort of wedge, with a little gap in between to accommodate the flexible screen’s curve.*

If you were hoping for a phone that folds its flexible display perfectly flat, the Galaxy Fold will disappoint you. There is a small gap at the hinge to accommodate a tiny flexible screen curve. I can live with it since I know there’s no way Samsung could make a folding screen capable of sustaining 200,000 folds with a sharply folded edge in the middle.

Samsung’s hinge mechanism is an impressive piece of engineering and branding. When folded, the Galaxy Fold’s half-inch thick, chrome hinge is wide enough to accommodate the word “Samsung.” Unfolded, the hinge somehow slips away inside the body, allowing the front and back of the fold to meet neatly in the middle.

![It’s amazing the way this big hinge just slips away into the device.](<|image|>)*It’s amazing the way this big hinge just slips away into the device.*

I was able to unfold the phone with one hand, which revealed the 7.3-inch (2152x1536), tablet-sized display. Unlike the screen on the outside, there’s no glass on this flexible, dynamic AMOLED screen. Samsung developed a special polymer for the display, which apparently needs a raised bezel running around the edge to hold it in place. If you’re accustomed to phone and tablet displays with perfectly flat bezels, this might throw you a little bit, but I almost didn’t notice it was there. Overall, the display looks fantastic, but from certain angles I could discern (and feel) the slightest wave in the center of the display. It did not impact how anything looked on the screen.

![There’s the Bixby/Fingerprint reader combo button.](<|image|>)*There’s the Bixby/Fingerprint reader combo button.*

As much as I liked the large Android display, it’s not the reason, at least alone, that I think the Galaxy Fold has some potential.

What impressed me most in my relatively brief time with the device is how Samsung made two screens into one continuous system. The Galaxy Fold is a $1,980 two-for-one-device that also manages to combine the two distinct screens into one cohesive system.

![Yes, it’s basically a real Android tablet tucked inside this phone.](<|image|>)*Yes, it’s basically a real Android tablet tucked inside this phone.*

App activities like maps that you start on the smaller 4.6-inch screen automatically appear on the larger screen as soon as you unfold the phone. And if you adjust the settings, you can have apps start on the large screen and continue to the smaller one when you fold the phone. As I did this a few times, primarily with Google Maps, I marveled at the smooth transition between screens. It’s a little like those old folded maps we kept in our glove compartments. The small screen is when you have just a small portion of the folded map showing and the large screen is when you unfurl the map, but without all the fuss of trying manage all that giant, unwieldy paper.

![The rear screen goes dark when you unfold the phone.](<|image|>)*The rear screen goes dark when you unfold the phone.*

Of course, if you hand me a big screen, I expect tablet functionality. I watched as a Samsung rep showed me how to separate the screen into three separate apps (chrome, calendar and maps), and then added a handful of additional app windows (up to five) that I could drag freely around the screen.

With the device folded, I launched the rear camera, using the 4.6-inch screen as a viewfinder. Then I unfolded the phone and it automatically switched the viewfinder to the 7.3-inch display. I didn’t even have to reorient the screen and device.

You do not have to unfold Galaxy Fold to use it. The external display functions as a complete touch-screen Android smartphone. Yes, the screen is small and narrow, but how much screen real estate do you need for email, texts, and scanning social media?

I examined the gold edges of the Galaxy Fold, noting the lack of a 3.5 mm headphone jack (it ships with Galaxy Buds), and existence of the fingerprint-reader/Bixby combo button. I hit that button more than a few times, accidentally launching Bixby, which I immediately exited. The phone even ships with a nifty two-piece Galaxy Fold case.

Samsung promises that the unusual dual-battery configuration (they split the battery between the two chassis halves) provides all-day battery life, but, for now, I have no way of testing their claims. It also supports wireless charging and Wireless PowerShare. Inside the phone is a 7nm 64-bit octa-core Processor. Sorry, but there wasn’t time to run benchmark tests or, this being an international model, test out network connectivity.

![The 7.3-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen is almost as large as the one on an iPad Mini.](<|image|>)*The 7.3-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen is almost as large as the one on an iPad Mini.*

As I placed the Samsung Galaxy Fold back in its box, I realized that I could no longer dismiss the folding phone concept as both retrograde and a desperate cry for attention. This felt, instead, like a third way: there’s the slab, the old-school flip, and this new path: two screens, one purpose and, maybe, all the flexibility you need.

# The Least Imaginative Holiday Gift Is the One Everyone Will Be Getting

## The Least Imaginative Holiday Gift Is the One Everyone Will Be Getting

### *When everything’s a screen, where’s the fun in shopping?*

![Credit: manaemedia/iStock/Getty Images Plus](<|image|>)*Credit: manaemedia/iStock/Getty Images Plus*

Tech companies are asking one big question this holiday season: Which screen do you want to unwrap?

There is a banality to the would-be gadget gifts introduced in 2018. So many of them are large, flat panes of glass, dark and featureless until you power them up. It makes you long for the days of a Lionel Train marking its circuitous route around the Christmas tree.

We’re surrounded by screens, though that [hasn’t reduced our demand for them](&lt;|url|&gt;), and for good reason: they improve products and make life more convenient. But too much of a good thing can be boring — or worse. Just as we’ve reached peak screen, companies like Apple are introducing features to protect us from their addictive qualities, complicating our relationship with them all the more.

We can blame, to some extent, Amazon, Google, Lenovo, and Facebook, which all think the answer to our prayers is yet another screen situated in the heart of our homes. Last year, the tiny Alexa-hosting Echo Dot was[ Amazon’s best-selling holiday gift](&lt;|url|&gt;)[.](&lt;|url|&gt;) Smart speakers alone weren’t enough. This year, we have Alexa’s latest big-screen device, the 10-inch Echo Show, which sits on a table and facilitates video calls; Google Assistant’s new screen crib, the 7-inch Google Hub, provides you with cooking videos and voice-activated information; Lenovo’s 8- or 10-inch Smart Display does all of the above; and there’s the [controversial](&lt;|url|&gt;) Facebook Portal, a brand-new tablet fused to a smart speaker that follows you around a room during video chats.

Always-listening systems, ever-ready with a smart answer or witty reply, could only get us so far, it seems: Companies needed displays to add visual flair to every utterance, and cameras through which to see the world.

For a time, technology, production yields, and cost held tech companies back from adding screens to everything. Early smartwatches had almost unreadable, low-resolution displays. Thin, high-resolution OLED screens were usually no larger than 15- or 20-inches diagonally, because companies couldn’t manufacturer larger panels without imperfections. It was expensive to build large display panels that they could cut up into a multitude of perfect smaller displays. That’s no longer the case.

Display technology as an art is nearing Renaissance levels. If screens are relatively easy and cheap to produce, why *not* put them everywhere?
> # I have nothing against screens, obviously, but it strikes me as a failure of imagination if every wrapped gift under the tree looks like it was modeled on the package next to it.

Adding screens to smart speakers makes them more useful (consider all those follow-along video recipes) and more like all the other gifts we consider giving this holiday season. There are the phones and the tablets and the laptops and the watches and the fitness bands and the refrigerators with screens. Not to mention the TVs.

Behind those screens, the technology is more varied, but it often lives inside similar packages.

If you’re not giving someone a smart slab for the holidays, you might hand them a wearable circle or square, or a smart “wedge,” which is the prevailing design for most intelligent-assistant-hosting smart-screen devices.

I have nothing against screens, obviously, but it strikes me as a failure of imagination if every wrapped gift under the tree looks like it was modeled on the package next to it. It reminds me a little of the heyday of CDs. I used to try everything to disguise the dull, square, tell-tale shape.

Even the gifts that don’t have displays rely heavily on screens for operation. Everything from robots and drones to smart home security cameras and video game consoles aren’t complete without your phone or TV.

This points to an interesting convergence on a core product idea. Tech companies build screens to engage us, while more traditional companies build products to engage our screens. The latter understands that most of us will be staring at our phones, tablets, watches, and TVs anyway, so they need to digitize some portion of their product functionality. Consider connected pillows, meat thermometers, voice-commandable microwaves, and refrigerators that are just as adept at displaying a local weather forecast as they are at making ice.

Meanwhile, tech companies have started to make a very real effort to pull us away from those screens. And while some might mock these initiatives as disingenuous, it’s clear that the shift is coming from the top.

Apple CEO Tim Cook [admitted to spending too much time](&lt;|url|&gt;) with his screens. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos is [pouring money into Montessori-style](&lt;|url|&gt;) schools that, if he follows their model, will be screen-free environments. Google CEO Sundar Pichai [limits his family’s TV time](&lt;|url|&gt;). Mark Zuckerberg says spending less time on Facebook is “[a good thing](&lt;|url|&gt;).”

What’s more, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and others have paid more than lip service to this endeavor, with built-in utilities that not only tell us how much time we spend staring at our screens, but can proactively block us from spending more time in general or with specific apps.

It’s hard to reconcile the reduced screen time development efforts with this display proliferation. One side is driven by what I believe is real societal concern; the other, a business imperative to sell more and more products. These public companies have to keep selling products and the products that sell best are the ones that feature or connect to screens.

People will get a lot of screens as gifts; I’ve given my share. But this holiday season, as even the tech companies encourage us to reduce our screen time, it might be a good idea shift our gaze from the latest glossy pane to our family and friends.<|endoftext|>

# Facebook Insists No Security ‘Backdoor’ Is Planned for WhatsApp

## The company is fighting back against rumors that it would scan messages on users’ phones prior to encryption

![Photo: SOPA Images/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: SOPA Images/Getty Images*

Billions of people use the messaging tool WhatsApp, which added end-to-end encryption for every form of communication available on its platform back in 2016. This ensures that conversations between users and their contacts — whether they occur via text or voice calls — are private, inaccessible even to the company itself.

But several recent posts published to *Forbes*’ blogging platform call WhatsApp’s future security into question. The posts, which were written by contributor Kalev Leetaru, allege that Facebook, WhatsApp’s parent company, plans to detect abuse by implementing a feature to scan messages directly on people’s phones before they are encrypted. The posts gained significant attention: A [blog post by technologist Bruce Schneier](&lt;|url|&gt;) rehashing one of the *Forbes *posts has the headline “Facebook Plans on Backdooring WhatsApp.”

It is a claim Facebook unequivocally denies.
> # “To be crystal clear, we have not done this, have zero plans to do so, and if we ever did, it would be quite obvious and detectable that we had done it.”

“We haven’t added a backdoor to WhatsApp,” Will Cathcart, WhatsApp’s vice president of product management, wrote in a statement provided to *OneZero *and previously [posted to Hacker News](&lt;|url|&gt;).“To be crystal clear, we have not done this, have zero plans to do so, and if we ever did, it would be quite obvious and detectable that we had done it. We understand the serious concerns this type of approach would raise, which is why we are opposed to it.”

WhatsApp is one of the most scrutinized apps in the world, a Facebook spokesman told *OneZero *in a phone call, adding that any kind of backdoors would be immediately obvious to the security community. There are many security experts looking at WhatsApp on a regular basis, he added.

Although the app is not open-source, security researchers can download the Android application package (APK) and use third-party tools to get readable Java code back, or they can extract the binary code for the iPhone versions and use debuggers (such as IDA Pro) to try to understand how it works.

“I’m sure people are constantly looking at reverse engineering it,” says cryptographer Steve Weis, a fellow at the Aspen Tech Policy Hub and former software engineer at Facebook. “Generally you can assume that people are poking around the binaries.”

While it’s certainly possible for any end-to-end encrypted app to backdoor its own code, doing so without people being able to figure out what’s happening would be extremely difficult.


The accusation leveled against Facebook is that the company plans to embed content moderation and blacklist filtering algorithms directly onto users’ mobile devices, scanning Messenger and WhatsApp messages before and after they are encrypted. The [post](&lt;|url|&gt;) by Leetaru points to potential future scenarios where the vast majority of phones would include this type of scanning, rendering encryption meaningless.

“Facebook’s model entirely bypasses the encryption debate by globalizing the current practice of compromising devices by building those encryption bypasses directly into the communication clients themselves and deploying what amounts to machine-based wiretaps to billions of users at once,” Leetaru writes, adding that this would “create a framework for governments to outsource their mass surveillance directly to social media companies.”

How did the rumor start? It has to do with the blogging platform itself and an unrelated presentation detailing potential ways to automate content moderation efforts on social platforms.

*Forbes* does not typically review blog posts by its contributors, who are not staff writers for the publication. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about this. (Disclosure: I was a *Forbes* contributor myself from July 2015 to January 2017.)

Though Leetaru originally stated in his post that a Facebook spokesperson declined to comment, Facebook tells *OneZero *this was not the case and that it gave Leetaru “[background](&lt;|url|&gt;)” information: context meant to inform an article without being quoted directly.

Reached via email, Leetaru stated that Facebook “did not dispute the characterization and pointed to [Facebook CEO Mark] Zuckerberg’s March blog post calling for precisely such filtering.” The [post in question](&lt;|url|&gt;), “A Privacy-Focused Vision for Social Networking,” lists a plan for making Facebook more private by focusing on encrypted and ephemeral communication. Although the post states that Facebook might detect “patterns of activity or through other means, even when we can’t see the content of the messages” across apps, it does not specifically refer to client-side filtering of WhatsApp messages or private messaging. In other words, there’s no suggestion from Zuckerberg’s writing that a system is being developed to read user messages.

Following the references in Leetaru’s post led to [another post](&lt;|url|&gt;) of his about an alleged WhatsApp backdoor. That post [linked to a video](&lt;|url|&gt;) of a technical talk on Facebook’s developer site about the use of artificial intelligence to keep content that violates Facebook’s policies, such as hate speech, nudity and pornography, off of the network.

The moderation would be performed by content classifiers, which is when a machine learning model is trained to recognize specific images and learns to reliably predict whether or not an image depicts violent content, for example. A Facebook spokesperson said there’s no connection between this type of moderation and private messaging encryption.

“The article is completely off base,” said Weis of the *Forbes *post. The video being discussed was about filtering content before it’s posted to Facebook in the first place — the app could, for example, detect that an image is pornographic and simply prevent a user from uploading it to the News Feed. “It was never talking about WhatsApp.”

Granted, a user wishing to post whatever they’d like on social media might take issue with this kind of automated moderation on the client side. (Technically, moderation like this already occurs on Facebook’s servers once content is uploaded.) But the important distinction is that it does not represent a backdoor into your conversations on WhatsApp.

Further, Weis says that moderating content on people’s phones is actually a privacy win, if you’re concerned about material being stored on the social network’s servers. “Today if you post a picture that gets sent to Facebook, and then they run their content filtering, and it gets rejected, it gets taken down, but they still have it. In this case, your content will get filtered locally, before it ever gets sent over. So it reduces the amount of information that will be sent to Facebook in the first place.”

Although the *Forbes *piece raises concern that plaintext copies of moderated messages would be sent to Facebook, “that’s completely filling in the blanks,” Weis said. “Nobody is talking about doing this for WhatsApp, and even if they did, nobody is talking about sending the plaintext to the server.”<|endoftext|>

# Oculus Quest Is VR for Normal People

## Oculus Quest Is VR for Normal People

### The $399 headset is worth the splurge

![Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

I’m in a cage of my own making. I drew the boundaries, and now a glowing aqua ring surrounds me and rises into infinity.

This virtual cage — or “Guardian” — is part of the Oculus Quest’s new boundary system. It’s designed to keep me from walking into walls and furniture while I explore new worlds with Facebook’s standalone virtual reality headset, which is out next month and costs $399.

The Quest is a standalone Oculus, meaning it requires no external tracking system for positional awareness of your head, hands, and body. It’s more powerful than the Oculus Go ($199) and comes with a pair of Oculus Touch controllers, just like those you’d use with a full Oculus Rift setup.
> # Oculus Quest definitely raises the bar.

The Quest launches alongside a new Rift S system, also $399, but like previous virtual reality setups, it requires a reasonably powerful PC to run. While the Quest is a step below the Rift S in terms of image and content quality, it’s clearly a next-level VR experience compared to previous standalone headsets. It could go a long way toward converting skeptics who haven’t had the opportunity to try “full” VR with motion controls. If you’re looking for a new gadget to splurge on, this may be it.

![You get the same pair of controllers as you would with the Oculus Rift S. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*You get the same pair of controllers as you would with the Oculus Rift S. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

## **Going virtual**

Oculus continues to refine the overall consumer VR experience, and nowhere is this more evident than in the Oculus Quest setup. You’ll need to use an iPhone or Android app for initial setup, which includes account creation (or, if you prefer, [logging in with Facebook](&lt;|url|&gt;)) and guiding the system to use a Wi-Fi network. It’s a pretty quick process, save for a required firmware update that occurred shortly after connecting the Oculus Quest to the internet.

![A speaker’s hidden here.](<|image|>)*A speaker’s hidden here.*

This gave me time to get acquainted with the new hardware. The Quest is not an upgrade of the Go. It is a completely different device. It features a dark gray, mostly plastic body with rubber straps that include adjustable Velcro straps. On the front of the headset are four strategically spaced, ultra-wide sensors that work with Oculus’ Insight Tracking System to understand your position in a room and the location of the controllers. There’s a volume rocker along the bottom edge, a power button on the side, a USB-C data and charging port on one side edge, and — yes! — a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack on another.

![The Oculus Quest controls have game console–like buttons and joysticks — and straps for safety. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*The Oculus Quest controls have game console–like buttons and joysticks — and straps for safety. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

Inside are a pair of Fresnel lenses, which sit in front of a pair of 1440x1600 OLED screens for a combined resolution of 2880x1600. Powering the Quest system is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835. For comparison, the Go includes the pokier Snapdragon 831 and a single LCD screen split into two images for a resolution of 2560x1440.

I peeled off the two protective labels on each lens. One warned me about shining direct sunlight into the system (I assume the Fresnel might focus sunlight on the delicate OLEDs with the same result as a magnifying focusing sunlight on an ant) and to never use liquid cleaners on the lens.

After futzing with the included eyeglass spacer, I placed the headset on my noggin. The fit was somewhat tight, so I simply adjusted the top strap to ensure that the substantial weight of the 580-gram headset was on top of my head and not pressing down on my face and nose. The Oculus app guided me to get the adjustments just right.

## **Making your space**

Nothing transforms a VR experience like being able to move your whole body about. I learned this when I tried the somewhat cumbersome [Lenovo Mirage](&lt;|url|&gt;). Oculus Go and Samsung’s Gear VR essentially require you to sit down and rotate in a seat.

Obviously, just because your system can see you and the room around you does not mean that Oculus Quest is designed for a full-home VR experience. Instead, Oculus developed an ingenious system for building a safe play space: Guardian.

![Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

When I put on the Quest headset, I could see a somewhat sketchy black-and-white view of my room. This is known as passthrough. Quest’s software then guided me to confirm that the virtual “X” marks it placed on my floor were, in fact, on the real floor. I did so by touching one AA-battery-powered controller to the ground. I then used the controller to draw a virtual line around the perimeter of my play space, ensuring that no furniture or obstacle was included in it. Oculus recommends at least a 6.5x6.5-foot space, and — this’ll be important later — I might have drawn one a little shy of that.

![Inside the Oculus Quest home environment.](<|image|>)*Inside the Oculus Quest home environment.*

The Guardian space initially appears as a kind of glowing blue fence that turns red when you touch it. During game and media play, the Guardian space disappears but reappears if you cross it. My favorite part was sticking my head or hands through it, which opens a hole in the fence. If you continue on past that, the screen changes to show your real-world environment to prevent you from actually walking into something.
> # Oculus’ tutorial does an excellent job of acclimating newbies to all the VR metaphors for moving, pointing, grabbing, touching, throwing, and so on.

Quest can memorize up to five different Guardian spaces, so you won’t need to remap your living room every time you use the headset, provided the space is sufficiently lit: The sensors need light to work.

![No, you can’t sit on that chair or check out the bookshelves.](<|image|>)*No, you can’t sit on that chair or check out the bookshelves.*

Oculus’ tutorial does an excellent job of acclimating newbies to all the VR metaphors for moving, pointing, grabbing, touching, throwing, and so on. The tutorial guides you through interactions with a variety of virtual objects, including cubes that you can pick up and throw and rockets that you can grab with one hand and ignite with the other. There was also a character I could dance with—at one point, I “grabbed” both its hands and spun it around the virtual dance floor. All of this is fun, but it also prepares you for life in the VR world.

![My son loved playing games on the Quest. Photo: Lance Ulanoff](<|image|>)*My son loved playing games on the Quest. Photo: Lance Ulanoff*

With the Oculus Quest situated somewhat comfortably on my head (I would feel the pressure on my brow and cheekbones after 20 minutes or so), I could look down at my virtual hands and see a perfectly rendered pair of virtual Oculus controllers. They appeared to match my movements precisely, even when I turned my hands over. In front of me was the Oculus home interface, with a main menu at waist level and a library of options in front of me. I had used my Facebook account to log into the Oculus experience and was signed into a special press preview of the Oculus store, so my content options were somewhat limited. Oculus promises 50-plus titles when the headset launches next month.

You need stereo sound to complete the virtual experience. Oculus built the speakers into the side head straps, and they’re quite effective. But you can, of course, plug headphones into the jack if you’d prefer not to bother people around you.

## **Game on**

I tried a number of games with the Oculus Quest — and made a major mistake in one. In *Sports Scramble*, your hands start out as foam fingers but eventually become gloves for catching or virtual hands for swinging bats, tennis rackets, and so on. I played a number of oddball sports, but when I switched to a version of bowling, I made a rookie VR error.
> # There’s nothing in the Quest system to warn you if a real remote is about to hit a physical object.

In my virtual hand was a traditional bowling ball and before me was a somewhat realistic-looking lane. I swung the bowling ball back with one hand, then stepped forward, swinging my hand forward as I moved. Just as I was set to let go of the ball, my real hand struck something — hard.

![](<|image|>)

My son, who was watching the whole time, explained that I’d just hit my desk. “You lunged forward,” he said, in a slightly scolding tone.

Even though I’d set up a decent-sized Guardian box, it was, at best, the bare minimum 6.5 feet wide. I swung my arm way outside that box, and there’s nothing in the Quest system to warn you if a real remote is about to hit a physical object. In fact, if there had been another Quest player in the room with me, the system has no way of knowing that (even if they’re inside my VR experience for multiplayer). I adjusted how I moved but also realized I needed to create a larger Guardian space.

I had a hoot playing *Space Pirate Trainer*, using two guns to shoot robots out of the sky while dodging the rays they shot back at me.

![Some of my game and entertainment selections.](<|image|>)*Some of my game and entertainment selections.*

*Creed: Rise to Glory*, based on the *Rocky* sequel series, is one of the best and most exhausting titles. I trained and boxed a number of rounds. In general, the positioning technology worked well, though I did notice that my fighter’s feet hung off my VR body like meat bags, sometimes facing in ways that were at odds with my torso. But I loved boxing in VR, and when I knocked out one opponent, I raised my arms above my head and gazed at their virtual musculature. It felt so real — though I will never have those arms.

![](<|image|>)

I learned how to fly an ultralight aircraft with *Ultrawings*, and it was pretty awesome — even though the graphics weren’t particularly realistic and I had a bit of trouble manipulating my virtual hands to manage the controls.

There were moments, like when I had to move forward to box or walk quickly through a virtual space, that the disconnect between my mind, which saw the movement, and my body, which was going nowhere, induced a tiny bit of vertigo-like dizziness. It never lasted long, but I felt it each time.

I also spent some time watching Fox Network’s Fox Now content on a large virtual screen. This is, naturally, a sit-down experience, so I pulled up a chair, sat in my virtual mahogany-covered room, and watched an episode of Rob Lowe’s *Mental Samurai* on what appeared to be a 200-inch screen. It was a good experience until the show unexpectedly crashed and wouldn’t restart.

## **Watch it**

As I mentioned, my son, who also tried the headset and said he liked it very much, was in the room with me for much of my test drive. He wasn’t just watching me. He used the new casting technology, which will work with smartphones, as well as Chromecast (Gen 3 and above) and Nvidia Shield, to watch my VR view on an iPhone. The video quality isn’t great, and he couldn’t read any of the messages I saw on screen, but it still helped keep him involved.

Not everything was castable. Video “experiences,” like the Notre Dame drone fly-through (an especially moving experience considering recent events) didn’t show up in the cast, for example.

![Quest’s image capture system would not snap an image of the Guardian fence.](<|image|>)*Quest’s image capture system would not snap an image of the Guardian fence.*

You can take screenshots and videos of what you see in VR. The media is stored on the Oculus Quest’s 64GB internal storage. To retrieve media, you’ll have to connect the headset to your computer via a USB cable.

Oculus told me I could get two to three hours of battery life per change, but I never got much beyond one hour. That’s okay, because I can’t see myself wearing the Quest for longer than that. Even with all the cushioning and perfect strap position, it started to hurt my face.

Having tried a few untethered VR headsets, Oculus Quest definitely raises the bar for the experience. It has a better design and play-space control system than the Lenovo Mirage, and the image quality is much better than on the Google Daydream and the Oculus Go.

At $399, the Quest is more of an investment than the Go, and it might not be for someone who doesn’t see themselves using VR more than weekly or monthly. But for those looking to take gaming and content consumption to a new 3D level, this is a fantastic choice.

As mentioned, hardcore gamers might prefer the new Oculus Rift S. Like the Quest, it’s a room-, body-, and hand-tracking headset that costs $399. The Rift S requires a PC, which you tether to via USB and HDMI cables. It’s a more powerful headset that supports console-level gaming. I played with it for a bit and found it very impressive.

Still, I like my VR untethered and on a measured basis, which is why the Oculus Quest is right for me. If you’ve been curious about VR but don’t want to commit to a more complicated setup, there’s a good chance this will be up your alley, too.

# You Should Be Scared of Nuclear War Again

## The Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from a Cold War-era nuclear missile treaty will put us all in renewed danger

![Demonstrators with a Putin and Trump mask face each other with rocket models on Pariser Platz. Photo: picture alliance/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Demonstrators with a Putin and Trump mask face each other with rocket models on Pariser Platz. Photo: picture alliance/Getty Images*

Mutually Assured Destruction has a bad name. I mean that literally — all three of those words are terrifying. Put them together, and they mean that annihilation is kept at bay by the fact that the two main nuclear powers — the United States and Russia — have thousands of warheads on land, sea, and in the air, targeted at each other and ready to launch, should one of them decide to fire first.

But what’s scarier than Mutually Assured Destruction in a world where an estimated nine countries have nuclear weapons and others want to join the club? Pretty much nothing.

That’s why the Trump Administration’s [formal withdrawal](&lt;|url|&gt;) of the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty on Friday is so worrying. The pact, which was signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, eliminated stocks of ground-based ballistic missiles capable of traveling between 500 and 5,500 km, otherwise known as tactical arms. The existence of these weapons was inherently destabilizing.

Nuclear weapons are dangerous not just because of their destructive power, but because of their speed. Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) can travel between Russia and the United States — and vice versa — in around 30 minutes. This means that in the event of a suspected launch, the leaders of the targeted country would have less than the length of an average sitcom to decide whether the launch was real and how to respond. That is an insanely compressed timeframe to decide whether or not to take an action that could plausibly result in the end of human civilization.

If tactical nuclear missiles are on the board, however, that time frame is contracted even more. It’s why the United States reacted so strongly after it discovered in 1963 that Soviet advisers were placing short-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, 100 miles away from the tip of Florida. The Cuban Missile Crisis that followed was likely the closest the world has ever come to all-out nuclear war, a fate that was avoided — or perhaps just postponed — by a mix of statesmanship and blind luck.

It’s the difference between a sniper having a bead on you from a distance and someone putting a gun right in front of your face. And now the Trump Administration — goaded, in part, by Russia — wants to take us back to those dark days.

Even worse, actually. Because short-range tactical nuclear weapons are less powerful than ICBMs, they implicitly lower the threshold for deploying an atomic bomb. They are seen as “gateway drugs” to nuclear war, blurring what should be very sharp lines. Any rational leader would blanch before launching an all-out nuclear attack that could ultimately kill billions of people. But firing off a single, tactical nuke might seem a lot closer to ordering conventional air strikes — something American presidents rarely hesitate to do when confronted with a range of threats that all fall short of the existential.
> # It’s the difference between a sniper having a bead on you from a distance, and someone putting a gun right in front of your face. And now the Trump Administration wants to take us back to those dark days.

Once the nuclear seal has been broken, though — even by what seems like a comparatively minor bomb — no one knows what will happen next. “Once you start using nuclear weapons,” Joe Cirincione, the president of the Ploughshares Fund, an antinuclear nonprofit, told me last year, “that is not a stable situation.”

The Trump administration’s stated reasoning for withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty is that Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has been effectively cheating on the treaty for years. This is largely true, but by unilaterally withdrawing from the treaty rather than punishing Russia over its violations, the United States effectively closes the door to future arms-control treaties, while also raising the possibility of a new arms race between the two countries to develop low-yield, tactical nukes.

And this should terrify all of us.

I spent more than two years working on [a book called *End Times](&lt;|url|&gt;)* about existential risk that will be published at the end of August. Existential risks represent global-scale threats that could plausibly result in the end of humanity, or something close to it. These range from cosmic or Earth-bound natural threats, like major asteroid strikes or supervolcano eruptions, to emerging technological threats that we can’t quite control, like synthetic biology and artificial intelligence. They are the ends that could lead us to the end times.

I knew nuclear war would be included in the book. The missiles, after all, are still there, still waiting to be launched at a moment’s notice. But I also assumed that the risk was far less than it had been during the worst days of the Cold War. Washington and Moscow, after all, were no longer avowed ideological enemies, and the thousands of warheads on both sides had been destroyed, thanks to a series of arms control treaties. The Cold War itself, after all, was over. I knew that my son, born in 2017, would live under the shadow of climate change and other new existential threats. But the nuclear nightmare — hadn’t we all awakened from it?

But the truth is that we’re still asleep. Climate change is the risk that looms largest over the decades and even centuries ahead, and biotechnology — the ability to engineer pathogens far worse than anything nature could cook up — poses the sharpest threat in the near future. But if the world ends today, or tomorrow, it would be due to a nuclear war. It could be started by intention, or by accident, as nearly happened countless times during the second half of the 20th century. It wouldn’t matter. What matters is that it can happen, and rather than attempting to minimize that risk, leaders in both Washington and Moscow seem to be actively courting it.

Nuclear peace relies on stability, and moves like Trump’s withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty degrade that stability.

Martin Hellman, an electrical engineer and cryptologist at Stanford University, has run the odds and compares the probability of nuclear war to a game of Russian roulette. Every nuclear crisis — every point of geopolitical tension between two atomic powers, every accidental close call with nuclear weapons that could lead to an exchange — represents a pull of the trigger. Inevitably — unless we choose to pull back from the brink — we’ll fire the chamber with the bullet.

In a 2009 paper, Hellman put the annual probability of a “Cuban Missile–type Crisis” producing nuclear war at 0.2% to 1%. That seems reassuringly low, but every year that passes compounds those odds, so much so that Hellman estimated there was a minimum 10% chance that a child born in 2009 would suffer an early death in a nuclear war. Other experts have come up with higher or lower estimates, but the point is that as long as nuclear weapons exist, they will remain an intolerable, existential risk. As the report from the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, an international panel on the future of atomic warfare, stated in 1997, “The proposition that nuclear weapons can be retained in perpetuity and never used — accidentally or by decision — defies credibility.”

William Perry lived through the Cold War as an analyst, and served in nearly every important position in national defense. He ended his career in government as President Bill Clinton’s Secretary of Defense between 1994 and 1997, at a time when the risk of nuclear war seemed lower than it had been since Hiroshima. But now, at 91, Perry is spending his final years raising the alarm about the renewed danger of nuclear war for the [*Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, the group that runs the famous Doomsday Clock. “I couldn’t imagine how we could go back to a Cold War again and a nuclear arms race again,” Perry told me last year. “But I was wrong.”

We were all wrong. And if our leaders keep making decisions like the one made today by the Trump Administration, we will all eventually pay the price.

# California Police Are Sharing Facial Recognition Databases to ID Suspects

## New emails reveal how a private technology company is working to change law enforcement as we know it

![A composite image sourced from DataWorks Plus documents](<|image|>)*A composite image sourced from DataWorks Plus documents*

Many of California’s local law enforcement agencies have access to facial recognition software for identifying suspects who appear in crime scene footage, documents obtained through public records requests show. Three California counties also have the capability to run facial recognition searches on each others’ mug shot databases, and others could join if they choose to opt into a network maintained by a private law enforcement software company.

The network is called California Facial Recognition Interconnect, and it’s a service offered by [DataWorks Plus](&lt;|url|&gt;), a Greenville, South Carolina–based company with law enforcement contracts in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Santa Barbara.

Currently, the three adjacent counties of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino are able to run facial recognition against mug shots in each other’s databases. That means these police departments have access to about 11.7 million mug shots of people who have previously been arrested, a majority of which come from the Los Angeles system.

![An email from DataWorks Plus executive vice president Todd Pastorini offering details on California cities that use the company’s facial recognition services. Contact information has been redacted by *OneZero.*](<|image|>)*An email from DataWorks Plus executive vice president Todd Pastorini offering details on California cities that use the company’s facial recognition services. Contact information has been redacted by *OneZero.**

Sacramento, Santa Barbara, and San Francisco also use the service, bringing the total number of mug shots in DataWorks Plus’ California system to 15 million, according to an email sent to the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department from Todd Pastorini, executive vice president and general manager of DataWorks Plus. Though the public records request returned emails suggesting these three cities would be added to the sharing network, DataWorks Plus now tells *OneZero *that they’re not connected, meaning other cities cannot access their images, and vice versa.

![Another email from Pastorini confirming that the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department has joined the company’s network of facial recognition services. Contact information has been redacted by *OneZero.*](<|image|>)*Another email from Pastorini confirming that the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department has joined the company’s network of facial recognition services. Contact information has been redacted by *OneZero.**

DataWorks Plus’ Interconnect network puts the company in a powerful position in the nation’s largest state. If police or sheriff’s departments invest in DataWorks Plus’ facial recognition system over a competitor’s, they could opt into having access to data from other cities around the state as well. Each contract is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars: When San Bernardino first bought DataWorks Plus’ technology in 2012, it financed the purchase through a $332,520 grant from the Department of Justice. The city renewed and upgraded its technology in July 2018 for $222,300.

But DataWorks Plus is also operating far beyond California. In 2017, it made a proposal to the Detroit police that listed 27 local, state, and federal agencies using the company’s facial recognition services, and company representatives call DataWorksPlus the number one provider of facial recognition on the West Coast. The Detroit proposal references Los Angeles’ adoption of the technology — by far the biggest in California — and boasts that the LAPD can search 7 million facial templates in less than 15 seconds.

![An excerpt from DataWorks Plus’ Detroit proposal](<|image|>)*An excerpt from DataWorks Plus’ Detroit proposal*

The capabilities of the Interconnect system are detailed in that proposal, which outlines how a shared database could work with the Michigan State Police (MSP).

“If allowed by MSP, DataWorks Plus is can [sic] provide dual search capability — analysts will be able to select a probe and search Detroit and MSP databases **from a single application**,” the report read, emphasis included. That means in one piece of software, an analyst running facial recognition searches can search not only their own database, but the databases of other agencies as well.
> # By signing a contract with DataWorks Plus, Detroit police would be able to access records, including mug shots, from other locations.

DataWorks Plus also offered “an opportunity through mutual interest to access” databases in Chicago, Pennsylvania, New York, Northern New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, and Columbus, Ohio. In other words, by signing a contract with DataWorks Plus, Detroit police would be able to access records, including mug shots, from those other locations. Pastorini says that this capability is not available to California law enforcement but did not elaborate on why.

Facial recognition is a [contentious](&lt;|url|&gt;) issue, especially in California. [San Francisco](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Oakland](&lt;|url|&gt;) have both banned the technology’s use by public agencies. San Francisco banned the technology due to privacy concerns, while Oakland cited studies that show racial bias in facial recognition systems sold by large technology companies like Amazon.

Pastorini tells *OneZero* that the characterization of facial recognition in the media is often unfair because it pits forensic tools against consumer-grade technology. He says that the automatic biometric identification technology his company sells does not rely on machine learning or deep neural networks, the way tech companies like Amazon or Microsoft do. Instead, he insists that the facial recognition technology sold by DataWorks Plus was developed specifically for forensic use.

“I can put all these engines [algorithms] side by side, and the Amazon searches are not the best forensic searches,” he says. Pastorini argues that the recent trend of banning facial recognition is unfortunate, since there wasn’t evidence of the technology being misused in San Francisco.

But NEC, a Japanese tech vendor from which DataWorks Plus sources facial recognition algorithms, [says its technology does partially rely on neural networks](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the method Silicon Valley companies have used for everything from recognizing people on Facebook to generating fake human voices in Google Assistant. These algorithms also put images through a number of different analyses specific to facial matching. One NEC technique estimates a 3D model of a face based on a 2D image and then tries to match the face at different angles, which could be useful to match a face captured at different camera angles.

DataWorks Plus doesn’t make facial recognition software itself; rather, it builds custom tools for law enforcement and provides access to tools to be used on police data, like facial recognition and fingerprint matching. The company typically sells access to three different algorithms, or engines, from NEC, Rank One, and Cognitec. The engines aren’t perfect. In the process of reviewing a new engine for a potential upgrade, an analyst for the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department wrote that a newer version “is much more forgiving with glasses and with the angle of the face (eyes don’t need to be level).”

Performance also varies greatly based on the engine being used, according to emails obtained through the public records request.

“Personally, I’ve never had a ‘hit’ with the Cognitec engine, so it would have to be a drastic improvement to be able to outperform either NEC or Rank One,” another analyst wrote during the same upgrade process.

The overall accuracy of the system is also unclear, even after reviewing the proposal submitted to Detroit police outlining the technology. A chart in the proposal ranks one of the algorithm’s performances on the Labelled Faces in the Wild dataset, a facial recognition dataset meant for research and specifically not built to be an accuracy test for facial recognition products, a co-creator of the dataset recently [told *OneZero](&lt;|url|&gt;)*.

The California Facial Recognition Interconnect isn’t the only system that helps state agencies share biometric data. In [1986](&lt;|url|&gt;), California established the Cal-ID system, which allows counties with more than 1.5 million residents to share and analyze fingerprints across the state. The state of California also runs [Cal-Photo](&lt;|url|&gt;), a database of 32 million driver’s license photos that was created in 2002 to help law enforcement agencies share facial images. These photos can be downloaded and used to run facial recognition searches against, Pastorini says.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit focused on digital rights, has [objected](&lt;|url|&gt;) to the use of facial recognition on the Cal-Photo database and expanding access to driver photos. EFF noted that the California DMV told the DOJ that a facial recognition and photo-sharing system wasn’t possible under current state laws.

Though his department could download Cal-Photo images and upload them into DataWorks Plus, San Bernardino Lieutenant Scott Landen, who leads the county’s Cal-ID program and oversees the operation of facial recognition and other biometric searches, tells *OneZero* it doesn’t.
> # “The software is never used as a guarantee.”

He also notes that the technology is used only as an investigative tool, rather than as evidence.

“It is very useful in narrowing down a possible suspect lead in an investigation,” Landen says. “The software just gives a possible individual. Our deputies still need to vet out this lead with more investigation, such as interviews and further follow-up. The software is never used as a guarantee that it is for sure the person suspected of committing the crime.”<|endoftext|>

# Trying Out a Gender-Neutral ‘Vibrator for Everybody’

## Trying Out a Gender-Neutral ‘Vibrator for Everybody’

### *The Enby, a new sex toy, is designed to adapt to a range of different genitals*

![The Enby. Credit: Wild Flower](<|image|>)*The Enby. Credit: Wild Flower*

When Amy and Nick Boyajian launched their sexual wellness store Wild Flower in 2017, they had a very specific vision for what they wanted. As non-binary people, they were turned off by mainstream sex shops like the Hustler Store, which rigidly divide their products into sections for men and women. Eager to offer a more inclusive alternative, they dreamed of a space where sex toys could exist free from gendered labels, where no one made any assumptions about how toys had to be used, or what sort of stimulation someone might want purely based on their gender.

As Wild Flower built up a fan base, the newly minted shopkeepers started getting curious questions about the kind of toys that didn’t seem to be on the market yet. “We were getting a lot of requests for toys that would fit into a harness, toys that can be humped or grinded against,” Amy explains. “We also had a friend of ours who was transitioning physically and made a comment about how she had to throw out a lot of her toys now because her body had changed.”

Those requests led the Boyajians to the same central question. “Can we create a toy that can work with all different types of bodies in different circumstances?” Amy remembers asking themself. Eager to assist their customers, the Boyajians decided to go from being sex toy retailers to sex toy manufacturers.

This month, they debuted their inaugural product: the [Enby](&lt;|url|&gt;), a “vibrator for everybody” that boasts its ability to adapt to, and pleasure, a range of different genitals. A stingray (or, if you prefer, bicycle seat) shaped toy, the Enby can be mounted and rubbed on, tucked into a harness, nestled between two partners’ bodies, or wrapped around a penis. And those are just what comes with the directions: Nick and Amy love the idea that customers might find wholly new uses and setups for the product on their own.
> # “I think we hit a sweet spot where it is pleasurable regardless of your anatomy.”

Enby isn’t the first product to market itself as a gender-neutral sex toy. In 2014, PicoBong launched [the Transformer](&lt;|url|&gt;), which the company billed as the world’s first gender-neutral vibrator. The following year [Jimmyjane’s Form 5](&lt;|url|&gt;), which plays up its ability to pleasure both vulvas and penises, debuted on the market. But neither of these products has developed a particularly passionate fan base.

Erika Moen, the co-creator of sex education webcomic [*Oh Joy Sex Toy](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and author of the forthcoming sex ed book *Let’s Talk About It*, has been unimpressed by the various gender-neutral toys that she and her husband have reviewed for their website. “Every single time we’ve tried one, it’s been like, ‘This is bad,’” she tells me. The Form 5, for instance, [disappointed both Erika and her husband](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the couple wrote it off as awkward to hold, uninteresting to use, and all around “a really bad sex toy.” In trying to meet the broadest array of needs, manufacturers often create a product that is “actively unsatisfying on all fronts,” Moen explains.

When I ask the Boyajians about this potential pitfall — that toys that attempt to be everything to everyone often wind up being nothing for nobody — Nick tells me they’re confident they’ve avoided many of the mistakes of previous gender-neutral products. “If you look at a toy like the Transformer, I think the box has like 20 or 30 different ways that you could potentially use it,” he says. “We picked a handful of use cases… by limiting our design criteria, and really making sure that we tested it on varied anatomy, I think we hit a sweet spot where it is pleasurable regardless of your anatomy.”

For some consumers, Enby’s name and vision alone are enough to get excited about. “I see toys as being an extension of sexual play and exploration and learning,” says the non-binary porn performer Jiz Lee. Lee loves the way the Enby’s branding and marketing open up conversations about bodies, gender identities, and sexualities that fall outside the mainstream.

Coyote Amrich, director of purchasing and product development at the San Francisco-based sex toy shop Good Vibrations (which, notably, caters to a queer audience and does not gender the toys it sells) has seen similar enthusiasm for Enby’s marketing pitch. “A lot of my staff feel seen by that product,” she tells me.

But even those who are excited by the product aren’t quite sure that the Enby is as revolutionary as the Boyajians seem to think, or that its central goal of being a multi-purpose product is truly a desirable one, particularly since many existing products with narrower aspirations — like the [basic bullet vibrator](&lt;|url|&gt;), which can be used on pretty much any body part imaginable — still manage to be flexible enough to serve a variety of purposes.

As Amrich points out, the Enby’s ability to accommodate a variety of bodies isn’t quite as unique as its creators claim. Most external vibrators are easily adaptable to all sorts of genitals and erogenous zones. Because vibration can feel pleasurable no matter your genital set up, even something as old school as the Hitachi Magic Wand is as easily [applied to a penis](&lt;|url|&gt;) as it is to vulva — or, for that matter, genitals that don’t comport to any binary standard.

The day after I chatted with the Boyajians, my very own Enby arrived in my mailbox. Laying it flat on my bed, I tried grinding on it; while the sensation was pleasurable enough, I found myself frustrated by the smoothness of the toy’s surface. Flipping it around, I attempted to cup my vulva with it, but found it a bit bulky, and not quite flexible enough to adapt to my anatomy. (It’s a problem I can imagine someone with a penis having as well — though I myself am not anatomically equipped to properly assess that usage.)

But even if the Enby wasn’t quite for me, I’m still glad that the Boyajians are committed to helping expand our conversation about who sex toys are for, and what sorts of bodies different toys can accommodate and pleasure. Our sex toy usage is as intimate and personal as the rest of our sex lives. We should be free to explore and enjoy them however feels best for us as individuals, without feeling pressure to contort our bodies, or our desires, to meet someone else’s expectation of what sex is supposed to look like.<|endoftext|>

### *We talk about sex the way we talk about the future. That’s a problem.*

*In I/O, columnist Lux Alptraum explores how technology intersects with sexuality and relationships. I/O will embrace the uncertainty of our future and help us craft a better tomorrow, together.*

In 2004, sex therapist Ian Kerner published his first book, *She Comes First*. A year later, futurist Ray Kurzweil released a work of his own, called *The Singularity Is Near*. At first glance, these two books — one a self-help tome educating men about the finer points of cunnilingus, the other a musing on artificial intelligence that predicts an eventual merger of man and machine — have very little in common.

Yet despite their wildly different subject matter, a common thread runs between them. Kerner and Kurzweil both used their bold, confident assertions about the way the world works to cement their positions as thought leaders, experts, and handsomely compensated speakers. And they both peddled overly simplistic narratives that scrubbed nuance and complexity from discussions within their respective fields, reshaping the larger conversation for the worse.

In Kerner’s case, the argument that heterosexual sex should always begin with a woman’s orgasm and that her orgasm should be generated through cunnilingus was rather bold given that Kerner could never be the recipient of the oral sex he so enthusiastically endorsed. It also reinforced the dangerous idea that there is one correct way we should all be structuring our sex lives.

And in Kurzweil’s case, the discussion of a coming singularity — the notion that humans may eventually have their consciousness uploaded into machines — revealed a near-religious belief in the unstoppable progress of tech. He never paused to consider that his own relationship to technology might not be a universal one ([among other problems](&lt;|url|&gt;)).
> # Why, exactly, do our brains seem to turn off when so-called experts start peddling their theories about sex and the future?

Kerner and Kurzweil are hardly the only people who’ve used thinly sourced arguments to launch themselves into the public eye. But people looking for guidance in the men’s respective fields — sexuality and technological soothsaying — seem particularly susceptible to arguments that can be as baseless as they are bold. Why, exactly, do our brains seem to turn off when so-called experts start peddling their theories about sex and the future?

As dissimilar as the two topics may seem, they are linked by one integral quality: a sense of unknowability and mystery.

The future, by definition, is quite literally unknowable. With sex, this sense of unknowability comes to us through the combination of privacy and taboo. Although the internet has greatly opened up our conversations about sex — and, in the case of some porn sites, has even given us a direct view into other people’s bedrooms — many of us are far more limited in our ability to talk honestly about sex than pretty much any other topic.

In both cases, when someone pops up on the national stage claiming to have found all the answers, we’re primed to take them at their word — no matter how ridiculous their claims end up being.

“If people say anything with enough conviction, other people will listen,” says Kate Devlin, author of [*Turned On: Science, Sex, and Robots](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, which* *explores our longstanding cultural obsession with sex robots. “When it comes to the unknowable, people really want to grasp onto something… [I]t’s comforting to think that someone has a grasp on this and we’re not just hurtling blindly into the future” — or, for that matter, into the vulnerability of a sexual relationship.

And when that confident assertion suggests there’s one easy and predictable path forward — good cunnilingus, a computer absorbing your consciousness in the end — we’re that much more susceptible.

“Solutionism, as a mindset, is very attractive,” says sci-fi writer and futurist Madeline Ashby. “The idea that all we need to do is this one thing has always been very attractive. Anyone who’s ever sold a diet plan knows that.”

But our actual behavior — whether we’re talking about what we’re going to be doing in 10 years or tonight when we close the bedroom door — tends to buck against these tidy solutions.

“I learned that lesson pretty hard working on *Second Life*,” says Kyle Machulis, the creator of [*Metafetish](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and [Buttplug.io](&lt;|url|&gt;) and a longtime commentator in the sex-tech space. Through his years of work tracking the technological advancements of vibrators, erotic apps, and other sex-related tech, Machulis has noted that many people assume there are certain predictable behaviors in human sexuality.
> # “When you are actually given an environment where people can do anything and be anything… you have no fucking clue what they’re going to do or be.”

And yet, he explains, “when you are actually given an environment where people can do anything and be anything… you have no fucking clue what they’re going to do or be.” Thanks to *Second Life*’s openness to adult content, many users have used the platform to explore their wildest sexual fantasies, diving into creative explorations of fetish and BDSM.

“In reality, there are many possible futures. There is no one future,” Ashby says. “My ideal future might not be someone else’s ideal future. In fact, I can guarantee to you that it’s not.”

Good futurism, Ashby tells me, isn’t about making hard-and-fast predictions or asserting you absolutely know what comes next. It’s about analyzing demographic trends and historical patterns and using that information to craft the future you want to see unfold, the same way good sex advice will instruct you to learn about your own needs and desires and those of your partner and synthesize those data sets into a mutually enjoyable — and perhaps utterly unique — sexual experience.

Kerner and Kurzweil may have rocketed to fame with their reductive visions, but if we want better conversations about sex and the future—and, indeed, the future of sex — we’ll need to set aside those confident assertions and embrace something a bit more complicated: uncertainty.<|endoftext|>

# What Does FaceApp Do With Your Photos? The Same Thing Facebook Does.

## If you’re worried about the data you’re giving FaceApp, there’s a lot more you should think about

![Credit: FaceApp](<|image|>)*Credit: FaceApp*

Last night, I learned that I am going to be a disgusting, decrepit old man. My beard will be gray, my cheeks will puff out, and my nose will get redder and more bulbous. At least, according to [FaceApp](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Like many others online, including [Gordon Ramsay](&lt;|url|&gt;), I recently downloaded and used FaceApp, which uses artificial intelligence to alter the appearance of someone in a photograph. It can make you look older or younger (if you don’t have a beard like me), or change your hairstyle or add makeup.

![The author, aged](<|image|>)*The author, aged*

Amid the sudden popularity of FaceApp, some online are [raising concerns](&lt;|url|&gt;) about the privacy implications of the company’s retention of user data. Wireless Lab, the Russian company that runs FaceApp, retains the ability to use your photos, name, and likeness for any purpose, according to its [terms of service](&lt;|url|&gt;). The company is also headquartered in Russia, where tech companies are expected to acquiesce to government demands. Some observers were [concerned](&lt;|url|&gt;) that the application would upload a user’s entire Camera Roll to the service.

That concern may be slightly out of proportion, considering what the app actually does. “Any information or content that you voluntarily process with the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the FaceApp anonymously,” the company’s [privacy policy](&lt;|url|&gt;) says, meaning the photos you send to be altered are FaceApp’s now. Though the company retains a mountain of metadata and device information for marketing and ad-targeting purposes, so do services like Google, Facebook, and Facetune, another popular image-editing app. Meanwhile, security researcher Will Strafach [found](&lt;|url|&gt;) rumors that FaceApp uploads your entire Camera Roll on iOS to the company to likely be false.

But there’s a bigger question behind the concern: Why would FaceApp want these images to begin with? Even if it weren’t gathering these pictures as part of a state-sponsored surveillance campaign, how could it put them to use?

The practice of altering human faces is well-worn in A.I. research, but typically boils down two techniques, as mentioned in an [IEEE](&lt;|url|&gt;) research [paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) from earlier this year: Either having an algorithm analyze pairs of images where a person differs in age, or showing an algorithm pictures of younger people and pictures of older people to identify similarities that are independent of a person’s identity. Looking at FaceApp’s creations, the app tends to whiten hair, add wrinkles and jowls, and redden skin.

The common factor between all of these applications is data. To train these algorithms you don’t just need one or two examples of a young person and an old person, but thousands. These datasets [already exist](&lt;|url|&gt;) online. A [compilation](&lt;|url|&gt;) of facial aging datasets from 2018 shows that hundreds of thousands of images are already available online for researchers to use. If you posted pictures of yourself online with certain Creative Commons licenses, you could be a part of them.

Earlier this year, an NBC News [report](&lt;|url|&gt;) detailed how IBM created a facial recognition dataset of more than a million people by scraping publicly available images on Flickr, a popular photo-sharing service.

Having its own facial recognition dataset would allow FaceApp to control the quality of the data that’s used to train its algorithms. Having exclusive access to high-quality photos is a differentiator for many big tech companies — for instance, Facebook and Google lead the field in computer vision and facial recognition in part because of their massive datasets built from user data. Which is to say: All of the photographs you’ve uploaded to these services over the years have been used to train the companies’ technology.

Facebook says that it uses your data for similar purposes even more explicitly in its privacy policy: “We use the information we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health, and well-being.”

Technological advancement is neatly tucked in the middle of that sentence, but Facebook clearly leverages user images for facial recognition. In a 2014 research [abstract](&lt;|url|&gt;), the company outlined that it had a facial dataset of more than 4 million images — and again, that was five years ago.

FaceApp and Facebook are clearly two very different beasts. One is an opaque tech company operating under unclear privacy regulations and with little oversight on how it uses its technology, and the other one is FaceApp.

The point here is that FaceApp isn’t the only tool that’s ripping your data off. If you use Google or Facebook, you’re already inside a global panopticon of advertising data and tracking pixels. That doesn’t mean that you should hand over your data to everyone else, of course.

We should be wary of startups that can scoop up device information and photos and use them in any way they see fit. Your photos could be sold and used to impersonate you, set up fake online accounts, troll people on Twitter, and a thousand other scams still undiscovered.

Before you download any app, scroll through the privacy policy and see if it offends you. That’s especially important if it’s from a startup you don’t recognize. Ever, a photo-sharing app, made [headlines](&lt;|url|&gt;) in May after using its customers’ data to train facial recognition algorithms, which were then sold to companies like SoftBank’s robotics firm.

Trust nobody, and read the privacy policy.<|endoftext|>

# Can Fancy New Graphics Tech Save Burned-Out Game Developers?

## Ray tracing looks great, and it could alleviate crunch if companies let it

![Credit: *Shadow of the Tomb Raider/Square Enix via *NVIDIA](<|image|>)*Credit: *Shadow of the Tomb Raider/Square Enix via *NVIDIA*

Real-time ray tracing, the next big innovation in gaming graphics, could eventually make your games look more like the CGI you’re used to seeing in movies. Companies like Nvidia are touting it as a revolution in computer graphics, but its biggest benefit may be easing the burden on the overworked game developers trapped under perpetual crunch time today.

Ray tracing is a powerful technique in computer graphics that simulates the way real-world objects should look. The software casts virtual rays of light and traces (get it?) the path from the light source to the camera, just like light works in real life. In the same way light from a lamp bounces off the book you’re reading and into your eyes, ray tracing blasts CGI objects with rays and captures them in a virtual camera.

This enables the program to intuitively cast natural shadows, light objects properly, and create fast and easy reflections. If a lot of rays hit an object, the object is brighter. If an object blocks a light source, it casts a shadow. Where the old method was like tediously drawing an animated movie, ray tracing is more like shooting a live-action movie. You can hang the virtual lights, and it all just looks right.

The problem is that ray tracing takes a lot of processing power. Until recently, rendering even a single frame with ray tracing on a typical computer could take hours. That’s fine when you’re making a movie [like *Toy Story 4](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and have huge server farms at your disposal. It’s less feasible for video games that have to generate 30 (or 60) frames every second.

Instead, video games traditionally use [a technique called rasterization](&lt;|url|&gt;) that creates a 2D image of a scene from the camera’s perspective. Then, shaders are applied to that image to approximate what light, shadows, reflections, and other details should look like. Think of it like trying to paint a circle that looks like a ball. A good artist might be able to get close, but nothing will ever be as accurate or as easy as taking a photograph of a ball.
> # “The nice thing about ray-traced shadows is that they’re… just kind of algorithmically right.”

The innovation in “real-time ray tracing,” therefore, isn’t necessarily the ray tracing part—it’s “real-time.” Nvidia currently has [a few graphics cards](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the market capable of real-time ray tracing, and Sony says [its next gaming console](&lt;|url|&gt;) will support the feature as well, whenever it comes out. It’s likely Microsoft’s Xbox will eventually follow suit. A decade or so from now, real-time ray tracing will be commonplace, allowing developers to create realistic graphics without all the tedious workarounds.

That future can’t come fast enough for overworked game developers.

Stories of video game studios operating under “[crunch time](&lt;|url|&gt;)” — a prolonged, semipermanent period of working late nights and weekends to get games done before a deadline — are as common as they are depressing. Rockstar, the developer behind the *Grand Theft Auto *franchise, had developers [working 60- to 80-hour weeks](&lt;|url|&gt;) to meet *Red Dead Redemption 2*’s deadline. Epic, the company behind online megahit *Fortnite*, acknowledged a few cases of employees working up to 100 hours a week in what some workers consider [a constant crunch lifestyle](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Much of that excessive work is spent on very minor but important details. As Tony Tamasi, senior vice president of content and technology at Nvidia, explained to *OneZero*, the process of getting shadows in just the right spot — called [shadow mapping](&lt;|url|&gt;) — can be tedious and time consuming. “It’s a pretty good amount of time developers and artists have to spend custom-tweaking things to get shadow maps to look right… And those are the kinds of things that ray-traced shadows all just magically solve for you.”

*Shadow of the Tomb Raider*, which uses Nvidia’s RTX platform to render shadows, shows how much work ray tracing can save. In the first picture below, you can see a few shadows cast by the wooden spikes onto a stone wall.

![](<|image|>)

It looks fine, right? Intricately detailed, even. These shadows would’ve been created by an artist or developer who crafted the shape of the shadows, adjusted how they behave as Lara moves her light around, and makes sure there are no glaring bugs. It takes time, but the end result looks pretty good.

Now take a look at that same location with ray tracing turned on.

![](<|image|>)

Look closely. Did you even notice in the first image that there was no shadow coming from the little flags? Or the ropes? Or the rocks behind the spikes? With the flip of a switch, every object starts casting shadows, not just the ones that are designed to do so. The shadows are also more accurate, getting softer the farther away the shadow is from the object casting it.

Cody Darr is an independent developer and creator of [Sonic Ether’s Unbelievable Shaders](&lt;|url|&gt;), a mod that turns Minecraft’s basic block design into [a detailed thing of beauty](&lt;|url|&gt;). Early versions of this mod used the old rasterization technique, but now Darr has switched to a ray-traced model. “I used to spend countless hours tweaking various faked lighting techniques to achieve the look I wanted,” Darr explains. “With ray tracing, those endless hours of tweaking to find the right balance for fake lighting effects have vanished. Everything just looks right!”
> # “Technology powering game development has only gotten better, yet crunch time has only gotten worse.”

For now, most players don’t have ray tracing–capable hardware, so game studios will still need to rely on the old methods. Ironically, this will add more work to support both rasterization and ray tracing, but not much. “Yeah, it’s not free,” Tamasi says. “It’s some amount of incremental work. There’s no doubt about that. But the nice thing about ray-traced shadows is that they’re… just kind of algorithmically right.”

Ray tracing can still help developers, even if many players can’t take advantage of it yet. Tamasi explained another technique during the development process called [light baking](&lt;|url|&gt;). This involves precalculating what the lighting in a scene should look like and saving that information as a texture on the disk in what’s called a lightmap. Building lightmaps can take a long time, and changing them even slightly takes a long time. “Every time an artist changes the light or moves the position, or you change the material, you’ve got to rebake it,” Tamasi says. With real-time ray tracing, he adds, “What used to take hours can now take a couple minutes.” Even before real-time ray tracing reaches consumers, it can save developers loads of time.

Further into the future, when ray tracing becomes common place, developers can start to drop older techniques in favor of these easier, faster methods. Whether that leads to less crunch time for developers is another question. “Sadly, I think it’s more of a cultural issue,” Darr says. “Technology powering game development has only gotten better, yet crunch time has only gotten worse.”

Some jobs in game development — like writing or QA testing — won’t benefit from the ray-tracing revolution at all. And some companies may fill the reduced workload with yet more work. It’s not a magic bullet. But there is an opportunity to use this as a chance to rethink the workloads put on the people who make games.

“It’s easy to blame game studios for not caring about the quality of life of its employees,” Darr says. “But gamers usually don’t think about the quality of life of game developers when they play a game. They think about the quality of the game itself, and game studios know that.”<|endoftext|>

# The Case for Visiting the Outer Planets

## The Case for Visiting the Outer Planets

### Scientists are begging NASA to go back to Uranus and Neptune

![Credit: SCIEPRO/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: SCIEPRO/Getty Images*

Until NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft reached Uranus and Neptune in the 1980s, the outer planets were simply fuzzy blobs that could only be viewed through ground-based telescopes. We had no idea what they actually looked like.

But when Voyager 2 made its [closest approach to Uranus](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 1986, the space probe revealed a light teal planet with rings. Three years after the Uranus flyby, Voyager 2 [introduced us to Neptune](&lt;|url|&gt;), a vibrant ultramarine blue planet with a dark oval storm that penetrated deep into the atmosphere. Suddenly these two ambiguous blobs became real worlds — as real as our own. They had clouds and storms as well as bands of winds and weather all their own. After hundreds of years of wondering, we finally glimpsed these distant worlds comparatively up close. So, why haven’t we been back for 30 years?

Funding is a perennial issue for NASA, and there simply isn’t enough money to reach every planet scientists want to visit. There’s also the sheer distance of Uranus and Neptune: Uranus is about two billion miles away from Earth, and Neptune is roughly another billion miles farther. Reaching these planets with the technology we have now can easily take a decade.

As it happens, the next ideal time to launch a mission to the outer planets is fast approaching. A spacecraft could use Jupiter as a gravity assist — a method of stealing some of Jupiter’s massive gravitational force to slingshot a spacecraft away even faster and therefore shaving years off the travel time. But to do that, a mission would need to be ready by the 2030s; otherwise our alignment with Jupiter will change, making a gravity assist impossible. NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft used Jupiter to gain speed, and while it became the fastest spacecraft headed to the outer solar system, it still took nine years to reach Pluto.

Scientists are urging NASA to take advantage of the timing and start planning a mission to Uranus and Neptune. Amy Simon, a senior scientist for planetary atmospheres research at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, [recently published a paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) with her colleagues outlining an epic outer planets voyage. While both planets are categorized as ice giants, “they are quite different from each other,” says Simon. Simon’s proposed mission would visit both Uranus and Neptune as well as Neptune’s ocean-world moon Triton. “They are quite interesting, and we know so little about how anything works at those planets.”
> # “We’re going to go back to both Uranus and Neptune someday. And when we do go back, those planets are not going to look at all like what they were during Voyager.”

Because we’ve only visited the outer planets once, our knowledge of both is limited to what Voyager 2 discovered 30 years ago. “Uranus is tipped over on its side, so possibly a big collision happened,” says Simon. “But it seems like its moons formed in place [grew up in the same environment where Uranus formed]. On the other hand, Neptune has a normal tilt, and it seems to have captured its moons from the outer solar system. So there’s this mystery at both of those planetary systems.”

Past exploration of Uranus and Neptune raised questions for scientists about the planets, and many want the opportunity to answer them. Heidi Hammel, a planetary astronomer, Voyager team member, and the executive vice president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, recalls how little we knew about the outer planets before Voyager. “We knew that they had some kind of cloud features, and we could make guesses at rotation periods, but it was very mysterious,” she says. “We knew there were methane ice clouds. [That] was almost everything we knew.”

Voyager 2 revealed that Uranus and Neptune bore peculiar storms and wind patterns and wonky magnetic fields that scientists still don’t fully understand. Both planets have the highest wind speeds in the solar system: Neptune has clocked in at over 1,500 mph. (The [fastest recorded wind speed](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Earth, by comparison, has been 253 mph during a tropical cyclone near western Australia in 1996.) Scientists think leftover heat from when both planets formed continues to rise from the planets’ cores and fuels these winds. But while Neptune seems to have retained a lot of heat from its nascent days, Uranus has not. Their high-speed winds remain a mystery.

Neptune’s big dark spot — a surprise discovery — is another area of interest. “When we finally got the chance to turn Hubble to that scene five years [after the Voyager flyby], I was waiting to measure the great dark spot, and it was gone,” says Hammel. “How can that be? Why does this planet have these huge features that disappear in five years?”

Another reason scientists want the chance to properly study the outer planets is that the knowledge could lead to a better understanding of exoplanets — planets beyond our solar system that orbit around other stars. Most of the 2,500 exoplanets discovered to date are similar to Uranus and Neptune. They’re roughly the same mass and likely also mostly made of ice, rock, and gas. Traveling to other star systems to study these worlds is impossible right now, but studying Uranus and Neptune is achievable. We have analogs for exoplanets in our own solar system, and by understanding how they form, their chemical makeup, and whether or not they are habitable could give us insight into alien worlds we are unable to visit.

The hope for Hammel, Simon, and many others in the scientific community is that a mission to these mysterious blue-tinted worlds will launch in our lifetime.

“We’re going to go back to both Uranus and Neptune someday,” says Hammel. “And when we do go back, those planets are not going to look at all like what they were during Voyager. They are dynamic systems. The atmospheres are dynamic. The ring systems are dynamic.”

But the clock is ticking. Even if NASA gets on board with an outer planets mission, its spacecraft may not arrive until the late 2040s.

“Incredible things are waiting to be discovered there,” says Hammel. “We just need another ship.”<|endoftext|>

# Erasing Women in Tech&#58; How 60 Minutes Ignored Women’s Voices, Stories, and Expertise

## A response from the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code

![Photo courtesy : Girls Who Code](<|image|>)*Photo courtesy : Girls Who Code*

Almost a year ago, *60 Minutes* producers contacted [Girls Who Code](&lt;|url|&gt;). The news show was working on a segment about girls and computer science and wanted to better understand what initiatives to close the gender gap in tech were proving effective.

Sunday, that segment was broadcast to the show’s [weekly 11 million viewers](&lt;|url|&gt;) in the U.S. and around the world — and it didn’t include a single reference to Girls Who Code or other girl-focused organizations like Black Girls Code, the National Center for Women and Information Technology, Kode With Klossy, and countless others. It was like a punch to the gut.

By omitting the expertise and experience of woman-led organizations’ pioneering efforts to bring more girls into computing, *60 Minutes* is contributing to a long and ugly history of media erasing women in tech.

Girls, women, and thought leaders who tuned in Sunday instead heard about Code.org, a non-profit whose mission is not to close the gender gap in tech. (Never mind that Code.org [led a partnership with the Trump administration](&lt;|url|&gt;), which has demonstrated time and time again it has no concern for the rights, well-being, and future of our girls.) And viewers saw a man, Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi, presented as a savior of women and girls (ironically with the help of some of Girls Who Code’s own [research](&lt;|url|&gt;) cited without attribution).

It was patently ridiculous to see the network uplift a man as the leader of a movement to get more women into tech — particularly at a moment when media, in general, should be acutely aware of sexist biases, and [CBS and *60 Minutes](&lt;|url|&gt;)*, in particular, should be cognizant of their extensive shortcomings in this area.

As women do, we debated publishing our account. We went back and forth about who we might offend. We consulted with allies in our space and with our friends in media. We considered how we’d be perceived by those in power.

And then we thought about the very reason we exist: because for too long institutions like *60 Minutes* have sidelined the work of women and women-led organizations in tech. We thought about the girls we’ve served: 185,000 of them across 50 states, half of whom are black, Latina, or low-income. We thought about our alumni, 13,000 strong, majoring in computer science at a rate 15 times the national average.

These omissions aren’t just an oversight. They are negligent, they are sexist, and they have consequences for efforts to close the gender gap in tech. And they are part of a long history of erasing the contributions of women in technology.

Take for instance the [women behind ENIAC](&lt;|url|&gt;), the first computer. Their male managers didn’t think to mention them at the ENIAC’s first demonstration in 1946. And the press never asked about the women, the first-ever computer programmers, who could be seen working on the machine in photos.

NASA mathematician [Katherine Johnson](&lt;|url|&gt;) calculated — by hand — the orbital trajectory of the first manned U.S. spaceflight. She and her black female colleagues were barely mentioned in coverage of that historic flight, and their story was mostly unknown by the public until the book and Oscar-nominated film *Hidden Figures*.

In 2015, [a story in the *Atlantic](&lt;|url|&gt;) *about gene-editing technology CRISPR quoted six men despite the fact that two of CRISPR’s pioneers — [Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna](&lt;|url|&gt;) — were women. To his credit, the reporter on that piece, Ed Yong, later [published](&lt;|url|&gt;) a piece focused specifically on his own biased coverage. Adrienne LaFrance, who inspired Yong’s reflection and who regularly covers gender in tech, found that women made up just [25 percent of people mentioned in her own stories](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Decisions like these mean educators, policymakers, and thought leaders are less likely to hear about organizations like Girls Who Code, which possess a deep understanding of what it takes for girls to succeed in this space. More importantly, they make it even more difficult for our girls to imagine a future in the field.

If *60 Minutes* had included us, its viewers would have learned that — contrary to what was said in the program — introducing girls to computer science earlier on (i.e. kindergarten) isn’t enough to close the gender gap in tech. Girls need support systems all along the pipeline, and tech companies need to do their part to root out harassment and discrimination.

If they had included us, people around the U.S. would have learned that access alone isn’t enough to bring girls into coding. In fact, we know from research that two-thirds of states with initiatives to expand access to computer science aren’t seeing any increased participation by girls. This is why Girls Who Code last year released a [policy agenda](&lt;|url|&gt;) for lawmakers with recommendations that go beyond increasing access, designed specifically to attract kindergarten to 12th-grade girls to computer science and retain them.

Elite media must do better. These organizations are kingmakers that inform policy and pop culture, conversation, and history. They have the power and therefore the responsibility to make sure that women make up more than just [0.5 percent of 3,500 years of recorded history](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Does it sting to be left out? Sure. But let’s be very clear: Girls Who Code doesn’t do publicity for the sake of airtime. We seek visibility so that we may bring more girls into computer science with programs that have been proven to work at every stage along the pipeline — in elementary and high school, in college, and in the workforce.

It’s our hope that we have impressed upon producers the importance of including the voices and experiences of women and girls who are working to close the gender gap in tech. If they had done so, and on the inaugural *60 Minutes* episode of Women’s History Month, our girls would be better off.

*Update: Since publishing this post on March 4, the founder and CEO of littleBits, Ayah Bdeir, has come forward detailing her experience with 60 Minutes producers. In it, she discusses how she was considered and ultimately omitted from the segment about girls in computing in favor of a male spokesperson. You can read that piece [here](&lt;|url|&gt;).*

# Review&#58; The OnePlus 7 Pro Hits the Android Sweet Spot

## Review: The OnePlus 7 Pro Hits the Android Sweet Spot

### *It’s not the best device on the market, but the price and performance is right*

![](<|image|>)

No notch, no laser-cut holes, no ungainly chin — just unblemished, AMOLED screen. That’s what you’re getting with the OnePlus 7 Pro, the upcoming flagship phone from a Shenzhen-based company best-known for Android devices that offer competitive features at a “midrange” price.

Don’t mistake the OnePlus 7 Pro as a no-frills update, though. As with Samsung’s Galaxy S10 line, the OnePlus 7 Pro hides the fingerprint sensor under the lower third of the screen. And for the selfie camera — the one that Apple’s [carved out a notch for](&lt;|url|&gt;) — OnePlus settled on something risky.
> # We put our smartphones through hell — can a pop-up camera survive all of it?

![The pop-up, 16 MP selfie camera is a surprisingly solid piece of engineering.](<|image|>)*The pop-up, 16 MP selfie camera is a surprisingly solid piece of engineering.*

Hidden along the top edge of the phone is a physical pop-up camera module that, as soon as you tap the selfie camera button in the camera app, rises up out of the body with the slight sound of mechanical gears whirring. OnePlus [isn’t the first](&lt;|url|&gt;) to do something like this, and it surely won’t be the last. Still, I had my reservations: We put our smartphones through hell — can a pop-up camera survive all of it?

In short, the camera is tougher than I expected. But before we dive into specifics, let’s step back a bit and take a good look at the OnePlus 7 Pro, out May 17 with a starting price of $649. It’s a gorgeous Android handset that I’ve used for the last couple of weeks.

### **Familiar, but good design**

In some ways, the OnePlus 7 Pro is simply a larger version of all those other beautiful slab phones. It has a familiar-looking aluminum edge, Gorilla Glass 5, and three cameras on the back.

OnePlus chose an eye-pleasing matte finish for the back, which also happens to make the slab less slippery and completely fingerprint resistant. As on Samsung’s Galaxy S10, the front-left and right edges gently curve toward the back, making the rather substantial device comfortable to hold. The edges include a standard volume rocker and power button, along with a rather odd three-stage switch for “Silent,” “Vibrate,” and “Ring” modes.

Along the bottom edge is the SIM slot, USB-C port, microphone, and speaker. Adjacent to the top edge is a barely discernible speaker slot (squeezed between the glass screen and aluminum frame), the pop-up camera, and another mic for noise cancellation.

Unlike Samsung, OnePlus didn’t bother with redundant biometric unlocking features. You can use the in-screen fingerprint reader or a PIN number. That’s it. Fortunately, OnePlus’s fingerprint sensor is easier to find — it literally glows bright green when you place your finger on or near it — and it also works faster and far more consistently than the scanner on the [Galaxy S10+](&lt;|url|&gt;).

### **Diving into display**

OnePlus packed the 7 Pro with an absolutely gorgeous 6.67-in, 3120x1440-pixel “Fluid AMOLED” screen. The “Fluid” part refers to the amped up, 90hz refresh rate. (The Galaxy S10, by comparison, clocks in at 60hz). Higher refresh rates mean less smudging and screen-tearing during games, action movies, and sports.

This is an excellent screen. It’s color rich, accurate, responsive, unblemished, and huge. I had a great time playing *PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds*, *Asphalt Legends, Mortal Kombat*, and watching endless YouTube videos.

### **Good lenses**

Some truly impressive camera specs have been packed into the OnePlus 7 Pro. First there’s the 48 MP, f1.6 main camera, complete with optical image stabilization. It’s complemented by an 8 MP, f2.4 3X, OIS optical zoom camera. (Apple’s iPhone XS and the Samsung Galaxy S10 top out at 2X optical zoom, but also up the megapixels to 12.) Finally, like the Galaxy S10, there is an ultra-wide angle 16 MP, f2/2 camera. That’s a lot of stats, all of which add up to this: The OnePlus 7 Pro takes great pictures.

![A photo taken with the OnePlus 7 Pro’s 48 MP camera.](<|image|>)*A photo taken with the OnePlus 7 Pro’s 48 MP camera.*

These are all excellent lenses, and I was especially impressed with the main camera. As with all other Android cameras I’ve tested, the colors tend to be somewhat richer and deeper than what you might get with an iPhone. I generally believe Apple’s approach to photography is truer to real-life, but I can’t say I dislike what I get from the OnePlus 7 Pro, especially considering all the extra detail packed in with the 48 MP lens.

![OnePlus 7 Pro’s Nightscape low-light photography doesn’t hold up well against Google’ Night Sight.](<|image|>)*OnePlus 7 Pro’s Nightscape low-light photography doesn’t hold up well against Google’ Night Sight.*

Like the Google Pixel 3, the OnePlus 7 Pro includes an extreme low-light capture mode, in this case called Nightscape. It can gather a photo with virtually no ambient light. Unlike the Pixel 3’s Night Sight, OnePlus’s ultra-low-light mode doesn’t ask you to stand still while it captures the photo. Instead, it does most of the image work in post-processing. The end result, though, is almost more impressionist painting than real photo: It doesn’t look quite right.

![At a glance, the portrait mode shots from the 16 MP pop-up camera look decent, but it didn’t do a great job making my head stand out from the background.](<|image|>)*At a glance, the portrait mode shots from the 16 MP pop-up camera look decent, but it didn’t do a great job making my head stand out from the background.*

Using both the main and telephoto camera, the OnePlus is capable of solid, if imperfect, portrait mode shots. Unlike the iPhone XS or Samsung Galaxy S10, the “bokeh” effect — the aesthetic quality of the blur produced by the out-of-focus parts of an image — is not editable before or after the photo is taken.

The ultra-wide camera creates good-looking, distortion-free 117-degree images. If you want to reintroduce some curves at the edges, you can turn off distortion correction in the settings.

![The 117-degree ultra-wide pulls in a lot of the scene, and software cleans up the edge distortion curves.](<|image|>)*The 117-degree ultra-wide pulls in a lot of the scene, and software cleans up the edge distortion curves.*

OnePlus’ selfie camera is a 16 MP, f1.6 shooter that emerges smoothly from the top of the phone when you switch to selfie mode, and it takes high-quality pictures.

The largest concern about this camera is durability. Who’s to say it won’t break moving up and down? But OnePlus has put considerable thought into protecting this little pop-up lens. First of all, if you try to push the camera back down into the body, the camera automatically retracts, and you get an on-screen notice warning you to never push down on the camera. The more likely scenario, though, is that you drop the phone while the selfie camera is exposed. In this case, OnePlus uses the on-board sensors to detect a free fall, and instantly retracts the camera before the phone hits the ground. I was a little skeptical, so I opened the selfie camera and repeatedly dropped the phone. By the time the phone hit the ground, the camera was safely back inside the OnePlus 7 Pro’s body every single time. Impressive.

As for video, you can shoot up to 4K while using the 3X optical zoom lens. The phone also supports 1080p at 60 FPS, plus slow-motion up to 240 FPS at 1080p and up to 480 fps at 720p. Just note that you can only shoot up to one minute of slow motion video. Overall, I was pleased with the video quality, both in standard and slow motion.

### **Oxygen, zen, and bad icons**

I’m not a fan of Android overlays, which put custom features over the “stock” operating system — and OnePlus’s Oxygen OS does nothing to change my opinion. The proprietary icons for apps like Gallery, Notes, and Messages are all terrible. More frustrating, though, is the way OnePlus hides some of its own most important utilities, like Screen Recorder and Zen Mode, a layer deep in Settings. You have to swipe to the left to find them.

![Can you stand not using your phone for a solid 20 minutes?](<|image|>)*Can you stand not using your phone for a solid 20 minutes?*

Zen Mode is an interesting utility. Instead of trying to help you manage your screen time with intricate time management utilities, it essentially locks your phone for 20 minutes. The only features that work are photos (you can take them, not view them) and emergency calls. You simply can’t unlock the phone to access any other apps. It’s a self-enforced time-out. The idea has merits. It reminds me a bit of what [Palm](&lt;|url|&gt;) has tried to accomplish with Life Mode, though that’s more flexible and forgiving than Zen.

Screen Recorder is a lot like the one you find on an iPhone XS, but with a nifty twist: the ability to record external audio. This might come in handy for creating narrated app walkthroughs and even play-by-play recordings for game apps. The phone’s mic is sensitive, though, so try to avoid jostling the device while you’re recording.

### **Energetic performance and long life**

The OnePlus 7 Pro uses Qualcomm’s powerful Snapdragon 855 chip, and at least with my review unit — a pricer $749 model with double the RAM and storage of the base unit — The Geekbench numbers were roughly on par with what I got from the Samsung Galaxy S10+, approaching Apple’s impressive A12 Bionic numbers. This is a high-performance device that, thanks to a liquid cooling system, never felt warm in my hands, even after nearly an hour of *PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds*. For those who really love to game, the phone includes a mode that’ll block calls, notifications, and dial down background activity to steer all the performance to your games. I turned this on as I played *Asphalt Legends*, but didn’t notice any performance change. Perhaps that’s because the baseline performance is so damn good.

![I gamed a lot on this big-screen phone.](<|image|>)*I gamed a lot on this big-screen phone.*

OnePlus claims that the 7 Pro also has an improved haptic system. Yes, I felt vibrations — strong ones — at all the right times, but they weren’t demonstrably better than anything I’ve felt on similar devices.

Battery life from the large, 4000 mAh battery is simply fantastic. I got 20 hours on a charge with almost constant play and was able to fully recharge using the included Warp Charger in just 70 minutes.

![These Bullets Wireless 2 earbuds are a little old-school, but the sound and battery life are good.](<|image|>)*These Bullets Wireless 2 earbuds are a little old-school, but the sound and battery life are good.*

OnePlus also handed me a pair of its OnePlus Bullets Wireless 2 Bluetooth headphones ($99). With their two earbuds connected by a neck cable that also includes controls and supposedly as much as 14 hours per charge in battery life, they feel like an oddly retro pair of earphones. But there is a modern flourish: Snap the magnetic buds apart and place them back in your ears and the OnePlus 7 Pro will know to switch its sound output from its speakers to your headphones. That’s pretty smart. And while the fit is just okay, the sound quality is very good.

I’m surprised that the OnePlus 7 Pro lacks wireless charging and any kind of water and dust protection (OnePlus says it can handle rain and a drop in a puddle), but, given that the phone costs hundreds of dollars less than a Galaxy S10 or iPhone XS, I can live without them. I’m also somewhat disappointed in the portrait mode photography, though I suspect a software update could fix some of the imperfections I noticed.

If it weren’t for these deficits, the OnePlus 7 Pro would be my new favorite Android Phone. The screen is stunning, the performance eye-popping, and the cameras are all excellent, even though I’m not a fan of that crazy pop-up selfie camera. It’s not the ultimate Android smartphone, but the 7 Pro sits at the perfect sweet spot of price, quality, and performance.

# Google’s Stadia Could Take Video Games Out of Your Hands

## The new streaming service could make owning a video game a thing of the past

![Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty*

Google’s all-streaming vision [may be the inevitable](&lt;|url|&gt;) future of the video game industry, even if Google’s not the one to do it. However, if Stadia and its future streaming competitors become the norm, it could cause serious harm to the idea of owning a video game and all that comes with it.

In the past, when you bought a video game cartridge or disc, you owned that game. You could dig *Super Mario World* out of storage, plug it into your old Super Nintendo, and play it right now, even though the hardware platform it plays on is more than 25 years old. Platforms like Steam also let you own the game in that you can download digital copies. If Steam were to go out of business, you might not be able to download a game anymore, but as long as you already have it on your computer, you could keep it as long as you wanted.
> # The most prominent question with a service like Stadia — aside from whether your internet speed can actually support this — is what happens should the game be removed from the server?

With Stadia’s streaming model, however, you never download a game. The game is installed on Google’s servers, it runs on Google’s servers, and your game progression is stored on Google’s servers. This new paradigm provides convenience and a potentially amazing experience, but it replicates problems we’ve seen as other types of online media have shifted from owning to streaming. And those problems could be much worse for the gaming industry.

The most prominent question with a service like Stadia — aside from whether your internet speed can [actually support this](&lt;|url|&gt;) — is what happens should the game be removed from the server? Steam sometimes removes games from its store but will still ([with rare exceptions](&lt;|url|&gt;)) allow anyone who [already bought the game](&lt;|url|&gt;) to download it. And if you downloaded it, you can keep playing it forever, even if Steam shut down. This isn’t an option for game streaming, however. If a game is removed due to licensing issues, technical problems, or a server outage, you lose the game and potentially any progress you may have made.

This is exactly what happened to some users of Sony’s similar streaming game service [PlayStation Now](&lt;|url|&gt;). In 2015, [several *Assassin’s Creed* games](&lt;|url|&gt;) originally designed for the PlayStation 3 were made available through the subscription streaming platform on the PlayStation 4. By 2016, [those games were removed](&lt;|url|&gt;). The only way to play the games today would be to buy the old physical or downloadable versions and play them on an actual PS3 console.

This raises the even more complicated problem of what happens to the time and money you invest in a game. According to professor Jon Festinger of the [Centre for Digital Media](&lt;|url|&gt;), games have already faced issues where users can lose valuable data. “You buy a game, it’s an online game… and then you spend money, you buy upgrades, you do whatever,” he says. “And the game company decides, ‘This isn’t financially worthwhile, and we’re closing it down.’ And so everything that you’ve invested in the game is now gone.”

If you’re watching [your favorite show on Netflix](&lt;|url|&gt;), it could disappear from their library before you get to finish it. That’s not great, but at least you could [pick it back up on Hulu](&lt;|url|&gt;) or by other means without losing anything. You can’t “unwatch” the episodes you’ve seen. Your games, on the other hand, include your progression, achievements, inventory, and experience. These can be lost to the ether if you can’t export them. Even if you buy the game somewhere else, you’d have to start over.

Sony indirectly dealt with this problem on PlayStation Now by letting users [download and transfer game saves](&lt;|url|&gt;) to a console. If you dig around in your system’s files, you could copy game saves from your PS4 to a PS3 ([or vice versa](&lt;|url|&gt;)). It’s a tedious process, but it at least gives the player some autonomy. Stadia, on the other hand, [won’t have a console at all](&lt;|url|&gt;). With nothing to download saved files to, there’s no way to preserve your progress on your own terms, unless Google expands [its Takeout service](&lt;|url|&gt;) — which allows users to download Google data like Gmail — to include game saves.

According to Google’s presentation, developers will have the ability to [migrate game save data](&lt;|url|&gt;) if they so choose, but this just puts players at the mercy of a different company. Without direct access to your save data — which players [easily have access to](&lt;|url|&gt;) in most downloadable games today — users run the risk of losing tens or even hundreds of hours of progress on the whims of gaming juggernauts. Large companies managing popular games will almost certainly enable this feature, but smaller developers may not have the resources. And unpopular or dead games can get left behind.

Speaking of dead games, what happens when a game gets so old that it’s forgotten or the developer goes out of business? Such games are called [abandonware](&lt;|url|&gt;). Enthusiast sites like [My Abandonware](&lt;|url|&gt;) collect the files necessary to play old games that companies no longer maintain. This helps preserve games that would otherwise be lost to the ether. On a streaming platform like Stadia, there’s no way to access the game files, which means there’s no way to preserve them.
> # If Stadia, or another publisher, decides to remove a streaming-only game that’s not popular enough or too controversial, it could be lost forever.

This kind of preservation isn’t just relevant for connoisseurs of gaming history, either. The great sci-fi spoof show *Mystery Science Theater 3000* famously coined the phrase “[keep circulating the tapes](&lt;|url|&gt;)” in response to its viewers’ habit of recording and trading episodes of the show. During its early seasons, *MST3K* was only available on certain regional broadcast stations late at night. Fan circulation led to much wider exposure, a deal with the cable network Comedy Central, and decades later, its [very own Netflix revival](&lt;|url|&gt;).

With games exclusively on a streaming platform — and Google has announced that at least some games on the service [will be Stadia-exclusive](&lt;|url|&gt;) — there seems to be no way to download a game you bought and preserve it. If Stadia, or another publisher, decides to remove a streaming-only game that’s not popular enough or too controversial, it could be lost forever.

Ownership rights for digital media like music, TV, and film is already eroding, but with services like Netflix, the “tapes” can at least keep metaphorically circulating to ensure nothing is ever truly lost. If Netflix ever closes down, someone on the internet will probably have a (somewhat extralegal) copy of *Stranger Things* preserved out there somewhere. But average users can already lose legal access to content, as was the case when classic film site [FilmStruck shut down last year](&lt;|url|&gt;).

The choice to preserve game data may be out of Stadia users’ hands. As Festinger puts it, “It’s well worth watching to see what Google does with [Stadia], because their general position, certainly with Android, etc., was to build open platforms… But it’s up to Google whether they do that.” Unless Google proactively works to ensure that players can keep their data, that buying a game means you can access it forever, and that old or lost games can be preserved, Stadia would end game ownership on its platform — and, if it catches on, the whole concept of game ownership might be lost entirely. If that happens, we could lose more than we’d ever realize.<|endoftext|>

# Why Do People Film Others in Distress Instead of Helping Them?

## Why Do People Film Others in Distress Instead of Helping Them?

### It’s not as simple as ‘people are the worst’

![Illustration: [Cathryn Virginia](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Cathryn Virginia](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

The video shows an older man on a New York City subway platform, struggling against a gush of filthy water that has forced him to the ground. Finally, he makes it to his knees and looks directly at the camera, as if in accusation: Why didn’t you help me?


After the clip went viral, people on Twitter wondered the same thing. “Drop the phone and help that man?” one person asked. “We are so much better at documenting the things we might have helped out with instead,” another said. It’s a familiar indictment of the social media age: We’d all rather record a clip for likes than actually do some good in the world. But the knee-jerk reactions to this clip — and plenty like it — may actually have things wrong. (Not for nothing, the clip itself also ends with someone walking toward the man; it’s possible he was ultimately helped.) Research shows the presence of cameras makes people more likely to intervene when they see someone in danger — not less.

It’s easy to see where the negative assumptions about uncaring “bystanders” comes from. Most people probably think of Kitty Genovese, a young New Yorker who, in 1964, was stalked, stabbed, and murdered outside her Queens apartment building while (supposedly) 38 people watched. The myth around the Genovese case is that none of these witnesses helped, and it’s from this story that the concept of the bystander effect — which suggests people are less likely to help someone if they’re around other people — was launched into the collective consciousness.

But that isn’t what actually happened. While initial reports said Genovese was attacked three times before her eventual death, the real number of attacks was [two](&lt;|url|&gt;). And there weren’t 38 witnesses who stood idly by. In reality, there were probably more like 12 people who heard suspicious noises, according to a *New York Times* [obituary of the murderer](&lt;|url|&gt;). Nor did they all stand by and do nothing — two people called the police, and one elderly woman held Genovese as she lay dying.

So, yes, there were people who were likely aware of the attack on Genovese and chose, for whatever reason, not to intervene. But there were also people who did do something to help. (If you want to learn more about the Kitty Genovese story and ensuing myths, I highly recommend this [*Inverse *article](&lt;|url|&gt;) about its impact on science, and an episode of the excellent podcast [*You’re Wrong About](&lt;|url|&gt;)* that delves into the story.)

This isn’t to say that the bystander effect doesn’t exist — it’s just more complicated than some of the original thought made it out to be. A [2011 meta-review](&lt;|url|&gt;) of research on bystander effect found that people are more likely to intervene when a situation is clearly an emergency — such as when someone has fallen to the ground and cried out after being robbed — in part because in such a situation, it’s clear beyond a doubt that someone actually needs help. In most situations, men are more likely to assist than women, primarily because men feel more physically capable of making a difference. And acquaintances are more likely to step in than strangers.

But when you factor in cameras and phones, things get even more interesting.

Linus Andersson is a lecturer in media and communication studies at Halmstad University in Sweden, who with his colleague Ebba Sundin is in the process of securing funding to research why people film instead of help. Though Andersson has no concrete answers on why this might be the case, he has some ideas.
> # Filming gives people agency when they might otherwise feel unable, or unwilling, to step in and lend a hand.

Filming, he says, “seems to be a very immediate way to come to grips with [an event]. It gives you the sense of doing something — instead of just being passive, you become some kind of active witness.” Filming gives people agency when they might otherwise feel unable, or unwilling, to step in and lend a hand.

And while there isn’t a lot of existing research on why people feel the urge to film a crisis with their phones, there is some literature suggesting that people are more likely to help when a camera is present. Marco van Bommel, an assistant professor of organizational psychology at the Open University in the Netherlands, has conducted research on how the presence of cameras affects bystanders. In one study, from [2013](&lt;|url|&gt;), he and his fellow researchers created two situations: one in which someone stole money from another person in the presence of bystanders and another in which someone stole money from another person in the presence of both bystanders and a security camera. People were more likely to help when there was a camera present, the study found.

Van Bommel conducted similar research looking at [online interactions](&lt;|url|&gt;), and found that when users had a webcam on them or felt like they were being watched or observed in some other way, they were more likely to provide needed support than if they didn’t feel they were being observed.

A [more recent study](&lt;|url|&gt;) backs up van Bommel’s findings. The researchers reviewed security camera footage of 219 violent situations in the U.K., the Netherlands, and South Africa, and found that, in 90% of cases, at least one person attempted to intervene. The study’s most surprising finding was that the more people were present at the event, the more likely it was that someone would step in. That directly contradicts the traditional theory of bystander intervention, in which people are less likely to help in a crowd.

Van Bommel says that he and his researchers speculate that, generally, people will be more likely to help in situations in which they feel like they’re being watched. “Sometimes there is something in the direct environment that helps them feel responsible again,” he says. These are called “accountability cues,” and van Bommel says they can be cameras, nametags, mirrors, or any other condition in which a person feels watched or reminded of their power and responsibility. “We think that when people are feeling accountable, they suddenly think more about their reputation and how it will look when they perform a certain action or fail to act at all,” he says. “To me, it seems likely that the camera on a smartphone can function as an accountability cue.”
> # People will be more likely to help in situations in which they feel like they’re being watched.

In other words, if a security camera or a webcam will make a bystander more willing to hop into a situation and lend a hand, the same theory likely applies to smartphone cameras, as well.

Which brings us back to a lingering question about the man nearly swept away in the subway station: Why did the bystander whip out their phone to record a video rather than wade into the water to help the victim? No direct research has been conducted on why people decide to document accidents and crimes rather than intervene, but there are a couple of good theories.

“I have had some conversations about this, where people indicated they felt filming was important for basically eyewitness purposes, i.e. helping the police with tracking down a criminal,” says van Bommel. “This may sound bad, but there is also another component to this: People who experience something bad may feel stressed, shocked, etc., and they need to relieve this by sharing their feelings and experiences with their friends.”

Van Bommel points out that, unless you were actually in the situation, it’s difficult to accurately judge how you would respond. If for whatever reason you’re not sure that the man in the water needed your help — though judging from the video, it appears that he did — research suggests you’d be considerably less likely to offer.

Further, if you don’t feel physically capable of helping — if you’re small, or a woman, or otherwise doubt your physical capabilities — you’re not going to feel comfortable enough wading into swiftly moving water on a subway platform to help someone. You might feel that you’re of more value on the sidelines, documenting the event so people have proof that the subway station is in a dangerous state of disrepair.

There is one situation for which we have evidence that a phone is a hindrance, not a help, and that’s when the bystander is having a phone conversation. A [2013 study](&lt;|url|&gt;) found that people were less likely to assist a subject wearing a leg brace who had dropped a stack of magazines if the bystander was on the phone. The study authors suggest that this could be because talking on your phone fulfills the need to belong, because you’re already engaged — and, thus, feeling a sense of belonging — to the person you’re talking with.

It stands to reason that more research needs to be done on how the presence of a phone affects bystander behavior. If the presence of cameras — which most phones now have, not to mention the oppressive ubiquity of security cameras — encourages bystander intervention, but talking on the phone decreases the likelihood that you’ll help someone, where are we left? It’s hard to say, but we’re probably not as “heartless” as pessimists would have us believe.<|endoftext|>

# A New Test Predicts When You’ll Die (Give or Take a Few Years)

## And insurance companies are already interested

![Photo: KTSDESIGN/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: KTSDESIGN/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images*

Soothsaying was once a fringe pursuit — the purview of psychics, subway cranks, and speed-addicted sci-fi novelists. Today, it’s big business. Abetted by new technology, thousands of salaried STEM types are now engaged in figuring out the future.

Among this crowd, Steve Horvath, a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles, stands out. He isn’t trying to predict what you’ll buy next or whether you’ll commit a violent crime after being paroled from prison. His project, almost magisterially bleak, is to figure out how much of the future you’ll actually get to see.

In a [paper](&lt;|url|&gt;) published this week in *Aging*, Horvath and his colleague Ake T. Lu formally announced a project they’ve been [teasing](&lt;|url|&gt;) for a couple months now: a “time to death” clock called DNAm GrimAge that they claim can predict, better than any other tool, when a given person might die. It was announced in tandem with AgeAccelGrim, which provides a countdown to the year you’ll develop cancer or coronary heart disease. Horvath said he can estimate the number of cigarettes someone has smoked in their lifetime and predict when they’ll go through menopause.
> # There’s a whiff of Theranos to Horvath’s promise that “a spoonful of blood is more than enough.”

The research has already captured the attention of the life insurance industry. After all, a solid death date could mean real savings when it comes to pricing policies.

Horvath has been tinkering with his clocks for nearly a decade now. Some of them sound even less inviting than GrimAge, which directly references the Grim Reaper. There’s last year’s “skin and blood clock,” for example, and the “pan-tissue” clock, which measured a person’s age. Its results were fairly impressive, with a median error of just 3.6 years, but the broader scientific community was nonplussed. There are, after all, less cumbersome ways to figure out how old a patient is. (Asking them is a good start.) And so Horvath set out to demonstrate that his method had more significant applications.

Central to that method is a process called methylation, which Horvath compares to rust. Over time, certain parts of our DNA become more methylated, or “rusted,” hastening the aging process along with our inevitable death. Horvath and Lu measured methylation spots from each of their DNA samples, which were taken from the blood of dead people. From there, GrimAge crunched the numbers and popped out the corresponding death dates. More often than not, these aligned fairly closely with the dates on record.

There’s a whiff of Theranos to Horvath’s promise that “a spoonful of blood is more than enough” for GrimAge. But Lu and Horvath aren’t isolated cranks: Researchers all over the world are examining the connection between DNA and physical decline. Yan Zhang, a researcher at the German Cancer Research Center, came out with his “[mortality risk score](&lt;|url|&gt;)” in 2017, and just last week, researchers at the University of Edinburgh announced their own [scoring system](&lt;|url|&gt;) for predicting mortality based on DNA. Lu and Horvath’s project may sound implausibly futuristic, but they’re not advancing any radical claims on its behalf. Horvath likens GrimAge to a more powerful microscope, a refinement of something that already exists.

The 2,356 blood samples that Lu and Horvath used came from the Framingham Heart Study, a well-known cardiovascular cohort study with data that has been used in many medical papers. That study includes medical information for its participants, which gave GrimAge something to measure against. The paper is amply sourced, and its co-authors are affiliated with a range of major research centers, like Northwestern, Columbia, and Stanford.

Still, the only living person to get a GrimAge reading so far is Horvath himself. He had fared pretty poorly on his pan-tissue clock — “I want to say I was four or five years older than expected; I didn’t like that” — but according to GrimAge, he’s on track to die more or less when he expected.

He does not offer his service to anyone else — and people have asked — for the reason that, from a medical perspective, it’s effectively useless. There is not much value in knowing you only have 10 years (or five years, or six months) to live, because “clinicians only order tests if they have a treatment strategy.”

But the hope is that if and when legitimate anti-aging drugs are developed, GrimAge could be used to test their effectiveness. In a world with functional anti-aging drugs, “doctors could test [your GrimAge number] and say, ‘You know what, you’re aging too quickly. Take this,’” Horvath said.

This scenario would be the culmination of a lifelong dream for Horvath. As a teenager in Germany, more than 30 years ago, he and his friends actually made a pact to solve the problem of death. “At some point, we realized that this was one of the central problems of human existence: our short lives,” he said. They called their initiative the Gilgamesh project, after the Sumerian king who hoped to conquer mortality.

But there are other, more immediate uses for Horvath’s invention.

The Affordable Care Act’s preexisting conditions clause and the [Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act](&lt;|url|&gt;) (GINA) would prevent health insurance companies from considering a person’s GrimAge when determining a person’s rate. But GINA, according to Seth J. Chandler, a law professor at the University of Houston specializing in insurance, “quite deliberately excluded other forms of insurance.”

Companies like Reinsurance Group of America are already looking into Horvath’s methylation method as a way to price life insurance policies. Horvath frames this as a positive development: A bad candidate for life insurance — say, a diabetic smoker — might have their case bolstered by a better-than-expected GrimAge score. But the reverse, he concedes, is true as well, meaning otherwise healthy-seeming people might find themselves saddled with a worse policy or denied one outright.
> # “Life insurance kind of depends on people not having private information about how likely they are to die.”

There is also the possibility that life insurance as we know it would simply cease to exist.

“Life insurance kind of depends on people not having private information about how likely they are to die,” Chandler said. If the only people buying life insurance are those who know they’re going to die soon, the insurance industry would have to “raise its rates dramatically.”

Chandler envisions a post-GrimAge dystopia in which “someone who doesn’t get tested ‘voluntarily’ is now likely to be assumed by the insurance company to have gotten a bad result.” He figures that if GrimAge works and eventually takes off, life insurance would largely be supplanted by accidental death insurance — the sort of policy that was once widely popular but today is best known as a plot point in *Double Indemnity*. (For the time being, at least, GrimAge cannot measure your likelihood of dying via free-falling air conditioner, swerving convertible, or gunshot wound.)

Mark Kuczewski, director of the Neiswanger Institute for Bioethics at Loyola University Chicago, has a less apocalyptic view. “It’s only going to make a difference in marginal cases,” he said. “Would you use this instead of whether someone’s 100 pounds overweight? Instead of whether someone has a terrible history of genetic illness? Would you use this instead of whether they’re a three-pack-a-day smoker?”

While health insurance is safe for now, an accurate death estimator could only embolden those who don’t see the sense in shelling out for the sick. As Allison Hoffman, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania specializing in health insurance, points out, health care is an inherently redistributive system and is able to function that way primarily because we can’t know what will happen to someone*.*

“The closer we come to perfect knowledge, the more we have to reckon with the question of who should pay and how much?” Hoffman said. “I think it heightens the seriousness of those conversations.”

It is important to note that Horvath has no control over how GrimAge will eventually be used. His inventions are the property of UCLA, which excludes its researchers from the licensing process. And as Horvath is quick to emphasize, DNAm GrimAge’s results are, at present, “not very accurate.” A given GrimAge might be off by four or five years in either direction, meaning a given GrimAge might only reveal the decade you’ll die.

But at the rate Horvath and his colleagues are working, a more precise death clock can’t be far off. At that point, whatever use it’s eventually put to, we’ll have to reckon with the fact that it exists at all. How will we behave when we know exactly when death is coming for us?

Horvath, for his part, seems to be managing just fine, though he’s an admittedly unusual case.

“I love these tests,” he said. “I use my own private funds for measuring various clinical markers — I’m just interested.”

Horvath understands on an intellectual level why some people find his invention terrifying — he said his parents lived in fear that he’d covertly draw their blood — but he sounds almost cheerful when talking about his own death date.

“Some people believe information is power,” he explained. “Others don’t.”

# Wikipedia Doesn’t Know What to Do With Almost-Famous People

## An arcane moderation process leaves public-ish individuals in a lurch when articles get too personal

![Photo: picture alliance/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Photo: picture alliance/Getty Images*

Wikipedia bills itself as the encyclopedia “[anyone can edit](&lt;|url|&gt;).” It’s a phrase that gives the impression of an online Wild West, but layers of intricate systems and rules are in place to make sure everything stays on track.

Sometimes, though, things go wrong. Rules are bent or used to justify bad behavior. The Wikipedia platform is leveraged as a tool for abuse.

Take the case of Jenny Nicholson. She makes videos for YouTube about [theme parks](&lt;|url|&gt;), [bad books](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [porgs](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the rotund, squawking bird creatures from *Star Wars*. She’s not an elected official, and she doesn’t run a Fortune 500 company. Yet, for a time, her Wikipedia page included deeply personal information, like names of old pets and when she got a certain job. It was stuff that went well beyond simple biography.

Deciding what goes on Wikipedia — in terms of who or what gets an article and what information should be included — is a complicated affair. The online encyclopedia has massive documents detailing criteria like [notability of subjects](&lt;|url|&gt;), what [sources of information are reliable](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [how to write biographies of living people](&lt;|url|&gt;). For subjects that obviously merit inclusion, like [the president](&lt;|url|&gt;) or [the CEO of a major tech company](&lt;|url|&gt;), the system is supposed to keep information accurate, neutral, and respectful. In edge cases like the one Nicholson faces, however, there’s a lot more room to fail.
> # The result was an article that felt less like an encyclopedia entry and more like a report from a stalker.

As Nicholson explained earlier this month [in a thread on Twitter](&lt;|url|&gt;), an old version of her Wikipedia page contained detailed personal information that was sourced from a backlog of thousands of tweets, many of which were made long before she began her YouTube career in earnest. While the tweets were technically public, they were also part of that vast digital archive that most of us have but rarely think about — and certainly never expect someone to comb through and mine for minor details. The result was an article that felt less like an encyclopedia entry and more like a report from a stalker.


Other YouTubers chimed in to note similar problems with their own Wikipedia entries. Natalie Wynn, who runs the left-wing video essay channel [ContraPoints](&lt;|url|&gt;), pointed out that the citation for her hometown was actually sourced from [a tweet she had made about astrology](&lt;|url|&gt;). Harry Brewis, who runs the video essay channel [hbomberguy](&lt;|url|&gt;), shared that [Wikipedia got his age wrong](&lt;|url|&gt;), and when he attempted to correct it, editors reverted his changes.

Of course, YouTubers aren’t the only ones subjected to questionable entries on Wikipedia. At the time of writing, Wikipedia’s directory of [articles nominated for deletion](&lt;|url|&gt;) included an “actor” whose only listed role on IMDb was a small part he played when he was nine. His biography listed his ancestry, where he went to school, and his favorite cricket team. Another entry for a fitness expert listed where he lived when he was 10 and how many siblings he had. Yet another article for a Puerto Rican vocalist was so lacking in notable information that one editor believed she may not even exist. (Her music was available on Spotify, but no other major news sources about her were found.) It still listed where she went to school, who she performed with, and members of a band she supposedly started.

Wikipedia’s policies on reliable sources [forbid the use of self-published sources like tweets](&lt;|url|&gt;). The site allows for some limited exceptions when the person is publishing information about themselves, but even in those cases, the article has to follow Wikipedia’s policies regarding [biographies of living people](&lt;|url|&gt;). If the subject is a person and alive — as Nicholson is — Wikipedia specifically cautions against collecting personal information about them.

According to Trudi Jacobson, head of the Information Literacy Department at the University at Albany, SUNY, the policy against self-published sources makes plenty of sense. “Social media posts really are not appropriate or possibly even permissible for tertiary sources such as dictionaries or encyclopedias, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be used,” Jacobson says. Self-reporting sources like social media are unlikely to be neutral and, even when covering basic details, might not be reliable.

Yet, as Nicholson’s case highlights, things that are against the rules can still happen. “Ideals and reality are in conflict here,” Jacobson says. “While some reputable biographical settings, such as Wikipedia, have a number of policies that should preclude social media posts… from being included, the reality is that anything one has put out publicly might be used, shared, or covered in some way.”

### **Wikipedia’s immune system**

Wikipedia has a number of methods to find articles that don’t conform to its standards, but they’re not infallible. According to the Wikimedia Foundation, which owns the Wikipedia domain and framework, a group of volunteers called the New Page Patrol examines new articles as they’re added. In addition, automated bots crawl Wikipedia constantly to look for “common errors or forms of vandalism,” according to a spokesperson for the foundation. But none of these tools caught Nicholson’s article. It wasn’t new when the problematic personal information was added, and it didn’t trigger the automated vandalism warnings.

The next safeguard is human moderation. Users can keep an eye on existing articles by adding them to their [Watchlist](&lt;|url|&gt;). “By default, the person who initially creates an article is watching the article,” says a spokesperson for the Wikimedia Foundation. “Other editors will usually add the article to their watchlist as it is categorized and tagged or as they make changes themselves.”
> # “Ultimately, the success of an article depends on its readership and how many people are interested in that topic.”

With 200,000 volunteers editing articles every month, the goal is for someone to always be watching, but that may not always be true. In Nicholson’s case, the attention the article received from her tweets become a necessary part of Wikipedia’s immune system. As the Wikimedia Foundation explains, “Ultimately, the success of an article depends on its readership and how many people are interested in that topic; the more participation and interest there is any given topic, the higher the quality of the articles around that topic tend to be.”

Frustratingly, that means the counterpoint — that the fewer people showing interest in an article, the lower the quality of that article might be — can also be the case. To wit, Nicholson was aware of an older revision of her article that listed irrelevant and personal information. It was live for at least a couple months.

“It didn’t sound right, like a legitimate Wikipedia article. Like, the language was clumsy. It was a little parasocial and listed irrelevant things,” she explains. However, Nicholson didn’t act on it because, she says, “I just assumed it was going to get edited or deleted over time.” Indeed, Wikipedia’s system is designed to do that, but it failed in this case, in part because too few people were paying attention.

### **Reaching consensus**

Even once a problem is discovered, resolving it can take time. The Wikipedia Foundation notes that volunteers craft and enforce Wikipedia’s policies. Since many of the site’s policies can be contradictory or subjective, volunteer editors resolve disputes among themselves via a process called [consensus](&lt;|url|&gt;). As Stephen Harrison, who writes the [Source Notes](&lt;|url|&gt;) column for *Slate* about Wikipedia and the internet’s knowledge ecosystem, explains, “Members of the Wikipedia community will debate whether proposed edits are consistent with the site’s [policies and guidelines](&lt;|url|&gt;)… If the discussion leads to a consensus **— **for example, that certain personal information is not appropriate for the encyclopedia **— **then that content will be removed.”

The consensus process can get messy. It’s not dictated by a vote and rarely leaves everyone involved happy. To achieve consensus, editors discuss the problems and make changes until the result is a version of the article most people are satisfied with.

But consensus takes time. When even more unsettling personal details were added to Nicholson’s article, she decided to speak up publicly on Twitter. The same day, the article was heavily pared down and locked, and editors began a discussion page to debate deleting the article entirely. During that time, most older versions of her article were still available through the revision history feature. Wikipedia’s policies allow at least one week to debate deleting an article.

Consensus is also a messy process. In the now-deleted talk page for Nicholson’s article, one user asked if they could find a suitable photo that Wikipedia has the rights to. Another user chimed in, saying, “Any picture posted to social media is in the public domain,” which is categorically false: Uploading a photo to social media does not remove its copyright.

In another part of the talk page, a user questioned why Nicholson would want her article deleted, since she makes money by creating YouTube videos, and further opined, “I don’t see anything in this article that could in any way be a threat to her safety.” Wikipedia’s policies on whether a subject is “notable” do not take into account how a subject makes their living or how much they may want coverage, instead focusing on whether a subject has had “significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject.” Nor do its policies require private information to be a threat to a person’s safety to justify deletion. In other words, both of these opinions are irrelevant.

Of course, the talk page’s purpose is for debate. People being wrong and eventually (hopefully) corrected is the point. The ideal here, to borrow Jacobson’s term, is that Wikipedia editors will spot a problem with an article in a timely manner, debate the issues, eventually come to a consensus, and make the appropriate edits or deletions. The reality, on the other hand, is that there is no team of editors on standby discussing every article for every YouTuber, Instagrammer, or TikTok star with a following. Sometimes things slip through the cracks.

From Wikipedia’s perspective, this is the process working as intended. For subjects on the edge of (or outside) notability, however, it can feel like a bigger deal. Until Wikipedia editors discover a problem and take the proper action, detailed information about anyone with even mild notability can end up centralized and indexed for weeks or months. Wikipedia’s process requires a lot of time, energy, and manpower. But how many of those resources are going to be devoted to every musician, child actor, or YouTuber?

As Nicholson puts it, “I get the idea of a public right to information. Like, what if it’s a politician? Or a really influential CEO? But when it’s a YouTuber, I just don’t know.” Wikipedia doesn’t know, either, until a problem is discovered, consensus is reached, and action is taken. Until that process is finished, it can cause a lot of stress for the subject — assuming the person exists, of course.<|endoftext|>

# A Grieving Sandy Hook Father on How to Fight Online Hoaxers

## Lenny Pozner lost his son in the 2012 mass shooting, only to be attacked by internet trolls. He talks with OneZero about battling back.

After the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 — which killed 26 people, 20 of them children — it surely seemed that if nothing else, Americans could agree on the abhorrent nature of the tragedy. The country may be divided on gun control and the proper political response to mass shootings, but who could doubt that they were real, and horrible?

Yet not long after Sandy Hook, alternative narratives began to take hold on the internet, attempting to proffer new — and utterly false — theories as to what happened that day. One claims that Sandy Hook was a “false flag” event engineered by the U.S. government, utilizing “crisis actors” — fake victims, in other words — to promote stricter gun control laws. Far-right radio host Alex Jones used his show *Infowars* to peddle this story, openly inciting violence against those standing in the way of the “truth.”

As a result, family members of the children who died — people who have already suffered unimaginably — have been harassed online and in real life by a contingent of die-hard hoaxers.

Many of the families have chosen to remain silent in the hope that attacks by conspiracy theorists would melt away. But Lenny Pozner, father of six-year-old Sandy Hook victim Noah, has chosen another way. Pozner began to counter-troll the trolls, flagging thousands of conspiracy videos for policy violations which led to them being taken down. He has also brought the issue to national attention through media appearances, op-eds, open letters, and litigation that helped speed the downfall of Jones.
> # *I soon realized that many of the attackers were fringe internet personalities who used the shooting to profit. They didn’t care about the truth.*

Pozner now heads up [HONR Network](&lt;|url|&gt;), a company that helps the families of those affected by such mass shootings deal with the digital aftermath. Fresh from [winning](&lt;|url|&gt;) a defamation lawsuit, Pozner spoke with *OneZero* about coping with loss, his work with HONR Network, and the future of online misinformation.

*This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.*

### ***OneZero*: Tell us about Noah. What was he like, and what’s your favorite memory of him?**

**Lenny Pozner: **Noah was an inquisitive boy, full of life and wonder. He always wanted to know the hows and whys of things. He was very caring; he loved animals and his family. Of course he had a special bond with his twin sister [Arielle]. He loved superheroes and trucks and playing outside. He was just a delightful, energetic, joyful little boy. You couldn’t help but smile when you were around him.

### **What do you remember from the day of the shooting?**

It was just a regular weekday. We had no premonition or sense of impending doom. The children got ready for school and, as usual, the morning was a bit rushed. Noah ran into the school just in time for the bell marking the beginning of the school day. That is my last memory of him, running with his jacket half on, carrying his backpack.

### **What happened when you first searched your son’s name online? When did you first realize this was a problem, and how did it feel?**

The attacks on Sandy Hook, on the victims and their families, started almost immediately after the news broke of the shooting. But for the first few weeks after Noah was murdered, I was consumed with grief and had to deal with my own emotional trauma as well as that of Noah’s sisters. I was in shock. At some point I went online in January of 2013. I was looking for information about the shooting and saw some posts claiming that Sandy Hook was a fake. This led to *Infowars* forums. As soon as I saw the posts, I emailed the head of *Infowars*, Alex Jones.

I tried to reach out to people and talk to them. I thought that if people could ask me questions, learn more about Noah, see his birth certificate and school records and childhood photos, logic would take over. I believed that they would understand that this tragedy occurred, that they would see us as real people suffering. Many people were awakened to the reality of the murders and our suffering. But I soon realized that many of the attackers were fringe internet personalities who used the shooting to profit. They didn’t care about the truth.

### **You’ve had Sandy Hook hoaxers challenge you in public, and track you down at home. What happened?**

Hoaxers have posted my TransUnion comprehensive background check online. They have videotaped my home, shared my address, and filed false reports with several enforcement agencies. They have confronted me in public, and one woman [Lucy Richards] [was jailed](&lt;|url|&gt;) due to credible death threats. Every aspect of my personal life has been intruded upon and years later, I am still living in hiding.

### **How can the phenomenon of crisis actors, hoaxes, and false flag theories be quelled? What motivates these people to lie about such a horrific event?**

Conspiracy theories have existed in some form since the beginning of recorded history, as have their purveyors. Some people have always been motivated by power or greed. They position themselves as sources of “true” information and sell fear to the gullible. These types of people aren’t acting based on their own versions of morality or because they believe a lie. They are using and selling whatever story people are buying. The real difference is that thanks to the internet, hoaxers no longer have to travel village to village selling snake oil. Now they can create a blog [and] interact with other hoaxers, which adds legitimacy to their positions. [They can] monetize their claims and spread their tales to an endless number of gullible consumers.
> # *People have the right to be wrong; they have the right to be stupid. What they don’t have is the right to harass and attack me.*

The reasons that people believe the hoaxers [are] more complex. From a psychological perspective, many people seek a simple answer to something frightening and out of their control. They need a way to deal with how unpredictable and fragile life can be. Tragedies like Sandy Hook are almost incomprehensible. In an effort to make sense of the senseless, people search for a reason and something or someone to blame and vilify.

There is a significant difference between someone’s private, personal beliefs and their actions. You can’t prevent people from believing even the most outlandish and offensive things. In this country, people have the right to be wrong; they have the right to be stupid. They even have the right to spread their stupidity. What they don’t have the right to do is to violate my right to be free from harassment and attack. They don’t have the right to defame me, they don’t have the right to harass, intimidate, and threaten my family, and they don’t have the right to manipulate and incite others to carry out their campaigns. The only way to stop this type of behavior is through the platforms that hoaxers use to spread misinformation banning behavior that violates my rights as a citizen.

### **How significant a role did Alex Jones play in your case specifically, and how important was it that he was de-platformed? And did the jailing of Lucy Richards deter other hoaxers from threatening you?**

Thanks to his huge fan base and ability to broadcast his views to millions of people, Alex Jones’ high profile certainly played a significant role in the attacks on me and my family. People like Lucy Richards consume his content and because he has all of the physical trappings of a legitimate news organization, people blindly believe and respond.

I continue to be threatened, I continue to live in hiding, so I can’t say that the jailing of Lucy Richards has been a deterrent to hoaxers. But prosecuting her and ultimately having her jailed has helped the media and internet platforms take the situation much more seriously. The division between the “real” world and the online world doesn’t exist. You can’t simply turn off the computer and have the threats and harassment and danger end.

### **Tell us about why you created HONR **Network** and what it does. Who works with you on the project?**

As hoaxers escalated their attacks on me and Noah, I started to be contacted by people who wanted to alert me to horrific content that they came across. Many offered to flag what they found for removal. This grew into a loosely-knit group of people whom I termed the “HONR Network,” a combination of the word “honor” and a domain name acronym that I had for a past website project.

Over the years, the volunteers have grown in size and we have around 300 people at any given time, searching for content and flagging it for removal. I keep the identities of almost everyone who works with HONR Network private, since hoaxers have been known to target people who have openly supported our work, attacking them on social media, doxxing them, or directly harassing them. Even my lawyers and their families have been threatened and abused.

### **What kind of strategies help defeat misinformation? What can the average web user do to support the truth?**

Critical thinking. People need to take a moment and question the logic of the content that they are consuming, without blindly believing and then spreading. They also need to examine the source of information. Someone who is saying shocking things and then trying to sell you vitamin supplements to prepare you for the end of civilization might not be the most reliable source of truthful information.

People should also avoid getting their information from “echo chambers” where all of the information just affirms existing beliefs. When one source tries to convince people that they must stop listening to other sources or that “mainstream” media is part of the conspiracy, that is a strong indication that that source isn’t trustworthy.

### **Have social media companies been supportive? What have they done to support HONR **Network**?**

Initially, social media companies and internet platforms ignored me. It was uncharted territory for all concerned, and there was a hope that the situation would go away. In the first five years, we issued tens of thousands of take-down requests. The magnitude of the number of videos and content resulted in incremental changes. But it felt as if every single removal was hard fought.

However, two events, nearly a year apart, changed my relationship with social media. First, Lucy Richards was convicted and sent to prison for death threats against me. This made many of these companies take notice. It wasn’t “just” online bullying — people were using social media to organize and then take their threats off-line.

The real significant changes came after the [*Guardian* printed my open letter](&lt;|url|&gt;) to Mark Zuckerberg. Readers were horrified to discover the lengths to which we were forced to go, simply to protect ourselves and to try to end the harassment and threats. Other media and investors took notice, and in turn, Facebook took notice. The letter started a cascade effect that resulted in the de-platforming of Alex Jones and others like him. Facebook and Google have been much more proactive since, engaging with us about policy changes to better protect harassment victims and recently, Facebook added the mocking of victims to be against their terms of service policies.

The goal of the HONR Network is to provide assistance for victims of online hate and harassment. Going forward we want to expand our relationships with social media providers and platforms to better effect policy changes that protect victims and hold perpetrators responsible.

### **Are you optimistic that the culture of online information could be changed for the better?**

The problem facing online platforms isn’t new nor is it unique. Technology has historically outpaced the regulation and education needed to protect users.
> # *The answer is creating regulation, codifying “rules of the road,” and educating users as to their rights and responsibilities online.*

At the turn of the last century in Detroit, the mass production of automobiles created a huge problem. There were no licenses, driving was unregulated, and the concept of road safety didn’t exist. People simply drove wherever and however they wanted, resulting in thousands of people in Detroit alone being killed by drivers due to a lack of basic skills and safety parameters. It was only when strict road rules, enforcement, and public education were implemented that fatalities dropped and a standard of acceptable behavior behind the wheel became the norm.

Similarly, today technology has outpaced the most basic need for rules of the road, and online pedestrians, especially those who make easy targets, are paying the price. The answer is creating regulation, codifying “rules of the road,” and educating users as to their rights and responsibilities online.

Law enforcement needs to catch up. Police see cybercrime as a low-level priority, often failing to understand that online harassment can have very serious off-line consequences, including violence and even murder. Harassment is already against the law; people in positions of authority need to be educated​ as to how to implement existing laws in a changing world.

# The Best Wireless Earbuds Actually Have Wires

## The new Powerbeats Pro earbuds are a sign that newer isn’t always better

![](<|image|>)

Our gadgets are thinning. Though they occupy more of our attention than ever, they ask for less physical space: Apple has cleaved 3.9 entire millimeters from the iPhone since its debut, and popular earbuds increasingly eschew wires.

To that end, Beats has now released, for $250, the Powerbeats Pro “totally wireless” earbuds. Marketed to athletes, they clip around your ears and hold firm. Their buds are technically the style that would go inside your ear canal, but the design of the exterior shell keeps them nestled just outside of it instead — which does mean, like the AirPods before them, they have some issues isolating sound. (Namely: They don’t, really.)

Beats sent me these new Powerbeats for review, and while I liked them overall, they reminded me that the best wireless earbuds I’ve used actually have one key thing: a wire.

![Powerbeats Pro. Credit: Apple.com](<|image|>)*Powerbeats Pro. Credit: Apple.com*

This superior breed is the Beats X, an earlier product from the maker of Powerbeats Pros. They cost a more reasonable $100, and though they wirelessly connect to your phone using Bluetooth, there’s a cord that links the left earbud to the right. It sometimes slaps my neck when I run with them. And that’s all okay. After trying smaller and smaller wireless earbuds on thinner and thinner phones, I’ve decided the best model is the one that’s at peace with its dangly splendor. The Beats X have sinuous wires hidden beneath a plastic coating that hangs around your head, with buttons to control your music, summon Siri, and power on or off. They’re against trend. But they also work really well.

Unlike AirPods and the Powerbeats Pro, Beats X are greedy for your ears. Pick the right earbud tips — the package comes with a few different sizes — and, reader, they will fill you. Outside noise will be blocked, allowing you to listen at more [responsible and safer volumes](&lt;|url|&gt;). The Beats X are designed to journey inside your canals, while AirPods and the Powerbeats Pro rest just outside them, as if they’re nervous to offend. It reduces their effectiveness in noisier places, urging you to pump that music louder and louder.

The cord gives the Beats X additional real estate for three simple functions: volume toggles, and a center button that plays or pauses your music. You can also hold that middle guy down to prompt Siri, which listens to you through the earbuds’ microphones. It works much better than AirPods — which don’t even offer volume adjustment — and it’s also got an edge on the Powerbeats Pro, which do feature dedicated volume buttons but require awkward presses against your ear to do anything else.

The Powerbeats’ main buttons are right around where their buds are — the “b” logo in the image above — which means you can end up mashing them into your ear to pause your music or switch songs. It’s a tricky prospect when you’re running, in particular. I was constantly nervous about pressing them too hard and hurting myself, and the double-push required to move forward in a playlist was difficult with a treadmill whirring beneath me.

![You’ll feel the Beats X hanging around your neck like an electric collar, but so what?](<|image|>)*You’ll feel the Beats X hanging around your neck like an electric collar, but so what?*

The wire on the otherwise wireless Beats X earbuds also means you can pop these babies out and drop them. They’ll catch around your neck, magnetized to one another. Not to be a Goldilocks, but frankly, it’s just right — more convenient than pulling AirPods or the Powerbeats out and holding them in your hand or sliding them back into their charging case.

As with any gadget, your mileage will vary, of course. But the Beats X are a reminder that something is lost in the trend toward ever more light-footed tech. Consider that while a lot has been written about the [conspicuousness](&lt;|url|&gt;) of AirPods, their goal is really to disappear. They’re small, they pop in and out in a second, you might be able to cover them with your hair, and you can use them without fiddling with any obvious controls. Some have argued they might save us from “[peak screen](&lt;|url|&gt;);” it’s certainly the case that an AirPods wearer is less of an absent drone than the person lost in their iPhone. In a sense, they’re so un-present that they don’t even accomplish the core headphone thing of blocking noise well.

Which is really to say: As buds propelling sound into your ears, they kind of suck. The Powerbeats Pro improves on the AirPod design — they fit better, they have actual buttons, the sound quality is superior — but the core issues inherent to packing so much into standalone wireless earbuds persist. Relative to the Beats X, the controls don’t work as well and they isolate sound poorly. Their selling point is simply that they’re purely wireless, which on further reflection feels like a tech solution in search of a human problem.

The Beats X, meanwhile, feel like they’re from a simpler age — 2017! — when headphones may have had a wire or two to better accomplish the job of filling your head with music.

# Google Could Get Tons of Data From Its Gaming Platform

## Stadia sounds great, but don’t forget that Google is a research company

![Illustration: [Yoshi Sodeoka](&lt;|url|&gt;)](<|image|>)*Illustration: [Yoshi Sodeoka](&lt;|url|&gt;)*

For all of Google’s colorful products and [silly games](&lt;|url|&gt;) — not to mention the search engine you use every day — it’s easy to forget that it’s also one of the world’s biggest research companies. It gathers data on everything from [education](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [UX design](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [artificial intelligence](&lt;|url|&gt;). It even studies how you use sites like [YouTube](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [Gmail](&lt;|url|&gt;). So, what could it do with the kind of data it gets from users through its new Stadia game-streaming platform?

If Stadia works as described, it has the potential to [upend how the gaming industry works](&lt;|url|&gt;). But it will also give Google a trove of data it didn’t have before. Basic information like what games a user buys, how long they play, and what devices they play on can provide valuable insights that might help Google do what it does best: sell ads.
> # “A good psychologist should be able to watch how most of us game and understand a whole lot about us.”

But *how* you play your games may be the most valuable data of all, according to Jon Festinger, a professor at the [Centre for Digital Media](&lt;|url|&gt;), a graduate program in Canada that focuses on design. While Google can already gauge your interests or political leanings from things like your search history, video games involve actively making decisions that reveal a surprisingly intimate picture of who you are.

“It’s a walking, talking Rorschach test onto which you project your decision-making,” Festinger says. “Are you timid? Are you bold? Do you take risks? What kind of risks do you take? What do you see and not see? Where are your blind spots? A good psychologist should be able to watch how most of us game and understand a whole lot about us.”

Bethesda and Ubisoft, two game publishers partnering with Google on Stadia, didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether their titles would be used for data collection purposes. But even without publisher involvement, video games have been used to research how people think. For example, researchers have examined teamwork dynamics by [studying guilds in *World of Warcraft](&lt;|url|&gt;)* and have [studied voice chat](&lt;|url|&gt;) to learn how men and women are treated differently.

Rachel Kowert, PhD, research director at [Take This](&lt;|url|&gt;), a nonprofit aimed at increasing support for mental health issues in the gaming community, explains the situation this way to *OneZero*: “In online games, I would measure the distance that people stand from one another in-game. What level of intimacy does that show? How many social interactions are they having with people when they play role-playing games versus when they’re playing first-person shooters?”

This kind of existing research is often done with very limited pools of data, usually provided by how players describe themselves. “We ask players to recall what behavior they have in-game, how much time they’re spending in-game,” Kowert says.
> # “Google’s going to have players’ data across age, across region, across gender, across genre.” This is on top of the data it already collects from your email, search history, location history, and more.

Game developers have also started studying their own player data in recent years, but they usually keep their analytics in-house. Google’s house is much larger. While a company like *World of Warcraft* developer Blizzard might study player behavior in order to improve a game or come up with [a new monetization scheme](&lt;|url|&gt;), Google has its fingers in everything from [smartphone software](&lt;|url|&gt;) to [home automation and security](&lt;|url|&gt;).

“I think the unique advantage that Google’s going to have is players’ data across age, across region, across gender, across genre,” Kowert says. This is, of course, on top of the data the company already collects from your email, search history, location history, and more.

Since 2012, [the company’s privacy policy](&lt;|url|&gt;) has allowed Google to combine data collected about you from one service with all the data it gets from the others. So far, Stadia has been marketed as a Google service (and even has a spot [in the Google Store](&lt;|url|&gt;)), so it’s reasonable to assume data collected about you via Stadia could end up connected to everything else Google knows about you.

When reached for comment about whether Google will conduct research on users or develop non-gaming products with player data, a Google representative simply said that the company “will have more to share on platform specifics as we get closer to launch.”

However, we know Google can use seemingly unimportant data to build powerful products. Back in 2007, the company launched a telephone search service called GOOG-411, itself a subset of its VOIP and voicemail service, [Google Voice](&lt;|url|&gt;). Users of GOOG-411 could call a toll-free number to search for local businesses. Since smartphones [weren’t common yet](&lt;|url|&gt;), it was a valuable free service for consumers.

And Google got something out of the deal: [phonemes](&lt;|url|&gt;). In [an interview at the 2007 Web 2.0 Summit](&lt;|url|&gt;), Marissa Mayer, then Google’s vice president of search products and user experience, explained that people who used the service provided Google the speech samples it needed to build a robust speech-to-text product.

“The speech recognition experts that we have say, ‘If you want us to build a really robust speech model, we need a lot of phonemes,’ which is a syllable as spoken by a particular voice with a particular intonation… So, 1-800-GOOG-411 is about that,” Mayer said.

At launch, the only hint that GOOG-411 was using your voice data to bolster its phonemes was [buried in its privacy policy](&lt;|url|&gt;). It was covered in the news as [a basic 411 service](&lt;|url|&gt;); its larger goal was [revealed months later](&lt;|url|&gt;).

This gave Google an edge in the still-burgeoning voice command market. By 2010 — shortly before [GOOG-411 was shut down for good](&lt;|url|&gt;) — the company introduced [Voice Actions for its Android phones](&lt;|url|&gt;). Eventually this feature was [integrated into Google Now](&lt;|url|&gt;). After [a rebrand in 2016](&lt;|url|&gt;), it became Google Assistant, which is used [on more than 1 billion devices today](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [could bring the next billion users online](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Google continues to use this strategy even today. “Google Goggles” was [a neat machine learning–powered visual search toy](&lt;|url|&gt;), but engineers internally considered it a “[research project](&lt;|url|&gt;).” Today, that research has led to [Google Lens](&lt;|url|&gt;), an augmented reality app. Niantic, an internal Google startup, created a game called *Ingress* that [solicited more than 5 million location submissions](&lt;|url|&gt;) from players. That data went on to form the basis of the wildly popular [*Pokémon Go](&lt;|url|&gt;).* The [recently shuttered Inbox app](&lt;|url|&gt;) was used to test email features that were [eventually implemented in Gmail](&lt;|url|&gt;).

It’s impossible to say for certain what kind of products, features, or insights Google could get from analyzing player data. After all, it would’ve been impossible in 2007 to predict that a 411 number would be the seed that grew into a voice assistant that’s always listening to you. We know player data is useful and valuable, but we don’t know with certainty what it could lead to.

What is certain is that Google knows how to leverage seemingly innocuous data from one product and use it to refine or even launch an entirely new industry. For now, there’s still a lot we don’t know about how Stadia will work, if it will catch on, or if it will wind up in [the Google Cemetery](&lt;|url|&gt;) a few years down the road. When it arrives, though, don’t forget to check that privacy policy.<|endoftext|>

# AirPods Are Now One of Apple’s Most Important Products

## AirPods Are Now One of Apple’s Most Important Products

### *As the iPhone becomes less relevant, the wearables will rise*

![Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty*

Few Apple products have suffered the undue scorn and ridicule endured by AirPods.

Introduced in late 2016, Apple’s first wireless, Bluetooth earbuds were at first a [joke and a meme machine](&lt;|url|&gt;). People thought they looked ridiculous and were certain they’d fall out of your ears and vanish without a trace.

Pictures of [me wearing them](&lt;|url|&gt;) from the launch event popped up here and there, often with an accompanying laughter emoji. [*College Humor](&lt;|url|&gt;)* called them “a legitimately terrible idea,” and perfectly summarized the key concerns (“you’re going to lose them IMMEDIATELY”; “one’s going to fall out of your ear and onto something gross”).

But more than two years and millions of units later, the $159 AirPods have become a Herculean success story. The accessory is now vital to Apple’s future, according to Tim Bajarin, a longtime Apple analyst and president of Creative Strategies, Inc.

“Voice is a new part of the man-to-machine interface, and getting info on demand through a headset tied to services is an important part of what will be [Apple’s] future AR strategy,” said Bajarin.

Even if that strategy has yet to be fully communicated to customers, they’re clearly warming to the once-maligned headset. Apple CEO Tim Cook went out of his way to highlight them in an [earnings call](&lt;|url|&gt;) last year. “This product is a runaway hit, and we’re working hard to meet the incredible demand,” he said.

AirPods sales have helped drive Apple’s wearable segment, which includes Apple Watch and Beats, to [$10 billion in revenue](&lt;|url|&gt;) between 2017 and 2018. Put simply, AirPods are a complete success.

This is somewhat surprising, because it took awhile for my perception of Apple’s AirPods to meet reality. When I [reviewed the headphones](&lt;|url|&gt;) in September 2016, people stared. In those first weeks and months of use, I got the same question over and over again: “Don’t they fall out?”

They never did, and through cleaning, walking, running, or shaking my head vigorously, they never have. Granted, I may have the perfect ear shape for them: My tragus — [the fold of skin and cartilage that covers the ear canal](&lt;|url|&gt;) — is large enough to make a nice enclosure for the AirPods. I’m assuming this because so many people tell me how they have the wrong-shaped ears and that Apple’s similarly-shaped wired EarPods never stayed put. I would always encourage skeptics to try them before passing final judgement.

In the meantime, I used my AirPods almost every day. I listened to music, podcasts, and took calls. I’d pop one out of my ear, which automatically paused the audio, to stop by the coffee truck and place my order, and then pop the AirPod back in to keep listening.
> # Like most of Apple’s best products, AirPods simply work.

Then, somewhere along the way, I started noticing other people wearing AirPods. At first it was just the occasional sighting, like [spotting a green parrot in Brooklyn](&lt;|url|&gt;). However, I remember the moment when I stood in a New York City subway car and noticed more than a half dozen people wearing AirPods. Apple’s oddball product had broken through.

AirPods are not succeeding in spite of themselves. They fit better than people expected and contain excellent, if aging, technology. The power-sipping W1 chip makes five-hour battery life in a pair of tiny devices possible. The charging case effortlessly communicates with your iPhone (or Apple Watch) and recharges your AirPods while sitting inside your change pocket. They integrate with Siri and have above-average sound for in-ear audio devices.

Like most of Apple’s best products, AirPods simply work.

Apple rarely talks about the design process behind its products and wouldn’t comment on whether the AirPods’ current success exceeded expectations. In [an interview this month with CNBC’s Jim Cramer](&lt;|url|&gt;) — essentially designed to allay concerns about weaker-than-expected iPhone sales — Tim Cook noted how the company’s success in the wearables category was driven almost entirely by the Apple Watch and AirPods. He added that the growth has been unprecedented.

“If you take AirPods and the Watch separately, and you sort of back these up and align it to the launch date of iPod… you would find that each one, independently, is, like, four to six times ahead of where iPod was at a comparable period of time,” he said.

While it may seem be odd for a screenless product to achieve this level of prominence in the Apple ecosystem, it does make market sense.

“Apple’s primary strategy is to be a product development company,” Annette Zimmermann, an analyst at Gartner, said. “Meaning, drive growth by introducing new products to market. In that sense, the AirPods are important since they have been well received.”

Interest in the future of AirPods feels more like what you would expect for a feature-rich, stand-alone product like the iPhone than a typical audio accessory. Rumors about updates started more than a year ago, and many, [including me](&lt;|url|&gt;), expected Apple to introduce some kind of color option, feature, or component enhancement by late last year.

AirPods, however, have remained steadfastly unchanged since Apple introduced them more than two years ago. Now, everyone assumes 2019 is the year of the big update. Most people [anticipate AirPods 2](&lt;|url|&gt;) will get the W3 wireless chip, which arrived in the Apple Watch Series 4. Along with Bluetooth 5 support, it should deliver significant improvements in connection speeds and power consumption. Noise cancellation is possible, though I bet Apple skips it, since the effectiveness would be questionable for in-ear headphones. Apple will also finally integrate some health-related features. A heart rate sensor is likely (almost three years after Samsung introduced its [heart-rate-sensing wireless IconX](&lt;|url|&gt;) earbuds).

The potential addition of health technology will shift AirPods into Apple Watch’s more life-essential category. With [Series 4, the Apple Watch](&lt;|url|&gt;) could not only monitor our bodies for a damaging fall but could also keep tabs on our creaky hearts and even run [a single-line electrocardiogram](&lt;|url|&gt;). With heart rate monitoring, the oddball AirPods will seem like a more serious product, though most of that tracking will be exercise-related.

I also wonder if Apple will include some adapters with AirPods 2 — perhaps silicon bits that could slip over the ear portion to make them better fits for people with, ahem, smaller tragi.

This attention consumers and, ostensibly, Apple are paying to a mere accessory cannot be understated. The rise of AirPods (and the Apple Watch) comes at a time of [diminishing iPhone excitement and sales](&lt;|url|&gt;). The handsets are selling, but not as well as they once did, and without major innovation, it’s unlikely we’ll see another wave of iPhone upgrades in the near-term.

The anticipated updates to AirPods could, according to some experts, [supercharge sales](&lt;|url|&gt;). Apple has never broken out unit sales of AirPods, but according to a [report](&lt;|url|&gt;) from Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities, the number was around 16 million units for 2018. Kuo predicts that number will rise to roughly 100 million by 2021.

“We believe that there is a greater likelihood of legacy iPhone users buying AirPods than upgrading to new iPhone models,” Kuo reportedly said.

Still, AirPods trail behind the money-making elephant in the room: services like the App Store and Apple Pay. “In the greater scheme of things, Apple’s services business is even more important [than AirPods],” said Zimmermann. “Apple’s service business revenue was around $29 billion in 2017 and based on my estimates it will grow to around $39 billion in 2018. This is phenomenal.”

Plus, even if AirPods do grow to the sales levels Kuo predicted, Apple is unlikely to sell enough to make up for the iPhone shortfall.

That makes business (and math) sense, but there’s no denying that AirPods are primed to become Apple’s most visible product since people wore iPod Nanos on their sleeves. It’s like a tiny, dangling advertisement for how you can join the iOS ecosystem and enjoy Apple’s in-ear technology without ever worrying if you look like a dork — because we all do and yes, we’re proud of it.<|endoftext|>

# Privacy Is Just the Beginning of the Debate Over Tech

## Controversial ‘smart locks’ show the way that surveillance tech begins with the poor, before spreading to the rest of us

![Credit: Freer Law/Getty Images](<|image|>)*Credit: Freer Law/Getty Images*

In a weird case of who knew we had to fight for that particular right, last month a [judge ordered](&lt;|url|&gt;) that landlords in New York were required to “provide physical keys to any tenants who didn’t want to use the Latch smart locks installed on the building last September.” This legal ruling came after residents of an apartment building in Manhattan banded together and [successfully sued to prevent](&lt;|url|&gt;) their landlord from replacing the physical locks in the lobby with smart locks.

The Latch, and similar keyless locks opened using smartphones, are increasingly common features of apartment buildings across the U.S. In their opposition to this forced upgrading, tenants listed myriad reasons why the smart lock did not actually offer the enhanced convenience and security their landlord claimed it did. These issues ranged from some of the older residents not owning smartphones to larger concerns around the landlord being able to monitor and harass tenants. “I said I don’t want to be tracked, and the landlord laughed,” a 72-year-old resident of the building [told CNET](&lt;|url|&gt;).

We are all aware that smart technologies — data-driven, internet-connected, automated — are rife with [privacy](&lt;|url|&gt;) issues. There are countless examples, and the list grows every day. Smart locks [bring to life](&lt;|url|&gt;) many of the worst fears of privacy advocates. Such fears-turned-reality include the collection of personal data, which is then used to (secretly) create [detailed profiles](&lt;|url|&gt;) about our identity, preferences, behaviors, and routines. In addition to fueling an economy built on [personalized targeting](&lt;|url|&gt;), with this level of tracking comes a near-total loss of the “[obscurity](&lt;|url|&gt;)” that shields us from the disciplinary gaze of governments, corporations, and bosses.
> # When we accept a framing that is friendly to the surveillance-industrial complex, then we end up fighting on their turf, by their rules.

It’s not surprising that our skepticism of smart things tends to start with privacy. The problem, however, is that it also often ends with privacy. This framing limits our understanding of what’s at play and what’s at stake. Instead, when we talk about technology, we should be thinking about power dynamics*.*

There’s a reason why tech companies are happy to discuss privacy, fund luxe conferences about privacy, concede some points to advocates, and even create new professions like “[privacy and civil liberties engineering](&lt;|url|&gt;).” It’s because this framing does almost nothing to challenge the actual political economic system — based on [extracting data](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [expanding control](&lt;|url|&gt;) — that they have built and benefit from.

Sociologist Sami Coll argues that the concept of privacy has now become more like an “[ally of surveillance](&lt;|url|&gt;),” rather than its antidote. Privacy has come to be defined by individualistic ideas and solutions centered on being responsible digital consumers who practice good [cyberhygiene](&lt;|url|&gt;). But in a battle between plucky individuals who must protect themselves, and powerful institutions who want to poke, probe, and profile people, it is no mystery who wins. When we accept a framing that is friendly to — or has even been absorbed and appropriated by — the surveillance-industrial complex, then we end up fighting on their turf, by their rules. We might [win some skirmishes](&lt;|url|&gt;), but we will lose the war.

So when tenants in rent-stabilized apartments are trying to prevent landlords from installing facial recognition, they are not simply “sparking a debate about privacy and surveillance,” as [*CityLab *framed it](&lt;|url|&gt;). This isn’t just a case of people wanting a place to hide from prying eyes. Nor is it, as the landlords frame it, about a [false choice](&lt;|url|&gt;) between privacy versus security. And it is definitely not a [knee-jerk panic](&lt;|url|&gt;) response to innovation, as the anti-regulation, pro-corporate think tank the Mercatus Center argued.
> # They are not merely technological refuseniks. They are fighting at the frontlines of digital capitalism — and they need reinforcements.

Ultimately, this issue is about power: who has it, how do they wield it, what do they gain? And vice versa: who is excluded, targeted, squeezed?

The example of smart locks and facial recognition does a great job highlighting what’s really at stake because it’s a clear cut case of a less powerful group (tenants) resisting attempts by a more powerful group (landlords) to arm themselves with a [dangerous arsenal](&lt;|url|&gt;). Tenants aren’t even trying to advance their position — they’re just trying to not lose ground.

These power dynamics are more common, and a greater influence over the design and use of new technology, than we realize. Technology [materializes power](&lt;|url|&gt;), giving it a solid and durable form. What’s most important is not the technology itself, but instead the people, values, and organizations that are behind technology and the ways their interests are channeled through technology. Technology is not neutral, inevitable, or totally malleable. Hidden inside every technology is a bunch of human choices about what problems should be addressed, how resources should be spent, where trade-offs should be made, whose views are represented, why the technology should be used, and many other decisions that boil down to doing X, instead of Y or Z.

Much of the smart technology we’re now surrounded by is born from a system of profit and power that legitimizes itself through what the historian and critic Lewis Mumford identified, back in 1970, as the “[megatechnic bribe](&lt;|url|&gt;).” The conditions of this bribe are simple: In exchange for accepting what the system produces with minimal fuss, some people are granted access to modest luxuries of convenience and comfort, while many others are subjected to enhanced degrees of exploitation, extraction, and exclusion. The benefits for some rely on the harms for many.

In other words, we get distracted by the privilege of cool gadgets and regular upgrades while a supercharged system of surveillance capitalism is integrated into society. None of us explicitly agreed to this deal, but just like with a software license or terms of service, we have been given no choice but to “accept.”

Examples of this bribe can be found everywhere. When insurers offer discounted devices and other incentives as a way to [harvest valuable, personal data](&lt;|url|&gt;) from our smart homes and everyday lives. Or when tech companies [sell solutions](&lt;|url|&gt;) for optimizing urban systems and securitizing urban space, as a way of [taking over](&lt;|url|&gt;) the operations, oversight, and ownership of cities. This bribe is the very basis for many of the platforms we have come to rely upon — Uber rides, DoorDash deliveries, and rooms from Airbnb. It’s so cheap and convenient that we’ll overlook those inconvenient issues of worker exploitation, cutthroat expansion, value extraction, and the billions in venture capital that make those [services possible](&lt;|url|&gt;).

Bribery is a form of corruption. And as society is upgraded according to the needs of digital capitalism, the imperatives of profit and power have corrupted these smart technologies at their source. We might not have accepted the bribe in any meaningful way, but nonetheless it appears to be working like a charm.

As Virginia Eubanks demonstrates in her book, [*Automating Inequality](&lt;|url|&gt;),* capitalism often tests its newest methods to extract, exploit, and exclude on the least powerful, most marginalized groups in society — those who don’t even get the privilege of being bribed — before rolling them out to the rest of us. We should heed the warning told to Eubanks by a woman on welfare whose life is tracked and controlled at every step: “You should pay attention to what happens to us. You’re next.”

Unless, that is, we follow in the footsteps of those tenants who rejected the smart lock and the power dynamics it materialized. They are not merely technological refuseniks. They are fighting at the frontlines of digital capitalism — and they need reinforcements.<|endoftext|>

# Tech Events Aren’t Fun Anymore

## Tech Events Aren’t Fun Anymore

### *Google I/O brought some updates but no “gee whiz” moments*

![Photo: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty](<|image|>)*Photo: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty*

A conversation with a computer, a search that can “see” beyond the typed word, A.I. that can detect lung cancer before human doctors. These are all amazing achievements, and I bobbed my head appreciatively as Google CEO Sundar Pichai and various other execs unveiled them at this year’s Google I/O keynote.

But when I close my eyes and think of Google I/O events of years past, certain images flood in, like a team of parachute divers [jumping out of an airplane](&lt;|url|&gt;) to introduce Google Glass, a weather balloon delivering internet access from the sky, phones you assembled from [puzzle-like pieces](&lt;|url|&gt;), and [fabric that seemed alive](&lt;|url|&gt;). These achievements were stunning, audacious, and exciting.

But those days are gone.

Some might argue that the [products Google unveiled](&lt;|url|&gt;) on Tuesday — [privacy-focused](&lt;|url|&gt;) software updates and some fresh hardware iterations — are inspired in their own way. But I wonder what happened to the moon-shot-obsessed Google that [toyed with robots](&lt;|url|&gt;), cooked up ridiculous modular phone ideas, and put a giant [Android-powered labyrinth game](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the floor of the 2011 Google I/O convention space.

The relatively staid approach isn’t unique to Google. Look at Facebook, the company that just two years ago unveiled a [brain-computer interface](&lt;|url|&gt;) at its F8 conference. This year’s keynote was about quality of conversation, safe spaces, groups, privacy — [lots of privacy](&lt;|url|&gt;) — and [commerce](&lt;|url|&gt;) on the Facebook platform.

Microsoft’s last big developer conference moment was when it [introduced HoloLens](&lt;|url|&gt;) in 2015. The mixed-reality headset was totally unexpected and seemingly out of character for the once dull tech company. A few years later, and HoloLens is on [version two](&lt;|url|&gt;), but for Build 2019, Microsoft’s cloud service [Azure took center stage](&lt;|url|&gt;).

These developer conferences are still full of innovation, but that sense of experimentation — the risk factor, the “look what we just did” — is gone. The crazy ideas have been scrubbed clean, and tech companies seem overwhelmed with [a new sense of responsibility](&lt;|url|&gt;).

This is understandable. The last 24 months have been some of the tech sector’s darkest. Whatever trust they once enjoyed has [completely eroded](&lt;|url|&gt;). Today’s tech leaders are thoughtful, careful, and desperate to be liked. When I think back to the tech mavericks I saw early in my career, they barely seem to be of the same species.

Before his beatification in the early 2000s, Steve Jobs was one half of the [*Pirates of Silicon Valley](&lt;|url|&gt;)*. That under-appreciated 1999 TV film starring Noah Wyle as Jobs and Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates depicted two entrepreneurs who gave little thought to the welfare of their customers. And it wasn’t far from the truth. Gates and Jobs (and Microsoft and Apple) were focused on beating each other and delivering their own brand of [graphical user interfaces to the masses](&lt;|url|&gt;).

To them, messaging was secondary to burn-out-your-retinas invention. Every event, product launch, and developer conference was another opportunity to knock people’s socks off and inspire. *Revenge of the Nerds* was real, and these were the nerd superheroes we worshiped. Their scorched-earth strategies may have inspired [Google’s original “Don’t Be Evil”](&lt;|url|&gt;) code of conduct in 1999, but a decade later, Google was less concerned with optics than no-nonsense invention.
> # Can you imagine what would have happened if Pichai had described Google Search’s new camera and augmented-reality capabilities as just a “search engine with eyes”?

In 2009, when Google wanted to paint a picture of the future of search, it didn’t mince words. As then vice president of search Marissa Mayer [put it](&lt;|url|&gt;), “Search engines that understand where you are in the world, search engines that understand you when you talk to them, even search engines with eyes: These are the things that are going to change the interface for search, fundamentally, as we move forward.”

Can you imagine what would have happened if Pichai had described Google Search’s new camera and augmented-reality capabilities as just a “search engine with eyes” even though that’s basically what they represent?

Where those early tech leaders were unapologetic and unafraid, Pichai, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Apple’s Tim Cook, and even Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg are well-mannered, careful, and — when speaking publicly at least — deeply concerned about consumer perception. Cook could’ve inherited the mantle of crazy genius from the late Steve Jobs, but that’s never been him. Fortunately for Apple, Cook’s hands-off approach to consumer data and resistance to outlandish ideas appears to be serving them well — even if it has led to a certain lack of rock-star product moments.

Cook, Zuckerberg, Nadella, and Pichai compete, in some ways, just as Jobs and Gates did decades ago, but there is little drama there. On the contrary, Pichai is no less reserved on stage than Cook.

Throughout the roughly two-hour Google I/O keynote on Tuesday, Pichai and company took great care to describe virtually every update as a tool for good, an update for assistance, and a way to control technology so that it doesn’t control you. The entire keynote was centered on “building a more helpful Google for everyone.” That lacks a certain edge, wouldn’t you say?
> # Google assiduously avoided whipping people into a frenzy even about its most inspiring developments.

All of these tech companies are grappling with the very real possibility that anything they do with consumer data in the future could put them at odds with [current European](&lt;|url|&gt;) and [future U.S. regulation](&lt;|url|&gt;). As a result, they’re playing it safe. And in doing so, they are necessarily changing the complexion of these developer conferences.

Don’t get me wrong: I think, for example, that Google’s [Project Euphonia](&lt;|url|&gt;), which can interpret muddled speech and even convert facial movements into language, is powerful and important work. But the news was delivered dispassionately. Google assiduously avoided whipping people into a frenzy even about its most inspiring developments.

It makes me a little sad. Sure, there were times when I shook my head at the overreach and the obvious hubris of previous developer conferences, but I’m also anxious for the future. Smart search and conversational A.I. will change our lives, but they don’t rock our world. I want to be amazed again.<|endoftext|>
