# How to Effectively Deal with Regret

## 

Everyone has feelings of regret once in a while, even the most socioeconomically successful among us. In fact, many of my clients and customers have asked me how they can more effectively deal with regret.

It’s easy to look back at our lives and think, “if only I did this” or “if only I did that.” We imagine how our lives could have been better if we did things differently. This kind of reflection tends to fill us with painful negative emotions.

I myself have had to deal with intense feelings of regret many times. Honestly, I should have started InnerConqueror sooner than I did. Before starting InnerConqueror, I wasted 3 years and thousands of dollars trying to start “get-rich-quick scheme” businesses in industries that I didn’t care about.

I learned the hard way that there’s no such thing as getting rich quick. This is especially true when you don’t have passion or purpose behind your work. That, my friends, is when the regret started to seep in and it began to pollute my mindset.

I used to think to myself, “if only I had started InnerConqueror, which I feel is my true calling from the beginning, I would have had 3 years of growth and progress under my belt by now.” Pretty soon, the regret was starting to demotivate me and prevent me from doing the hard work I needed to do to become successful. I was letting the past affect my present actions and the regret was also hurting my future.

Eventually, I decided that enough was enough! I picked up every book, listened to every podcast, and watched every training I could find on psychology, motivation, success, and personal development.

I was able to get over my regret and began focusing on creating a better future for myself and my family instead. Today, I’m going to pass this hard-won knowledge onto you. My goal is to quickly teach you how to effectively deal with regret.

Let’s begin!

## Accepting the Emotions of Regret

The first step to effectively dealing with regret is to identify the emotions that come with regret. I recommend doing this through reflective meditation. You can read more about reflective meditation [here](https://innerconqueror.com/3-practical-types-of-meditation/).

The emotions of regret are going to be negative, and that’s okay. These emotions you bring up could be anger, sadness, envy, or embarrassment. It’s important to get specific and identify the negative emotions you’re feeling so that you can work on accepting them.

Oftentimes, we get stuck in denial when it comes to regret. We know what happened to cause the regret, but end up getting stuck in a mental loop.

I’m sure you’ve experienced this before. It’s the experience of replaying the regrettable event over and over again in your head. When you are stuck in a mental loop, it means your subconscious mind is trying to send you a signal.

To break the loop, it’s important to accept the emotions that we’ve previously identified. Accept that your regret is caused by those emotions, and accept that you felt those emotions and that they hurt you. Once you do that, you can work on the next step in order to deal with regret, which is letting go.

## Letting Go of Regretful Emotions

After you’ve identified the negative emotions that are causing regret, you’ll be ready to move on to the next step. It’s time to begin mentally letting go so that you can move on.

Everyone has different ways of letting go, but I’m going to share how I like to do it with you. I’m a very visual person, so I like to create mental images to deal with regret.

First, I use my mind’s eye to imagine that I’m on a grassy cliff with a beautiful seaside view. I know it sounds kind of woo-woo, but imagining this peaceful environment helps to keep me calm and relaxed. I imagine each of the emotions associated with the regret as individual balloons.

In my mental visualization, I’m standing at the edge of the gorgeous cliff with the wind in my hair. I’m firmly holding the balloons in my left hand. Maybe I’m holding an anger balloon, a fear balloon, or an anxiety balloon. To further enhance the mental image, I like to associate colors with each balloon. For example, I imagine red balloons representing anger and blue balloons representing sadness.

Next, I like to imagine myself moving one of these emotion balloons from my left hand to my right hand. Finally, I imagine myself letting go of that particular balloon (let’s say it’s anger), and try to feel that emotion leaving my mental space.

I watch the anger balloon fly away in my mind’s eye, and feel an overwhelming sense of peace and calmness. Then I take the next negative emotion balloon (let’s say fear), and repeat the process.

I know this process sounds silly to anyone who hasn’t tried it. I thought so too at first! But trust me, you’ll want to find something like this that works for you.

As long as you have the goal of letting go of your negative emotions in mind, you can use my method or you can define your own path to get there.

## Becoming Inspired By the Future

Once you’ve let go of the negative emotions associated with regret, it’s time for the next step. Although you’ll probably be feeling great after working on the process of letting go, there’s still more work to do. We want to make sure that the regret won’t come back to haunt us again later on.

Another amazing way to deal with regret is to start focusing on the future instead of the past. Having a positive outlook on the future will reassure you that you’re moving on from regret.

Think about the fact that your future is still unwritten! You can decide how you want to live your life going forward. I know you can’t necessarily decide your fate, but you can decide which actions will give you the greatest chance of having a brighter future. This means that the possibilities are endless for you.

You can set new goals and plans for the future, leaving old setbacks and regrets behind in the dust. If you made a mistake in the past that hurt you or hurt others, guess what? It’s over now, and you have the opportunity to make up for it in the future.

Time waits for no one, Father Time’s watch continuously ticks on. Don’t waste your time thinking about things you can control or change.

Try hard to direct all your efforts towards the things you can do, and focus on becoming more optimistic about the impact of your actions. You never know which action could make a huge difference in your life!

## One Final Key Strategy to Deal with Regret

Hopefully by now, you’re really getting the hang of dealing with regret. You’ve recognized the negative emotions behind regret and worked hard on letting them go. You’ve also looked toward the future and created exciting new goals that will motivate you.

The final strategy I have to share with you will seal the deal. It’s simple to know and understand, but difficult to execute. However, If you do execute on this strategy consistently, your regret will likely be gone forever.

The strategy is simple: you need to practice taking massive action in the present. Taking massive action means you really push yourself to be more, do more, and accomplish more today than you did yesterday. Ideally, this massive action will be aligned with the goals you set from the previous step.

Massive action is the key strategy to squashing regret because you need to focus all your mental energy on the present to do it effectively. When you’re so focused on accomplishing your future goals, you won’t even be thinking about the past!

As you take massive action, you’ll begin to see promising progress towards your goals. When you see progress, your mindset will shift from being regretful of the past to being excited about the present and future! The present moment is the only phase of time where you can change your life for the better.

Don’t let it go to waste!

## Conclusion

I hope this guide helped you deal with regret effectively.

Remember, you must first accept the negative emotions that are the root cause of regret, and let them go.

After you get rid of these negative emotions, you can then look forward to the future.

That positive outlook will allow you to take massive action and shrink regret.

As you take massive action and improve your future, your regret will eventually disappear!

# What I’m Hoping to Accomplish With VIP

## What I’m Hoping to Accomplish With VIP

### An experiment in learning, training and human potential.

For the past five months, I’ve been running a small group coaching experience on Coach.me. Un-creatively, it’s titled VIP. Every four weeks we do a very deep dive into a productivity topic.

Coaching this group is my favorite part of every day. But it’s a work in progress and I wanted to talk a bit about the process.

This isn’t a sales pitch, so I’m not going to link to anything until the bottom.

## What is the right target for success rates?

The self-improvement space is tough because change it hard. And, counter-intuitively, most people don’t want to change.

So I go into everything knowing that a lot of people are going to fail. Thankfully, in our world failure doesn’t mean that suddenly you lose your jobs and your friends hate you. Actually, this might be part of the problem. In self-improvement, there’s almost never a cost to failure.

I’ve tried building solutions where I thought the success rate was going to be as low as 15%. That’s still 1,500% higher than most people were going to do on their own.

And I’ve tried solutions where I thought the success rate was going to be 95%. In these, when clients learn what’s actually expected they run away screaming.

Of course, confidence is one of the major components of every motivational coach or guru. So I’m probably doing a huge disservice to the entire industry by even mentioning how low the actual success rates are.

Every other author, speaker and founder will tell you that their advice is 100% guaranteed to work. So hopefully not too many people will read this post. I don’t want angry letters form supplement salesmen.

The actual success rates across the board for anything you’ve ever heard of from AA to Weight Watchers to a best-selling book are in the 5–15% range. The implication then is to stop looking for silver bullets and start expecting to try a portfolio of approaches.

Anyway, back to VIP. This is one of the major design decisions: how much success should we expect?

## The median VIP change

We charge real money for VIP. And you could look at that charge as either cheap or expensive depending on your world view.

The charge is $5/week. That’s $260 per year.

What I want is for the value to price ratio to be incredibly high. People who are feeling ripped off aren’t going to be fun community members.

That means adopting my world view, which is that personal growth is valuable and worth paying for.

At design time, my expectations for someone who stays in the group for a year is as follows:

* We’re going to do 13 modules, where each module is four weeks, covers four sub-topics in depth and includes five exercises per week. That’s 260 exercises.

* You will immediately and fully connect with one module, but it will be hard to predict which one. The connection will depend on both timing and topic. This full connection will result in a permanent and life-long change.

* You will partially connect with ten other topics, doing at least one exercise from each. Those exercises will produce moderate, but significant improvements in your life.

So, essentially, for $260 you will make one massive change in your life and ten small changes.

Of course, you could get that same impact by jumping in and out of VIP on a weekly basis. In that case the cost is only $70. But I think that’s bad math. In my world view it’s foolish to focus on a $5 savings at the expense of massive self-improvement.

That micro-optimization would be like choosing a coach who offered 61 minute sessions over one who offered merely 60 minute sessions. The real evaluation is “is this person going to transform your life?”

## Picking topics

The self-tracking aspects of Coach.me are meant to be all things to all people. It doesn’t matter if you believe in science or magic — there’s a goal for you (433,289 at the time of this writing).

But VIP is different.

There’s a coaching phrase that I like for certain (but definitely not all) people: “Healthy self-entitlement.”

VIP, since it depends on me and one other person (covered below) requires that we filter for topics that evoke our own passions. Otherwise we just wouldn’t do very good work.

I have to remind myself that the content won’t be good unless it fits my passion. In that way, the commercial success of VIP is simply a discovery process of people who are attracted to my world view.

There is a real tension between commercial success and originality.

We’re just wrapping up a module on morning routines. During this module we covered the science of sleep, strategies for efficient and motivational mornings, and brain science around cognitive load. This is a topic that a lot of new VIP members signed up for. It’s commercially successful.

A few modules back, we covered [writing your own Codex Vitae](https://betterhumans.coach.me/codex-vitae-635f97552092), a work of art to define your life philosophy. Each exercise was an examination of a segment of your life and your philosophies covering that segment. Writing your own Codex is a weird and strange idea that nobody in the world is currently thinking about doing. I loved running this module.

Probably 90% though is just, “DO WE LOVE THIS TOPIC?”

For example, we’re going to do “Set priorities for your day” starting this Monday.

The discussion started:
> “How do you do four weeks on priorities? Get a piece of paper. Write down three priorities.”
> “But how do you know if they’re the right priorities? How do you know if you can complete them? How do you get yourself to follow them?”
> “Oh, so you mean, let’s get pedantic as hell? Velocity based estimation, procrastination prevention, decision making matrixes and all that stuff?”

The thing that got us excited was the word pedantic, which for us was to do a meticulous and thorough examination of a topic that is only simple on the surface.

## Overcoming my own bias

I have a very narrow life experience. I’m a white male. I haven’t worked for other people in ten years. I’m partnered but not married — we don’t have kids. I’ve been fortunate to avoid health or other forms of life crisis. I’ve never been to church. I grew up in a city that prides itself in being weird.

These limited experiences are huge dangers to the content inside of VIP.

Here’s a phrase I just heard that’s semi-related.
> “Behind every woke man is an exhausted feminist.”

That’s a tongue-in-cheek way of saying that I’m grateful to have wildly different voices in my life because they help expand my world view.

For VIP, that diversity of life experience comes from my partner in writing and research, Terrie Schweitzer. Terrie is a bit more than a decade older than me which puts her in a different generation. She has an actual spiritual practice, has been through therapy, has overcome actual life challenges, and has been early-adopting productivity fads since the 80s.

She’s the one that can bring a Zen perspective around acceptance and say, “Over the course of history, I’ve seen this done seven different ways. Your way only works for a small subset of people. And also — are we fixing an actual problem or just a perceived problem?”

And she’s right. We don’t operate in a world with one-size-fits-all solutions. Sometimes in VIP we have to say “here are the three best ways to do it and who each approach is best for.”

The VIP research is much stronger for having Terrie’s strong counter-balancing force.

The other key to an effective VIP group is to embrace the group nature. From the beginning, I seeded VIP with some of our top coaches. So, on a recent day a discussion erupted about Bulletproof Coffee and a very experienced BullteProof coach stepped up to answer all of the questions.

The group brings a diversity of perspectives, and, in self-improvement, that’s critical.

## The product

We hacked VIP into the existing Coach.me app, making use of tracking and Q&A.

It’s totally a hack and I think I should be more up front about that. We needed three features basically: tracking, daily exercises and discussion.

And to get there we co-opted Coach.me’s Q&A feature to handle both the daily exercise and the discussion. It works, sort of. The worst thing is that Q&A sorts by last-updated, so sometimes the exercises get out of order.

I think it’s appropriate for where we are — a small community of passionate self-improvers trying to figure out best practices together.

Plus, the real product is just to have great content and research and people.

# This is the Best Way to Stick to Your Goals

## 

Humans have always used more or less clever of ways of binding themselves to do what they want or need to do.

One classic example is Odysseus ordering his men to plug their ears with beeswax and tie his body to the mast of the ship so he could listen to the siren’s song without being lured into jumping overboard (1).

Another one is Spanish conqueror Hernán Cortés bold move to destroy his ships to remove the possibility of retreat and thereby increasing his chances of defeating the Mayans (2).

Now, I realize there’s a pretty good chance you won’t get seduced by sirens or fighting Mayans anytime soon, but these kinds of self-binding strategies can be very effective for day to day obstacles as well.

## Overcoming ‘Akrasia’

Most people have a good idea of what behaviors are good for us. We know we should [exercise](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-start-exercising/) to be strong and healthy, [read](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-read-more-books/) to expand our minds and [meditate](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-practice-mindfulness/) to reduce stress and be more mindful. We have a good idea of how much work or studies we need to put in every day to get a satisfying result.

For the most part, it’s not a lack of information but a lack of follow-through that’s the problem.

And this struggle to execute on what you genuinely want to do is by no means a new obstacle. Philosophers all the way back to Plato and Aristotle even created their own fancy term for this failure of the will.

They called it ‘akrasia’ (3) and it encompasses procrastination, lack of self-control, lack of follow-through, and any kind of addictive behavior.

This tendency of doing something else than we want is a little strange, especially to economists, who often presume that whatever we do by definition is what we want to do. This theory is called ‘revealed preference’ (4) and fails to account for a stubborn quirk of the human mind: **what we want depends on when we’re doing the wanting**.

We’re all susceptible to what’s known as ‘time inconsistency’ (5) and this tendency is nicely illustrated in a study on grocery-buying habits (6): When buying groceries online for delivery tomorrow people buy a lot more ice cream and a lot fewer vegetables compared to when they’re ordering delivery for next week.

So, our preferences are inconsistent and at times even contradictory over time. Our ability to weigh costs and benefits (in this case tastiness vs. healthiness) is heavily affected when some of those costs are immediate, and some are not.

**In general, it seems we want to do what we know is good for us. Just not right now.**

## Enter ‘Commitment Devices’

And here’s where the strategy of commitment devices is so helpful. A commitment device is essentially something you put in place in the present to ‘lock you in’ to a certain course of action in the future.

If you know you’re going to be seduced by Sirens later; you have yourself tied to the mast. If you know you and your soldiers may be tempted to retreat from battle; you destroy the ships so you’ll have to charge forward.

Other, less extreme, examples include (7, 8):

* Signing up for long-term gym memberships instead of single day passes.

* Cutting up your credit cards to avoid mindless spending.

* Leaving work at the office so you can’t keep doing it at home.

* Buying junk food or candy in small packages, rather than in bulk.

* Getting rid of all alcohol in your house to prevent drinking.

* Using [temptation bundling](http://www.selfication.com/temptation-bundling/) and restrict certain fun stuff only to occasions when you’re engaging in a healthy/productive behavior.

* Buying small plates to avoid overeating.

* Teaming up with a workout partner for accountability.

* Having a portion of your paycheck automatically transferred to your savings account.

* Canceling your TV service to [protect your time](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-have-more-time/).

These days, there are also plenty of clever services you can use to commit yourself to your goals:

* [Coach.me](https://www.coach.me/) — [Get a coach](http://www.selfication.com/coaching/) for the particular goal or habit you’re working on.

* [StickK](https://www.stickk.com/) — Create commitment contracts and, if you want, put some money on the line. If you don’t meet your goal, they will send your money to a charity or organization you don’t like!

* [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) — Combines self-tracking and commitment contracts. Your challenge here is to keep all your data point on a Yellow Brick Road, or they take your money.

* [Pact App](http://www.pactapp.com/) — Allows you to create weekly pacts to exercise more or eat healthier and decide what you’ll pay other Pact members if you fail. If you stay on track, you’ll earn cash from other who didn’t.

There are also plenty of great apps you can use to remove energy-draining clutter from your digital environment and help you commit to more productive behaviors (9):

* [Quicksilver](https://qsapp.com/) is a launcher utility app for Mac OS X that gives you the ability to perform common, everyday tasks rapidly and without thought. After installing this app, you’ll never have to have your computer desktop cluttered with icons again.

* [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en) is an extension for Google Chrome and Firefox that converts all of your open browser tabs into a list. A very handy way to remove clutter and free up more computer memory.

* [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) is an extension that blocks annoying ads from your web browser.

* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) lets you organize your menu bar apps in Mac.

* [Readability](https://www.readability.com/) turns any web page into a clean view for reading on your computer, smartphone, or tablet.

* [News Feed Eradicator for Facebook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en) is a Chrome extension that replaces your Facebook news feed with an inspiring quote.

* [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) is an app for Mac that allows you to lock yourself away from the Internet so you can become more productive.

* [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) is an app for Mac that lets you block your access to sites and mail servers for a set amount of time.

* [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en) is a Chrome extension that allows you to restrict the amount of time you can spend on time-wasting websites.

* [Forest](http://www.forestapp.cc/) is a clever way to stay off your phone when you should be working. The app lets you plant a digital tree whenever you want to focus. The tree will then grow during the next 30 minutes, but if you leave the app, the tree will die. Stay committed and you’ll plant a forest.

## Let’s Commit!

As you can see, there are PLENTY of ways you can use self-binding to your advantage. When it comes to commitment devices, the only limit is your imagination. Hopefully, this article has given you some ideas for how you could kick akrasia in the butt and get moving toward your goals.

For me, [my accountability partner Nik](http://niklasgoeke.com/), [my clients](https://www.coach.me/Patrik?ref=P7G1v), and my 2000+ [newsletter subscribers](http://www.selfication.com/join/) make for powerful commitment devices to always improve my coaching and writing skills. For you, it might be something else entirely.

Regardless of what you’re trying to achieve the key is to find a way to [consistently show up and do the work](http://www.selfication.com/the-tortoise-mindset/). So, before you close this article I highly recommend you decide on 1–3 commitment devices to start experimenting with immediately.

Put a system in place that [makes success easier and failure harder](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-change-your-habits/). The way to beat akrasia is to commit!

# Fasting and Ketones&#58; Data from 3 Days with No Food, Only Wine

## I’m obsessed with eating.

Probably addicted. I do it multiple times every day.

I finally had the good sense to quantify just how obsessed I am. I collected lots of data, ran that data through a complex regression algorithm, and plugged it into a state-of-the-art graphing application.

Here’s what popped out:

![](1*KOF8P0b2xYmhk6dkeQlUJg.png)

That graph shows very clearly that, yes, I do appear to be obsessed with food. That’s especially true as the day goes on.

Below is a story that I originally told at my local Quantified Self meetup. The data and graphs get a lot more serious than the one above. And even though I love eating as much as the next person, I am going to talk about *abstaining* from food.

![](0*oG4lrNLTpsH2bLKl.)

## Two Insights

This article is a continuation of an experiment I did last year [tracking data while I was on a ketogenic diet](https://medium.com/the-mission/tracking-blood-ketones-behind-the-scenes-data-on-the-ketogenic-diet-7d35fcab0baa).

*[Editor’s Note: The goal of a ketogenic diet is to achieve a metabolic state that emphasizes burning fat as the primary source of energy. It is often marked by the presence of ketones in the blood. This family of diet is most often performed either with regular periods of fasting or by restricting carbohydrates, as with the slow-carb diet or Atkins.]*

In that article, I shared data I collected while following a ketogenic diet for three months. Two insights from that data inspired this new experiment with fasting.

### **Insight #1: I Felt Better **When My Ketones Were Higher

The following graph compares my average ketone readings (more than 100 samples) to how I felt at the time of testing.

* On average, when I felt like a five (SUPER HIGH ENERGY!!), my ketones were at 3.4.

* When I felt like a three (normal energy), my ketones were at 1.4.

* When I felt like a one (low…en…er…gy……), my ketones were at 0.5.

![](1*2HQOfPljgGCavAU9WnfPKQ.png)

This shows, on average, that I felt better when my ketones were higher.

### Insight #2: My Ketones Were Highest at the End of Intermittent Fasts

The following graph shows four consecutive days of ketone samples. You can see that the measurements peaked in the early afternoon toward the end of my intermittent fast.

![](1*By5Zf5v_OUShUY0izbpiAQ.png)

### So…

1. If ketones are highest at the end of a short-term fast, and

1. I feel best when ketones are highest, then…

What would happen if I extended the fast? Would my ketone levels continue to increase? Would I feel SUPER AWESOME?!

![](0*nnd0QOFfowY6Koy0.)

## First Experiment: Three-Day Fast

To test this theory, I fasted for three days while measuring my ketone and glucose levels using a [Precision Xtra Glucose and Ketone Meter](https://www.amazon.com/DSS-Precision-Glucose-Results-Included/dp/B00JIK6CIW/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1500930439&sr=8-1&keywords=precision+xtra+ketone+meter). If you buy one, remember that you also need to buy strips and lancets. The whole purchase should run about $120.

![](1*RTc5mfKlgTLomtRzLkOZYg.png)

Let’s look at the data.

### Ketones

![](1*QMS83QTZPAcNWqHaNrnsxw.png)

My ketone levels trended upward each day. Here are my average readings:

* Day 1: 1.5

* Day 2: 2.2

* Day 3: 3.0

My ketones peaked at 4.4 in the afternoon of day three. Surprisingly, my ketones remained high even a day after the fast ended (day four in the graph).

Another notable finding is that my ketones dipped after each weightlifting session.

### Glucose

The next graph adds my glucose readings (I started tracking glucose on day two).

![](1*VWigX6EaslHsX22GcxBJMQ.png)

In this graph, glucose is often high when ketones are low, and vice versa. This implies a possible inverse correlation between the two.

Also, similar but opposite to ketones, my glucose spiked during weightlifting workouts.

### Energy

This graph compares my ketone levels to how I felt in terms of energy. I recorded my energy level before taking each blood sample using a scale of one to five:

* 1 = *[yawns] *I want to lie on the couch and *[yawns again] *do nothing but watch *Black Mirror*.

* 5 = I’M READY TO RUN A MARATHON AND THEN CHALLENGE DEEP BLUE TO A CHESS MATCH!!!! LET’S GO!

![](1*K2bvp3mznAdn_4_5NWgyxw.png)

My energy was surprisingly highest on the last day of the fast.

I averaged a 3.0 on days one and two and a 3.8 on day three. Dips happened each night, probably because I was tired and couldn’t eat food to boost my energy.

This graph also shows a possible correlation between ketones and energy. There are too many variables to know with any certainty (subjective measurements like “how do I feel” have so many confounding factors), but it’s another data point that aligns with data from my prior experiment.

### Lessons from Fast #1

1. My ketone levels increased each day of the fast.

1. A heavy workout decreased ketones and increased glucose.

1. Ketones and glucose seemed to have an inverse correlation.

1. Ketones and energy seemed to have a direct correlation.

1. Ketones remained high even a day after the fast ended.

This data is promising!

During these 72 hours of abstaining from food, my glucose stayed fairly stable, my ketones steadily rose, and my energy increased toward the end of the fast.

But this was just one short experiment. If I repeated the experiment, would I see the same results?

![](0*hvW6BYxmwQy6jTxa.)

## Second Experiment: Three-Day Fast (+ **🍷!)**

The second experiment was another three-day fast. But this time, there was a twist.

You see, I’m in the wine business now. This means I drink wine almost every night (occupational requirement). I follow a ketogenic diet and do frequent blood testing, so I know the wine I drink doesn’t kick me out of ketosis. However, I always drink wine with food.

Naturally, I was curious: *What would happen if I drank wine ONLY while not eating food?*

Like any good biohacker, I decided to experiment (for science, of course).

My hypothesis: **I’ll get a super-awesome buzz!**

I started another three-day fast, but this time, after two days of fasting, I sat down with a bottle of wine and started drinking. I tracked how much I drank and how inebriated I felt.

At the end of the night, I collected all this data, ran it through multiple complex algorithms, and graphed it.

*On a side note: I am quite impressed with this new graphing application I’ve been using.*

Here’s what I found:

![My level of inebriation is measured in a technical unit known as a “buzz.”](1*O0pc-6MSv4ltW6kdRtsZJg.png)*My level of inebriation is measured in a technical unit known as a “buzz.”*

After the first glass of wine, I felt great!

And then things quickly became a little blurry. There were some stick-figure drawings, a round of pushups, and eventually falling asleep at the kitchen table.

Overall, a very good time.
> ***VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
*** The wine in my experiment was a natural wine from the Loire Valley in France. It’s one that we’ve sold at Dry Farm Wines, so it has been lab tested. I therefore knew it was organic, sugar-free, 12 percent alcohol, very low in sulfites, and free of any additives. I would not have done this experiment with commercial wine, and I would strongly discourage trying this experiment with any wines that aren’t sugar-free or guaranteed to be clean.

![](0*-M_NFWYiz06Er3F4.)

## The Real Data

Here’s the hard data, starting with my ketone readings.

### Ketones

This graph has a similar shape to the first experiment’s ketone graph.

![](1*oP8qxqVvT4lZzuQpd1JuIA.png)

Ketones dipped after working out, peaked in the afternoon on day three, and stayed high even a day after the fast ended.

### Glucose

This data is also similar to the prior experiment.

![](1*Q6FxfRdXwx2AkXG3hzjifg.png)

Glucose typically goes up when ketones go down, and vice versa.

### When Drinking Wine

Zooming in on day two, we get a closer look at the data around each glass of wine.

![](1*s6zBhJCdim2pyi1t9lDKiA.png)

After the first glass, there was no change in ketones or glucose. After the second, ketones dropped a little and glucose rose a little. After the third glass, ketones dropped again (though still comfortably in ketosis at 1.4) and glucose actually dropped a little (not sure why). Another blood test a couple hours later (around 2 a.m.) showed that ketones were still at 1.4 and glucose had risen slightly to 82.

When I woke up the next morning, my ketones were back to 2.3 and glucose was 70. By early afternoon, ketones were in the fours and glucose was down to the 40s.

### Energy

Comparing my ketones to how I felt, there is a similar correlation between the two, as we saw in the first experiment.

![](1*gz_m2gkSIk-fF8ep333fOg.png)

One notable observation is that my energy dropped when my ketones were their highest (approaching a 5.0 ketone reading). I’m not sure if that’s an anomaly or if 5.0 is my threshold and anything above that is too high for me. I don’t have enough data to know.

### Learned from Fast #2

1. This experiment supported all the same lessons from the first fast: Ketones increased each day, ketones and glucose showed an inverse correlation, ketones and energy showed a direct correlation, ketones dipped after workouts, and ketones remained high even after the fast ended.

1. Drinking three glasses of wine while fasting moderately affected my ketones and glucose, which quickly recovered the next morning, and created a very gnarly buzz (a technical term).

![](0*LYdbiSXpnyZbkOe9.)

## What’s Next?

What would happen if the fast extended beyond three days? Would ketones continue to rise into days four and five? Would they eventually level off? Would I continue feeling better each day, or would my energy start dropping?

These are my lingering questions. The next experiment will be a longer fast.

# Motivation Monday&#58; Daily Journal

## Motivation Monday: Daily Journal

I’ve been working on Morning Routines recently and that reminded me of the power of daily writing.

Journaling has a number of powers to increase creativity, reduce anxiety and generate insights.

Here are a few motivational bullets to pick up journaling as a daily habit.

## 1. Free writing as an alternative to meditation

[Buster Benson](https://twitter.com/buster), a favorite in the Motivation Monday letter, writes about free writing as an [alternative to meditation](https://betterhumans.coach.me/better-than-meditation-12532d29f6cd#.k0gtepwrm) noting the similarities:
> The specific limitation of time, the gentle persistence of staying on track during that time, being an observer rather than a critic of what’s happening in your head, stay on track, stay on track, let the ideas flow and just watch them, stay on track.

If you want a great tool for free writing, try Buster’s [750words.com](http://750words.com)

## 2. Morning pages as a brain hack

This hack comes via chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin.

The hack goes like this.

* Work on something hard at the end of the day. Let that hard project percolate in your subconscious while you sleep.

* In the morning, your brain will have made new, creative connections. Capture those connections right away by journaling in the morning.

This hacks your sleep to make you more creative in the morning.

If that’s interesting, read more in my post about [getting more creativity from your morning pages practice](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-get-more-creativity-from-your-morning-pages-practice-27684106268d#.u0sgm31o7).

## 3. Journaling as a habit

The results of the survey from our last letter had that 52% of readers here don’t even know what we do.

Answer: Imagine you have a goal. Now imagine a drug that made it easy to achieve that goal. Metaphorically, we’re the drug.

The vast majority of our community start by building accountability through goal tracking. Interested, start with the [Write in Journal goal](https://www.coach.me/plans/1183-write-in-journal).

Question for you: Do you keep a journal or daily writing practice? What prompt do you give yourself to write about? Has it made a difference in your life?

# Shine Your Light

## Shine Your Light
<center>
## A Journey to Mecca in Layers</center>
<center>
### Ummah Wide Travel Series</center>
<center>
**By Dustin Craun**</center>

Years ago while visiting my Mother on the plains of Colorado, I walked out to the edge of the suburbs to look at the sky in all its glory as the sun was beginning to set. Once I reached my destination I sat in meditation and said over and over again in Arabic *La illaha il Allah *(There is no reality except God) centering my focus on my heart. After some time a storm that looked to be far away in the distance rapidly closed in with flashes of lightning striking all around me. As I began to walk home I continued my *dhikr* (sacred remembrances) but the lightning came closer and closer so I started to run, then boom, flash, I was to late a strike hit so close to me that all I could see was an all encompassing white light all around me.

What seemed like an eternity in a flash and then it was gone….. Ahhh! I was still alive, and after experiencing that flash of light encompass my entire being, I realized that is the closest existent metaphor for the spiritual or metaphysical light mentioned in the Qur’an which encompassed every layer of my being while I visited the holy city of Mecca for the first time shortly after that lightning strike.

![](1*8UZ5Wvvv5ZsshJu_PkKg6g.png)

This story is about my second trip to Mecca this past winter as I traveled across the world to make Umrah (the lesser pilgrimage to Mecca), to visit my wife’s family in the Arabian Peninsula and seeking to bask in that divine light again even if it was only for a moment.

It was with a bit of suddenness and surprise that I was able to travel across the world and retrace the steps in the path of the Prophets, the *Awliyah* (the spiritual saints/ sages) and all those millions and millions of people who came before me over thousands of years to visit these lands of pilgrimage.

Journeying from airport to airport to airport — San Francisco to Frankfurt to Istanbul to Jeddah — then straight to Mecca made for the ultimate contrasts in realities. In a world that is continuing to shrink culturally, and in airports throughout the world you can be anywhere and feel that you are always in the same place, immersed in the monoculture of westernization/ neoliberal capitalist colonial modernity. People wear mostly the same clothes, drink mostly the same drinks, eat mostly the same foods, shop at mostly the same shops and speak increasingly with similar lingual tongues. Not to say great and important cultural differences don’t still exist but in these spaces they are hard to see at times and there is probably no greater constant space of bombardment of capitalist consumerism than at the airport, which I just so happened to be stuck in as I was on and off of planes for over 30 hours.

On this day the contrasts were also embodied by my change in clothing going from my everyday suit jacket, vest, and dress shoes into changing to my *ihram* (essentially two white towels that men making pilgrimage to Mecca wear with nothing else) on the plane, going from wearing wingtip dress shoes to going barefoot (I forgot to bring sandals) for my last two hours on the plane, off the plane, through customs, from Jeddah to Mecca, a half mile walk from my hotel and to the sacred mosque. While the *ihram* is meant to symbolize the equality of all humans in front of God and ultimately on the day of judgement, getting off the plane I saw how temporary of a state this was for me and though the clothes may have contrasted with the others in line, my privileges as a White American convert to Islam were always still present with me. As I got into the customs line I stood behind two-hundred Bengali men, migrating to Saudi Arabia for jobs as the working underclass in this country that no Saudi would ever take.

While surely most of these men would love to be wearing the *ihram *and visiting *Bait Allah* (The House of God) like myself, they instead were to be intensely scrutinized by customs officials then off to work, while I flew through customs with my blue passport, met my taxi driver and was off headed in the most sacred of directions. These men were in my thoughts just as were the homeless people who I passed as I walked to the Subway in my home city Berkeley, California, that took me to the airport a full day before. My change in clothes was a change in states physically, and it is an important gesture for all of us to be reminded of the state of poverty we will all permanently visit when we are lowered into our grave, but a reality I feel far from as a moderately wealthy White western man visiting a country where the poor and women have few rights.

![The **Abraj Al-Bait Towers**, also known as the **Mecca Royal Hotel Clock Tower before it was completed in 2012**](1*m6FuYZY0OdMzF92a9GBaYA.jpeg)*The **Abraj Al-Bait Towers**, also known as the **Mecca Royal Hotel Clock Tower before it was completed in 2012***

While the outward (zahir) reality of the Saudi government, and its insane redevelopment of Mecca; destroying entire mountains, nearly all the historical sites related to the Prophet Muhammad’s life (Peace be upon him), and building the second tallest building in the world directly outside the grand mosque of Mecca are the first things that strike you as you enter the city. Once you are inside the mosque a reality that is outside of place and time overwhelms your entire being, the internal (*batin*) and unseen realities of existence begin to capture your spirit and your heart. I walked alone towards the *Kaba* with my head held down at 5:30 in the morning just before the dawn prayer and as I neared what Muslims believe to be the center of the universe and the first house of worship on the planet first built by Adam, then later by Abraham and his son Ishmael (the Kaba). Almost instantly the weight of being in that place began to overwhelm me. How was I back here, a young man from the suburbs of Colorado my family having lived in the United States for hundreds of years and never having known anything about Islam before, and yet in the midst of a global war with ever present lies and hatred directed at Islam and Muslims these are the realities I was guided to.

As I neared the center of the mosque, I chanted the call that all visiting the Kaba chant *Labaik Allahuma Labaik* (Here I am at your service O Lord, here I am), finally I looked up and there it was, I had returned again. In that moment as you lay eyes on the kaba, as you renew your ties to God and you make sincere prayers for guidance, for family, for humanity; mercy and light flood your heart. The Light and the Mercy fill your spirit in a way that no food, water, sleep or other material reality could feed you. Words cannot describe the indescribable and so as I entered this metaphysical plane of being that seems of the world, but not of it, I began to perform the rituals of the Umrah. The first act of which is making tawaf, where we walk around the kaba seven times. As I began to make tawaf I knew other people were around me but it took me a long time to really notice them, the reality of God was so overwhelming in that moment. As I walked around the *kaba *praying for everyone and everything I could think of, the silence and the clarity of that space was deafening.
> In my clearest of reflections the symbolism of it all was clear, God is the center of everything, and everything revolves around God. We spend our lives chasing the material while the reality of the immaterial surrounds us. The only question here, is whether or not we are open to these realities.

![Photo — Dustin Craun](1*58_5p5Xw9bFmqHJO3juqOQ.jpeg)*Photo — Dustin Craun*

What a visceral experience, as your soul is enraptured an entire universe of people walk by you in the same daze whispering prayers, tears flowing, and begging for forgiveness for past deeds and guidance for the remainder of our lives. For most of us this is one of only a handful of times we will stand in this place, so young women pray for children who will not be born for another decade, as old men ask forgiveness for a lifetime of misdeeds and children in their pureness utter prayers for their parents and peace in the world. Your life flashes before your eyes as your heart is expanded in ways that we can never fully understand, and the weight of the world is lifted from you as you bask in that light.

![The door of the Kaba (Photo — Dustin Craun)](0*Una8GWyjoAmxw_s4.jpeg)*The door of the Kaba (Photo — Dustin Craun)*

After I finished my *tawaf* I headed to the edge of the mosque to perform the *Sa’i* where we walk and jog back and forth between two small mountains *Safa* and *Marwa* seven times as Hagar, the Prophet Abraham’s wife did frantically looking for water for her infant son when she was left there alone millennia ago. Imagining a mother and child without water is not difficult to do in a world where over a billion people do not have access to clean drinking water, and this is where my prayers turned as I prayed for God’s justice to be done on earth. I prayed for all those suffering without adequate food, water, and shelter throughout the world to be given relief. I prayed for an end to global warfare whatever weapon is used against anyone anywhere on the planet.

As I was in this daze of prayer, I walked by a small infant child begging in the mosque without an arm and I thought of all the impoverished children and families I have met all over the world from my hometown in Thornton, Colorado to the Dine reservation, to the U.S./ Mexico border, in West Africa, in Morocco, in Spain, in Oakland and in Richmond, California, here in this mosque, and all places in between.

How we let such suffering exist in a world of so much wealth, beauty and mercy shows how weak our faith and belief in a God of justice truly is. In that moment I remembered the standard of justice we are called to maintain, when All Mighty God says in the Qur’an
> **“You who believe, uphold justice and bear witness to God, even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or your close relatives. Whether the person is rich or poor, God can best take care of both. Refrain from following your own desire, so that you can act justly — if you distort or neglect justice, God is fully aware of what you do.”**

May God forgive us.

As I finished the rituals of my *Umrah* with a clarity of heart and mind I have only experienced in these moments I walked back into the center of the mosque and saw the beauty of the global Muslim u*mmah* (community) there in front of me. People from nearly every corner of the earth, from every class and racial background, women next to men all together in one constant and continuous state of worship that goes on every moment, of every day of every year for the last fourteen hundred years and which Muslims believe will continue until the end of time.

As I walked out of the mosque I was surrounded by people everywhere, some headed back to their five star hotels that directly surround and tower over the mosque, while others laid out their breakfast meals there on sheets of plastic on the marble tile surrounding the mosque. What a beautiful community we are, but how many ways we have been divided, by colonization, dictatorships, capitalist and nationalistic insanity, through warfare and intolerance related to ideological differences, gender, race, nation, and class.

Yet God has called us to so much more, at a time where all of humanity is becoming increasingly interconnected. What if we are living manifestations of the reality God has called us to when it is stated in the Qur’an
> **“People, We created you all from a single man a a single woman, and made you into races and tribes so that you should recognize (ta’arif) one another.”**

What does this recognition mean? The question for us is how do we break this covenant and call when we do not respect the diversity I saw that day in Mecca, and that reality I live in, in one of the most diverse Muslim populations in the history of the world in the United States. These are questions we must begin to ask as a people who are a bridge community to the majority of humanity. How then do we begin to embrace these differences and live truly Ummah Wide? How do we live our religion Prophetically as an embodiment of the example that has been set for us and to live up to the call for justice we are held to live up to?

Related to this word *ta’arif* (recognition) in the Qur’an is the question of if we truly see each other in this world. Mostly we walk by each other hardened to the stark injustices and reality of the world, and rarely do we stop to notice each other and yet in the Qur’an God states unequivocally that the only form of privilege is the human beings relationship with their lord. In that moment in the courtyard of the mosque I noticed a man who looked much like those Bengali men I had seen at the airport hours earlier, he was one of the many janitors of the mosque whose job it is to constantly sweep up and keep the mosque clean. A man who may step foot in the mosque daily but likely rarely gets the time to stop in front of the Kaba and offer his prayers. So there he stood outside of the mosque facing the brick walls and exterior of the mosque his broom on the ground with the broom stick against his chest, hands outreached in sincere prayer to his lord.

![Photo — Dustin Craun](0*wtbt3C6nOmBakcvV.jpeg)*Photo — Dustin Craun*

While Mecca is home to the Kaba, and the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad, and the spiritual earth based core of the Muslim faith. It is also a place where twenty-five years ago you could still see the mountains surrounding the mosque, today those mountains have been mostly destroyed as has any remnant of the history of this great city. Today Mecca is becoming more and more a playground for the rich, and while those of us who can afford it can pray today two thousand feet above the *Kaba* in a five star hotel room, the reality is that this man taking a break from cleaning the mosque, perhaps his prayer is the one heard by God.

![The Abraj al-Bait Tower, the 2nd tallest building in the world towering over the kaba. (Photo—Dustin Craun)](0*XeMbUMHfBqzSCdns.jpeg)*The Abraj al-Bait Tower, the 2nd tallest building in the world towering over the kaba. (Photo—Dustin Craun)*

These were the reflections I was left with as just like that I had finished my Umrah, it was 11am and it was time for me to find some sandals and to grab a cab and head back to Jeddah to reunite with my wife. A heart filled with Gods mercy and light, my prayer was that I was able to maintain it on my journey back home.

May God bless, and guide us all!

# How To Save 10 Minutes Per Day While Browsing The Web

## How To Save 10 Minutes Per Day While Browsing The Web

I spend 99% of my working life in Google Chrome. 40–60 hours per week. That means sometimes, I surf more than I sleep.

While you may not spend more time in your browser than in your bed, like some of us, I’m still willing to bet navigating the web is a big part of your life.

So big, in fact, that you could easily save 10 minutes per day by optimizing how you do it. Regardless of [which browser you use](https://betterhumans.coach.me/which-browser-will-make-you-the-most-productive-22b0ec7eaa18), here’s how.

## 1. Think About Links Before You Click On Them

This’ll make me sound either like Captain Obvious or a sheer genius: All modern browsers show you where a link will lead you *before* you click on it. When you hover over a link with your cursor, a small preview bar will pop up in the bottom left corner, highlighting the URL.

![](1*KrFGrKX3CaOq-Q_L_00rGg.png)

This is the single most valuable feature in modern web browsing. When it comes to time, everything you *don’t do* will always have a much bigger impact than *how* you do the things you choose to go through with, regardless of how efficiently you do them. Hence, links you can avoid clicking add up quickly.

This preview, combined with the practice of interpreting URLs, allows you to do just that. If you have to click every link to figure out if it’s useful, you’re wasting lots of time interpreting information which’ll only lead to dead ends.

Take the above example. If there was a specific picture the author wanted to show that might’ve added value, she would either have included it or, at the very least, linked to a picture. But picture URLs on Instagram look like this:

```
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn9htrohACj/?taken-by=medium
```


Since she only linked to her profile homepage, it’s likely just a plug. That’s fine, but if I’m only interested in the topic of the article, that’s a link I don’t need to click. There are a million more ways you can apply this.

* When you’re looking for scientific journals as sources, don’t click on links that lead to blogs.

* When you recognize a site you’ve repeatedly visited before and didn’t like, don’t click on links that go there.

* When you realize a link is about to distract you, either open it separately and minimize it for later, or just don’t engage.

* When a link looks sketchy, it probably is. So don’t click on it.

As the word ‘practice’ implies, becoming more efficient at interpreting URLs takes time. But once you do, you can easily save 10 minutes per day with this habit alone.

The point is: Think about links before you click on them. Don’t just slingshot down every rabbit hole simply because you can.

## 2. Learn The Basic Browser Keyboard Shortcuts

Muscle memory is faster than active recall. Therefore, the less often you have to take your fingers off the keyboard, the better. Shortcuts allow you to do just that.

Instead of clicking the plus symbol to open a new tab, then click inside the URL bar, then start typing, just hit Cmd+T and start typing immediately. And so on. You only need a handful of these to get the most out of them.

* Cmd+N opens a new window. Useful for separating tasks.

* Cmd+Shift+N opens a new incognito window. We’ll get to those.

* Cmd+T opens a new tab and jumps into its URL bar, so you can start searching Google instantly.

* Cmd+Shift+T reopens the last tab. Great for when you accidentally closed the wrong one.

* Cmd+W closes your current tab or the window if it’s the last one left.

* Cmd+[Number] jumps to that tab in the current window. With 9 you jump to whichever’s the very last one.

* Cmd+L and you insta-jump into the URL/search bar.

If you’re on Windows, use Ctrl instead of Cmd. There are even [apps that help you memorize shortcuts](https://www.cheatsheetapp.com/CheatSheet/), not just for your browser, but all applications. Like [typing with 10 fingers](https://www.typingclub.com/), these mini skills go a long way.

## 3. Minimize Browser Windows You’re Not Using

I’m a huge fan of organizing my browsing activity by state of mind. What I mean by that is grouping tabs together in different windows, depending on the task, topic, or even mood they relate to.

For example, I usually have one “lobby window,” in which I open tabs with different music and that I go back to when I take short Youtube breaks between tasks. Then, I might have one window with tabs of readings I want to catch up on, one with all the tabs I need to write an article, another one with a movie for a longer break, and one to manage communications.

While that in itself is useful, switching between these windows quickly becomes confusing if they’re all just layered on top of your desktop, like this:

![](1*gkGFEI31adWaW7jpg_gR6w.png)

Instead, minimize all windows (Cmd+M) except the one you’re currently using. This way, you won’t accidentally land in a completely different state of mind or get distracted and pulled into the wrong direction.

## 4. Use Visuals For Faster Bookmarks Access

Muscle memory might always beat active recall, but even when you can’t avoid making an effort to remember things, there are things you can do to [make it easier](https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-complete-guide-to-remembering-what-you-read-1ffb74b4e04a). Like using visuals instead of descriptions.

Here’s what my Bookmarks Bar looks like:

![](1*ZUohX2TtPrgDaQKbl3AuMw.png)

As you can see, it’s all symbols. Only the folders have short descriptions. That’s because when I look at the icon for MailChimp or Gumroad or Patreon, I instantly know what’s behind them. No verbal details needed.

Doing this saves space and allows you to have more bookmarks in close reach. It also makes it easier to spot whatever you’re looking for. To get these, simply leave the ‘Name’ field empty when saving a URL (Cmd+D).

![](1*PJmI9b_0IMMLypE2sew7Rw.png)

After you’ve done so, click on it the bookmark once. The page will load and the icon should show up in your bookmarks bar.

## 5. Use Incognito Tabs Instead Of Disabling AdBlock

Ads are annoying. So annoying, I use both [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/) *and* [AdBlock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/). But sometimes, they lead to web content not being displayed correctly.

When that happens, reloading the page might do the trick (Cmd+R), but often, your ad blocker rightfully won’t budge. In that case, you could of course figure out which ad blocker you need to disable or set up an exception.

![](1*K09cWtWJdLfR8lJFUZr-vg.png)

What’s a lot faster, however, is to press the following sequence of shortcuts:

1. Cmd+L

1. Cmd+C

1. Cmd+Shift+N

1. Cmd+V

1. Enter

What this does is jump to the URL bar, copy the link, open a new incognito window, in which all extensions are disabled, paste the link back into the URL bar and load the page. The third time you do it, it takes less than 5 seconds.

Viewing pages in incognito modes has lots of other uses, especially when you’re creating on the web yourself, because you can use it to preview content as a logged out user or visitor without actually logging out of Wordpress, Medium, your online shop, etc.

## 6. Use Google To Search Specific Sites

Most websites come with their own search function, but it often sucks. Google, however, has had the single greatest search algorithm for the past 20 years. Therefore, if you’re looking for anything specific, especially something you’ve seen before, you’re likely to find it faster by searching that site *through* Google, rather than using its own mechanism.

If I search for “letter millennials Niklas” on Medium, I can’t even find my own post (although Medium’s search is usually alright). But if I plug the query in Google, it comes out right up top.

![](1*430qd_zvZT1g1keQj1krMg.png)

![](1*mm1iEKtK8pzXQFgCig7REw.png)

The format is as follows:

```
site:medium.com letter millennials niklas
```


While this is great for finding phrases you’ve read before and articles you only vaguely remember, it’s especially helpful for creators. I find it to be a better way to access my own, older content than forever scrolling through my stats page or stories folder.

## 7. Continue To Search For Keywords On Pages

Sticking with the example of a particular phrase, it often makes sense to *continue* your search once you’re on a potentially relevant page. If you stop after clicking the Google result and always read everything until you find out, you might once again waste a lot of time exploring dead ends.

For example, let’s say I want to get a few experts’ latest thoughts on the [yield curve inversion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp), a financial indicator. I google “yield curve inversion” and click on news, then open a few recent articles in new tabs (Cmd+Click).

![](1*ytZaTV2IHhmHnB0BVQwx4w.png)

Now I can cycle through these tabs, press Cmd+F in each one to open an on-page search box, and put in “inver” to get all variants of the words ‘inverted,’ ‘inversion,’ ‘inverts,’ and so on. Firefox even has an option to search a page [just by starting to type](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-set-up-firefox-for-simple-productivity-7cd3e87aa3f0), no shortcut needed.

By looking at all instances of the most relevant word, I quickly found out that the first article didn’t actually comment on whether the curve had inverted recently. It was more of an explanation. Alright, no problem, but that meant I could close that tab and move on to the next one.

You get the idea. Especially when you have to dig through long texts, don’t stop searching after googling. They’re highly related, but not the same thing.

There’s a great deal of things you can do to [use technology more efficiently](https://medium.com/personal-growth/why-we-need-breaks-from-tech-to-use-it-best-e3de310916a2). You can [streamline your operating system’s environment](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-set-up-your-mac-for-focused-work-ab3565750059), [use different browsers for different tasks](https://betterhumans.coach.me/which-browser-will-make-you-the-most-productive-22b0ec7eaa18), and [learn more shortcuts](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-move-around-your-mac-at-the-speed-of-light-e07d8d7fb89d), for example.

But I think the most valuable skills for the future will be those, which help us navigate the world’s rising tide of information. That process starts with mastering the gateways we use to access that information.

10 minutes a day add up to 61 hours a year. That’s 2.5 days. I’m sure you could use those days well. Maybe you’d spend more time with your kids, treat yourself to a weekend getaway, or learn new things.

You could also, of course, actually go surfing.

# 3 Astonishing Things I Learned by Waking Up Early

## My new book Wake Up: The Morning Routine That Will Change Your Life comes out Tuesday, April 14. In anticipation for the big release, I wanted to share some life lessons I have learned while waking up early.

Two years ago I started waking up early to carve out precious ME time each day. I was depressed and burnt out and needed a change. As it happens, this was the **single most life-changing habit I ever did.** You see, I was trying to squeeze in happy habits like meditation, exercise, and journaling throughout my busy schedule but nothing was working. Just not enough time. I was alway too busy!

It wasn’t until I started waking up early every day that I began to finally have time to do them. This ME-time every morning was vital to my well-being. I was able to string together days, weeks, and even months of waking up two hours earlier than normal.

Before I knew it, I’d been waking up early for a whole year! I [wrote about this on my blog](http://makermistaker.com/wake-up-early-one-year-later/) and it turned out to become my most popular post by far. It even led to my favorite habit tracking app Coach.me (formerly Lift) recruiting me as a wake-up-early coach!
> # ***I have grown and learned so much since I started waking up early. It was one of those pivotal moments in life where everything starts to shift. I called this my awakening.***

## WHAT I LEARNED:

### 1. I’M NOT MY MIND, MY THOUGHTS, MY BODY, OR MY TWITTER BIO.

This was a breakthrough that I learned early on through meditation and my studies on emotion and how depression works. Turns out that there’s this thing called the ego — our our sense of self. This “false self” was what I identified with my entire life up until now.

When asked “who are you?” I would rattle off something akin to my Twitter bio. You know, I’m an artist, designer, musician, yada yada. I achieved this, I did that, I like these bands, these movies, I don’t eat meat, blah blah.

**So who am I if I’m not any of that?** Welcome to one of life’s greatest questions!

Through my morning meditations, I would watch my thoughts come and go. I realized I could observe my thoughts, my emotions, and my body from a detached perspective. I can separate myself from any of the “identities” that I’ve created for myself and I still existed. I could surrender all the bullshit and baggage from my life and I would still exist. I didn’t have to maintain this “persona” anymore.

This was a game-changer for me. It shifted my worldview completely. I no longer felt compelled to chase after money, fame, respect, or admiration. I didn’t care about material goods nearly as much and I felt so much happier with less. The pressure of “being somebody” or “being important” was no longer part of my thought process. I could just be. It was such a relief!

### 2. I LEARNED HOW TO LOVE AND CARE FOR MYSELF LIKE NOBODY EVER HAS.

Another big thing that I learned by waking up early was self-love. Too often I searched outside myself for validation, help, and answers. I spent so much time pleasing other people and spreading myself thin between all the people I didn’t want to let down. But the biggest person I was letting down was myself.

By deliberately carving out time for myself each morning, something shifted in me. The acceptance, respect, and validation that I sought elsewhere I could find within. You can’t love others without truly loving yourself, as the saying goes. I noticed my mood and outlook on life brightened and my fears of what other people thought of me diminished.

I realized people come and go, but there’s one person I spend my entire life with, and that’s ME! So why not take care of that relationship? For a long time my primary motivation for waking up early was self-love and self-care. Whenever I felt scared, guilty, ashamed, needy, or whatever — I would take care of myself. I learned how to speak to myself in positive ways instead of judgmental or critical ways.

I love my relationship with my life!

### 3. I AM 100% RESPONSIBLE FOR MY LIFE. THE GOOD AND THE BAD.

And finally, the biggest thing I learned by waking up early was that I’m the one in control of my life, not anyone else. I am responsible for the good and the bad. If I don’t like my life, it’s up to me to do something about it.

Waking up early was one simple thing that gave me the power to change things. It blew the doors wide open and cleared space so I could proactively take action on the life I wanted each and every day. Sure, it allowed me to be more productive and get more done before 8 am than many get done in a full day. But the power it gave me was remarkable. The power to change my life. The power to visualize my dreams and actually turn them into a reality.

There was a shift from “life happens to me” to “I create my life.” I also became aware of the people and systems that I gave my power to in exchange for convenience, safety, or some other insecurity. Remarkably, there was a shift in my perspective that allowed me to look at all of the negativity in my life with gratitude and appreciation.

I saw difficulties as opportunities for empowerment and growth. And I got excited about taking responsibility! It was like I woke up to my own personal power. I felt stronger and more capable of taking risks and overcoming my fears.

### TRUTH, LOVE, AND POWER.

The above life lessons mesh perfectly with Truth, Love, and Power. Three pillars of growth I learned from personal development blogger Steve Pavlina. This underscores the foundation of my integrity and helps me make decisions every day.

When I started waking up early, I had no idea it would teach me so much! Not only did I wake up early, but I woke up to my true self.

**What would your life be like if you woke up early?**

# What Is the 2 Part Process To Fulfilled Goals?

## 

**Everyone wants to be successful and fulfilled.**

We get distracted though.

We have too many options and afraid of missing out.

*Sounds familiar?*

*Have you struggled with finding out what you want in life?*

If we want to be successful, we must study successful people.
> *“**Success Leaves Clues.**”*

— Tony Robbins

What we tend to find is that these successful people have things in common that I am going to talk about in this post.

There are 2 parts to setting goals and succeeding.

Priming and execution.

## The Problem: The New Year’s Resolutions Deceit
> The ability to be in the present moment is a major component of mental wellness.
> **Abraham Maslow**

New Year resolutions **don’t work** simply because we are trying to decide in advance how we are going to behave in the future. Instead living intentionally a day at a time and reinforcing the desired behaviour the following day is a better [strategy as explained by Dr. Wayne Dyer](http://www.drwaynedyer.com/blog/resolve-to-get-real/).

I have gone through new year’s resolutions and setting goals in the past, not realising I was focusing on the future and dreaming only to let these dreams die in the daylight.

This was because I didn’t take consistent daily action. There is power in dreaming and then taking daily consistent steps towards living the life that you have imagined.

Then and only then magic can happen.

My favourite quote of all time that summarises this perfectly is from Henry David Thoreau.
> *“**“If you advance confidently in the direction of your dreams, and endeavour to live the life that you have imagined, you will meet with a success unexpected in common hours”.**”*

— Henry David Thoreau

*That is why we need to prime our mind daily, be intentional and present.*

## Part 1: Priming

## Setting Intentional Goals

Goal setting is an important part of our life. We either set goals for us, or we work on helping someone else achieve their goals.

There is nothing wrong with helping others but we have to be aware that without setting goals for ourself, things are not going to go according to plan, if there is no plan in the first place.

*What happens?*

We follow the path of least resistance. We don’t want to get disappointed, we don’t want to be seen as a failure.

That’s why we choose the safe path and we settle for kinda and don’t dare to dream or wish.

In Dr. Wayne Dyer’s book “[Wishes Fulfilled](http://lifemasterycoach.co/wishesfulfilled)” there is a framework for having your wishes fulfilled.

Here are some notes I’ve taken on the **5 steps** which describe the invisible forces that make our wishes a reality.

**1. Using your Imagination** — Visualise what you want to have in life.

A. Imagination is more important than knowing. **Albert Einstein**
 B. When the subconscious mind starts to chatter, imagine putting a **Do not Disturb** sign to stop the chatter so as not to interrupt the imagination.
 C. Everything that we are enjoying now in life are all first imagined.

**2. Living From The End** — Call the things which do not exist, as though they did.

**3. Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled** — Place into your imagination the “**I am**” that you wish to accomplish.
**4. Give it ATTENTION. — **There are 2 kinds of attention — Subjective & Objective

A. **Subjective** — when you choose how to think and therefore react while you are creating your desires.
B. **Objective** — is a programmed information you have acquired by habit.
C. Make this a rule “ **Don’t complain, Don’t explain**”

**5. Now you lay me down to sleep.**
The last 5 minutes before you head to sleep. Review only what is positive and wonderful that happened during the day. Be thankful. Think of your dreams and desires.

This is powerful.

Even in the classic book “[**Think and Grow Rich](http://www.lifemasterycoach.co/thinkandgrowrich/)**” there are **6 steps to manifesting your wishes**, dreams and desires. The steps described below, talk about financial wealth, but can be adjusted for any goal you may have.

1. **Fix** in your mind the exact amount of money you desire

1. **Determine** exactly what you intent to give in return for the money that you desire.

1. **Establish a definite date** when you intent to possess the money that you desire.

1. **Create a definite plan** for carrying out your desire and **begin at once**,whether you are ready or not, put this plan into action.

1. **Write out a clear**, concise statement of the amount of money you intent to acquire. Name the time limit for its acquisition. State what you intent to give in return for the money and describe clearly the plan through which you intent to accumulate it.

1. R**ead your written statement aloud**, twice daily, once just before retiring at night and once after rising in the morning.

Therefore, there is an invisible realm that we need to place our attention and intention, equally or even more than we will do in the physical realm, as everything starts out as a thought.

## Part 2: Execution

### Life Planning Basics

The next part is daily execution.

Something I learned from Tony Robbins, is **Life Planning** and the **wheel of life**.

A life plan will add clarity and peace as you are taking a picture of where you are, called the truth and then deciding where you want to be.

Once you have placed into your imagination the image of yourself as I you would like to be, it is time to start taking action.

The wheel of life is a very basic concept. Imagine your life as a wheel. The wheel is divided up in **7–8 sections**.

* Physical Environment

* Health

* Personal Growth

* Romance

* Business/Career

* Family and Friends

* Finances

* Fun and Recreation

![Strartofhappiness.com](1*ixQbYPNZzBax3bYk-SD1eg.jpeg)*Strartofhappiness.com*

As you can see in the picture above, each section is measured from **1 to 10**. If you pay attention to one area and disregard the rest, there is going to be imbalance and stress in your life.

At what level from 1 to 10 is each area of your life at the moment, with 10 being excellent?

Now draw a line connecting all the sections with the numbers you have chosen for each area. Is it perfect circle?

Imagine now if this was a wheel on your car, called life. How would this car perform at ***10 mph**?*

***At 100 mph?***

You get the idea.

Once you have imagined how you want each of these 7–8 areas of your life to be, you can start becoming ***intentional*** with your days and the ***86400 seconds ***that gets deposited into your bank account every morning.

### How To Structure Your Goals

When starting to write down your goals for each of these areas, it is recommended that you follow the SMART and 4CF methodologies.

[SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) stands for:

* **Specific**

What: What do I want to accomplish?

Why: Specific reasons, purpose, or benefits of accomplishing the goal.

Who: Who is involved?

Where: Identify a location.

Which: Identify requirements and constraints

* **Measurable**- It needs to be measurable

How much?

How many?

How will I know when it is accomplished?

* **Attainable**- It needs to be attainable taking into account where you are starting from as it pertains to the goal

* **Relevant**- It needs to be relevant your life goals

* **Time bound**- It needs to be attainable within a specified timeframe

Also, the existence of the principles below as part of your goal, is closely related with its achievement.

4CF stands for:

* **Clarity-** It needs to be clear enough

* **Challenge**- It needs to be challenging but still within your confidence levels

* **Complexity**- It can be complex as long as all the interconnecting part are coherent

* **Commitment**- You need to make a commitment to yourself or even publicly

* **Feedback**- Review and get feedback where possible

Have you approached your goals in this format before?

# How to Beat Perfectionism With The 80/20 Rule

## image source

Perfectionism is a big obstacle when it comes to productivity. Instead of focusing on what’s important, we waste time trying to make everything perfect.

How many days have you wasted obsessing over insignificant details? And when it was all over, did you wish you had that time back to invest it into something more important?

## Why We Seek Perfection

When you’re working on a project or task, it’s all about the objective that you have in mind. The goal that you’re working towards.

However, we’re not always consciously thinking about the goal or objective. In fact, in most cases it’s unconscious.

Here are some goals that might be in your head while your perfectionism is in high gear:

* I want to be satisfied with my work.

* I want to do it better than everybody else.

* I want my boss to like me more.

* I want my colleagues to respect me more.

* I want this to make a ton of money.

* I want my mom to be proud of me.

These “goals” sound a bit ridiculous. It’s as if a 7-year-old wrote them. But that’s just how our brains operate in the background. We have subconscious needs and motivations that creep into our work.

So instead of focusing on what’s really important and what our real aim is, we end up serving our subconscious needs and desires. Like the desire for approval.

## A Better Alternative to Perfectionism

Instead of slaving to your subconscious mind, you’ll be much better off if you set the goal consciously. If you are really clear about your objective. Or as Stephen Covey said, “Begin with the end in mind.”

Write what you really want to get out of your work and what you’re willing to give in return.

For example, if I apply the concept for this article it would go something like this:

1. Reach and serve as many people struggling with perfectionism as possible.

1. Spend a maximum of 4 hours working on the article and move on.

The first point is making sure that I focus on the real purpose of the article and what I want to achieve with it.

The second point is to define the constraints. To make sure that I don’t waste time obsessing over small, insignificant details.

If I didn’t have those two points to guide me I would constantly waste time to serve my subconscious needs like, “I want to do it better than everyone else.”

## 80/20 Rule & Diminishing Returns

Even if you set your aim consciously, however, the perfectionism impulse isn’t going to magically disappear. You’ll still have to put in some effort to stay focused on what’s important. But staying aware of the goal makes it much easier than just going with the flow.

A very simple way to start overcoming that perfectionism impulse is to apply the 80/20 rule. Also known as the Pareto principle.

The rule says, “80% of the results are coming from 20% of the effort.” It means that when you’ve put 20% of the time working on your task, you’re already 8/10’s done.

The more time and effort you keep putting in after that, the less effective you’ll be.

For example, I can write the draft for the article in about 60 minutes. In those 60 minutes, the article is about 80% done. You will get 80% of the value even if I stopped after an hour of work.

For the remaining 3 hours, I might do things like:

* Format the article so it looks good.

* Fix spelling and grammar mistakes.

* Research the facts to make sure they’re correct.

* Find an appropriate header image.

All of these would add much less value to the article than expressing the main idea in the first 60 minutes.

![](1*QCoVtGAVGSvVxcBJc9IzPQ.jpeg)

The 80/20 numbers are a very broad generalization, but the rule is based on the idea of diminishing returns.
> # A point at which the level of profits or benefits gained is less than the amount of money or energy invested.

Or in other words, the more you keep working on something, the fewer results you’ll get in return.

## Prioritize, prioritize, and prioritize some more!

Cutting 80% of your working time isn’t automatically going to leave you with the most effective work. The 80/20 rule applies to tasks and to-dos, not time. The rule works only if you figure out which of the tasks are on the 80% side of the equation.

So how do we do that? We start with the end in mind. The objective.

Using this article as an example again, I’ll take my two goals:

1. Reach and serve as many people struggling with perfectionism as possible.

1. Spend a maximum of 4 hours working on the article and move on.

Then my 5 tasks:

1. Write the draft.

1. Format the article so it looks good.

1. Fix spelling and grammar mistakes.

1. Research the facts to make sure they’re correct.

1. Find an appropriate header image.

Now that I have my goals and tasks written out, it’s easy to pick the top 20% of the tasks that will give me the most results for this goal.

For me, the top 20% is just writing the draft. That’s where I should spend the majority of my time if I want to get the most results.

In the case of an article, that’s really easy and obvious. But when you’re working on more complicated projects, prioritizing is crucial. It helps to not get lost in the insignificant tasks and get the most bang for your buck.

What are you working on right now that you’re trying to make perfect? What is the true objective of your project? What are some of the tasks that are not going to make much of a difference?

# How I Lost 40 Pounds In My 50s By Combining Strategies

## Photo by patricia serna on Unsplash

I no longer had a choice. I had to do something about my health now or suffer the consequences. It was after returning from a trip to the Amazon Basin in August of 2016. My family had spent 10-days in Iquitos, Peru, living and learning from some of the most isolated people in South America. Iquitos is the largest city in the world that can’t be reached by a road. It is only accessible by plane or boat.

I got sick as soon as we returned home. This was not the average sickness that you get when you travel overseas. This was an ‘in the hospital with IVs in my arm’ sickness. During my visit to the hospital, they tested every bodily fluid imaginable. Multiple times.

They never found the cause of my sickness, and it went away after several weeks. What they did find was even more alarming. They informed me that I was 40 pounds overweight, my body fat was 32%, my cholesterol was 203, and my glucose was 109. I needed to make some lifestyle changes or I would not live very long.

I knew that I needed to improve my health, but I didn’t know where to start. I had spent years eating poorly and not getting enough exercise. Getting back into shape in my 50’s was not something that was going to be easy or happen quickly. Weight loss and muscle growth are much more challenging as we get older.

However, over the last two years, I have been able to overcome these challenges. The changes I’ve made have helped me lose 40 pounds, reduce my body fat from 32% to 20%, reduce my total cholesterol from 203 to 170, and bring my A1C to an all-time low.

Out of all the things I’ve tried, three steps, in particular, have given me 80% of the benefit. Here’s how I took them and how you can do the same.

## 1. Try Several Diets For 30 Days Each To Find The Most Effective One
> # “If you maintain a healthy diet, or at least are smart about your food choices, you’ll still see the pounds come off.” — Misty May-Treanor

We have all heard that weight loss is 80% nutrition and 20% exercise. I am not sure if that is a fact, but from my experience, unless you eat healthy, you will not lose weight, regardless of how much you exercise.

It is not easy to change your diet. I have been eating poorly for years and I love pizza, burgers, and fries. Unfortunately, these foods will not help anyone lose weight. I have tried many diets over the last year. Some of them resulted in short-term weight loss. But most of them were not healthy for the long-term.

First, I tried the Whole30 Diet. It is an elimination diet that removes all sugar, dairy, and grains from your diet. Not eating most of my favorite foods made it a difficult diet to follow. It also requires hours of meal prep for you to stay on track. The good news is that I lost 12 pounds over the course of 30 days.

Next, I tried Intermittent Fasting for 30 days. I thought that this was going to be much more difficult than it was since I have been known the get very “hangry.” I experimented with a daily schedule where I would fast for 16 hours and eat for 8. I was able to schedule my first meal at about 11:00 am and finish my last meal by 7:00 pm.

This actually worked well for me because I was able to eat most things that I wanted as long as I ate within the required time frame. Did I eat burgers and fries every day? No! I tried eating healthily most of the time but did allow myself unhealthy choices occasionally.

Finally, I experimented with the Ketogenic Diet. Despite the recent hype, the Ketogenic diet is not new. It’s been used for almost 100 years to treat drug-resistant epilepsy, especially in children. This was a good solution for me because it allowed me to eat a lot of high-fat foods that are filling and taste good. It was great for short-term weight loss, but it can be hard to follow in the long-term.

**Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that strict, rule-based diets don’t work.**

They can speed up your weight loss in the short term, but if you want long-term weight loss and a healthy body, you simply need to eat healthy foods.
> “It is also important to remember that “yo-yo diets” that lead to rapid weight loss fluctuation are associated with increased mortality. Instead of engaging in the next popular diet that would last only a few weeks to months (for most people that includes a ketogenic diet), try to embrace change that is sustainable over the long term.” — [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ketogenic-diet-is-the-ultimate-low-carb-diet-good-for-you-2017072712089)

What I ended up with is a blend of the diets I tried. I am now trying to eat a more balanced diet with more unprocessed foods, lean meats, fish, whole grains, and olive oil. I also drink at least 100 ounces of water a day. Without a balanced diet, you will not be able to transform your body.

What helped me get there is to test different diets for 30 days each. Pick one, then stick to it rigorously for one month. Repeat with different diets until you find one that will be a long-term solution for you or you can blend one together from the ones you’ve tried. If you find a diet isn’t working for you early on, stop and move on to the next one.

## 2. Walk At Least 10,000 Steps A Day
> # “The longest journeys start with the smallest steps.” — Cherie Blair

You need to get moving if you want to lose weight. You don’t need to run a marathon.You don’t need to spend hours on a treadmill. You just need to *move*.

My first step was to start walking. My goal was 10,000 steps a day. There’s nothing magical about 10,000 steps, it’s just a nice number to shoot for. An interesting fact is that that the 10,000 number originally appeared in the 1960s when a Japanese company started selling pedometers called manpo-key, which literally translates to “10,000-step meter.”

Since then, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14715035) have shown people who take 10,000 steps have lower blood pressure, more stable glucose levels, and better moods. I would not quit walking until my phone said that I had walked 10,000 steps. It was hard at first. Sometimes, I would have to go out for a walk when I was tired and just wanted to relax with my family. But I forced myself to do it every day.

Walking 10,000 steps a day was a good goal for me. It might not be the right goal for you. What is important is that you get moving. **Any movement beyond what you are doing today will improve your health.**

If you want to test what I did, walk at least 10,000 steps a day. Or set a lower number at first. If you can’t walk outside due to the weather, go to your local mall and walk inside or walk on a treadmill.

## 3. Develop A Simple 30-Minute Workout
> # “From middle age on, there’s nothing more vital to your health and weight control than building lean muscle mass, and the only way that happens is with weight training and exercise.” — Suzanne Somers

I am not a personal trainer or an expert on resistance training, but what I have learned over the last year is that resistance training is important. Dieting without proper resistance training will cause you lose muscle which is the opposite of what you want.

Resistance training can mean different things to different people, but it’s usually a form of weight training with or without weights. For some people, it might be doing bodyweight exercises at home. For some people, it might be joining a gym. For others, it might be starting a Crossfit program.

**If you’re not doing resistance training at all right now, it doesn’t matter which type of training you initially choose.** Just choose something!

I chose to join a gym and was able to find one close to my home and on my way home from work. This made it very convenient. I knew that if it was convenient, I would make excuses not to go, defeating the whole purpose of joining a gym.

Since I hadn’t been in a gym in years, I needed a simple plan to get me started. I worked with a trainer to develop a simple 30-minute machine workout that got me started. Working with a trainer is important. It helps you get started safely and to see more rapid results. Having a plan helped me know what I was going to do for each workout. Keeping it simple removed more excuses and made it easy to do.

After a few months on a basic program, my trainer worked with me to develop a more advanced program that allowed me to continue to make progress. I am not becoming a bodybuilder, but I am getting more toned and preventing muscle loss. It is important to find something that works for you and get started.

You can either do what I did and sign up for a gym and trainer, who’ll help you make a plan and hold you accountable to it, or go for a more self-disciplined type of workout that you maybe find online. The point is to develop a simple 30-minute routine you can actually follow.

## Will This Work For You?

I am not a doctor, personal trainer, or dietitian. I don’t know what your current health status is. You should discuss any lifestyle changes related to your diet and exercise with your physician.

But for most people, there is nothing stopping them from choosing to eat healthy foods instead of less healthy ones. Most of us have the ability to walk, and walking is a great way to get started. Workout routines are available everywhere, for free, and there are lots you can do without spending a lot of money or time.

The key is to commit to taking a small first step *today* that will help you live a more healthy lifestyle. Getting started will help you feel better, have more energy, and live longer.

# Real creativity requires  lenses.

## Real creativity requires  lenses.

### True creative thinking only happens when you view things through the lenses of your life experience.

Here’s some news for you: you need lenses. No, not the kind that wear on your head (though if you’re anything like me you need those too). I’m talking about the kind of lenses that only come through pursuing passions, takings risks, and stepping away from your laptop long enough to actually experience the people, places and things around you.

I’ve been thinking a lot about the concept of lenses lately as I roll into my second decade as a participant in the creative industry. Being at the point where one of my most important functions is hiring the right people and maintaining (and evolving) a culture of creativity, the issue of personal experience and how it can positively affect peoples outlooks, personality and overall creative output is one that’s been front and center for me for awhile.

## So, what’s are these lenses you speak of?

In a nutshell, lenses are a short and artful way of saying “your life’s pursuits and inspiration.” I look at them as something you collect as you progress through your life and your career. Some you’ll keep forever. Some you’ll trade in for new ones. Some you’ll toss out completely.

Everyone’s lenses are different: different combinations, different intensities, different angles. What’s cool is that you get to use them in your own way, on your own time, in whatever manner you want. Being that I’m writing this as a [creative director](http://www.faction18.com/) and with a design-focused mindset, I typically use my own lenses in my day-to-day work at [Fluid](http://www.fluid.com/). But its really up to you as to how you want to apply your lenses to your work or personal life. But the key here is that **you actually have to make it a point to start collecting them. **To many of you, I’m sure that sounds simple. But from my point of view, we aren’t doing nearly enough to collect the lenses we need to offer our clients and customers our primary product: original creative thinking that solves problems.

## I want lenses. Now. Please.

Cool. Go out and get your self some. It’s not super hard to do, but it requires one of the most valuable asset you possess: Time.

Think about how your spend your time. How much time do you spend online? On Facebook? In your car? How much time do you spend doing work you don’t care about for people you don’t know? Thought so. Looks like you just found yourself a bunch of time.

The next thing you need to do is actually figure out what you really want to do with all that newfound free time. Do you want to [invent a brand and ship a product](http://www.modernnerdapparel.com/) like [Balind Sieber](http://balind.co/)? What about surfing and [startups](https://letshum.com/) like [Dann Petty](http://www.dannpetty.com/). Or maybe a combination of [entrepreneurship](http://tattly.com/) and [mentorship](http://creativemornings.com/), like [Tina Roth Eisenberg](http://www.swiss-miss.com/)? Say what you want about these 3 examples, but the fact is that each of these people have used their life passions as powerful lenses through which to view their creative endeavors. Their results and successes speak for themselves.

## That’s all well and good. What are YOUR lenses?

Glad you asked. Here are a few, (in no particular order):

![Optimism](1*n5Y1iKtXy441J_ehoK2d8Q.jpeg)*Optimism*

Optimism is a very important lens for me. I acquired this one during the design of [lifeisgood.com](http://www.lifeisgood.com/) and although it’s one of the newest, I consider it one of my most important lenses.

![Surfing](1*YK3YbtCEGvH7-U2QiZYZ8w.jpeg)*Surfing*

I actually can’t imagine life without the possibility of surfing. I’m not super public about it and rarely talk about doing it, but surfing is a lens that I’ve had for over 13 years and one I’ll probably never trade in. There is something about interacting and having a relationship with the water that energizes me and always provides me with new, different perspectives I can apply to my life and work.

![Punk music and DIY](1*HcgqAA-ldhXdoO51TSBgkQ.jpeg)*Punk music and DIY*

Punk music (and underground music & art in general) has been a part of my life for 20 years. The lenses I’ve acquired through coming to my own understanding of punk, the DIY ethos, and independent thought has done more to shape my outlook than any other singular thing in my life thus far.

![Family](1*aM6FWWqyERWcot7soaDmNQ.jpeg)*Family*

One of my earliest lenses was learning the importance of family. Coupled with those of getting married and having children of my own, these lenses have had a profound effect on everything I do, from career and time management to relationships and free time.

### *What are your lenses? How did you get them and why do you keep them? How have they helped get you where you are today? How will they help take you further?*

# Healthy People are Boring.

## Productivity is Rigid.

![](0*OK8b5sxc2DT6RfUm.jpg)

How many times have you heard this or thought this yourself?

Do you feel like your friends, families or co-workers sabotage you?

Are you afraid you’ll lose your spontaneity and be licensed to a life of routine?

Do you think that you will never celebrate a birthday with a piece of cake or be able to work creatively because you’re on a schedule?

Enough already! Healthy people are fun. Productive people are fun. You’re just making excuses not to uplevel.

### You will not lose yourself by committing to being a better you.

Your friends may not like it.

Your family may not appreciate it.

Your colleagues may roll their eyes at you.

In the end, it’s your choice to make.

### Common misconceptions about people who give a damn about being healthy or work hard to be productive.

1. **My diet is boring.**

WRONG! I probably have a more varied diet than they do. Already today, by 1:20pm I’ve had — Brazil nuts, cacao powder, Vega protein powder, watermelon, coconut oil, grass-fed butter, chia seeds, hemp hearts, split-peas, coffee, kombucha tea, red pepper, corn tortilla, Applegate organic hot-dog, avocado, apple cider vinegar, Bragg’s amino acids and Tamari. Seriously, would you consider that boring?

I experiment and am willing to try new things. When I am traveling to another country, I eat what they eat. For real….I have no idea what some of the things were I ate in Beijing but I did pass on the fish head with eyeballs.

Whenever there is something sweet around, people will make comments about how I would never eat that or that I wouldn’t approve. Well, maybe I wouldn’t eat it, but it wouldn’t be because I didn’t want to and was ‘being good’. It would be because I really didn’t want it. I eat sweets on the weekends and holidays. Those are my food rules and they work for me. Most of the time, I find I don’t even want them.

**2) Going to bed early is for children.**

I’m a morning person. I used to get up at ungodly hours when I had a corporate job just so I could get my workout in. I still naturally wake up between 5:30–7. I like that I get up early because by the time many people start on their first cup of coffee, I’ve gotten in a great workout, meditated, ate breakfast and possibly already completed a Pomodoro. Look at the characteristics of highly successful people and you’ll see a trend toward early morning risers. There are exceptions to the rule but this is pretty common.

I avoid organized early morning meetings and chose a BNI and Toastmaster’s group because they didn’t meet early. Not because I’m not up and at ‘em, but because that’s the most important part of my day and is ‘Marcey Time’ more than anything else.

I go to bed between 9–10:30 during the week. I have no shame in this and because I don’t still have the mindset of a college freshman, I don’t see anything wrong with it. It doesn’t set me up for success to stay up *just because,* so when I’m tired or I need to make sure I get up early, I go to bed. Does this mean I don’t go out at night? Nope! If something interests me enough I’ll certainly go out, although I admit in the winter it’s hard and if something begins late, like 11 or 12pm, I tend to opt out, but I don’t feel guilty about it or like I’m less cool than you are.

**3) My fun might be your torture.**

My neighbor made the comment that ‘adults don’t play’. I play every day because I work out. I LOVE to work out. Every day I am either trail running, mountain biking, hoop dancing, throwin’ a sandbag or practicing yoga. That might not seem like play to you but it certainly is to me. After I gave up swimming, almost never do I dread a workout because I do what I like. I’m actually more excited about it the harder it is.

I haven’t drank alcohol since the 8th grade (true story) and to me, getting drunk, feeling bad the next day and possibly making a total ass of yourself doesn’t look like fun. That is your idea of fun. Have at it! In the same way I’m not boring, I wouldn’t necessarily think you’re Mr. Party Pants and more fun to hang with at an event.

![My idea of fun — 30 Hour National Adventure Racing Championships 2013](0*n2gyeHlz-zhQYH8F.jpg)*My idea of fun — 30 Hour National Adventure Racing Championships 2013*

**3) My routine and schedule allows me to be spontaneous.**

Wait a second, isn’t that an oxymoron? Not at all. Because I have some structure, I don’t get overloaded and behind. When someone asks me to do something last minute, I can usually do it. Because I make sure my work environment is productive, it allows me to feel creative and strategize about my clients.

# What I’ve Learnt From Practising Bikram Yoga

## What I’ve Learnt From Practising Hot Yoga

### Nine lessons to enrich anyone’s life

Although not a stranger to yoga, I’d never tried the ‘hot’ version before. That changed a few months ago. I’m now on this rather warm path that is throwing up creative insights, left, right and centre. Here we go.

**1First impressions don’t have to be ‘The End’. **On experiencing the wall of heat as I walked into my first class, I have to say, I wanted to run from the room shouting “no!”, “nope!” and “fire!”. But I stayed, and stayed until it became a regular practice. Hard to believe, but by my third class I hardly noticed the heat walking in (although that soon changed as the class progressed. Keeping it real). Sometimes it’s worth checking something (or maybe someone) out for a little while longer.

**2Competing against myself is the best kind of competition. **I didn’t think I could last the heat, but I did. I didn’t know that I could sweat a bucket for ninety minutes and want to come back for more, but I do. In the first few days when I wasn’t sure I would continue, I would encourage myself to take my attention off the heat and onto my body. I would gently push myself to go deeper into a pose, to hold for a few more minutes or to lift higher. It’s not really competing against ourselves so much as loosening the ego-fear dynamic that can hold us back. Got it?

**3 Success breeds success. **When you do healthful and loving things for yourself and others, you become a resting place for other healthful and loving ideas for yourself and others. Where do you think the idea for this post came from? How are you succeeding?

**4 Inspiration can be found right where you are. **By noticing what is going on in and around me during my practice (as illustrated by these nine points), I’m able to deepen my enjoyment of the experience, and of my life. Where could you glean more pleasure in your life? It really is there for the taking.

**5 It’s never too late to learn something new. **I hadn’t planned to take up* Hot Yoga*, but when the opportunity presented itself, I thought “I’m game, throw me the ball!” I hope you close out the year relishing having learnt something (or many things) new. It’s one of the secrets of eternal youth, don’t you know?

**6 We are stronger than we think.**The growing sense of inner ‘can-do’ that came from turning up and carrying on despite the initial discomfort, reinforced a rinse- and -repeat teachable moment. I was reminded again that we more easefully create, from a place of emotional safety and mental strength.

**7 I love my body.. even more. **Getting intimately acquainted with the workings of our bodies, helps us to get intimately acquainted with the workings of our lives. We cannot control our circumstances, but we can choose how we look after ourselves. And with that comes a lovely anchoring feeling independent of those circumstances.

**8 Structure is soothing and boundaries are beautiful. **One of my top values is freedom. True freedom only exists where there are boundaries, otherwise it’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing. And structure provides purpose (not too much mind), otherwise there is no forward momentum. I noticed the limits each pose held for me, but also the freedom to become and do more in the moment and over time. The structure of the class is soothing to the mind as it is predictably always the same. But my personal experience and results vary from class to class. Sweet freedom.

**9 Empathy is always welcome. **I noticed that the most popular teachers are the ones who can put themselves in the shoes of others, who smile and offer words of support, who pull the blinds down when the sun is blazing, and open a window during a stiflingly humid session. They are also the ones ironically that you make you want to go right to your edge. Why? Because they’ve created an environment of warmth (no pun intended), and safety.

It’s amazing what we notice when we pay attention.

*Jayne writes about (and consults on) unchaining creativity, feeding your power, the elegant use of emotion for intentional living, thriving through feeling, and the various nooks and crannies where they all happily collide.*

*Say hi @jayneyuk promise to reply inspite of intermittent Twitter hibernation.*

# Bulletproof Coffee&#58; My Review

## If you have been looking to lose weight since the beginning of the New Year, then there is a good chance that you have heard of Bulletproof Coffee or Butter Coffee as some people like to call it.

Many people swear by it, others call it yet another health fad, up there with kale shakes and juice fasts, but what does the evidence say, does butter and coffee together offer something unique for shedding the pounds?

First off, disclaimer alert!

I follow what is called the Bulletproof Diet, similar to the Paleo Diet, however I didn’t take the whole coffee thing seriously until quite recently.

Now, what is Bulletproof Coffee?

Well it a blended drink of high quality coffee, grass fed butter and either coconut oil or MCT oil.

The idea is to mimic the effects of intermittent fasting through the avoidance of proteins and carbohydrates, which both cause insulin secretion which can lead to fat storage. However intermittent fasting has benefits beyond weight control, studies show that it can in fact have a substantial impact on life expectancy.

So, the protocol goes that by consuming just fats in the morning you can combine the benefits of intermittent fasting while not getting hungry and losing productive hours, an apparently ideal combination for the busy but health conscious person.

Now this doesn’t mean adding a stick of butter into your instant coffee and mixing it it, yea that is gross!

No, instead, you choose high quality coffee low in mold toxins (Central American beans have the lowest levels), grass fed butter and MCT oil, then blend it using a high power blender. pretty simple really.

But does it work?

Well, yes it does. I am afraid this is a simple and easy one, in my experience and the research there cannot be much denying it.

It helps fat loss, turns off hunger for hours, is easy to make and is steadily stimulating.

MCT oil which is derived from coconut oil, stands for medium chain triglycerides and are fatty acids, essentially it allows your body to quickly make ketones, a form of energy for the body. MCT’s are coming into widespread popularity because of their number of health benefits from fat loss to the recent research examining its effects on Alzheimer’s and dementia sufferers. One of the key aspects is the very fast process in which the body can use it as energy in the form of ATP, there are only 3 metabolic steps compared to 26 for simple sugars making it ideal for long lasting and steady energy without having to go on a very low carb ketogenic diet. By incorporating MCT into the diet you can access the benefits of ketones without the difficult and constraining limits of a ketogenic diet.

You can take this a step further if you have the budget and get hold of Brain Octane Oil, produced by Dave Asprey at the Bulletproof Executive who is responsible for developing Bulletproof Coffee. It is basically upgraded MCT, the strongest stuff on the market. While by no means necessary or essential, it is frankly a big level up. Asprey has distilled coconut oil to a much greater extent with a high proportion of caprylic acid or C8 which is the fastest metabolized fatty acid for the brain. According to Asprey it is 18 times the strength of regular coconut oil. However, it isn’t cheap and if you aren’t willing to spend that bit more cash, by all means stick to regular MCT oil.

What about the other stuff, specifically the type of coffee and the butter? After all adding butter to coffee at first sounds gross and just plain weird!

Well, the butter, supplements the ketogenic effects due to it being a saturated fat, and the absence of protein and carbohydrates allows the same effects of intermittent fasting without the hunger.

However, it is important to keep it grass fed and organic as industrial dairy is often full of antibiotics from the cows and pesticides and other chemicals from their food, plus their grain fed diet harms the fatty acid profile and the vitamin levels. If you are intolerant to casein as some are, you can use ghee or clarified butter instead, I mix it up myself. Generally, lactose intolerance won’t be a problem as there is very little left in butter.

Finally, the quality of the coffee is very important, you will want to avoid cheap instant varieties and go for a high grade bean, you can see in the photos below I am using a organic whole bean from Peru. You don’t need to grind your own beans of course, but I find it helps keeping it fresh and retaining the full rich taste.

Dave Asprey talks a lot about mold toxins in coffee and while he certainly is correct on his analysis of most coffee, he suffers far more than most with toxins issues, so I feel no need to purchase his own variety. This is also because, being based in the UK, all coffee has to meet much stricter regulations on mold toxins levels than in the USA. Essentially, a good bean, ideally from a single source Central American growers and ideally organic is going to be fine for the vast majority of people.

I add some other things in like L-Theanine to take the stimulating effect of caffeine down a notch as well as L-Carnitine and occasionally Maca, I won’t discuss this in length but they are all good additions, in fact you could add many other things like some cocoa, collagen, other nootropics and powders such as creatine for example. I do a lot of bodybuilding/powerlifting so frequently add in some of my supplements to the coffee.

So what are the benefits overall then?

In short, here they are:

1) **Fat loss.** Mixed evidence but there is an overall correlation showing the increase in satiety and metabolic rate can help.

2) **Sustained and steady energy supply.** The caffeine combined with MCT’s gives a nice relaxed feeling of energy for hours without the crash associated with simple sugars and carbohydrates. This can be enhanced further by adding in the L-Theanine.

3) **Easy and quick to make. **You can put it in a thermos and take it with you plus the prep time is much less than a full meal so it is ideal for the busy and commuting person, and who isn’t busy these days!

4) **Gut health.** The polyphenols from the coffee plus the effects of the MCT are great for your gut flora. Research is mounting on the importance of gut health and the gut-brain axis. MCT has been shown to heal the gut lining and reduce gut permeability conditions in rats and in humans, due to the anti-fungal and anti-bacterial effects, it improves overall gut health.

But what does any of this have to do with willpower?

Well, one of the most important factors about having high and sustained willpower, is our energy levels and overall health.

Bulletproof Coffee is one of many ways to enhance this through the steady and powerful energy supply and focus contributed by the caffeine. Furthermore the health benefits of ketosis, keeps us in good shape but most importantly maintains our brain health. A healthy brain is absolutely imperative for strong willpower and avoiding energy peaks and crashes as can happen from sugary foods, is incredibly helpful.

This is just part of my material on the importance and effects of nutrition for willpower, and if you found this helpful and/or interesting, please go and [have a look at this article,](http://www.superhumanwillpower.com/blog/2015/05/31/nutrition-and-willpower) outlining the role of nutrition for willpower.

I have attached a series of photos from my Bulletproof Coffee ritual, in sequence of making it just to show you where I get the ingredients and all the equipment needed, it isn’t much and all the equipment can all be picked up on Amazon. A good and powerful blender is very important, mixing in the oil and butter will not taste good I assure you!

If you have had any personal experience with Bulletproof Coffee or even other fat based beverages like the tea and butter combo that Tim Ferriss is a fan of, be sure to leave a comment below.

# How to eat healthy and get rid of the excuses.

## 

## You don’t have time to eat.

## You don’t have time to prep.

## Get rid of the excuses not to eat healthy.

## Get your mouth out of the garbage can and Pomodoro that task!

I work with very busy clients. They have full schedules, more than one mouth to feed and need to eat in a way that energizes them, keeps their blood sugar stable, and doesn’t resemble something that comes in a box with a toy.

Here are the excuses I have heard:

**I want to sleep in.**

**I don’t know how to cook.**

**I just eat what my husband fixes me.**

**I hate grocery shopping.**

**I don’t know what’s healthy. Too much conflicting information?!?!?!?**

We found solutions to all of them. Keep in mind that these were specific to the individual and isn’t a catchall solution for everyone.

1. ***I want to sleep in. ***Breakfast is a must. What you eat for breakfast can affect your decision-making later in the day. I have had a few clients who liked breakfast, they just never found the time to eat it. Two clients were willing to make healthy smoothies. I encourage a lot of superfoods — hemp hearts, chia seeds, cacao powder, high-quality protein powder, berries, almond, coconut or cashew milk, spinach, kale, avocado and nuts or nut butters. This is WAY too much stuff to get out every morning. Instead, I convinced them to do what I do, which is put all the dry ingredients for each smoothie into separate baggies on Sunday. One client even does it assembly line style with her two teenage boys. I make about 10–15 bags at a time. I put a couple of tablespoons of Bob’s Red Mill Muesli in mine too because I eat mine in a bowl with yogurt or kefir. Then, all you have to do is dump the baggie in the blender, throw in your liquids and fruits and you’ve cut a lot of time. A smoothie can be made the night before too. Trigger yourself to make it right after dinner, ***before* **you plop down on the couch. We both know you won’t end up doing it later. Other options to prep on Sundays? Make 7–10 hard-boiled eggs (eggs DO NOT cause high cholesterol. There was never one single study that proved it. We were all duped.), breakfast burritos (rice tortilla, quinoa, eggs, greens, beans) wrapped in foil and stored in the freezer. Place in the fridge the night before to thaw and give it a quick heat in the morning or eat it cold.

1. ***I don’t know how to cook. ***My first recommendation is the [Stone Soup Cookbook](http://thestonesoup.com/blog/2010/06/a-free-e-cookbook/). Five ingredient, healthy meals that are a great place to start and generally take less than 10 minutes.

1. ***I just eat what my husband fixes me. ***I get it. Your spouse doesn’t like vegetables. That doesn’t mean that you can’t prep some veggies on Sunday and throw on top of whatever is served. My husband makes grits a few mornings a week. I throw sauteed onions, spinach or whatever else I have made on Sunday on top. Voila. Vegetables added and he didn’t have to do anything.

1. ***I hate grocery shopping.* **Gynecologist or grocery is pretty much a toss-up for me in the fun category. However, I make 90% of my meals and most of them are from scratch. How do I handle my anti-love for the supermarket?

1. Amazon Subscribe and Save — I’ve turned several clients on to this beauty. I get all of my paper goods and a LOT of my dry goods here. I save at least 15% off the already low Amazon price, it comes to my door on a schedule I choose and I can easily change it if needed. My next order consists of cayenne pepper, single-serve bags of almonds for Hangry snacks, Wild sockeye canned salmon, miracle shirataki noodles, Julia’s organic grits, Kleenex, hemp hearts, toilet paper, Jyoti canned dal, chia seeds, nutritional yeast, tahini, sardines, pre-cooked individual servings of quinoa (great for mobile work and lunch-packing), coffee and supplements. Whew! It also saves me from buying unnecessary stuff that I always found ended up in my cart. I love it so much, I’m shocked when people **don’t** use it once they find out about it!

1. Community Supported Agriculture — I use[ Papa Spuds,](http://papaspuds.com/?rid=3172) local to Raleigh-Durham. I consider them one of the best because I have full control over what comes in my box, delivered to my door every Wednesday. I can choose from a variety of fruits and veggies but can also get chicken, beef, fish, pork, eggs, cheese, milk, mushrooms, coffee, chocolate, honey, and condiments. There are even pasta, breads and pizza crust options.

1. What’s left? Frozen and refrigerated foods like yogurt, kefir, and my beloved rice flour tortilla shells. I use Earth Fare for that and meet people there in the eating area for 1:1s. This is a combo move that is productive because I’m already there and can just grab and go.

1. I have three clients I talked into using either a full grocery delivery service or a grocery pick-up. Many grocers have this now. Place your order on line and pick it up or have it delivered during designated times. The price is minimal compared to how much time you spend in the grocery.

1. ***I don’t know what’s healthy. Too much conflicting information?!?!?!? ***I hear you. There is conflicting information. Why? Sometimes it’s because it’s just bad information to begin with (like the eggs debacle), other times it’s that new research has come out, the research is biased to begin with or that all of the information** is** correct. What’s one person’s potion is another person’s poison. You can’t listen to a soundbite and say that whatever it is must be good for you. Coffee is good for some disease prevention but not others. It also depends on a specific gene you have and how you metabolize coffee. My Hashimoto’s diet may not work for you. What is ONE thing that will always be in agreement? Less or no sugar and vegetables. Lots and lots of vegetables.

Set aside time 1–2 days a week. I choose Sundays and Wednesdays for myself. Turn on a timer and do as much food prepping, cooking, steaming and baking as you can. In a couple of timed events I can get a lot of my food made for the week.

Cook once. Eat 2–3–4 times.

*Are you willing to try any of these methods to improve** your** nutrition?*

# This 10-Minute Routine Will Increase Your Clarity And Creativity

## This 10-Minute Routine Will Increase Your Clarity And Creativity

*“Your subconscious mind works continuously, while you are awake, and while you sleep.”* — Napoleon Hill

Your subconscious never rests and is always on duty because it controls your heartbeat, blood circulation, and digestion. It controls all the vital processes and functions of your body and knows the answers to all your problems.

What happens on your subconscious level influences what happens on your conscious level. In other words, what goes on internally, even unconsciously, eventually becomes your reality. As Hill further states,* “The subconscious mind will translate into its physical equivalent, by the most direct and practical method available.”*

Consequently, your goal is to direct your subconscious mind to create the outcomes you seek. Additionally, you want to tap into your subconscious mind to unlock connections and solutions to your problems and projects.

Here’s a simple routine to get started:

## Ten minutes before going to sleep:

*“Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious.”* — Thomas Edison

It’s common practice for many of the world’s most successful people to intentionally direct the workings of their subconscious mind while they’re sleeping.

How?

Take a few moments before you go to bed to meditate on and write down the things you’re trying to accomplish.

Ask yourself loads of questions related to that thing. In Edison’s words, make some “requests.” Write those questions and thoughts down on paper. The more specific the questions, the more clear will be your answers.

While you’re sleeping, your subconscious mind will get to work on those things.

## Ten minutes after waking up:

Research confirms the brain, specifically the prefrontal cortex, is most active and readily [creative](http://jn.physiology.org/content/109/5/1444.abstract) immediately following sleep. Your subconscious mind has been loosely mind-wandering while you slept, making contextual and temporal connections. [Creativity](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-real-neuroscience-of-creativity/), after all, is making connections between different parts of the brain.

In a recent interview with Tim Ferriss, [Josh Waitzkin](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/03/23/josh-waitzkin-the-prodigy-returns/), former chess prodigy and tai chi world champion, explains his morning routine to tap into the subconscious breakthroughs and connections experienced while he was sleeping.

Unlike 80 percent of people between the ages of 18–44 who check their smartphones within [15 minutes of waking up](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/smartphones/480485?red=at), Waitzkin goes to a quiet place, does some meditation and grabs his journal.

In his journal, he thought-dumps for several minutes. Thus, rather than focusing on input like most people who check their notifications, Waitzkin’s focus is on output. This is how he taps into his higher realms of clarity, learning, and creativity — what he calls, *“crystallized intelligence.”*

If you’re not an experienced journal writer, the idea of “thought-dumping” may be hard to implement. In my experience, it’s good to loosely direct your thought-dumping toward your goals.

Consider the “requests” you made of your subconscious just before going to bed. You asked yourself loads of questions. You thought about and wrote down the things you’re trying to accomplish.

Now, first thing in the morning, when your creative brain is most attuned, after its subconscious workout while you slept, start writing down whatever comes to mind about those things.

I often get ideas for articles I’m going to write while doing these thought-dumps. I get ideas about how I can be a better husband and father to my three foster children. I get clarity about the goals I believe I should be pursuing. I get insights about people I need to connect with, or how I can improve my current relationships.

To be sure, you’ll need to practice this *skill. *It may take several attempts before you become proficient. But with consistency, you can become fluent and automatic at achieving creative and intuitive bursts.

## Conclusion:

*“A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.” *— James Allen

Mental creation always precedes physical creation. Before a building is physically constructed, there’s a blueprint.

Your thoughts are the blueprint of the life you are building one day at a time. When you learn to channel your thinking — both consciously and subconsciously — you create the conditions that make the achievement of your goals inevitable.

You are the designer of your destiny. This simple routine will help you crystallize where you want to go, and how you will get there.

### What a newborn baby can teach us about product development.

My friend is the father of a newborn. She is four months old.

She can’t talk. At best she makes these funny, incoherent noises. She can’t walk around or toss a ball or high-five. She can’t draw pictures or solve math problems. She can only flail her limbs while strapped into a comfy chair that plays music.

Mostly, she’s just thinking about the world around her. She looks around, taking everything in, trying to figure out what in the world is going on. She’s quite a contemplative person I’d say.

Soon her curiosity will turn into exploration as she starts to crawl and walk. And this will make her think and reflect about the world even more! Eventually she’ll start developing a system of beliefs and values long before she realizes what those words even mean. She already has a personality. She giggles and laughs at me and gets cranky when she poops in her diaper.

I watch her grow every week. Each time I see her she is a little chunkier, spunkier and more curious than ever.
> # Less thinking, more doing.

I see this mantra a lot lately as adults are talking about building a product or company.

Obviously, it’s meant to encourage adults to get off their butts and actually do something instead of just thinking about it, which is certainly great advice.

But if you tell your boss you’re going to come in at noon tomorrow in order to spend the morning walking aimlessly in nature, exploring and reflecting on the things that shape your worldview, he might look at you funny.

Though, I bet you’d come to work feeling completely refreshed, rejuvenated and as-ready-as-ever to get shit done. I wonder what might happen if managers began requiring employees to spend a sizable chunk of their work week reflecting, talking to others about life and exercising that muscle of utmost importance to ourselves and ultimately the organizations we work for: our brains.

Babies get it.

# Instamemories

## Instamemories

### just going with it

Instagram is not only a place to share photos, but also a source that gives you the opportunity to see into others everyday lives and live a little piece with each post.

This weekend had been pretty amazing. My lady and I woke up and decided to head towards the LA area. On our way their, my girlfriend opened Instagram to contact a photographer she follows. Our first stop turned into a photo shoot with this amazing photographer named Greg Campos. You can view his work here [Gregorio Photo](http://gregoriophoto.com/)

![[@jennasherrill](http://instagram.com/jennasherrill) Behind The Scenes photo by [@chrisferrill](http://instagram.com/chrisferrill)](0*enZDpd4oSmlzHtQT.jpeg)*[@jennasherrill](http://instagram.com/jennasherrill) Behind The Scenes photo by [@chrisferrill](http://instagram.com/chrisferrill)*

After wrapping up the shoot we headed west to Newport Beach where we had been invited to meet another Instragram friend. He and his wife were two of the nicest, most kindhearted people I have ever had the opportunity to meet and share an evening with. During dinner we shared many stories, getting to know one another and even discussed my current start up [**Tattwo Apparel](http://shop.tattwo.com/).**

Dinner in itself was an amazing experience. Captain Jack’s atmosphere was alive with colorful fish tanks on every wall. Everyone was enjoying themselves so much you literally had to yell across the table to speak with your friends. Nights like these are ones you will always remember.

![AVP Championship Huntington Beach, CA photo by [@chrisferrill](http://instagram.com/chrisferrill)](0*b81gLL8RvmAA_OlI.jpeg)*AVP Championship Huntington Beach, CA photo by [@chrisferrill](http://instagram.com/chrisferrill)*

When we awoke the next day, we decided to take a morning walk on the beach while drinking our coffee. After we rounded a corner, there stood a huge AVP stadium, where later that day would hold the 2013 AVP Men & Women's Volley Ball Championships.

After leaving Huntington Beach we headed to the La Brea Tar Pits where I proceeded to post this picture below. A few minutes had gone by and I was already getting a message from my hometown friend, that he and his lady were going to be in the area and wanted to grab lunch. It had been quite some time since I had seen him so it was pretty cool getting to hang out and catch up for a bit.

![La Brea Tar Pits photo by [@jennasherrill](http://instagram.com/jennasherrill)](0*U2nt6HbyUfElFgkc.jpeg)*La Brea Tar Pits photo by [@jennasherrill](http://instagram.com/jennasherrill)*

Now get out there and start making your own Instamemories. Next time you are visiting a city just hop onto Instragram and say something like ‘Hanging out in *Huntington Beach *this weekend-who wants to grab a beer and hang out?’ You’ll be surprised by the amount of people who are actually looking forward to meeting you and sharing stories.

Follow me on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/chrisferrill) and lets hang out. I’m always traveling and would love to meet and make Instamemories with you.

# Struggling to Stay Keto? Why Relying on Willpower Is a Bad Idea

## 

It’s happened again.

You’ve succumbed, and lost the battle with:

* the chocolate chip cookie staring back at you as soon as you open your pantry

* the bread that’s right in the middle of your dining table

* the easy-to-cook, kid friendly spaghetti dinner that’ll be ready in 30 minutes.

And just like like last time, you were quick to blame yourself for not enough willpower, poor motivation, or lack of self-discipline.

But what if it weren’t those things at all? What if it wasn’t your fault? And what if it was entirely something else in your control that you can easily turn into your favor?

## Candy bars and grocery stores

Ever wonder why candy bars are at sold at the checkout line at grocery stores? It’s not a random placement.

It’s based on a study out of *Stanford Research Institute* called *Suggested Impulse Buying*. It says you don’t necessarily buy something because you want it, you buy it because of how it’s presented to you.

Think about it. Would you have even thought about going to the candy aisle if it wasn’t Halloween?

But now there it is, so cleverly placed in front you, where you can’t miss it — **the checkout line.**
> **You didn’t have to exercise willpower when you weren’t presented with a candy bar. But now you do.**

## Bottled waters and a hospital cafeteria

But what if you were presented with healthy choices instead?

That’s exactly what researchers did at the hospital cafeteria of *Massachusetts General Hospital*** **in Boston:

**a) **They added bottled waters in all their refrigerators.The major refrigerator units still had soda in them, they just added bottled waters to it.

**b) **They added baskets of bottled water which were placed throughout the room.

Nobody said a word about any of these changes and yet [soda sales dropped by 16.5% and bottled water sales rose by 25.8%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22390518) . Behavior changed all because customers were simply presented with a healthier choice.
> **Without tapping into your willpower, you can make better choices just by changing your environment.**

## Change your environment

### 1. Surround yourself with keto staples

Stock your fridge and pantry with some of these simple and basic ketogenic food staples.

* Meat (rib-eye, t-bone, ground)

* Poultry (thighs, wings)

* Pork (bacon, pork belly, ribs)

* Seafood (salmon, tuna, mackerel)

* Low carb veggies (*avoid starchy veggies like beans, carrots, corn, parsnips, peas, potatoes, yam)

* Leafy greens

* Avocado

* Eggs

* Real butter

* Cheese (*avoid highly processed ones like Velveeta, Kraft Singles)

* Cream (heavy cream, sour cream)

* Nuts (macadamia, pecans, almonds, walnuts)

* Beverage (water, plain sparkling water, coffee, tea)

* *Optional: s*ugar substitute (liquid stevia, pure granulated erythritol)

### 2. Win the battle at the grocery store

Imagine your grocery cart as a fortress. It needs to be fiercely defended. It’s the point at which you don’t let the enemies in.

If bread is not in your grocery cart, it doesn’t end up in your home, and you don’t have a bread battle to fight to begin with. Eliminate them.

Here are some of the worst offenders:

* bread, muffins, bagels

* tortillas, wraps

* rice, pasta, potatoes

* grains (even “whole” grains), flour, cornmeal

* cereals

* chips, crackers

* desserts, treats

### 3. Deploy a winning strategy

But your fortress can be breached. It happens. Perhaps not everyone in your home is trying the keto lifestyle.

Now what? “Hide” them.
> **“Eye level, is buy level”.**

Tap into the science of how *Visual Merchandising* and *Shelf Placement* influences a consumer’s buying behavior. Did you know that grocery items placed at eye level sell more?

* Place keto food staples at eye level shelves in your fridge or pantry (so it’s the first thing you see).

* Place a basket in the middle of the dining table for non-refrigerated keto items like nuts and avocado (so it’s in your line of vision).

* Put non-keto foods in a place where it wouldn’t be at your eye level (i.e. lower shelves, higher shelves).

* Put non-keto foods in a place where you’d have to overcome an obstacle or a barrier to get to it. Make it harder for yourself to get it. For example, place cookies on the highest part of the cupboard so you’d have to pull a chair and stand up on it to get to the cookie.

* See if you can get a trusted member of your household to hide non-keto foods from you. It can be moved around if you accidentally find them.

## The problem with relying on willpower

Willpower is a limited resource. It gets drained as you use it for all kinds of decisions you make throughout the day — big or small.

And it’s depleted when you need it the most: like at the end of a long day, when you’re tired, stressed, or sleep deprived.

Making little changes to your environment may seem too simple, trivial, or inadequate to make a difference.

But the results are real.

It’s easier to run on concrete than it is to run on a thick sandy beach. It has nothing to do with your running skills, it’s the environment you run on.

It’s easier to find pumpkin spice lattes in the Fall than it is during the Summer. It has nothing to do with your perseverance, it’s the environment in which you find it.

Likewise, a ketogenic lifestyle doesn’t have to be a constant struggle and an uphill battle.
> **It’s not about sheer willpower.**

Picture yourself in an environment where keto choices are the default. Create this winning advantage. And let your behavior follow suit.

# Knock it out of the Ballpark!

## Sharing the good times makes the good greater. We might barely know the other players, but it doesn’t matter. The fact of sharing the experience makes it better for everyone involved. Our instinct for empathy functions even if we don’t call on it. (1, 2)

We also know that our ability to focus on the people in our lives is a direct reflection of our emotional intelligence and relationship skills. ([3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062114867/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062114867&linkCode=as2&tag=gregooscicen-20)) How do we improve them without practice? How do we practice them without focus?

These sound pretty great, right? Sharing? Win! Focus? Double win! Better relationships? Triple play! How could we have too much?
> # “No one has ever become poor by giving.” — Anne Frank

But let’s consider the **quality** of our social participation:
> “We text friends while at a party, check our Twitter feed while out to dinner, and play Sudoku while watching TV with family — without meaning to, we are unsharing experiences with the people around us,” says [Boothby](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/sharing-makes-both-good-and-bad-experiences-more-intense.html?utm_source=pressrelease&utm_medium=eureka&utm_campaign=sharingintensifiesexperiences). “A pleasant experience that goes unshared is a missed opportunity to focus on the activity we and others are doing and give it a boost.”

With one swift chain reaction of poor choices that turn into long term behavior patterns way too fast, we have built the very obstacles to our own life satisfaction. Bad play.
> “…emotional intelligence requires self-awareness — awareness of our own minds and emotions — as well as empathy, both of which can be cultivated by honing our skills of attention.”

Need some more good reasons to develop the ability to focus? [Cultivating attention makes it easier for us to make better decisions](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/2/369.abstract). It supports [neuroplasticity](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143113100?ie=UTF8&tag=gregooscicen-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0143113100) ([2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092549271000288X)), [working memory, and fluid intelligence](http://jtoomim.org/brain-training/Zeidan2010_Mindfulness_Meditation.pdf). It alleviates symptoms of stress, [anxiety](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Weinstein-MindfulnessStress.pdf), [depression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21135325), [post traumatic stress disorder](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/treating_the_wounds_of_war/), and [sexual dysfunction](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/mindfulness_treat_sexual_dysfunction). Of course, all of this makes us [generally happier](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_killingsworth_want_to_be_happier_stay_in_the_moment), [more productive](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-4537.00148/full), and even [decreases our mistakes](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-4537.00148/full).

That is a lot of wins!

This isn’t a rant against technology. This is a manifesto to develop the skills we need to live a satisfying life. Technology is amazing. We can’t escape it, and it isn’t going anywhere. What we **can **do is learn to manage our relationships with our technological tools so that they serve us more effectively.

# Urban Adventuring for 10-Year-Olds

## Urban Adventuring for 10-Year-Olds

### There is no better way for a kid to learn self-reliance.

“When you were little,” my mother says today, “I’d send you out for the day, then cry because I was worried sick.” These were the days when playing outside was the default—we never played inside unless it was pouring rain (and even then, if it was warm, we’d probably be out in the rain getting soaked).

As far back as I can remember, almost every weekend, I’d leave the house in the morning, and not come home ‘til dark. This was in Charlottesville, Virginia, which was a much smaller town in the 1970s than it is today.

Sometimes I was alone, but most of the time I was with my best friend JB. We both had 10-speed bikes, and we rode as far as many serious adult cyclists. For us, every weekend was a time for urban adventure. We took it seriously, always on the lookout for new discoveries.

We’d take note of things while we rode—an abandoned house, a water tower, a storm drain—then follow up on these opportunities later.

One area on the south edge of town called the Woolen Mills was a top destination. Named after a Civil-War-era mill that made wool uniforms for troops, it was an urban adventurer’s paradise. There were two abandoned power plants, both crumbling and in ruins…an old dam across the Rivanna River (now gone)…a high railroad box trestle across Moore’s Creek…and a rusting water tower.

![Remains of an old power plant in the Woolen Mills neighborhood of Charlottesville, Virginia—still there 40 years after we explored it.](0*mvf0jrDGoUx6E4R3.png)*Remains of an old power plant in the Woolen Mills neighborhood of Charlottesville, Virginia—still there 40 years after we explored it.*

We spent countless weekends exploring the Woolen Mills. We picked our way through the hulking ironworks of the old power plants, marveling at the glass-faced gauges, chains hanging from the ceiling, and huge iron valves. At one point we laid claim to everything left in the plant, assuming at some point we’d figure out how to drag it all out of there.

We climbed the rusting water tower, carefully scanning the area to be sure nobody was watching…then scrambled up the caged ladder to the narrow catwalk around the base of the tank, where we’d sit and survey the area for other opportunities.

![The Woolen Mills water tower we often climbed as kids in the 1970s.](0*r1YZndpIpqIglWUz.jpeg)*The Woolen Mills water tower we often climbed as kids in the 1970s.*

We crept across the box trestle, under the tracks, inching our way along six-inch wide beams a hundred feet above the creek. Sometimes a train would cross while we clung to the trestle beneath…and we’d hunker down and plug our ears against the roar.

My mother surely would have had a heart attack if she’d known what we were up to. But the important thing, mom, is that we were never careless. Every adventure was carefully analyzed ahead of time: we talked about the chance of failure, what might happen, how we’d escape; and were always cautious.

In this respect, I guess we were odd for 10-year-olds. As I said, we took this stuff seriously. We weren’t going to get hurt or caught—and neither ever happened.

## We had a saying: Nothing is too hard for the average American kid.

Another favorite adventure was exploring storm drains. There was one in particular that was like a subterranean highway: two six-foot-high square, concrete tunnels that ran for a mile or two beneath Emmett Street past a busy shopping center.

![An opportunity like this was irresistible to us.](0*Q3K0dTXs-mj4L3oH.jpeg)*An opportunity like this was irresistible to us.*

We only did this on sunny days with no chance of rain. And we were well-equipped with rubber boots and flashlights (and extra batteries of course). We’d walk through the tunnels (which normally held only a trickle of water), and explore smaller side tunnels. We’d often have no idea where we were relative to the surface, but were always careful to remember exactly how to get back the way we came.

Sometimes we’d find a vertical access pipe and climb up, crack open the manhole at the top, and peer out to see where we were. Another time we scored a pair of walkie-talkies, and one of us walked through the tunnels while the other followed on the surface, describing the tunnels’ path.

Perhaps one of our greatest extended adventures involved the Paramount Theater down on Main Street. Now restored and a thriving community theater, there was a fire next door in the early 70's and the theater was shut down for several years.

A few years after it was closed, JB and I were poking around an alley on one side of the theater when we found a door that was chained loosely—loose enough for us to pull the door open about a foot and squeeze into the dark theater.

![The Paramount Theater in Charlottesville, Virginia.](0*JF9LpwyeY40LwfZy.jpeg)*The Paramount Theater in Charlottesville, Virginia.*

I’ll never forget the first time we entered. In the narrow cones of our flashlights, we saw chandeliers covered in spiderwebs and red velvet seats covered in dust. It was an ornate theater, with baroque, gold-leafed decor.

Over the next several weekends, we returned to the theater and spent hours inside, exploring everywhere. We carefully pulled the doors closed to ensure nobody thought they were open, and were equally careful to be sure nobody ever saw us entering or coming out.

The high point of this exploration was when we explored the projection booth, where we found the original projectors: hulking *Motiograph AA* models, which used a carbon arc as a light source. There was still electricity in the theater, and we found the operating manuals for the projectors. It was only a matter of time before JB and I—two 12-year-old kids—fired up the Motiograph and lit up the Paramount’s screen for the first time in years with nothing. The thrill was awesome.

![A Motiograph AA carbon-arc 35mm projector (many are still in use today).](0*bjmmiL_HSKPQJZIi.jpeg)*A Motiograph AA carbon-arc 35mm projector (many are still in use today).*

Alas, our adventures came to an end when one Saturday morning, all geared up for adventure, we found someone had pulled the chains on the doors tight—and shut us out. We were crushed…but the memories are still vivid.

Occasionally our adventures drifted into the potentially illegal. One example was the University of Virginia’s McCormick Observatory, which houses an impressive refractor telescope built in 1885.

![UVA’s McCormick Observatory.](0*K38RD7ieCuQerWVG.jpeg)*UVA’s McCormick Observatory.*

On one desolate winter Sunday morning, we were poking around the observatory when we found an open window—so of course we climbed through it, then stood in awe beneath the giant telescope. We did nothing (we were smart enough not to actually mess with anything), but for two little kids, being in the closed observatory by ourselves was an adventure.

It’s often said that kids these days don’t play outside. Or if they do, it’s highly-supervised (and/or confined) play. I hope that’s not really the case. The adventures I had as a kid not only fired my imagination, but made me self-reliant. I always knew there was nobody to get me out of a jam but myself—and that’s an invaluable lesson for any kid to learn.

Most importantly, kids can’t learn this lesson with helicopter parents. It’s just not the same. Kids are smarter than we think, and they’ll rise to the occasion when they know they have to.

And to my brave mother, who had the wisdom (yes, *wisdom*) to let me go on those mornings, knowing she’d have no clue where I would be all day, I say thank you. The worries may have been terrible, but you were teaching me self-reliance that has benefited me throughout my life.

# 5 Easy Habits to Improve Your Self-Confidence

## 5 Easy Habits to Improve Your Self-Confidence

### Train People Skills, Not Charisma

According to [the etymology of the word](https://www.etymonline.com/word/charisma) “charisma,” it is something you have, or don’t have. It’s like artistic talent. No amount of training could’ve taught me how to draw beautifully. I simply have very little capacity in that area.

Moreover, charisma and confidence go hand in hand. I know, because my son is a very charismatic person and very confident at the same time. One cannot exist without another.

However, charisma is a magic-like ability to influence other people, and not everybody has to possess it. For a common mortal, it’s enough to have **decent people skills**, and confidence can be built **independently **of charisma.

Here are several habits that allow you to grow your confidence and people skills at the same time. By the way, your confidence and how you interact with others **highly overlap** with each other. I personally used them all with excellent results. Their huge advantage is that they don’t need the cooperation of other people. Everything is dependent solely on your actions.

## **1. Observe People.**

![](1*gujbTY7dmlthfmtXzplKxw.png)

Instead of spending time in your own head thinking about your issues, look around and notice who is there. Think of them in a positive way. How do they look? What aspects of their behaviors do you admire? What’s original about them? What could you praise them for?

Whenever you take your attention away from yourself and positively focus on others, you dwell less over your insecurities and shortcomings.

## **2. Have Conversations with People.**

I had hundreds of conversations with strangers. Not even once were people offended that I started a conversation, and very rarely they hinted that they have no desire for a chat.

![](1*Qe31mJA6YdWP1OFOuYZd5g.png)

Here is a twist: when I had been starting this practice, I was terribly shy. So I started from having a conversation with people **in my own mind**. I visualized how I approach them, how I start a conversation, how positively they react, and so on, till the friendly adieu.

Your mind cannot recognize your imagination from the reality, so you will get interactions and confidence training almost as effective as the real conversations.

## **3. Make Eye Contact.**

This is one of the signs of confidence in social interactions. I have another powerful twist from my experience. Do you remember the questions about people from #1? Whenever you notice something positive, admirable or original, make eye contact and say that to them… in your mind.

![](0*ED5ByDFLYSQf0FBP.jpg)

We are social animals. People will sense you have positive feelings toward them. More than once, a woman thought I was hitting on her, in an appropriate meaning of this expression, of course.

When I don’t have any other thing to “say” to them, I say *“I love you.”* Thanks to my religious background, I firmly believe all people are brothers, so there is not an ounce of falsehood in this statement.

## **4. Smile.**

![](0*zD2b4EVF-GhpzGe9.jpg)

When you catch someone’s eye contact, smile. The broader, the better. Even if you are as timid as I, a tiny move of your mouth will not go unnoticed. Smiling is infectious.

Very rarely can people connote any malicious intention with a genuine smile. Often, they will smile back at you. Sometimes I use this fact to start a real conversation: *“Thanks for smiling back, not many people do that, but it brightens the mood, don’t you think?”*

## **5. Keep a Good Posture.**

![](1*ph-gV6tliNpFO8MSZ9TvNA.png)

Don’t slump. Keep your head high. Keep your back straight. If possible, move sharply, with energy emanating from you.

People will notice all of this. Human communication [is only 7% verbal](https://www.businessballs.com/communication-skills/mehrabians-communication-theory-verbal-non-verbal-body-language-152/). The rest of the meaning we take from facial expressions, a tone of voice and body posture.

## **Social Skills and Confidence**

How do all of those tiny disciplines build your self-confidence? Well, confidence is a two-way trait. It is as much about what you think about yourself, how others perceive you, and how you think they perceive you.

If you start to notice people around you and think about them positively, if you make eye contact and smile at them, and if your body language is half-decent, people will notice and appreciate you as well. You will read those tiny social cues from them. They will start to smile back at you, start a nice conversation and so on. You will affirm your own confidence through their eyes and action.

It’s an upward spiral. This is how I transformed from a socially retarded introvert into a man who can start a conversation with any stranger.

Practice those tiny disciplines long enough, and they will become automatic and a part of your personality. Nowadays, I can’t help but smile at people.

![](1*qRwKMQA75ntfWHL_xDR2nQ.png)

Seeing another person’s face is a sure trigger that brings the smile to my face.

# How To Use BlockSite To Make Sure You Never Read Fake News Again

## How To Use BlockSite To Make Sure You Never Read Fake News Again

I keep seeing [real news articles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/11/15/facebook-must-confront-the-responsibilities-of-being-a-media-company/) about how Facebook was promoting fake news articles to hundreds of millions of users.

Those fake stories get promoted through a Facebook algorithm that only looks for whether you clicked and liked an article. The algorithm doesn’t know if something is true or not.

As a result, fake news that appeals to our own biases has been spreading rampantly.

Thankfully, [Melissa Zimdars](https://twitter.com/mishmz) has been collecting a list of all of those fake news sites.

These sites are like the National Enquirer but even shadier. Most people like their news with a partisan slant. This list won’t block those sites (HuffPo, FoxNews). The list is really focused on the truly bogus.

[Here’s the list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10eA5-mCZLSS4MQY5QGb5ewC3VAL6pLkT53V_81ZyitM/preview).

But… you’re not going to read and memorize that list. That would be a waste of your time.

Instead, try the Chrome extension, BlockSite and a [CSV file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yjxask9teuy4a40/fakenews.csv?dl=0) that I created based on the document above. This tool will automatically block any sites that you want to block. You just install BlockSite and then import my CSV.

I’ll walk you through it step by step.

Start by [downloading BlockSite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en).

Once it’s installed, open up the BlockSite options.

![](1*oQb8xsVBlTt3edPIJiGjHA.png)

At the bottom of the BlockSite options is a way to import sites from a CSV file. That way you don’t need to type them in by yourself.

![](1*HVHkDGdHmxMdVs6Q54CL7w.png)

Thanks to computer programmer magic (in a past life I wrote a programming book on regular expressions), I went ahead and created a CSV file out of that list of fake news sites.

All you have to do is download this [fakenews.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yjxask9teuy4a40/fakenews.csv?dl=0), save it to your computer, and then import the list into BlockSite.

*Aside: I’m thinking of BetterHumans more and more as being about personal augmentation: you + tool = better you. In this case, BlockSite is a truth filter. You + BlockSite = Intelligence Upgrade. It’s pretty exciting how many easy ways there are to upgrade our brains.*

# The Champion’s Blueprint and How To Win Before You Start

## “Mediocrity pisses me off.”

Dr. Jeff Spencer spoke with a deep passion. *“I was asked, why does success matter? Well, I’ve never met a person who couldn’t wait to get up and fail.”*

Dr. Spencer knows a thing or two about success. He was an Olympic cyclist, a performance coach for 7 winning Tour De France teams, and is a mentor to everyone from olympic gold medalists to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. He’s worked with Sir Richard Branson, Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, Bono, Maria Sharapova, and many more of our generation’s top achievers.

*“What I’ve discovered is that success doesn’t come from will, talent, or tactics. The winners know something everyone else doesn’t. They’ve discovered that success is both a path and a process.”*

That path is called the Champion’s Blueprint, and the process is the collection of predictable patterns that live within its 8 steps. The Champion’s Blueprint is sixty years of experience packaged into a framework for living a Champion’s life.

I was fortunate to learn the details from Dr. Spencer at one of his [live events](http://drjeffspencer.com/workshop/) and I share my top 5 takeaways in this post. We’ll also run through the blueprint together for one of your goals.

Take a moment now and imagine yourself standing on life’s pedestal as a gold medal is placed around your neck. You had a vision of a better you and a better world, and you now join the elite few who achieve those goals, who reach their full potential.

To the Michael Jordan’s of the world, that gold medal is the honor of being the top of their craft. To the Steve Jobs’, it’s the vision they manifested into reality. To someone else, it could be finishing the marathon they thought was impossible, and to another it’s being the best parent they can possibly be.

What is that gold medal to you?

![](1*vnVR0b0McbDGe-b-e9VLHA.png)

## **Take A Seat**

Your path to success will have its surprises.

*“You’re going to get punched a lot along the way,”* Dr. Spencer likes to say.* “And the punch you should fear is the one you don’t know is coming,”*

In boxing, your cornerman helps you know when to expect punches so you can safely guard against them. He’s always on your side, watching your progress, patching your bruises, and advising you on the patterns you don’t see.

Rocky’s cornerman, Mickey, would sit Rocky down on a stool between rounds and whisper strategies in his ear. But then, before the bell rang, he would pull that stool out from underneath him, forcing Rocky to stand.

Dr. Spencer is your Mickey and he’s sitting you down right now. Here’s what he’s saying.

## **1. You Will Never Arrive**

The first and most important cornerman lesson: You will never arrive at the “top” that you idealize.

That gold medal vision you seek is a false summit.

If you want to make a million dollars and you do, what then? Either your ambition will push you to desire more money, or you will realize that money was not really your goal. Either way, your climb doesn’t stop. There’s plenty more mountain ahead of you.

Too many of us don’t recognize this. We imagine our ideal life at the top and push as hard as humanly possible to reach it. Along the way we sacrifice our health, relationships, and time. We stop caring for our wellbeing as we kill ourselves to reach our goal. We leave the people we love behind to fend for themselves. Before we realize it, we’ve grown old and weary. When we turn around, we’re shocked to see the destruction we’ve caused along the way.

One attendee shared his story: For years he worked tenaciously to reach the top of his industry and he eventually made it, earning lots of money and influence. But when his 5-year-old daughter wrote him a note asking to schedule time in his calendar to play, he realized he had forgotten everything that was truly important.

You never arrive.

This sounds hopeless and depressing, but it’s not.

It just means the top is not our goal. Life continues past it and we must sustain our energy and resources so we can continue to climb.

Knowing this empowers us to reconsider how we’ll climb and why we climb in the first place.

## **2. Start At The End**

Most people leave their legacy to be determined at the end of their lives. They think legacies are meant for the tombstones of the deceased.

A Champion, however, starts at the end and then lives with intention. They define their legacy first and spend the rest of their life living by it.

Your legacy says who you are, how you live, what you believe in, and what you will ultimately leave behind.

By defining your legacy today, you develop integrity for your life. That integrity is a filter for every decision you make. When offered a new job, confronted with a moral dilemma, or even when deciding how to spend your free time, choose the option that enhances your legacy.

We will work together on your legacy statement in a moment, so keep this in mind.

Once your legacy is in place, then consider your vision.

If Michael Jordan’s legacy was to elevate the game of basketball, to rise in every big moment, and to inspire greatness in all those who watched him, then his vision was to win six championships and be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

A clear vision gives you purpose and direction.

Guided by your integrity and driven by your purpose, you light the internal spark. You know the direction you must go and the person you must be. Now you must build the courage to believe it is possible.

Too often we think about the negatives, the reasons we aren’t capable, and the situations that didn’t go our way. We think *“if only I were like another person, then I’d be successful.”* We question our own abilities, succumb to our fears, and whine about situations to justify our mediocrity.

This mindset will gladly sacrifice your higher potential for decisions that lead to safety. To rise above, you must alter your perspective.

Practice believing in yourself. *“I’m my greatest asset. I’ll find a way. It’s in my power.”* Visualize your success and begin to internalize it. Make this mindset part of your identity and soon you will feel that internal spark swelling with enthusiasm.

Now, grounded in integrity and enlivened with the passion of purpose and courage, you are ready to grow.

## **Let’s Take Action**

*“The Champion’s Golden Rule is, you do the homework and the test is easy.”* Dr. Spencer says this frequently. *“The Champion’s Blueprint is really the art of winning before you start.”*

Let’s win right now. Grab a notebook and pen and let’s act on the first four steps of the Champion’s Blueprint. Then we’ll cover the last 3 takeaways.

### **1. Write your legacy statement.**

Writing your legacy statement can be difficult. It requires deep and honest reflection.

Ask yourself:

* How do I want to be remembered?

* What do I want to be know for? Use adjectives, like courageous or caring.

* What do I want to contribute? Use nouns, like a book or my business.

* What are key moments from my past and what do they say about my beliefs?

You don’t need to be perfect. Understand this is a “living legacy” and it will evolve over time. It’s more important to start.

Maybe you are known for being helpful, curious, grateful for every moment, and eager to help others find peace. Or maybe you are an explorer, someone who sees life as an adventure, seeks to increase freedom, and chooses to live every moment to it’s fullest.

Write a few statements that are unique to you.

My legacy statement has changed many times already. You can see my current one in my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/markmoschel) (the 140-character version). While you’re there, send me a tweet!

### **2. Visualize your purpose.**

Ask yourself:

* What do I want to achieve?

* How do I envision life at the top?

Don’t be afraid to dream big. Most people dream too small. The bigger your vision, the more motivated you’ll be to chase it and the more inspiring it will be to everyone who observes it.

Be *“responsibly aggressive” *and make your vision ten times larger than what feels comfortable.

Draw your vision right now. Then come back to it often.

### **3. Align your mindset.**

Ask yourself:

* Am I mentally prepared?

* Am I thinking with a Champion’s mindset?

Review the mindsets below and align yourself with thoughts of excellence (the right column).

![](1*NM115KMev84-gSatvByaVg.jpeg)

### **4. Gather your resources and build your team.**

Ask yourself:

* Do I have the time, finances, equipment, space, and knowledge to sustain my climb?

* Is my team in place?

No one wins without a team.

Good teams harmonize their efforts to boost the group to a higher level of performance. They have each other’s backs and support each other when things go wrong. Collectively, we’re capable of accomplishing so much more than we could alone.

![](1*JmDdjPfm41tbWFdgnlCxLw.png)

Find the people who match your values and add them to your team. Avoid anyone who drains your energy.

Without adequate resources and support, you cannot sustain your climb. Go find the resources and team that will form the foundation of your success.

### **Do the homework.**

I know we covered those four steps quickly, but if you haven’t already, take a moment now to answer the questions above. Even a rough draft gives you a good start.

Remember the Champion’s Rule?

Okay, let’s continue.

## **3. Focus On Expansion**

Traditionally, we achieve our goals by working hard.

In the Champion’s Blueprint, we surpass our goals by continuously expanding our capabilities.

10,000 feet from now, our world will not be the same. By focusing on expansion, we are prepared to change as life changes around us.

Expansion puts emphasis on the process rather than on the goal. Remember, you will never arrive. Simply working hard toward a goal will lead to inevitable disappointment. You instead must climb without requiring a summit. At every step, you slowly and consistently increase your capabilities. If your goal changes, you are ready. If you reach your goal, you have the foundation to continue.

Expansion requires patience. It is tempting to sprint to your goal, but then you wear yourself down. You must grow sustainably. Spend time reviewing your motivation and nurturing your team. Spend time internalizing your mindset and improving your health. Spend time learning the details of your skill and practicing your leadership.

Expansion is a process and it requires a daily effort.

## **4. Show Up Every Day**

Champion’s show up. Every day.

Your integrity isn’t something you can shift on and off. You live by it daily. Each morning, you renew your enthusiasm for it. You wake up and ask: *“How will I show up today?”* The birth and death of your daily motivation is a choice.

Every day, visualize a bigger dream.
Every day, internalize a Champion’s mindset.
Every day, nurture your relationships.
Every day, fuel your health.
Every day, practice your skill.
Every day, take one more step forward.

It is consistency that makes your success inevitable and sustainable. Choose to show up every day and build that choice into your daily routine.

## **5. Expect Adversity And Know It Is Opportunity**

Adversity is inevitable. It is also predictable.

At some point, you will hit a reality check. You will question yourself and your progress. If you are not ready for it, fear will win and you will eventually quit. If you expect it and focus on the 1–2 things that must go right, you will come out of it with renewed strength and enthusiasm.

At some point, you will fatigue of the daily grind. Your efforts will be greater than your perceived results. If you do not expect this, you will push harder and burn out. If you do, you will know to focus on the process and continue showing up each day. You will not consistently look up or down, but straight ahead. You will savor the daily practice and eventually get over the hump.

At some point, other people will pull you down and pummel you with punches. If you are not ready, you will expose yourself while fighting back and be knocked out. If you are ready, you will know to stay positive, to consult your cornerman and nucleus of friends, to conserve energy, and to stay true to your integrity.

These challenges are coming. The goal of the Champion’s Blueprint is to set your expectations so you are ready for them and know how to respond.

*“The greatest energy consumer of all time is anger,”* Dr. Spencer says. Do not let anger control your actions.

Instead, ride the wave: Breath. Stay present. Focus on the process and don’t forget who you are.

In the end, you learn valuable lessons when confronted with these adversities. Honor the process and be grateful for the opportunity to grow. You are always better on the opposite side of your worst moment.

## **Now You Stand**

*Remember:
*You will never arrive.
You will start at the end.
You will focus on expansion.
You will commit to showing up daily.
You will expect adversity and emerge from it stronger.

It’s time to pull the stool out from under your seat and step back into the ring. You are ready for the next round. You now walk in the footsteps of all the Champions who have come before you. It is your turn.

Stand and choose to be a Champion.

# How to Crush It with Your New Habits

## How to Crush It with Your New Habits

### **Practical Advice that Will Make You Unstoppable**

David Allen, the author of “*Getting Things Done*,” broke down what’s going on in the human brain when we decide to do something. It applies to everything, from implementing a multimillion dollar business venture to walking your dog.

So, it can be also applied to habit formation. For each phase there are a few questions you ask yourself to determine your process. Those phases are:

### **Vision**

What’s the purpose of your simple-good things? Why are you going to start them in the first place?

Those phase also defines your principles. The moment you think about your vision, you also have your constraints and limitations in mind. “I’m too busy to spend 10 hours a week in a gym”, “I’m vegan, so its’ hard for me to keep low-carb high-protein diet”, “I work 2 full-time jobs, so sleeping 8 hours a day is out of question”.

### **Purpose**

What am I trying to do here? What I’m trying to accomplish? What would wild success be?

### **Brainstorming**

What are all the potentially relevant things that pop in your head about simple things that are good for you?

What could you do? What areas it involves? How can they fit your schedule? What would your family react to them?

Brainstorming implies dumping every relevant detail from your head onto paper. You generate ideas, raw data. There is no judgement involved. You don’t ask what’s possible, but “What if?”

### **Organizing**

How do I get there? What is the most important? What would the biggest thing I need to think about?

This phase is about sorting through the raw data in terms of priority, sequence, or components.

### **Next Action**

What’s the very next step to undertake?

This phase and answer to the above question provides you with the specific action you need to do to move forward.

## **Habit Formation with 5 Phases**

![](1*vAj60MtKJTTO5hLuYXJUOQ.png)

The trick with habits development is to ask all the above questions in the perspective of regular practice.

For greenhorns in habit development, I highly recommend to frame those questions in terms of everyday disciplines. It’s much easier to develop a daily habit than a bi-daily one, and it is exponentially easier than to develop a weekly habit. In the same way, developing a habit that is practiced a few times a day is significantly easier than developing a daily habit.

### **Ask Yourself:**

Why am I going to start doing simple things that are good for me **every day**?

What am I trying to accomplish **every day**?

What are the relevant things for a **daily **practice?

What is most important for a **daily **habit of those simple things?

### **Good Advice**

You need to **start small** to keep doing your disciplines every day. It’s best to focus on **one thing at a time**, otherwise there is a great danger that you will get overwhelmed and quit.

### **Your Why**

But if your “why” is big enough, you can start multiple habits, as long as they are small enough to be sustainable. “Small” is relative. For some, it’s one pushup; for others, 5 minutes of pushups.

When I started to turn my life around, I started several 10-minute habits at once and quickly added more to this load. Every habit expert would tell you that this is a recipe for disaster. I succeeded, because my “why” was big — I wanted to [completely change my life](http://expandbeyondyourself.com/slight-edge-report-year-four/) — and because those habits were “small” in my mind.

![](1*Kejx9yFOSrpZ4Ibo4Q_i-w.png)

Adding a series of pullups on top of a series of pushups I had already been doing, was **not **a big deal for me. 
Studying the Bible 10 minutes a day was a small potato. 
Practicing speed reading for 10 minutes was laughable. When I was a teenager, I had read two books a day.

## **Tiny Habits**

I highly recommend taking a [Tiny Habits course](http://tinyhabits.com/). It’s free. It’s simple. It takes only one week. You don’t commit more than 1 hour of your life to learn and implement everything. You end up having three new habits and an intimate knowledge about developing habits that comes from experience, not theory.

Super-fast, you will learn how to frame Allen’s 5 Phases in context of daily disciplines.

Seriously, this course will answer your question: *“How to start?”* in a way that will allow you to internalize the answer for it. You will never have to wonder about this question again.

## **Tips & Tricks**

Going intentionally through those 5 phases will provide you with action steps that will be easily implementable into your life and your specific situation.

And that’s what successful habit development is about. You need to sleep better, eat better, and move better where you are — right now — not in some ideal future conditions.

You will discover how to start and how to continue. Your eyes will open to the opportunities you hadn’t seen before.

### **Integrate a New Habit with Existing One**

When I wondered about 4½ years ago how I can improve my physical wellbeing, one of the first things that came to my mind was increasing my water intake.

![](1*ScM-ExZcmUG7VdoWXeOkLg.png)

I hated drinking pure water, but I wasn’t properly hydrated and I often had headaches because of that.

I trained myself to drink two glasses of water early in the morning. It was pretty easy because my cue was finishing my morning workout which I had been doing for years at that time. That habit was firmly established and it was a foolproof trigger for drinking water.

Once I learned how to force myself to gulp water, it became easier for me to increase my water intake throughout my days.

### **Have a Crystal Clear [Endpoint ](http://expandbeyondyourself.com/infallible-framework-for-habit-development-endpoint/)(So-called Reward)**

![](1*WWoRh9Q8D-P5_xFO_XvNAg.png)

I do every morning a hardcore version of HIIT workout.

I do pushups, pullups or chin-ups to a failure point. It simplifies my workout immensely. I just push or pull to my limit and that’s it. No thinking involved.

### **Don’t Change Your Life (Very Much)**

Use the opportunities that already exist in your life. When I had been losing excess weight in 2013, I embedded a few habits into my daily routine.

At that time I lived in an apartment building with an elevator on the first floor — (second in American notation) — I decided to never use an elevator. It was only 16 additional steps one way, maybe a calorie or two. But it **compounded **because of **repetition**. Every time I was going out of my flat, I burned an additional calorie.

![](1*vmcmX3SFuQmWtHTbXvC-Eg.png)

Then I scaled it up and decided to always run the steps. Then I decided to run stairs every single time. Now I live in a house and my bedroom in on the upper floor. I run 17 steps up and down every single time. I run stairs on my daily commute to and from work (about 200 steps).

This little discipline amounted to thousands and thousands calories burned while simply living my life.

## **Start Small; Start Intentionally**

Intentionally going through the process of habit design helped me to build this automatic discipline (steps= run) practically effortlessly.

Start where you are — with what you have — and then build on it.

# Think, Watch, Do&#58; 3 Simple, But Powerful Self-Awareness Exercises

## It never ceases to amaze me how much you can learn from movies, books and music, even if it’s completely fictional. Take Harry Potter, for example.

No matter how many times I watch it, read it, or think about it, I always find something new that’s interesting. Here’s what I learned from it this week:

In every trio there is *a thinker, a watcher and a doer*.

Take our three aspiring magicians, for example.

![[Source](http://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/harry-potter-bffs)](0*gwy4oc2ENQELBS9b.)*[Source](http://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/harry-potter-bffs)*

Who’s who is obvious:

* **Ron’s the doer**. He charges right ahead and he doesn’t know what he’s doing most of the time.

* **Harry’s the watcher**. He observes everything and tries to process it. If you’ve ever wondered why he spends so much time of the saga on the sidelines, either incapable of acting or reluctant in deciding, that’s why.

* **Hermione’s the thinker**. She doesn’t just observe things, but deliberately takes time to think about them *before* she gets more information. That’s what makes her so brilliant.

When you try to identify these types for the people in your life, you’ll see the thinkers are the ones who seem to have it the easiest while the doers are frustrated a lot.

That’s because this categorization corresponds to [different levels of self-awareness](http://niklasgoeke.com/self-awareness-activities/): **the thinkers know themselves best**.

This is *not* to say one is better than the other. In fact, we have to carry all of these types within us. It’s just that the thinkers tend to know best when to take on which role. At the same time, it’s the capacity most of us have developed the least.

Whatever mode you spend the majority if *your* time in, there are certain things you can practice to get to the next level.

Today, I’d like to show you three self-awareness exercises to achieve just that.

## Self-Awareness Exercise #1 — For Doers: Apologize

Since he does first and thinks later, Ron is often wrong. That’s why he’s making a fair share of apologies. Apologies to Harry, apologies to Hermione, apologies to his family.

![[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_dukNgLPg)](0*-vz4k4FLO9HOVDXl.)*[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s_dukNgLPg)*

As a doer, that’s one of the best things he can do. You can’t apologize without acknowledging you’ve made a mistake. This acknowledgement is where self-awareness comes from.

## **Exercise:**
> The next time you feel embarrassed because you know you just made a mistake, don’t brush off that feeling. Take it as a chance to quickly turn this obstacle around by apologizing.

I used to *hate* apologies. Especially as a teenager. Over the years I’ve come to see that not only is the transparency and [vulnerability](http://niklasgoeke.com/being-vulnerable/) of it liberating, but it actually helps you see the kinks in your armor — and how could you iron out what you can’t see?
> # Apologize fast, apologize often.

[We hate admitting mistakes more than making them](http://fourminutebooks.com/black-box-thinking-summary/), but when you do, you won’t turn into a hypocrite and can reflect on how you can do better next time.

## Self-Awareness Exercise #2 — For Watchers: Journal

When you observe so much, it’s hard to keep track of everything without writing it down. And write a lot Harry does. He writes letters to everyone, he writes in detention and he even had a diary that one time…

![[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDBbf2p8jYY)](0*-CI8OH7-_knrEzQU.)*[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDBbf2p8jYY)*

This is a good idea for watchers in general. There’s a saying by Confucius:
> “You cannot open a book without learning something.” — Confucius

Well, you also can’t write a sentence without learning something. The simplest form of journaling I know is [the 1-sentence journal](https://www.quora.com/What-tiny-daily-habit-could-be-life-changing/answer/Niklas-G%C3%B6ke).

## **Exercise:**
> Take a thought-provoking question and answer it in one sentence, but answer differently each day.

There are endless possibilities to design this exercise and you can change the question from each week or month to the next.

* Why did you get up this morning?

* What made you go “huh?” yesterday?

* Were you content before you fell asleep?

![](0*u0QmHRKZirLwKQs3.)

You can also gear your questions towards when in the day you’re answering them. For example, here are some ideas for good questions to ask yourself in the morning:

* Do you feel ready to tackle the day? Why? Why not?

* What was the first thing you thought of after waking up?

* What’s one thing you’re grateful for?

* What’s the most important thing you want to achieve today?

* Did you sleep enough?

* What are you most excited about today?

Then again, you might want to journal before bed. In that case, you could answer an evening question. Here are some examples:

* Why did you get out of bed this morning?

* What’s the best thing that happened today?

* When did you feel happy or content today?

* Which hour of the day was your favorite?

* What did you learn today?

* Did you do your best today?

* How could you make tomorrow an even better day than today?

* What thing are you most excited about for tomorrow?

Even in this tiny format, journaling helps your brain structure the things you observe and get better at filtering what matters. That way you can take action in a more targeted way and have to apologize less.

If you want to grow this habit over time and slowly spend some more time each day, there are a lot of pre-structured journals out there too. Here are a few some of my coaching clients and I have used:

* [The 5 Minute Journal](http://amzn.to/2oqUh8p)

* [The SELF Journal](http://amzn.to/2oqHjY6)

* [The Productivity Planner](http://amzn.to/2oqVAUD)

* [The Freedom Journal](http://amzn.to/2oqPgN0)

* [The Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/)

You could also journal online, using an app like [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) or [Penzu](https://penzu.com/), but there’s something visceral to writing by hand, which I prefer.
> # If you’re a watcher, you’re great at watching life.

Might as well remember what’s important. Journaling helps you do just that.

## Self-Awareness Exercise #3 — For Thinkers: Read

When you generally have a good sense of what’s going on, which events are most important and where action’s required, it’s up to you to now extend this knowledge *at the right ends*. That’s why Hermione’s favorite place is the library.

![[Source](http://nomercy68.deviantart.com/art/Read-195306023)](0*kyj8yOV_RzTxJ-CQ.)*[Source](http://nomercy68.deviantart.com/art/Read-195306023)*

Thinkers transform their good contributions to great contributions through selective and well-timed reading. Reading the right thing at the right time allows your neurons to find the best connections between the pictures in your mind.

## **Exercise:**
> Read at least one page a day.

[Wittgenstein prompted us to read many books to expand our language](https://medium.com/personal-growth/wittgenstein-why-should-you-expand-your-vocabulary-9669325487c6). You can only know if you’re an ambivalent person when you know what that means. But you don’t have to overdose either. Thinkers usually have a fairly ingrained reading habit as is, but here are some resources that have helped make mine better:

* [**Time 2 Read](http://time2read.co/)**. A free, 14-day email course I made to get your reading habit off the ground when you’ve fallen off the wagon.

* [**The Complete Guide To Remembering What You Read](https://medium.com/@ngoeke/the-complete-guide-to-remembering-what-you-read-1ffb74b4e04a)**. A post I wrote to help you retain more.

* [**A Kindle](http://amzn.to/2gPFX99)**. Easy access to books on the go. It removes the friction of having to carry books around.

* [**Books first, rent second](https://ryanholiday.net/how-to-read-more-a-lot-more/)**. Ryan Holiday never worries about money spent on books. I try to do the same.

* [**Four Minute Books](http://fourminutebooks.com/)**. A stash of 400+ short non-fiction book summaries with three lessons each.

* [**The Daily Stoic](http://amzn.to/2uGGlg5)**. A great philosophy book by Ryan Holiday, which is literally set up to read one page day.

* [**Blinkist](http://fourminutebooks.com/go/blinkist/)**. An app that provides you with 15-minute summaries of non-fiction books.

The extension of knowledge we get from reading always comes with a side of self-awareness: are you the kind of person who can put it to good use?
> # A page a day goes a long way.

Being able to tell *what* you need to learn next and *where* you can find it is one of the highest forms of self-awareness.

## Think, Watch, Do — The Path To Knowing Oneself

Only the best of us carry multiple characters around in our chest that we can draw on at will. We all begin one way or another. Start looking around. You’ll find this 3-type pattern in all famous trios. Them…

# Homero Simpson dijo una vez…

## Homero Simpson dijo una vez…

### Homer Simpson once said…

Guest Blog- Roxana - Buenos Aires - On Posing Nude for the First Time

Homero Simpson dijo una vez: “No puedo decir la palabra teta sin reirme como escolapio”. Mi timidez se describe perfectamente con esa frase. Y se comprueba constantemente en mi vida cotidiana; cuando me visto tapando alguna parte de mi cuerpo que quiero disimular, cuando me sonrojo al recibir un cumplido o cuando evito decir alguna palabra que me avergüence pronunciar. Con todo esto, es difícil creerme si digo que hubo una ocasión en la que participé desnuda en una sesión de fotos. Y mucho más difícil es creerme si afirmo que me sentí totalmente cómoda al hacerlo.

Y es que siempre consideré al cuerpo humano como una de las más bellas herramientas del arte. Por que es eso, una herramienta que se usa para expresar. Es incalculable la cantidad de sentimientos, sensaciones e ideas que el cuerpo puede transmitir con una imagen. Quizás por eso fue que cuando me propusieron posar para una pintora y un fotógrafo sin portar ningún tipo de ropa me entusiasmó tanto la idea, y ese entusiasmo aplastó inmediatamente a las dudas que podían provocar la timidez y la inseguridad que crónicamente acompañan mi vida.

Creí que iba a tener problemas en el momento de desvestirme, pero no resultó así. Fue extraño, pero sentía una confianza hacia los dos como si los conociera de años. La comodidad es un requisito fundamental en situaciones como esta. No sólo por el tema de estar totalmente desnudo frente a otra persona, sino también porque si no hay comodidad no hay base donde apoyarse para expresar ni para capturar expresiones y el resultado de esto puede ser decepcionante.

# The 4 Questions that Define You&#58; Aristotle and a Deeper Dive into Self-Awareness

## The 4 Questions that Define You: Aristotle and a Deeper Dive into Self-Awareness

### How the “Four Causes” of an ancient philosopher can be used as an exercise to help you live with more purpose and focus.

We all get stuck from time to time. We all fall into a rut, where it seems like we can’t move forward and make progress — at least not in the way we’d like to. While tips and tricks abound for trying to get around the problem and keep moving, any of them are going to be short-lived if they don’t address the root cause of most procrastination and stagnation: a disconnect from who you are.

The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle dealt extensively with understanding the essences of things — whether people, animals, plants, or stones. He defined 4 different ways to answer the question of what makes something what it is. They are:

* The Material Cause

* The Formal Cause

* The Efficient Cause

* The Final Cause

These 4 causes are extremely valuable as a way to get a better understanding of yourself — who you are, and where you are going. And when you remember who you are, you can get going where you’re going. You can overcome the stagnation, and drive forward.

### The Material Cause

Aristotle defined the material cause of a thing as the physical stuff that made it up. For a human, it’s flesh and blood, but if we stretch the concept a bit, its also your thoughts and feelings — the mental building blocks of a person. For our purposes, that’s what is most important to get in touch with. The way to get a grasp on the material you is through introspection and simple self-awareness.

Simply being aware of what is on your mind right now is so valuable, and yet so overlooked. At any moment, you have way more on your mind than you are initially aware of. And all that stuff on your mind has weight to it — it impacts your mood and your energy. It also takes up space. It keeps other thoughts and feelings out of your mind, or relegates them to the background, when perhaps they should be in the foreground — pushing your activity in a positive direction.

Getting to know the material causes of yourself is as easy as journaling. Simply writing down the things that come to your mind, and doing a bit of exploration about them on paper can clear up that space in your mind, and take a weight off of you. With that done, it becomes easier to do more constructive things.

### The Formal Causes

For Aristotle, the formal cause of a thing is what makes it the particular *kind* of thing that it is. Another way to put this, and a way that some medieval philosophers took it, is that the formal cause captures the *essence* of something.

For us, it’s first and foremost about what makes us human, but if we push it further, we can ask what type of person I am. Am I a writer? Well, what is it that makes me a writer? What makes anyone a writer? To me, it seems that what makes someone a writer is that they think and write above all else. Activities and thoughts flow into words on the page, into paragraphs, and into essays of wisdom worth sharing. But for each of us, there is a *thing* that we are above all else, and at times, we lose touch with what kinds of thoughts and activities constitute being *that thing*.

In so many cases, we procrastinate by doing something other than what our *thing* is. Asking the question of what makes you a writer, an artist, a leader, a founder, etc., can quickly get your thoughts and actions aligned once again with that formal cause of whatever it is that you are — and back on the path you’d like to be walking.

### The Efficient Cause

The simplest way to understand the situation you’re in is to ask yourself what led you there. Trace the events back to a tipping point. Trace your thoughts back to what event or experience set them off. This is the efficient cause — the concrete events that put things where they are now. Part of journaling should be reflecting on these events, and understanding how they fit in the chain of events in your day, week, month, year, and life.

George Santayana once said “*Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.*” And it’s not just remembering the past, but also being willing to take a hard look at it now, when you may be ashamed of it or made uncomfortable by it. We cannot know who we are unless we fully come to grips with where we have been and what we have done. Without doing that, any progress we make is borrowed, and the debt will be due before we know it.

### The Final Cause

The final cause of a thing is its purpose — it is the *why* to end all *whys*. For us, it is the one thing that we are most often unclear about, and that is what most contributes to periods of stagnation and frustration. But we cannot beat ourselves up about forgetting our purpose, because purpose is a complex thing, and I believe that it goes through changes.

Though we can use the term “purpose” in the singular form, purpose is rarely felt as a singular force. There are multiple pulls and pushes on us at any given time — we are different people to each person in our lives. But that should not deter us from defining ourselves and our work in a singular fashion. The difference is in the nature of those forces, which are either a pull or a push.

The various things we are to others — a parent, a friend, a sibling, a partner, etc. — are *pulls*. Though we can genuinely come to define ourselves through the lens of being those things, they are dependent on the demands of others, and so not wholly ours, and they don’t come from within. This is not to say that those pulls are not worth devoting time and attention to — they surely are. But they are incomplete without an examination of the final cause that comes from within you — regardless of the demands and needs of others.

The final cause for you is a push — and it comes from within. It is what you are to become, and what — in your best moments — you care most about. It may express itself in what you do with and for others, but it comes from within, and through inward energy it is sustained. You may be a mother or father as an expression of your final cause, but your true inward push is caring, serving, and teaching. Whoever you happen to care for, serve, or teach is simply happenstance.

When we lose touch with our final cause, we can feel lost. Many of us can go through most of life without understanding what it is — without a clear knowledge of what we’re driving toward.

When we lose touch with what makes us who we are, we lose direction and energy. That’s why things like meditation and journaling are so vital to living well. They help us get in touch with the 4 causes that make us who we are. When we understand *why* we are, we can know *who* we are, and we can do the daunting work of being that person.

Existence is a given. You exist, and you are what you are. But only when you really knuckle down can you take that given existence and make it into a life. Only by understanding who you are, and who you need to be, can you do the rewarding work of living a life.

# The Happier Days Formula&#58; How to Engineer More Happiness into Your Life

## The Happier Days Formula: How to Engineer More Happiness into Your Life

Bad days are bound to happen.

Anyone who says that they’re happy all the time is flat-out lying to you or not actually human. Experiencing sadness, and a wide range of other, less attractive emotions, are a part of what makes us human.

Back in 2011, I had a lot of bad days. [Many mornings](http://www.themonklife.net/morning-anxiety/), I would wake up depressed, [anxious](http://www.themonklife.net/anxiety-troubleshooting-guide/), and wondering if it was worth getting out of bed.
> # *“Ugh, what’s the point today?” is something I would ask myself a lot.*

When most of your life is spent having bad days, that’s a sign that you need to reevaluate how you’re living. For me, it became clear that I wasn’t doing many things to contribute to my happiness. I had fallen into a rut and was wandering aimlessly through my days, mostly allowing others to dictate my schedule.

No more. I was sick and tired of waking up unhappy, dreading my days before they even began.

As an engineer, I’m a big fan of equations and repeatable formulas to spit out an expected result. If it worked for [Bernoulli](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pber.html), then why couldn’t it work for my happiness?

After some personal experimentation and lots of tweaking, I found that the days I was happiest were those that factored in these 4 principles:

* Doing more things that I genuinely enjoy doing

* Doing less things that I hate

* Spending time with uplifting people

* Practicing gratitude

Each principle seems simple enough in theory, but in practice, is much more difficult to implement; otherwise, everyone would be running around as happy as they could be.

How can you implement these into your life? Let’s take a look.

## 1. Doing more things you genuinely enjoy doing

This one is fairly obvious — doing more things that make you happy, should make for happier days. Duh.

But, when was the last time you intentionally added something into your day just to improve your happiness? If you’re like the old me, that actually sounds pretty exhausting. My days were already filled to the brim with things I had to do.

But, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from being a giant sack of misery, it’s that for happiness’ sake, you must do things you enjoy.

What could you possibly add into your day that would make you happier?

For me, it was hoops with friends, playing chess with a close friend over lunch, and going out to eat with a girlfriend or my bros.

If you’re struggling to come up with ideas for things to do, try thinking back to activities you used to enjoy doing but for whatever reason don’t anymore.

Start with college and work your way back to grade school.

I used to love playing pick-up basketball in college and grade school, but was something I had gotten away from after graduating. It was a no-brainer that it made me a happier person (and was a heck of a workout), which is why I made it a staple during my weeks.

### **Action:**

Your turn. Come up with a list of potential things that you could do to brighten your day and then plan and schedule them into your calendar. Trust me, you will have time for them, especially after implementing the second happiness principle.

## 2. Doing less things that you hate

If you’re going to be adding enjoyable things into your day, that likely means you need to cut other stuff that you simply hate.

A good philosophy that I’ve adopted is one that I picked up from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/hellyeah), “If it’s not a ‘hell yes!’, then it’s a ‘hell no’.”

I realized quickly that part of my daily misery was because of two things:

* Extracurricular things I was doing at work, mostly to impress my boss and appease my coworkers

* Writing short, SEO-focused articles for other people as a freelancer

Both things were activities that lots of other people might enjoy — mingling with other people and making money. But for me, they weren’t a “hell yes!”, which meant that for my happiness, they were “hell no’s.”

Suddenly, I found myself having all kinds of free time in the evenings. With that time, I was able to start adding in more things I genuinely enjoyed into my life. After about a week, I’ll be damned if I wasn’t a good bit happier.

### **Action:**

What are some things you can cut from your day that you hate doing? Think about all the things you’re doing for others’ happiness and not your own. Note that this doesn’t mean you need to quit your job immediately if you hate it. That was an issue for me, and is eventually something I worked my way out of, but that requires more forward planning than just dropping it from your calendar.

## 3. Spending time with uplifting people

The famous quote, “you are the average of the 5 people you surround yourself with most” has been beaten to death by this point, so I’ll leave it at that.

Negative people have a way of draining your energy. During that dreaded 2011 year, not surprisingly I had a girlfriend who simply sucked the life out of me. She rarely had anything positive to say and was constantly finding something to complain about.

Young love be damned; I knew I needed out of that relationship. So, I did. After that, I started hanging around more of my college buddies that enjoyed similar things to me. People who I could have deep, meaningful conversations with, without worrying about being judged.

This made be incredibly happy. Then, I started inviting people out to lunch more often and made spending time with those people a top priority.

### **Action:**

You know who your uplifting friends are and who aren’t. Start hanging out with the former much more often and telling them how much you appreciate them. If you find out that you don’t have any deep, meaningful relationships, then go out of your way to find some. Try apps such as:

-Meetup

-Bumble

-Tinder (yeah, I went there)

Fortunately, if you start doing more things you enjoy, you will also naturally start meeting other like-minded people who enjoy those things too!

## 4. Practicing gratitude

This last one is the thread that ties everything together. Often times, a simple shift in your mindset is all it takes to turn a shitty day into a good one.

[Mindfulness](http://www.themonklife.net/how-to-meditate-daily/) is something I’ve recently begun practicing every single day. Gratitude and mindfulness tend to go hand-in-hand, so needless to say it’s worked out amazingly.

Gratitude can be as simple as waking up and thoroughly enjoying the deliciousness of a warm cup of coffee in the morning.

Or taking a few extra moments to appreciate the feel of the wind against your face on a breezy fall afternoon.

Gratitude has the power to turn the worst of days into one that’s infinitely more enjoyable.

### **Action:**

What’s one thing that you could be grateful for today, and then the next several days? Try not to use the same thing or person every time. Instead, look for joy in the simplest of things, the stuff that people in third world or underdeveloped countries wished they had.

By focusing on those four principals, I was able to gradually start feeling a good bit happier. It didn’t happen overnight, but within a few weeks, I noticed some significant changes. You can do the same by focusing on engineering your happiness just one day at a time.

Brainstorm a bunch of things that you could add into your days. Aggressively look for activities that you can dismiss. Spend more time with uplifting people. And lastly, practice gratitude in any way that you can.

I bet if I asked [Adam Bornstein](https://www.bornfitness.com/), he finds happiness in whipping up some delicious [protein ice cream](https://www.bornfitness.com/protein-ice-cream/), or spending quality time with his wife and the intern (that’s what he calls his baby boy).

I guarantee you that [Noah Kagan](http://okdork.com/) would be out eating tacos, or hanging with his buds from [Sumo](https://sumo.com/).

Nils and Jonas Salzgeber might be kicking ass in the gym, [reading more books](http://www.njlifehacks.com/read-more/), or putting [stoicism into practice](http://www.njlifehacks.com/what-is-stoicism-overview-definition-10-stoic-principles/).

Pat Flynn finds happiness in watching [Back to the Future](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/back-to-the-future-again-my-short-film-to-open-my-nmx-keynote/) with his kids and [growing his online business](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/about/).

These are real people who find true happiness doing things they love. And it’s 100% possible for the rest of us.

Now, what kind of monster would I be if I didn’t include a hefty list of things for you to start working with? Here you go, friends. This is by no means an all-encompassing list, but it is a great place to begin your journey.

## Things you might enjoy doing:

* Going to the movies

* Eating at your favorite restaurant (or a new restaurant you’ve always wanted to try)

* Go swimming

* Waking up early and making a delicious breakfast

* Become a tourist in your own town or somewhere else: visit national monuments or parks, historic landmarks, interesting things out-of-towners always flock to

* Playing pick-up or casual sports: basketball, whiffle ball, kickball, street hockey, frisbee golf, actual golf, racquetball, to name a few.

* Joining a sports league: softball, kickball, dodgeball, bowling, and others.

* Signing up for sports lessons: tennis, golf, karate or MMA

* Doing something outdoors: hiking, biking, kayaking, going for a walk or jog, plan a picnic

* Playing board games

* Playing video games

* Watching sports

* Learning how to play an instrument, or reigniting a past love for one: guitar, piano, saxophone, trumpet, violin, your voice

* Pick up a new hobby or one you’ve previously enjoyed: painting, writing, creating things, or literally almost anything listed above

## Things you may want to consider cutting:

Use the “hell yes!” or “hell NO” technique to eliminate:

* Non-urgent chores: laundry, going to the bank, taxes, mowing the lawn, doing the dishes (many of these and others you can put off until later, or you can delegate to someone else)

* Your day-job: as I mentioned earlier, this one may take some time and planning, but if you’re unhappy you should be actively working on a way out.

* Unnecessary meetings

* Any kind of appointments you aren’t excited about or don’t desperately need

* Problematic or “not worth the hassle” clients

* Hang outs with people you don’t necessarily care for: happy hours, get-togethers, company picnics

## Spending more time with uplifting people:

* Schedule play dates with your friends (maybe don’t phrase it like that to them, though): play catch over lunch or in the evening, plan a homerun derby, have a meaningful conversation with a close friend over coffee or tea.

* Get out of toxic relationships: applies to both sexual and non-sexual relationships

* Book a weekend getaway with your close friends

* Plan a trip or evening out with some of your favorite family members or friends

* Buy a ticket to a seminar or workshop focused on an enjoyable hobby of yours and meet other like-minded people

## Practicing gratitude:

Noticing and deeply appreciating:

* A warm cup of coffee or tea in the morning

* The comforting sounds of nature or the city outside your home

* The feeling of warm water on when washing your hands

* The feeling of a hot shower and the water running down your neck, across your shoulders

* The feeling of relief and intense happiness that you get after a freezing cold shower (thanks, [Tim Ferriss](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/23/tim-ferriss-5-step-morning-routine.html))

* A meaningful conversation with a close friend or family member

* The warmth of a hug

* The beauty of a first kiss, or ten thousandth

* A warm meal in the evening

* The feeling of freshly brushed teeth

# How to Stay on Track for Your Goals This Year

## Have you ever noticed how creative your brain can get when it wants to procrastinate on your most important goals?

* ‘I’ve been so good at keeping my diet this week, I deserve to order this pizza.’

* ‘I’ve been meditating for 10 days straight, I deserve to skip a day.’

* ‘I’ve been rising early every day this week, I deserve to sleep in today.’

* ‘I went running earlier today, so I deserve to have a few beers.’

* ‘This day has been so stressful, I deserve a glass of wine’.

This tendency to avoid discomfort, seek pleasure and constantly gravitate toward the path of least resistance seems to be part of human nature.

The problem, of course, is that if we let these thoughts guide our behavior too much, it will be impossible to reach our long-term goals.

### Moral Licensing

In social psychology and marketing, this way of using past good behavior to mitigate bad behavior in the moment is well documented and referred to as ‘moral licensing’. Researcher Anna Merritt and her colleagues explain that:
> *“Past good deeds can liberate individuals to engage in behaviors that are immoral, unethical, or otherwise problematic, behaviors that they would otherwise avoid for fear of feeling or appearing immoral*.”* (1)*

Journalist Michael Rosenwald described this tendency in terms of everyday life in an article in the Washington Post like this:
> *“We drink Diet Coke — with Quarter Pounders and fries at McDonald’s. We go to the gym — and ride the elevator to the second floor. We install tankless water heaters — then take longer showers. We drive SUVs to see Al Gore’s speeches on global warming.” (2)*

It’s like one step forward ‘makes it okay’ to take one (or even two) steps back. Not a very helpful way of thinking if we want to make consistent progress towards our goals.

### So, what can we do about it?

Well, the first step is to become aware of this tendency in yourself. Just knowing that there is a well-documented mental glitch known as ‘moral licensing’ is a great place to start because it helps you question your own way of thinking. From now on I encourage you to be on the lookout for and stay very skeptical of your own rationalizations.

Remember that [you are not your thoughts](http://www.selfication.com/you-are-not-your-thoughts/) and that your thoughts not necessarily are right or even looking out for your best interests in the long-term. Get into the habit of asking yourself: ‘Is this thought really true, or is it just my brain seeking the path of least resistance’?

You might also want to create specific ‘[implementation intentions](http://www.selfication.com/achieve-your-goals/)’ for your particular habits and recurring moral licensing thoughts. For example:

* IF my brain tries talk to me into staying in bed when the alarm goes off, THEN I will get up and stay up for 10 minutes before deciding whether or not to sleep in.

* IF my brain tries to convince me to skip my daily run, THEN I will put on my shoes and go outside before deciding.

* IF my brain tells me I deserve a glass of wine after a stressful day, THEN I will meditate for 10 minutes first.

Usually, pre-committing to a small action to take every time you catch your brain with a thought that seems like moral licensing can be very helpful because:

* It directs you to a healthier and more productive behavior by default.

* It gives the urge some extra time to blow over before you start acting on it.

* It helps you [get started on the habit](http://www.selfication.com/how-not-to-procrastinate/), which is usually the hardest part.

Finally, as I’ve written about before in ‘[The 2016 Goal Setting Workbook](http://www.selfication.com/2016-goal-setting-workbook/)’, I strongly encourage you to set aside an hour or two every week to review the past seven days and [plan the week ahead](http://www.selfication.com/weekly-planning/). The only way to effectively deal with moral licensing is to reflect on your rationalizations and continuously tweak your approach in dealing with them.

# Goal-Oriented Communication

## Goal-Oriented Communication

### “effective communication is what binds together all aspects of a successful business”

Gone are the days when a specific team would sit together in a room 6-8 hours a day, 5 days a week coming up with a new product or solving a specific problem. The definition of a team has changed quite radically since the advent of fast Internet and Facetime. Nowadays, members of one single team might be scattered all over the globe working in completely different environments. So how are these new teams able to produce so effectively and deliver in such tight deadlines if they might not even be in the same time zone? This question also applies to CEOs, CFOs and many other professionals who need to rely on good information gathered from various sources to make important decisions.

The answer is communication. Quick, clear and not always concise.

In my experience, effective communication is what binds all aspects of a successful business together as it reflects good organisation, allows for a more fluid workflow, improves team cohesion and fast tracks problem-solving. But there are many ways of communicating one idea. In today’s ever more demanding and fast-paced professional world it is very important that ideas get transmitted clearly and quickly but that the value isn't lost in the process. That is what Goal-Oriented Communication is all about.

In any business, independent of its size, the perception that it is run in a well-organised manner and having clear goals are motivational factors to employees, even if not obvious ones. When employees have a clear image of what their role is in the bigger scheme of things they are more likely to put in that extra effort as they identify themselves more strongly with the business and its goals. Also, having confidence that operations are well run and structured gives employees more peace of mind in executing the important and productive work they are capable of. Such paradigms are set or changed by the company’s culture and its approach to communication with its employees.

So having employees behind the business’ goals will be likely to improve efficiency but workflow can be tricky to manage if all that efficiency is not being well managed. A poorly managed project, for example, can lead to friction amongst team members. That combined with a lack of structure usually spells trouble.

With that in mind, the manager needs to make sure he fully understands the challenge ahead so that he can come up with a well-structured plan of action that will encourage communication and collaboration between all involved. That encouragement usually happens through results. When the person in charge is quick to respond to small pertinent questions and issues, thus improving workflow, they are actively leading the rest of the group to approach issues in the same way.

Part of a good plan of action is ensuring that it is communicated very clearly to all involved and that all changes are informed to all relevant parties as soon as possible. The same can be said about any disruptions coming from down the pipeline. Supervisors and managers also need to encourage their employees to report such disruptions as soon as they become aware of them in a non-reprehending way as it is more important identifying and correcting a problem as early as possible rather than promptly identifying the alleged responsible for it.

But such a fast approach to communication can have its traps. When rushing through e-mails, phone calls and meetings one can start either assuming too much or not giving out enough information in their eagerness for achieving ever-faster results.

People can be very different from one another in how they assimilate information. Some people are more visually oriented, some more verbal, others are both and in a team you are bound to find a good mixture of these aspects. It is then very important that when addressing a team the message is not only clear and obvious to the person delivering it but contains enough information so that anybody in the target audience is able to comprehend it. In other words, concise is good but only to a certain extent. When a message is so short it creates room for many interpretations or none at all, then its efficacy drops drastically. It defeats its purpose and becomes demotivating or even frustrating. On the other hand, if the target audience feels included and is able to move forward because of that piece of information, then a reasonable deadline or task will seem and (quite importantly) feel easily achievable.

It seems then, that having a defined and effective goal-oriented communication culture in a business will help managers and leaders to achieve better results in less time. It is also likely to improve job satisfaction to all involved as feeling productive generally means a happier and even more productive team member.

# This is How to Get Better at What You Do, Every Single Day

## This is How to Get Better at What You Do, Every Single Day

I talk a lot about the importance of [starting small ](http://www.selfication.com/good-habits/)when you’re just getting started with a new habit.

And this is indeed an important and very powerful strategy for establishing a new behavior.

Starting small allows you to [get out of your head](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-overcome-perfection/) and start building the momentum necessary to [make the habit stick](http://www.selfication.com/stick-to-your-goals/).

But once your new behavior is a reliable part of your daily routine, it’s equally important to increase your efforts to get better at what you do.

### The Process of Supercompensation

In sports science theory, there is a fundamental principle of athletic training known as “supercompensation” (how’s that for a badass word?).

This concept refers to “the post-training period during which the trained function/parameter has a higher performance capacity than it did prior to the training period”. (1)

The idea is that since the human body is an adjustable organism, it will not only recover from the exercise. It will also adapt to the new strain placed on it and get a little bit stronger than it was before:

![](0*Bnjj9-o-BS13Gjya.png)

But the thing is, supercompensation** will only occur if you increase your efforts to a level that is higher than your body is already used to**.

And this is, unfortunately, where a lot of people get it wrong. According to sports scientist, the most common mistake regular exercisers make is doing the same workout over and over again.

When you do that, there’s no new level of strain for your body to adapt to and because of that, no supercompensation will occur:

![](0*tayg44V91Mgoinqw.png)

Albert Einstein once said that “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.” (2)

So, if you want your fitness level to improve, you can’t settle for running the same trail at the same intensity week in and week out. That would be NUTS. Hey, it was Einstein who said it (2). Not me.

For supercompensation to occur, you need to consistently push yourself to run a little bit faster or longer than what you’re already used to.

### How to Get Better at What You Do, Every Single Day

And the concept of supercompensation isn’t just helpful for fitness. In fact, it’s a very useful concept for any positive change you’re trying to create:

* Want to be more mindful? Add one minute to your meditation habit every month.

* Want to sleep better? Make one small improvement to your bedroom every week.

* Want to clean up your diet? Remove one type of unhealthy food from your diet every week.

* Want to become a prolific writer? Add 100 words to your daily writing goal every month.

You get the idea. Once your habit is up and running, don’t settle for putting in the same amount of effort every day. If you do, your growth will quickly plateau.

Instead, always look for ways to raise the bar just a little bit and push yourself to get better at what you do.

If you can do that, your consistent, [tiny improvements will lead to massive results over time](http://www.selfication.com/consistency/).

Let’s get our supercompensation on! Where will you get started?

# How to take down a mountain (of debt)

## 

### The best way to accomplish any goal is first to fully commit to it. Then develop your plan of attack.

Getting out of debt is no different.

Sounds simple, I know. But this is where most people get tripped up.

As for the commitment part, what I can tell you is that your reason for wanting to become debt-free should be extremely compelling to you. It needs to be something that strikes a chord in your heart, speaks to your values and to what you want for your future.

Visualize your future state, living free of the burden of debt and all that this represents for you. Take your time with it. Really see it. Memorize it. Hold onto it tightly.

You’ll be glad you did, because you’ll need it standing right there with you, in the face of temptation, when sacrificing and working your way out of debt starts to get super-old and your willpower wanes.

Now, once you’ve got the commitment part down, the plan part is much easier. You know that you are absolutely *going* to make this happen, no matter what it takes. And you are ready to move mountains.

## Stop the bleeding.

Doesn’t it make sense to plug up the hole in the bottom of the boat if you’re trying desperately to bail water out to keep it from sinking?

I think so.

But, I’m not here to rail on the evils of credit cards. I actually *do* think that responsible credit card use is possible. Some people never get into trouble with them at all.

However, when you’re in debt, particularly in credit card debt, I think a serious evaluation of the spending habits and the behaviors that got us into trouble in the first place is necessary.

I know that I’ve had trouble with credit cards in the past. So, when I cleared my $25k in credit card debt, I did some serious thinking about whether or not to bring credit cards back into my life. But after having lived a completely cash and carry lifestyle for 3 years, I’d successfully rewired my spending habits and my relationship with money in general. Now, although I do have 2 credit cards, they play a very small role in my day-to-day financial life.

You need to figure this out for yourself. Define what a healthy relationship with money looks like for you. Establish the habits that will keep you in line with this. And stick to them.

## Embrace the “B” word.

Setting up, maintaining, and sticking to a budget is essential to any get-out-of-debt plan.

If you’re going somewhere new with no roadmap (or [Waze app](https://www.waze.com/)) to get you there, chances are you’ll get stuck in traffic, end up lost, maybe arguing with your passengers, and probably turning the car around and going home.

Boo!

Don’t fight it. Just find a way to make budgeting work for you.

## List out all of your monthly expenses.

*I mean everything.*

It should be easy enough to get your fixed expenses down, but for anything that varies from month-to-month, you may not be sure of what you’re currently spending on average. You will need to track your spending for a month or so to get an idea of what your baseline is.

You can do your budget on paper, you can build a spreadsheet, or you can use one of the multitude of online tools that are available. Personally, I’ve used [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) and [YNAB (You Need a Budget)](http://www.youneedabudget.com/) in the past, but have been using [Dave Ramsey’s Every Dollar](http://everydollar.com) tool for the past 6 months.

Mint is very convenient because your spending is directly uploaded from your bank account. By comparison, previous versions of YNAB forced the user to manually input each and every transaction (which I *loved* because it requires full engagement with the numbers), but they’ve recently introduced the ability to sync with your bank account and import transactions automatically. You’ll still need to categorize your spending manually. This is essentially the way the Every Dollar tool works (all transactions are synced with the paid version, but manual categorization of spending is needed), but a big distinction between Every Dollar and most other budgeting tools is in the way they handle credit card spending. As you might imagine, a Dave Ramsey product is not going to be super-friendly in this area — something to consider if you’re going to continue using credit cards.

Both YNAB and Every Dollar work on a [“zero-based” principle](http://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/post/a-zero-based-budget-boring-effective). This means that every single dollar you earn has a “job” assigned to it before it is spent. Everything is accounted for. This is my preferred budgeting method.

Managing a budget takes commitment and success with it will require consistency. Ideally you should draw your budget up at the beginning of the month and revisit it at least weekly, making adjustments where needed. Don’t just “set it and forget it”. Stay engaged. This is how you will win.

## Find “hidden money” in the cracks and crevices.

If you’re anything like me, once you start shining a light on your spending, you’ll start to notice that there are expenses you can cut right off the bat. I was a sucker for monthly subscriptions — Spotify, Audible, I could go on. When I started thinking about the last time I actually used those services though, I realized that they needed to go. The little things add up.

Get in there. Scrutinize *everything* you’re currently spending money on. Look closely at bills and invoices — are you being charged fees for add-ons and silly stuff you don’t need? See how many expenses you can reduce or eliminate. I found that I was able to slash my monthly spending by close to 20%.

I’m not going to tell you to cut your cable or to stop those daily Starbucks runs. I think it’s all about spending on what matters in your world and slashing all other spending with a vengeance. Personally, I’m a craft beer freak. I spend money on beer. I live in walking distance of some of the country’s best breweries and tasting rooms. It’s my jam. And I own it. *But*, I don’t spend money on cable tv, makeup, or manicures!

When you’re evaluating whether to keep or drop an expense, it just comes down to this:

*How badly do you want to be debt-free?*

## Bring in extra income.

The impact you can have by also focusing on the income side of the equation is far greater than what you can accomplish by cutting spending alone.

There is a limit to how much you can cut back on your expenses. For instance, if you’re currently spending about $3,500 monthly, the maximum you could cut back is $3,500. (And that would be if you moved back into your mom’s house, ate her cooking and used her electricity without contributing at all to the household, never went anywhere, lost all your friends…you get the picture. No fun.).

If you want to seriously supercharge your debt crushing efforts you’ll need to focus on increasing your income. Ask for a raise at work, change jobs, consider getting a second job or [starting a side business.](http://traceyminutolo.com/want-side-hustle-dont-know-anyone-pay/) Your earning potential is only limited by your imagination, your work ethic, and your commitment to making things happen.

## List your debts smallest to largest in amount, regardless of interest rate.

For the math nerds out there, this is going to seem counterintuitive.

“Doesn’t it make sense to pay off the higher interest loans first?”

Yes, from a purely mathematical standpoint, it does. The problem is that the reasons we’ve gotten ourselves into debt were not purely mathematical. The behaviors that got us into trouble weren’t so rational. We all know that the more we spend above our means, the deeper into debt we go.

Yet, we’ve done it time and time again.

In my mind, the solution to debt needs to take into consideration our emotions and behaviors around money. It should provide us with a means to retrain ourselves and reframe our relationship with money in a way that leverages in a positive way, the powerful emotions that money elicits from us.

## Blast away at the smallest debt first.

Go full force, hitting that smallest debt with as much force as you can muster up and pay minimums on all the rest. When that smallest debt is gone, apply that monthly payment to the next smallest and so forth.

You’ll do this until you finally hit the largest debt.

![](0*9vYu8qxLuH682CBF.)

## The magic of the “debt snowball” method.

When you start blasting away at those small debts, picking them off one by one, a crazy thing happens. You begin to build momentum. The small wins begin stacking and the intensity that you feel toward destroying your debt grows with each one you achieve. You begin to feel like becoming debt-free is a real possibility. The end becomes visible. You become unstoppable. This feeling is worth its weight in gold.

The biggest debt starts to feel less formidable and you tackle it with everything you’ve got. Before you know it…you’re done!

And usually in the time that most people are able to work their way through the “debt snowball”, with intensity on their side, the interest that might have been saved by tackling the highest interest debts first turns out to be fairly minimal.

However you decide to pay down your debt, just **commit to it** with 100% of your being. *Feel* the restrictions that debt puts on your life, how it limits your options, keeps you in jobs that suck your soul dry, and robs you of your future.

If you’re truly committed to taking action and can stay connected with the reasons you want to break free of debt, you will get there.

## Don’t underestimate the power of your surroundings

The journey to debt-freedom is not easy, but it doesn’t have to be lonely. If you are not in a situation where you’re working with a spouse, I highly encourage you to find an accountability partner and/or to surround yourself with others who are working towards the same goal for themselves.

Create the environment you need to succeed.

It is better to set this up from the start. You *will* need it.

Support, while best if you can get it locally, doesn’t have to be right in your own backyard. There are countless groups out there that provide ideas, tips, support, encouragement, and accountability. [Dave Ramsey’s Baby Steppers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DaveRamseyBabySteppers/) group on Facebook is just one example.

Inspiration and motivation to keep moving forward can also come very conveniently through podcasts, books, and other resources, if you keep them handy! See below for some of my favorites*.

**I personally listen to the [Dave Ramsey Show](http://www.daveramsey.com/show/home/?snid=show) daily for a shot of motivation. Love him or hate him, you can’t deny that his methods work.*

# A Practical Guide to More Hygge for More Happiness in Your Life

## A Practical Guide to More Hygge for More Happiness in Your Life

### The Danish have figured out happiness

Denmark often ranks as the happiest country in the world, earning the top spot on the [World Happiness Report](http://worldhappiness.report/) in three of the past five years (and finishing number two and three in the other years).

This can partially be explained by the fact that the Danes receive free health care and university education, five weeks of paid vacation each year, and substantial unemployment benefits, and they routinely leave the office by 4 or 5 p.m.

Denmark does a fantastic job of reducing many of life’s stresses for its inhabitants. But that doesn’t necessarily separate Denmark from other Nordic countries, such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland, the residents of which all enjoy a similar quality of life.

The secret ingredient for the Danes’ happiness is their obsession with “hygge.”

Hygge (pronounced HOO-gah) roughly translates to a sense of coziness, togetherness, and well-being. It is warmth, comfort, slowness, intimacy, rusticity, and simplicity. The Danes spend their days and nights pursuing it.

Contrast that with the United States — down at number 14 in the World Happiness rankings — where we spend many of our days feeling busy, rushed, and stressed. We would be well served to take a page from the Danes’ book — slow it down, and take time to really enjoy life.

Whether it’s curling up with a blanket and a good book, making a fire, organizing a potluck dinner with close friends, or savoring a hot cup of coffee, we can all benefit from a little more hygge in our lives.

Here’s a guide to making hygge a central part of your daily life. Much of this wisdom comes from the highly recommended bestseller [*The Little Book of Hygge](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Hygge-Danish-Secrets/dp/0062658808) *by Meik Wiking, CEO of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen.

![](1*VKWNPROtxqh8F67MqAqsug.png)

### **Get Together (With Just a Few Close Friends)**

[Social connection is the best predictor of our overall happiness.](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-you-should-have-friends-1f11808ea5b4#.843kp9e1i) Togetherness is a central tenet of hygge and the foundation upon which many other hygge principles and activities are based. But hygge socializing isn’t about big, lavish parties. Rather, it is being in the company of a few close friends in an environment of trust, comfort, and security. According to Wiking, nearly 60 percent of Danes believe that the ideal number of people to experience hygge with is three to four. (Only 1 percent of Danes believe hygge is best achieved with 10 or more people.) Getting together with a small circle of close friends or loved ones is a hallmark of hygge.

Build this into your routine with a standing happy hour every Friday to celebrate the end of the workweek, a Sunday brunch with friends at your local bakery, a rotating dinner club that meets at a different house each month, or a book club that regularly gathers over tea and coffee. You could make a plan to watch a TV show with friends each week on the day and time it actually airs, or build your outings around restaurant theme nights (e.g., Pizza and Wine Wednesdays). The point is to make it a recurring commitment with close friends and to minimize the hassle of coordinating everyone’s schedule on a weekly basis.

### **Enjoy Good Food and Drink**

A hygge food experience is comfortable and warm. It is casual, rustic, and slow. This experience can be enjoyed at home or at your favorite cafe, coffeehouse, or pub (or any other establishment where the atmosphere is cozy and the music isn’t too loud for conversation).

Hygge food is a hearty stew, fresh-baked bread, a warm grilled cheese with soup, or a shared bowl of popcorn. The Danes also love their sweets, especially baking and eating cakes, cookies, and pastries. Anything home-cooked is much more hygge than something store-bought.

Hygge drinks are best served warm. Tea, hot chocolate, and mulled wine all have a high hygge factor. Especially on a cold winter night. But the Danes’ favorite hygge drink is hot coffee. According to *The Little Book of Hygge*, the Danes are the fourth-biggest coffee drinkers in the world and take in 33 percent more coffee per capita than Americans.

Slowly sipping alcohol is also associated with hygge. This could be drinking a glass of red wine while a storm rages outside or enjoying a glass of whiskey or Irish coffee around the campfire. Meeting up with friends at a comfortable lounge or speakeasy gets the hygge going as well. Go for the vibe found at the [Library Bar](https://www.worldsbestbars.com/bar/copenhagen/city-center/the-library-bar) in Copenhagen.

### **Disconnect and Savor the Moment**

You cannot achieve hygge while checking your phone or email. Hygge is all about disconnecting and enjoying the present moment. It is shared experiences right here and now, taking it all in without imagining being somewhere else. Follow the Danes’ lead by leaving work on time and going home to eat and play together with your family. Turn off your email and social media on the weekend (and definitely when you’re on vacation). Hygge life is simple and slow. Go offline to turn the hygge on.

![[Jovi Waqa](https://unsplash.com/@joviwaqa) (Unsplash)](1*Msyq35_5kwC-eZKeECyheg.jpeg)*[Jovi Waqa](https://unsplash.com/@joviwaqa) (Unsplash)*

### **Turn the Lights Down Low**

A hygge atmosphere is dimmed and low, not light and bright. The optimal hygge lighting is achieved by making a fire, turning on low-temperature lamps, or lighting a few candles. In fact, Wiking notes that nearly 75 percent of Danes light candles at least once per week, and 28 percent do so every day—often lighting more than five candles at a time. Hygge light is the first hour of sunrise or the last hour of sunset. Go outside for that magical experience, or try to recreate that level of lighting indoors. In general, you’re aiming for the light of flames, not fluorescents.

### **Dress Comfortably**

When choosing your outfit, keep it comfortable and casual. Layers are important so you’re never cold (remember, hygge is all about warmth). Dial up the hygge with a warm sweater, wool socks, and scarf. Feel free to bring out your own personal style, but keep it classy and cozy. And always have a warm blanket nearby.

### **Make Your Home a Hygge Hot Spot**

Seventy-one percent of Danes report experiencing the most hygge at home, according to Wiking. Make your home a hygge hot spot with a library of books, a fireplace, and lit candles. Wiking says that every house needs a “hyggekrog,” essentially a nook where you can curl up with a good book and a warm drink. Accessorize the space with a blanket and plenty of cushions.

The Danes also adorn their homes with rustic and vintage items, such as wooden tables and chairs, old lamps, or a worn-in leather chair. Anything handcrafted is much more hygge than a mass-produced item. Dress up your sitting areas with sheepskin or other animal skins. And, of course, make sure your favorite teapot and coffee mug are nearby. Overall, you want your home to feel warm and safe, not sleek and sterile.

We can follow the Danes’ lead by prioritizing simplicity, modesty, and functionality when decorating our homes. Hygge could be considered a form of cozy minimalism—every item should serve a purpose to increase feelings of warmth, comfort, and security for you and your guests.

### **Get Out in Nature**

Although home is often where the hygge is, it is abundant outside as well. Hygge is natural, simple, and rustic, just like the great outdoors. Get close to nature and you will experience hygge.

It could be a ski trip with friends, a long hike in the woods, a camping trip, or even just a walk around the block. Surround yourself with nature — on a boat, at a friend’s cabin, watching the sunset, or looking up at the stars — and let the hygge wash over you.

If you live in an urban environment, you can seek out a public park, river, or community garden to get closer to nature. Walk or bike to work if that’s an option, or go for a walk every day on your lunch break. Having a dog will also lead to plenty of walks outside (not to mention companionship).

### **Play Games and Get Creative**

Think about fun traditions that you can start with friends and family. There are plenty of easy and inexpensive ways to hygge if you’re willing to try new things. Maybe it’s family game night every Friday or inviting friends over once a month for movie and popcorn night. Or perhaps just a routine of relaxing on the couch and watching your favorite TV show at the end of a long week.

Instead of dining out, try having friends over for a potluck dinner where everyone brings a dish (find your signature dish [here](http://allrecipes.com/recipes/1536/everyday-cooking/on-the-go/potluck/)), or consider starting a cooking or wine-tasting club that meets regularly. Of course, you could also just have a close friend over for coffee or tea on a regular basis — if there’s a warm fire and soft music in the background, all the better.

### **Celebrate the Seasons**

It should come as no surprise that winter is the most hygge time of year, and Christmas is the most hygge holiday of all. Embrace it by being with close family and friends, watching holiday movies, putting up decorations, and indulging in good food and drink. Go ice skating or sledding, and warm up with hot chocolate by the fire. Sit by the window and watch the snow fall outside.

Although it’s easiest to visualize hygge in winter, you can certainly hygge year-round. When the weather is nice, visit your local farmers market and have a picnic in the park. Have friends over for a backyard summer barbecue, take the kids apple picking, or sit in the shade of a tree and read a good book. Go for a walk on the beach, take a dip in the saltwater, or enjoy a leisurely bike ride through town. Take what the season gives you and lean into it.

![](1*VKWNPROtxqh8F67MqAqsug.png)

Boiling it all down, hygge is about the simple pleasures in life. It is being surrounded by good food and good friends. It is taking it all in and enjoying the moment.

It is everyday happiness.

It is working wonders for the Danes, and I hope it works for you, too.

# The Weight of Unfinished Business

## 

If you made a list of all of your **unfinished business**, what would be on it?

I’m talking about all of the incompletes you’ve been carrying around; the projects that got halfway done and stalled; the little annoying fixes you never got around to; the great ideas that were never developed; the improvements that were never implemented; the conversations that you always meant to have.

All these bits of baggage weigh on us, taking up mental space, and requiring energy to keep them at bay.

Here’s a way to reclaim that bandwidth.

**Make The List**

Get everything out of your head. Brainstorm rules. No judgment. Every item belongs. Repetition is okay. It’s fine to repeat yourself. When you think you’ve finished, wait 5 minutes because there’s likely to be another burst of insights after the initial one.

**Start Clean**

The point of this exercise is not to feel bad about yourself. It’s to clear the air, bring the dark into the light. Take a deep breath and forgive yourself, knowing that your intention is good. You are doing this process to acknowledge the past and move into the present.

**Review The List Dispassionately**

Look for themes. On my list there are a lot of home maintenance items. They never seem to rise to the top of the priority list until they are an emergency. What do you see repeated?

Look for the nice-but-I’m-never-going-to-do this ones. Be honest with yourself. I promise you will feel relief when you cross this off your to-do list. Examples might be mending those slacks or finishing that knitting project. See any of those taking up space in your garage or spare room?

Sometimes a ritual helps. You can cut the “never gonna happens” from the list and burn them saying a fond farewell. Or create a journal page honoring the idea and that time in your life when it was important. Do what you need to do to consider it finished, and let it go.

I’ve [mentioned before](http://lizsumner.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=51eb4bb2615286af2d4a0722a&id=1f0496c93b&e=be2aba1daa) the notion of parallel universes, and fantasizing that in that other world I finished that novel or took that idea to market. It helps me.

**Missed Opportunities**

You may have some items on the list that cannot be completed, for example, heal a relationship with someone who is no longer living. Even in that case it’s possible to find some closure, perhaps through a letter, or a journal entry, or with the help of a therapist.

And of course forgiveness works here as well, of yourself and others. The point is to let it go and move on.

**What’s The Deal?**

On my list there are a number of items that say “deal with X.” Productivity gurus will tell you that action items must have a verb to pull you toward what needs to be done. “Deal with” is a lame version of that. I’m using it to mean decide, budget for, find a contractor, schedule– dozens of different activities.

The “deal with” items need to be examined, broken down into steps. The critical parts need to be prioritized. The rest filed away– not forgotten but not taking up top of mind space.

**Maybe Someday**

One of my favorite aspects of [David Allen’s *Getting Things Done](http://lizsumner.us1.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=51eb4bb2615286af2d4a0722a&id=acfe598eae&e=be2aba1daa)* system is the notion of the Maybe Someday file. These are items that are valuable enough to be saved but not at the top level of your consciousness. They will come up in your GTD review process and may at that time advance in priority, but you don’t need to spend energy worrying about them. It’s not their time.

**A Fresh Look**

Just maybe there’s an item on your Unfinished Business list that just keeps calling to you. You try and hide it away but it won’t stay hidden. Maybe you always wanted to finish your degree but think it’s too late. Listen to your heart.

If there is a lifelong dream on your list **you can find a way** to make it come true. I still remember at my college graduation a fellow classmate getting her bachelor’s degree at the age of 96. It’s never too late.

**The Finish Line**

I get enormous satisfaction taking a fresh Sharpie and drawing a big black line through an item on my list. At the end of this exercise you should have a bunch of black lines through anything that is no longer important to you. You are done carrying it around.

You will also likely have some clarified tasks that deserve your attention, a few to be filed under Maybe Someday, some inspiration for your journal, and a lightness in your step due to the burden you have let go.

# You Should Burn Down Your Life From The Inside Out

## You Should Burn Down Your Life From The Inside Out

### Got a lighter?

A few nights ago I was sitting on a roof patio about 220 feet above a crowd of rambunctious, emphatic Chilean futbol fans. They were chanting spirited calls in celebration of the Chilean national team qualification to the World Cup. The shouting and exuberance caused many of my fellow [Exosphere](http://exosphe.re/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=post&utm_content=burn%20down&utm_campaign=medium_burn%20down) pals to lose sleep. It seemed as though they were celebrating the victory of a championship, but in reality, they were just celebrating their chance to participate in the tournament. I was impressed by their passion. Or, was I just impressed by their enthusiasm?

As I was sitting by myself, just looking up at the cloudy sky, searching for centers of fusion powered light, I was reminded how ancient sea farers used the stars to guide their travels. In our age of electronic abundance and GPS technology, it is easy to take something as obvious as the stars for granted. That blanket of dotted light was used to navigate to new worlds in search of opportunity and a chance for a better life.

Similar to the stars, personal passions can be used to navigate through life in attempt to spark more adventure, fulfillment, and enjoyment.

In attempt to define the word passion, it is difficult to give it a tangible meaning. Many would reduce it down to something like, “It is what moves you.” Maybe some would say, “Passion is what you feel strongly about.” I would agree but there is so much more! Passion is not just skin deep. It is not simple attraction or enjoyment. I can’t just say that I have passion for a certain baseball or basketball team. My enjoyment watching sports does not crutch my spirit when it feels like I have had my legs taken out from under me. My favorite teams are not the reason I get up when I get knocked down.

Whether you are aware of it or not, passion is what humans constantly seek. More importantly, people who display passion are whom others are subconsciously gravitating towards. People walking in line with their passion attract others like moths to a flame. Passion is warmth, it is comfort, it is certainty in a world full of unknown. It is confirmation, it is food, it is what fuels our advances forward. It is an enabler of hard work with no expectation of reciprocity. Passion is what heroes and mad men share.

A phrase that comes to mind is,”Wear your emotions on your sleeve.” In regards to passion, you have no choice but to wear it on your whole body. It is your light, and therefore it is a part of you, like your thoughts. Your passions are always going to be there.

The kicker is that passion alone is not enough. It is arguable that passion isn’t the most important variable in the equation. The “x” is you.

You have to provide the spark. Passion is the fuel to ignite a kindling to an inferno.

You know those seemingly crazy guys that quit their jobs, uproot their families, and empty bank accounts to pursue some idea that everyone thinks is stupid? I bet you can guess what he is passionate about. When you have passion for something like an idea, it is the first electron pulse as you wake up, it is what occupies your mind even when that pretty girl smiles at you from across the room, and it is the last bullet point on your list of things you are willing to give up. In other words, it is something in which you are willing to fight for until there is no battle left to win.

When talking to someone who knows their passion, and is committed to it, you can sense their fire and feel the heat radiating from them. To borrow from [Fake Grimlock](http://fakegrimlock.com/), “NOTHING STOP PERSON ON FIRE. NOT SLEEP. NOT SICK. NOT BROKE. NOT BULLET. NOT END OF EARTH. NOTHING.”

The above quote is so true. When you meet someone that really is on fire for an idea or cause, you marvel at it because it is so rare to see. It isn’t rare because its difficult, I think it is rare because so many people are not even aware of their passions or are not pursuing them even if they are aware.

During that night on the patio, as I was thinking about my passions, I tried to mentally list them. I really struggled to identify clear examples. I knew that I cared about a lot of different topics and ideas but I felt it wasn’t that simple. Luckily, I received some free advice.

With the help of one of my new friends, I began listing notes on what I felt passionate about. Then I started writing notes on how I envisioned my ideal life playing out. A few hours later I finished an article detailing my large goals over the [next 20 years](https://medium.com/who-i-am/f88cc50c484e). In the process, I found out what I was truly passionate about. If you want something to be included in your life 20 years from now, I think its safe to say you have a passion for it.

I feel that I knew the answer all along but I did not want to admit it to myself. I wanted to lie and say that I had passions about making money, becoming a famous personality, being the sole author of my story, or navigating through life with only my destination in mind. In the end, I am glad that my passions are deeper than that. I want to be a small piece of the machine that changes the world for the better. Now that I am aware of my passions, I can make small incremental steps to reposition my life so I can ensure I am working towards my goals every day.

Getting back to the Chilean futbol fans—they may think they have passion for their La Roja- but I urge you to look for something more. Find something that you can control and that you can invest your life into. It is getting colder everyday. This world needs more people that are on fire!

I think that Thoreau was referring to passion when he said, “Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them.” That quote breaks my heart because you can see it everywhere you look. Most people seem to afraid too sing their unique song. Burning for an idea or cause destroys that fear and enables you to sing louder than ever before.

I believe that humans need a battle to fight or an adventure to live. Recognizing your passions and fighting to advance them is a great way to satisfy this desire. A lot of the average people in the western world do not live for anything other than material goods and entertainment. You do not have to be one of them.

I encourage you to spend time thinking about what really makes you burn and what weighs heavily on your heart. Take small steps to reposition your life so you can become aligned with what really inspires you to get out of bed each morning. Recognize your passions, become the fire, and start living a more meaningful and fulfilling life.

Good things to come,

# How you can beat Procrastination forever.

## Medium just dropped the paywall from their Members content and moved to metered. That means you can look at some of the Members content Better Humans has been publishing before having to pay.

One of my favorite of the first [53 articles](https://betterhumans.coach.me/53-deep-dives-on-improving-productivity-health-happiness-a53e97921d68) we published is this [Science of Procrastination](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-use-psychology-to-solve-the-procrastination-puzzle-6e6a56cdd535) piece from Dr. Tim Pychyl.

The article highlight, which I’ve been repeating to a lot of our coaches, is about your future self.

You can think of procrastination as selling your future self short. It would be best for you to do the work right now and it’s going to be a lot harder on your future self. But you postpone the task anyway. That’s procrastination.

Tim summarized the science of this for us:
> When we process information about our present and future selves, the brain regions involved in processing information about our future self are the same as those used when we process information about a stranger.

We treat our future self the exact same way we would treat a stranger.

If you think that sort of science might hold the key for you to beat procrastination, then please head over to [Tim’s article and give it some claps](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-use-psychology-to-solve-the-procrastination-puzzle-6e6a56cdd535).

Over the last few weeks, a number of you have given us great feedback on how we can turn Better Humans into the most trusted personal development publication. I appreciate that.

As a quick update, we’ve started to put together an [advisory board](https://betterhumans.coach.me/join-the-better-humans-advisory-board-6ccb2839548f), we’ve updated our [style guide for our authors](https://medium.com/@tonystubblebine/draft-style-guide-for-personal-development-articles-6f641023347f), and shortly we have one more special announcement coming shortly.

We’re looking forward to publishing many more life changing articles for you.

# Letting Go

## Letting Go
> # If there is one skill to sharpen and hone like a blade, it’s letting go.

Humans are emotional sponges, our attachment to past transgression strengthened the more we revisit and absorb.

And though our attachment tendencies are part of the genetic equation, there is a loophole.

**Letting go can be learned.**

For this particular journey, letting go is crucial — of expectations, of the need for validation, of the pressure to stay connected at the cost of doing the work, and of relationships that do not align with your values.

This is a choice to make, a space to be filled and discarded, a space somewhere between what has to get done and what has you circling your work like a vulture.

Fill this space by shedding the excess that does not support your greater purpose.

Do this, and the gap between intention and action will shrink.

# 3 Steps To Wearing The Same Outfit Each Day (Without Smelling Like An Ogre)

## 3 Steps To Wearing The Same Outfit Each Day (Without Smelling Like An Ogre)

Wearing the same outfit every day is genius. Here’s how to pull it off.

It’s great for 2 reasons: [more willpower](http://niklasgoeke.com/increase-willpower/) to make better decisions and personal branding. Having a recognizable outfit and showing it to the world every day will make you an icon.

**Today I’ll teach you how to do it, by creating a minimal wardrobe.**

## Why a minimal wardrobe?

A [minimal wardrobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_wardrobe) has many benefits, including being [more productive](https://medium.com/better-humans/the-barack-obama-willpower-hack-1780c5f6e493#.hndhvnjd8), [less stressed](https://medium.com/better-humans/7-toxic-habits-you-can-let-go-of-before-9-a-m-a-tribute-to-marc-angel-hack-life-1d820b87df46#.6rddtrojt), saving a lot of money and creating your own unique style that people will recognize you for.

Don’t even get me started on time. [Women spend 136 days of their lives, just getting ready](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2578041/Women-spend-3276-hours-getting-ready.html). Men are slightly better, but only slightly.

I have witnessed a lot of these benefits myself in the past 2 years. Countless hours were saved, t-shirts worn and re-worn, while compliments were often received.

One of the biggest lessons I had learned during my 2 semesters at UMASS Dartmouth, living in a tiny 70 sqft, Harry Potter cupboard-under-the-stairs style dorm room, is that I do fine with way less clothes — and you will too.

The first thing I did upon returning was simplify my wardrobe, throwing out trousers I hadn’t worn in years, gifted shirts I never liked and items I liked, but which were simply worn out or torn.

3 out of 4. That’s 75%.

That’s how much had to go — a sacrifice for my new, minimal wardrobe.

I kept the red shoes though. I was sure they’d become a hit.

2 years later this minimalistic clothing style stays with me as strong as ever. It survived one internship at a big corporation (BMW), a bad relationship and my changing tastes, so I’m confident it’s here to stay.

![](1*o21pJyJ7P58IHfG_eWOKSw.jpeg)

The good thing about it:

**You don’t even have to clean out your wardrobe first, like I did.**

Bear with me.

[Owning fewer clothes](http://www.becomingminimalist.com/a-practical-guide-to-owning-fewer-clothes/) is a goal worth striving for, but if you’re just starting out you can try this to ease into letting go of your woven possessions later.

I will show you that you can [have a Steve Jobs thing going](http://niklasgoeke.com/focus-on-what-matters/#Environment_Change_2_8211_Second_order_decisions), without looking plain or smelling weird.

Ready? Let’s go!

## Step 1: Pick out your 3 favorite outfits

First, you need to go to your wardrobe, and pick your 3 favorite outfits. Here’s the kicker: You pick one for each of the following occasions:

1. Relaxing and sporty

1. Casual but classy

1. Fancy

**1. Relaxing and sporty:** This should be your go-to outfit for chilling on your couch at home, making your way to the gym and even driving over to a friend’s house on a Friday night to watch a movie in a relaxed setting. It should be comfortable, laid back and, in the winter, warm.

**My example:** In the summer I’ll just wear Nike shorts and a t-shirt, in the winter this means long sweatpants, a t-shirt, warm socks and a hoodie I bought at the campus store back in US. I usually wear my New Balance sneakers with this.

![](1*yKNxD56Mms-qXL6gK3JIJA.jpeg)

**2. Casual but classy:** Your second outfit should be classy enough to go out in public in style and for people to recognize you are “going somewhere”, meaning you’re about to go to work, meet someone who you dressed up for, or an event. If it’s enough to make people see you dressed up, but not so much they think you’re going to the opera (or singing at the opera, depending on your makeup), you’ve made a good choice.

**My example:** My go-to outfit is a pair of cloth trousers (no jeans), paired with a white and red t-shirt in the summer, or a cotton red sweater in the winter. I also have a black Hilfiger belt (I only have this one) and will usually wear my infamous red shoes with it.

You’ll see me wearing this again, and again, and again, and again.

![(10/14–12/14–5/15–9/15)](1*-8-ypaXaxfofdl0ytKGgEQ.jpeg)*(10/14–12/14–5/15–9/15)*

**Pro tip:** If you work at a job where coming in with the same clothes every day might get you fired, pick out 2 outfits for category 2.

**3. Fancy:** Here come the big guns. This should be your “all-in” outfit. Basically something you would wear if things got really formal. For women this will most likely be an evening gown, for men a tuxedo or suit.

**My example:** I have a suit for these occasions. Black pants, white dress shirt, black tie and a black jacket. I have a pair of black leather shoes to go with it, which are remnants from my high school graduation ball.

![](1*KhwvlIAhHPkrj-YYDgDPwQ.jpeg)

## Step 2: Store your 3 outfits OUTSIDE your wardrobe

Now here comes the magic. This is the big trick.

You take your 3 favorite outfits, arrange them neatly in little piles, and then…you take them out of the wardrobe!

Put them somewhere far away from it. The living-room. The kitchen. The bathroom. Your desk chair.

**Anything is fair game. Except for the wardrobe.**

![(the kitchen is a good start)](1*XG2-t_z8321Rcg2Ze1mDUQ.jpeg)*(the kitchen is a good start)*

Here’s why: The moment you open your closet, **you lose**. You start debating your choices, comparing outfits in your head and second-guessing your decisions.

With this trick you won’t pick your outfit from the wardrobe in the morning, but from a pre-selected choice of only 3 options.

This means you’re very likely to wear the same clothes several days in a row. I, for example, work at home, which means I’ll wear my relaxed outfit a lot more than the others.

**Pro tip:** Hang your outfit outside or on the window sill after wearing it, to let the fresh air clear out potential smells. Also do the smell test in the morning and wash your outfit as soon as it starts smelling or has gotten very sweaty.

The beauty of this system is that it gives you enough wiggle room to **maintain the style others perceive you in,** while simultaneously **creating an iconic style unique to you.**

For example: When I was working at BMW, I changed between 2 casual, but classy outfits during the week, and wore my fancy outfit only at important events or client meetings. I would sometimes cross-switch pants or sweaters to create some variation, but most people didn’t even notice the consistence in outfits when I didn’t do so.

What’s more: Every time I arrived wearing a red sweater and red shoes, people complimented me. **The red shoes became a running gag and wildly popular.** People kept asking me where to buy them (and whether I would get blue ones soon).

## Step 3: Pick your occasion in the morning

Now, when you stand in front of your 3 piles in the morning, the only question you have to answer is: **Relaxed, casual, or fancy?**

You know the answer before you even get there, because you have the agenda of the day in your head and picking clothes becomes a no brainer.

Again, if you need more than one outfit in one category, for work reasons, pick 2. For example if you’re a personal trainer you might want to have 2 fitness outfits for the gym.

## A minimal wardrobe in 3 steps

That’s all there is to it. You’ll have more time, more energy, less stress and the best part: you can start today. No need to downsize your entire wardrobe just now. As of tomorrow you could be free of the shackles of clothing decisions.

Here are the steps again:

**Step 1:** Pick one relaxed, one classy, but casual, and one fancy outfit from your wardrobe.

**Step 2:** Store them somewhere out of context, remove them from the wardrobe and give them their own place.

**Step 3:** Each morning decide by asking yourself: Relaxed, casual, or fancy?

**What could you do if you didn’t have to worry about what to wear in 2016?**

# How to Meditate & Be Mindful in 2016&#58; Advice From 8 Experts

## 

Meditators have been claiming many benefits of their practice for millennia and in recent years scientists have been finding strong evidence to back these claims.

Studies have shown that a regular meditation practice is an effective treatment for stress, worry, lack of focus, relationship problems, addictions and much more.

In surprisingly little time, it can lead to a quieter and more peaceful state of mind, sharper mental focus, increased creativity, better relationships and an overall greater sense of wellbeing.

Because of all these benefits, meditation is one of those habits I find myself recommending over and over again to clients and friends.

But how do you meditate an effective and sustainable way?

That’s what I reached out and asked the finest meditation and mindfulness experts on coach.me.

## What would be your number one advice for someone who wants to meditate and be mindful in 2016?

![](0*yBZGkNmb6nB9MxrV.jpeg)

“**First, get your motivation straight**. Read up on the benefits, and understand what meditation can do for you, how it can help you in your core values and goals in life. Then choose a technique. I recommend either concentrating on the movement of your breath, on repeating a mantra, or on the space between the eyebrows. Alternatively, you can use guided meditations from apps such as Insight Timer and Headspace. Start with as little as 5min every day. Don’t meditate longer than your motivation for it allows. Increase 1–2 every week, until you arrive at your ideal length. Do it everyday — have a “never zero” approach. Having a set time and place is useful in building the habit. Keep your expectations low, and do the practice for it’s on sake — like you do when taking a shower.”
 — [Giovanni Dienstmann](https://www.coach.me/giovanni?ref=P7G1v), [Live and Dare](http://liveanddare.com/)

![](0*eurTPyCPL3UL0_OT.jpeg)

“**Create serenity time for yourself by switching off all electronic devices** (phones, computers, TVs…) for 20 minutes every day.

**What’s Needed:**
Markers or pencil crayons
Coloring book (there are many unique all ages coloring books these days)
A comfortable location (e.g. living room floor, window seat…)

**The How:**
1. Befriend your breathing by taking even breaths, deeply from the belly, in and out through the nose, feeling it throughout your body after each color selection:

* Negative Thoughts: Greys & blacks

* Positive Thoughts: Reds & oranges

* Neutral Thoughts: Greens & blues

2. Acknowledge and name your thoughts, then let them go”
 — [Melanie Christian](https://www.coach.me/Melanie_FMS?ref=P7G1v), [Forward Muse Solutions](https://forwardmusesolutions.wordpress.com/)

![](0*uvnUksvex0MODRrT.jpeg)

“You have almost certainly heard of the benefits of meditation, it truly is a superpower for dealing with modern life. As a result there could be countless reasons as to why you should meditate. But what is yours? **It is all about a clear goal.** You need to be able to answer why, for how long and how you are going to start meditating. This will sustain motivation beyond the first week of January after which all your friends will be relapsing on their resolutions. TOTAL CLARITY over your goals will ensure your new 2016 meditation habit actually sticks.”
 — [Ben Whittle](https://www.coach.me/BenWhittle?ref=P7G1v), [Superhuman Willpower](http://superhumanwillpower.com/)

![](0*km6D6Xoa6BDVwmDm.jpg)

“**Making time for meditation and mindfulness has proven to be a key to success for me**. I recommend meditation in the morning because you can get it in before the usual interruptions of life. The morning practice also sets the tone for the day because it allows you to approach the day calmly and peacefully. Mindfulness can happen anywhere and anytime. One simple trick is using your smartphone alarm to schedule a mindfulness break in the morning and the evening. When the alarm goes off just take a few deep intentional breathes to reset your mood, energy and attitude.”
 — [Jeff Shannon](https://www.coach.me/JeffShannon?ref=P7G1v), [Ax & Yoke](http://www.axandyoke.com/)

![](0*63NsIZLWZPgC-oiD.jpeg)

“**Whenever you are attempting to start any new habit, making it small and easy so you can be consistent is the first goal**. This is definitely true for meditation. Even though, you may feel tempted to think, ‘I’ll start later when life slows down or when this project is finished because then I’ll be in the right mindset’… Don’t wait! The best time to start is now. Plus, by starting small you can get past those early objections and just do it. You’ll be surprised how even one minute will change your connection with yourself and things around you.”
 — [Nathan Sudds](https://www.coach.me/nathansudds?ref=P7G1v), [Change Fear](http://changefear.com/blog)

![](0*SzrXLqcYJ5y-j6qH.jpg)

“My number one advice for anyone seeking to learn how to meditate and quiet the mind in 2016 is to **keep it SIMPLE**.
Although there are many forms of meditation the good news is that it doesn’t require fancy equipment or a trip half way around the globe to sit in silence on a mountain top to get started. If you are alive, breathing and committed to starting with just 5 minutes a day I promise you this will become a healthy habit you can build on for years to come. The beauty of meditation is that it could be done anywhere morning, noon and sunset or whenever feeling tired or nervous.
You could be sitting in silence, brushing your teeth or in walking down a busy street the key is being fully present, mindful, breathing properly and breaking the bad habit of shallowing breathing. Once you decide to start utilizing these simple techniques get ready to accept the benefits of feeling healthy, stress-free and peaceful.”
 — [Herman Olivera](https://www.coach.me/Herman?ref=P7G1v), [HermanOlivera.com](http://hermanolivera.com/)

![](0*_zeo6f9bfkarBk1p.jpg)

“You don’t know what you’re supposed to do. So what can you do? Well, if you don’t know what you’re supposed to do, you watch. You simply watch what is going on. This is the beginning of meditation. In fact, you can’t do meditation. You become aware of being. **Give yourself this gift, some time to just sit and watch what happens**. Learn to know yourself and you will discover wonders.”
 — [Dennis Swennen](https://www.coach.me/dennis_swennen?ref=P7G1v), [DennisSwennen.com](http://www.dennisswennen.com/)

![](0*A_NtWrixyVT04fId.jpeg)

“My advice for someone who wants to get into meditation in 2016 is to **start slow**. Meditation is not hard if you go at a steady pace. The same thoughts that are telling you meditation is hard are the same ones that will be released during meditation. So to take it slow I suggest starting with just 5–10 minutes a day and when you find yourself wanting a longer practice (and you will know) then add more time in 5 minute intervals. And lastly to finish off I suggest doing the practice first thing in the morning. This starts the day on a super positive note.”

# What You Can Learn From Ryan Holiday’s Ego Is The Enemy

## What You Can Learn From Ryan Holiday’s Ego Is The Enemy

Today we will look at one of my new favorite books on psychology and self-help, **Ego is the Enemy by Ryan Holiday**. This blog post will cover the main lessons in the book and clearly display all its practical advice. So take out your notebook and let’s get to it!

*Ego is the Enemy* explores the negative aspects of the ego and its effects on several historical and contemporary figures. But what’s the *ego*? There are a lot of definitions around, but this is the one used by the author in the book:
> # “An unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition.” — Ryan Holiday

As you can see, the ego ALWAYS is something negative. We all have it and it is our responsibility to keep it in check.

The book is divided into three parts which characterize the three possible phases of our lives where the ego can spiral out of control and nudge us out of our path.

* **Aspire,** wanting to accomplish bigger and better goals.

* **Success,** achieving our goals and receiving public praise.

* **Failure,** falling from grace and dealing with internal resistance.

For each of these parts, Ryan Holiday extracts valuable lessons that we can apply when we find ourselves in these phases of our lives. He covers **how to think about goals, the right approach to relationships with others and ourselves, how to stay humble, how to deal with failure** and more.

## ASPIRE
> # “The ability to evaluate one’s own ability is the most important skill of all. Without it, improvement is impossible. And certainly ego makes it difficult every step of the way.” — Ryan Holiday

If you are reading this, it means that you want more. You aspire to achieve all these amazing things and destroy everything in your way. But do you know who is the biggest obstacle?** Yourself**. More specifically your ego. The climb towards success creates dangerous openings from where the ego can burst through. In the attempt to go forward, you unknowingly go backwards.

We start talking about our future achievements to make us feel important and productive but we forget to put in the work. We get in our heads and become impulsive and reactive instead of practicing patience and being present and practical. We want to be the one in charge and do everything instead of helping and trust others.

Therefore, it is imperative that we know how to avoid and identify them in ourselves and in others. Here are the main points made by the author about the ego and aspiration:

* **Too much talking, not enough work**. The ego wants to project the idea that we are busy doing important work without actually doing it. It feels like work but it’s just us feeding our ego.

* **Do it for the right reasons**. The ego is simple minded. It wants only the perks that come from being famous or rich without wanting to take the necessary steps to reach that goal. Having a goal bigger than us counteracts that.

* **Keep learning**. In every situation we can learn something. The ego loves to believe that we have everything figured out but it is not true. Seeking to learn and receiving feedback is a must to keep the ego in check.

* **Be practical, not passionate**. Being passionate can lead us to do stupid things. Be calm and calculate your next steps with a clear and objective mind.

* **Help others**. Just like learning, helping others keeps us humble. Having a mindset of abundance will allow you to strive and forge relationships without having to fight your ego.

* **Restrain yourself**. Don’t reply to the haters. They will want to suck you into their negativity and make you act like them. Don’t allow your ego to get offended. Endure the pain.

* **Live in the present**. With ambition comes doubt. We begin telling ourselves that we don’t have what it takes, that we will fail. But that’s the ego spitting its venom. Getting out of our head will help us remaining focused in the work and able to learn from its lessons.

* **Don’t get fancy**. Ego turns minor accomplishments into major events. This artificial inflation is simply a delusion. It turns you into a fraud. Stay humble through your work.

* **Work! **While aspiring, the most important thing you can do to fight your ego is to focus on creating value. Sit down and put in the hours. Invest in yourself by thinking long term.

## SUCCESS
> # “ Success is intoxicating, yet to sustain it requires sobriety.” — Ryan Holiday

As you can already guess, **success can be the greatest catalyst for the ego.**

Countless are the successful people who worked extremely hard to reach a position of power and influence to later destroy their lives because of their egoistic addiction. It is the reason for many failed businesses, relationships and careers.

Success is a double edged sword and we must put in place a mindset and tactics to help us wield this dangerous weapon. Remember: the ego only wants the short term pleasure associated with success. It’s greedy, selfish and short minded. Let’s see how to avoid this behavior.

* **Keep learning and improving**. With success comes the pressure to pretend we know more than we do. This prevents us from learning and gathering new information, eventually causing our own downfall.

* **Don’t tell yourself a story**. The path towards success is full of obstacles and failures. But once we get to the destination, the ego only wants to share with others all the victories making it sound like we had everything planned all along.

* **Remember what’s important. **In the aspiring phase of our lives, we start with a direction and purpose but during the climb it’s easy to get sidetracked and forget what’s important. Check yourself before you wreck yourself.

* **Trust and value others. **Success can breed entitlement, paranoia and distrust. Don’t fear depending on others. Detach yourself from your work and let others help you

* **Manage yourself first. **Know yourself, learn your inner workings and most important, learn your weaknesses and accept them. Learn how to manage yourself and you will succeed at managing others. Delegate.

* **Beware the disease of me**. Don’t fall in love with yourself and your success. The ego feeds off boasting and vanity. Stay focused on what got you where you are: work.

* **Remember how insignificant you are**. If we look at the night sky and see all the stars and thinking about our impact in this infinite plane of existence, it is hard to feel nothing but gratitude. Ego can’t live in that state of mind.

* **Stay sober.** Success can act like a drug. It makes people act differently and against their own principles.

## FAILURE
> # “The future bears down upon each one of us with all the hazards of the unknown” — Plutarch

So far we saw how much the ego influences your actions and hurts our progress. Unfortunately, failure happens to everyone, regardless of our ego. It’s an inevitable aspect of our lives, therefore we must know how to deal with it. Failure is already hard to deal with by itself but our ego will hyperbolize the situation, making it even harder to bounce back from it.

The following advice will make you understand how important it is to maintain your sobriety during turmoil, guaranteeing a safe and quick recovery to aspiration and success.

* **Keep the fire going**. The ego assumes defeat easily. In failure, quitting and becoming stale is an attractive option. Keep active. Keep learning and improving. Never give up.

* **Your work is enough**. Sometimes we work and work and seem to get nowhere. The ego likes to be acknowledged but bad news: life is not fair. Therefore we must internalize that doing the work is enough. No need for public recognition. It will eventually come by itself.

* **Draw the line.** In failure we tend to forget to act according to our principles. As a result, we might extend pass out internal limits and act impulsively. Fall back to your principles when things go wrong.

* **Follow your own standards**. Don’t hold yourself to other people’s expectation and standards. That mindset will not allow you to grow and improve. Create your own version of success and hold yourself against that.

* **Always love. **In defeat, sentiments of hatred and revenge can dominate your internal conversation. Don’t get sucked into it. It’s just not practical. Practice love towards others who don’t deserve it and specially with yourself. Do not indulge in gossip, it will only set you back even more. Focus on productive ways to move forwards.

## **The Bottom Line**

The lessons in this book are eternal and for everyone. The ego is part of us and we have to manage it. Life is full of these ups and downs and our ego is always sitting in the dark, waiting to strike.

While reading the book and writing this review, I noticed certain points in common between the stages of aspiration, success and failure and the ego. Regardless of these stage, I believe that if we cultivate certain principles we can always keep the ego in check. If I would have to further summarize the lessons in this book, I would simply stick to the following:

* **Never stop learning.** Seek to learn about yourself, your craft and others.

* **Don’t get fancy. **Don’t fall in love with yourself. You are not that special.

* **Have a goal bigger than yourself.** Set your standards and be selfless with your goals.

* **Focus on the work.** Doing the work is enough. It keeps us in the moment, honing our skills and away from impracticality.

As all the books I summarize, I definitely recommend you read the source material. Your understanding of these concepts and lessons will be much deeper and personal.

This the type of book you will want to go back and forward and reread from time to time. Therefore I recommend you grab the hardcover version of “Ego is the Enemy” by Ryan Holiday.

### **RECOMMENDED READING**

I am a sucker for self help books who extracts their lessons and advice from history and philosophy. If you enjoyed “Ego is the Enemy” you will definitely enjoy **“Mastery”** by **Robert Greene**, one of the mentors of Ryan Holiday.

If you want to read more from Ryan, the natural progression is to read **“The Obstacle if the Way”**, a stoic view on adversity and how to keep pushing towards greater things.

# 9 results of a routine that centres around wellbeing

## For the last 3 weeks I’ve been doing something very different — making it a priority to book time with myself and the results have been surprising.

I have been trying to stick to something resembling a routine for some time now. Couldn’t my routine centre around something I had been missing — yoga?

The host at one of my Airbnb houses had recommended a nearby yoga centre, triyoga, that offers a 30 day trial for a good price. I paid and booked my first 3 classes.

When I looked at the huge menu of options I realised that I was going to make it my mission to try them all. Feldenkrais today. Vinyasa yesterday. Pilates the day before. Prana, Iyengar, straight up yoga, yin yoga, Kundalini, Scaravelli, yoga gently.

I still have restorative yoga, Qi gong, anusara and jivamukti to go.

![Kyoto Garden, London, D Worster (c) 2015](1*8PYVYdbgQBNUynN5hb3b3Q.jpeg)*Kyoto Garden, London, D Worster (c) 2015*

Here’s what surprised me:

## 1. I go six times a week and I’ve never been late.

I found myself arriving 5 minutes or more ahead of time for each yoga class and occasionally very early to sit in the sauna or sip tea in their relaxing cafe. I’m not always on time in other areas of my life…and indeed I have found myself power walking to make it on time!

It isn’t that I don’t want to be the person who strolls in 10 minutes late (ok I don’t), it’s that I do not want to miss even ONE MINUTE of the potent practice of yoga. And the beginning of each class sets the tone. What is the teacher like? Do we meditate or dive right in? Who else is wearing socks? And so on.

## 2. A morning class is all the motivation I need to get up early.

An alarm ‘just because’ doesn’t have me leaping out of bed. But knowing I’ve got something fun that will inspire me and feel good to go to? It’s priceless. I’ll even defer a full breakfast til after the class without any complaint.

## 3. I’ve stayed in the same neighbourhood for the last 3 weeks!

Wow — so I will actually commit to being in the same part of London in order to commit to yoga? True story.

Freedom for me is being able to make this choice to prioritise my wellbeing. And yoga has ‘grounded’ me very differently than what I expected!

![D Worster (c) 2015](1*8YoTIEx0I1G8aVEN9pdWQQ.jpeg)*D Worster (c) 2015*

## 4. It’s an exercise sandwich.

For me to get to yoga is a 25 minute walk — then 60 to 90 minutes of yoga — then the return 25 minute walk.

Genius — I get my walk and my yoga. I know myself — when I can walk somewhere I am miles happier and it is much more likely to be habit forming.

## 5. There are infinite ways to explain how to do a pose.

And I learn something new each time I have a different class, new teacher or new explanation, even if it’s a pose I am familiar with such as downward dog or cobra. What are the other areas of life that might benefit from a rephrase or a reframe, I wonder?

## 6. Compassion is magnetic.

The yoga teachers that are compassionate, who have a beautiful sense of humour, smile and a gentle being have become my favourites. They inspire me with their love.

I am especially challenged by any poses requiring flexible hamstrings as mine are steel girders. An especially lovely yogi took me aside and suggested a stretch and let me know it took her 8 years to gain flexibility in her hamstrings!

![Love buzz, D Worster (c) 2015](1*LP4Dz0iaj4GcnkQoIZrQcg.jpeg)*Love buzz, D Worster (c) 2015*

## 7. We must make it very easy and welcoming.

We being the people who run yoga centres, who encourage healthy habits, who create powerful conversations and who create oases of calm.

It’s everything at the yoga centre- the booking system, printing out a ticket automatically (to track attendance), the pleasant environment, the cafe, the teachers, the equipment, the showers. Everything helps us get our ass in gear to do it. To show up on time. To feel welcome.

## 8. Creating a fun experiment can be a powerful green light.

How often do you experiment in life?

Let me rephrase — how often do you GIVE YOURSELF PERMISSION to experiment with what you do and how you do it?

And what elements do you require?

I require: (1) an adventure, (2) enough freedom to feel I have a choice and am flexible (e.g. I go to yoga at different times of day) and (3) some aspect of personal growth — yoga gives me a mind-body outlet for stress, better flexibility and strength.

When you experiment there are no winners and no losers. Just learners. Just results.

## 9. I love to collapse into a heap on the floor.

I love the relaxing, yin, ‘let your body collapse into the pose’ style of yoga.

I loved writhing around on the floor in Feldenkrais class today.

I loved chanting and doing creative and flowing hand swirls in Kundalini yoga.

I don’t love ashtanga, prana or hot yoga so much. (If I wanted a hard workout I’d do step class, thank you.)

![London fly, D Worster (c) 2015](1*OwT_6n3MOGxm02oGspvIdg.jpeg)*London fly, D Worster (c) 2015*

### **Actions:**

-Notice what you could experiment with in your life. Maybe it’s how you approach something you are avoiding or have let lapse. What can you do to make it a bit easier, more fun and have a halo effect on other areas of your life?

-Decide what would make an experiment worthwhile for you — what elements do you need?

# Wabi-Sabi&#58; Beyond Minimalism, and into a Unique Mode of Mindful Simplicity

## Wabi-Sabi: Beyond Minimalism, and into a Unique Mode of Mindful Simplicity

### On the Perfection of Imperfection, Graceful Humility, and the Understated Benefits of Acceptance

When I was growing up, I would regularly go to my friend Paul’s house. His bedroom was down in the basement, but in order to get there, you had to walk through a little hallway with an old trunk sitting there — which doubled as a bench where you could take your shoes off. As I took this trip more and more times, I came to look forward to seeing that trunk.

It was old canvas trunk with a wood frame. It had discolorations, scuff marks, and areas where the canvas was a bit tattered and the wood chipped. Not long ago, I happened upon what looked like a brand new version of that same trunk — with fresh, bright canvas and new, polished and unblemished wood frame. The brass was bright yellow and shiny, each rivet plainly visible. It was striking. But it couldn’t hold a candle to that old trunk in Paul’s house.There was something about that old trunk, something that made it exponentially more pleasing to behold than a shiny new trunk.

This isn’t an anomaly. The “worn-in” aesthetic has been finding its way into various arenas over the past few decades. In the late 90s/early 2000s it was the “distressed” clothing movement. As the 2010s came around, antiques and repurposed building materials became the go-to in many interior designers’ repertoires. Things that are old and *look *it give us a different kind of feeling — one that shiny new things just can’t replicate.

But what’s behind this? Well, it’s not just marketing, and though it seems trendy, the concept itself is not going away. In fact, the concept has less to do with clothing and design, and more to do with a different approach to living — one that focuses on simplicity, imperfection, and relaxation. This approach is called *wabi-sabi*.

And the thing about *Wabi-Sabi* is that it isn’t just an aesthetic. In fact, the aesthetic part of it is just a superficial representation of something deeper and more meaningful — something that, when embraced, can guide us toward a simpler and more fulfilling way of living.

### What is Wabi-Sabi?

The term *Wabi-Sabi* consists of two concepts combined into one. Each word has its own rich meaning, but they come together to form a unique concept that explains the warmth that radiates from certain things (or people) that embody it.

**Wabi
***Wabi* is a term that means something like “peace or quiet fulfillment with intentional simplicity”. At one time, it was used to describe the monks of Japan in the 14th century. They had simple robes, often worn and a bit tattered. They lived in simple housing, did their rituals with little adornment and pageantry, and thus exemplified a mode of existence that was respected for its simplicity and tranquility.

*Wabi* has come to be associated with a kind of minimalism and humility. People are often described as *wabi* when they exemplify a deep understanding of and comfort with who they are, and don’t crave or long to be anything else.

**Sabi**
*Sabi* (which conveniently rhymes with its partner word) connotes the graceful and quiet dignity of something (or someone) persisting through time. It mostly applies to objects, but it can easily be extended to a person as well. It’s the green oxidation on the Statue of Liberty, the whiskering on a pair of old jeans, the dark seasoning on a cast-iron skillet.

*Sabi* has as its root an embrace of the buddhist teachings about impermanence, and an acceptance of the decoration of time and existence. And that’s the thing about *sabi*: it can’t be built-in to something or fabricated; it must be earned over time.

**“Wabi-Sabi”
**Bringing the terms together, *wabi-sabi* is about a simple, humble, and gracious existence — fully understanding and embracing both yourself and the undeniable truth of impermanence. It finds representation in anything that accepts the fortunes or misfortunes of time, and bears them all with unfaltering dignity and grace.

In objects, you can see it in the presence of imperfections and evidence of use and wear. The objects have clearly been used, cared for, and kept. They could never be mistaken for new, but that’s precisely the point. They have gone through unique use cases, and are thus now unique — and distinguishable from others like them, produced long ago.

In people, you can see it in simple jeans and an old t-shirt, scuffed old shoes, salt-and-pepper hair groomed neatly, but not obsessively, and an understated, but undeniably genuine smile. There is an understated grace and wealth of experience, a comfort, and lack of aggressive desire and ambition (not a total lack of ambition, just that *aggressive* kind of ambition — the one that usually manifests in a bone-crunching handshake).

Reading all this, you might be confused and think that *wabi-sabi* would be permissive of neglect, and a wistful lack of care. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, *wabi-sabi* is all about care and appreciation. Things that show the patina of time are not the same as things that show a lack of care and upkeep. Neglect of things — whether material or otherwise — shows itself in particular ways. Those ways are different than how the simple wear from time shows itself. Appreciation also shows itself in important ways, and appreciation is a big part of what *wabi-sabi* is all about.

### How Can Wabi-Sabi Change Your Life for the Better?

We each want to be the best version of ourself that we can be. That’s the point of reading anything like this piece of writing. But there seem to be infinite different routes promising to get there.

To me, *wabi-sabi* is a way of getting back to basics. Consider it like minimalism for those who are tired of hearing about minimalism. It’s not an obsession with getting rid of things, taking pictures of your daily carry or tiny house. It’s not an ostentatious series of Instagram posts showing your nearly empty desk. It’s the antithesis of all that.

Embracing *wabi-sabi* is as easy (or as difficult) as understanding and accepting yourself — imperfections and all. It’s about being compassionate with yourself as you are, and building on whatever that is — not feverishly trying to rebuild yourself in order to pose as something else entirely.

If this sounds a bit vague, it’s because it is. Perhaps a quote from [a fantastic piece at the Utne Reader](https://www.utne.com/mind-and-body/wabi-sabi) can say it better than my own words:
> # Bringing wabi-sabi into your life doesn’t require money, training, or special skills. It takes a mind quiet enough to appreciate muted beauty, courage not to fear bareness, willingness to accept things as they are — without ornamentation. It depends on the ability to slow down, to shift the balance from doing to being, to appreciating rather than perfecting.

And there it is. Quiet your mind, understand, accept, and appreciate. That is as simple as it gets. Unfortunately, it can (and often does) take a lifetime to cultivate.

Appreciation is a lost art. It’s like gratitude, but much richer and more powerful. It requires a deeper understanding — the kind that comes through experience, work, and use. The more we can become appreciative of the things, people, and experiences that weave the tapestry of our lives, the better those lives will be, and the better *we *will be.

So go forth and be both *wabi* and *sabi.*

# How to strengthen rapport and connectedness

## How to strengthen rapport and connectedness

*How do you build rapport with the ones you meet in your line of work? Or maybe at that chess club you’re frequenting?*

Every now and then you make new acquaintances, and of course, most of us want to establish a connection with everyone, right from the start.

So how do you do it?

These guidelines may put you on the right track and facilitate the creation of rapport:

The first one and maybe the most important one:
> # ***“There are always similarities that connect us.”***

Whoever you meet, there is always a lot that you have in common.

When you think of these commonalities, you may feel more connected. At best, you may feel as though this person is *one of my kind*.

And then you may tend to be more positive and understanding.

You could call this bridging.
> # ***“Curiosity is key.”***

There’s an odd friendliness to curiosity, a positive frame of mind.

And what is more, it is outward-directed:

*Curiosity* could make you focus on others instead of yourself, which could let you uncover and learn more about their merits and their preferences.

Then it may also be hard to be judgmental and self-righteous.
> # ***“What you assume is what you get.”***

Maintain positive expectations.

When you meet or are about to meet someone, he or she is a significant and interesting person.

An individual with all sorts of ideas and abilities and experiences that you could learn from.

All in all, this kind of thinking could put you in the right state of mind, could set the foundation, and may make rapport more likely.

So one could keep in mind: *similarities*, *curiosity*, and *expectations*.

# Why You Need to Infuse Your Creative Practice With Joy

## 

### We’re hard at it, right? We’re clocking up hours in the studio or at our writing desk. But are we present? Are we experiencing JOY?

Or are we instead worrying about meeting an upcoming deadline? Or the slowness of our progress? Or whether that character really adds anything to the plot or that blue bit at the bottom left really belongs there…

We fail to notice that JOY has gone out of the room. ​

You remember Joy, she’s the one who’s always hanging around when you start something new. She wears bright clothes and she’s full of optimism and excitement.

Just when did she leave?

When you finally realise Joy’s gone, it’s like someone turned the light off in your studio. Or the sun off in your world.

Earlier this month, I was working on my second [artist’s book](https://www.cherryjeffs.com/art-blog/what-is-an-artists-book) and everything felt kind of *heavy*. I was forcing myself to work but I’d rather have been anywhere than in the studio. I was literally dragging myself in there.

I sat down and took a break. I looked around. Where was Joy?

As soon as I realised that the joy had gone out of my work, I knew I couldn’t go on in the same vein. Something needed to change.

### The hardest moment to take time out is when you most need it

It’s so hard to take time out when it already feels that you’re way behind with everything. Yet it’s the most essential time to do it. What’s the point in knocking up hours or ticking off tasks if there is no joy? Thats not creating, it’s debilitating!

Plus I bet that like me, when you’re joyous you can work at warp speed. So there’s no point in saying that you don’t have time to stop and analyse what you’re feeling!

You can save yourself a lot of time if you don’t spend it doing something that’s making you miserable…

We need to stop in our tracks every time we find ourselves not enjoying the process and ask why.
> # “With an eye made quiet by the power of harmony, and the deep power of joy, we see into the life of things.” 
> # William Wordsworth

So I took a long hard look my ideas for the project. And the work I’d done so far.

I thought about which part of the project was the most exciting for me — and why. I decided to ignore everything else for the moment and start working with that part.

I bet you can guess what happened can’t you?

Joy came back into the room.

My motivation returned and I worked quickly and decisively and *well*.
> # “Joy acts like a trampoline, everything that touches it bouncing right back off it.”
> # Mariella Frostrup

Happy accidents occurred and sparked a new idea. Suddenly even the bits that had felt burdensome and lugubrious before, began to energise.

I accidentally placed a fish on the sky area and suddenly it came alive!*
> # “…when I stand back and look at my work I can sometimes feel that side of my brain, the left side, too much in the finished work. It makes my art look like I have been trying too hard…A casual observer might say, ’It looks like, in this painting you didn’t have as much fun’ and in truth, they would be right.”
> # Nicholas Wilton

So next time your creative work starts to feel like a millstone round your neck, take a break. Look around and see if you can spot Joy.

If you can see her, make a beeline in that direction.

If she’s left the room, ask yourself why.

Think about what you can do to entice her back in.

Go do that.

# The Monkey Suit

## The Monkey Suit

### If life were a 24-hour clock, it is just past 7:00am for someone in their early 20s. I’m just waking up!

Each day I open The Facebook Times and scroll through pictures of glorified nature hikes and quotes of dead people ordering me to push my limits and trail blaze a path into the unknown. Apparently I should do whatever excites me and brings pleasure to my life because that’s the only good way to live it. Artistic mavens from here and then solidify this ideal, like Hunter S. Thompson in his 1955 essay entitled “Security”…
> “Security … what does this word mean in relation to life as we know it today? For the most part, it means safety and freedom from worry. It is said to be the end that all men strive for; but is security a utopian goal or is it another word for rut?
> Let us visualize the secure man; and by this term, I mean a man who has settled for financial and personal security for his goal in life. In general, he is a man who has pushed ambition and initiative aside and settled down, so to speak, in a boring, but safe and comfortable rut for the rest of his life. His future is but an extension of his present, and he accepts it as such with a complacent shrug of his shoulders. His ideas and ideals are those of society in general and he is accepted as a respectable, but average and prosaic man. But is he a man? has he any self-respect or pride in himself? How could he, when he has risked nothing and gained nothing? What does he think when he sees his youthful dreams of adventure, accomplishment, travel and romance buried under the cloak of conformity? How does he feel when he realizes that he has barely tasted the meal of life; when he sees the prison he has made for himself in pursuit of the almighty dollar? If he thinks this is all well and good, fine, but think of the tragedy of a man who has sacrificed his freedom on the altar of security, and wishes he could turn back the hands of time. A man is to be pitied who lacked the courage to accept the challenge of freedom and depart from the cushion of security and see life as it is instead of living it second-hand. Life has by-passed this man and he has watched from a secure place, afraid to seek anything better What has he done except to sit and wait for the tomorrow which never comes? …”

Why then do I rise every morn before the sun and put on my monkey suit 1 perfectly creased pant leg at a time? Here’s why.

For every Hunter S. Thompson there are 500 homeless bums with no means to fund their drug addictions. I live in Venice now and each day I notice 1 of each: a new mural and a new bum. I’ve seen the lifestyle; it’s not for me. Ever.

I would love to drink, travel, meet beautiful women, and write throughout my divine 20’s and I *could *find the means do it by working odd jobs…but then what? I’ll wake up tomorrow with 30 years under my belt having learned no professional skills at which point the boring 9 to 5ers will begin translating their dreams into reality and shaping their future by utilizing the help of the grey-hairs who they’ve assisted.

The early 20’s are a tough era. We see little reward for our efforts and the light at the end of the tunnel is a dim lit speck on the horizon. I’m being used up for every ounce of productivity within me to help old dudes and dudettes fulfill their dreams because they’ve already walked hundreds of miles in my shoes paying their dues all along the way.
> **Yet I will not fret. If life were a 24-hour clock, it is just past 7:00am for someone in their early 20s. I’m just waking up! My dreams will come to fruition, soon, but they must be put on the back-burner for now.**

I will continue to wear the goddamn monkey suit with a Half Windsor. I will sit behind a computer screen every day and continue to acquire the knowledge that has been gained from the failures of past generations by rote. But don’t get it twisted. I’ll pepper my drudgery with experiences where I have the liberty to unleash myself…

# I’ve Been Homeless.

## Personal story of development, humiliation, and the growth of capacity to help others.
> I’m writing this piece to share with others how I faced a tremendous personal challenge and came out the other end much more awesome at everything.

## There are a lot of valid reasons that people give up on life.

It’s not as hard as you think to be so defeated by life that you just throw your hands up and quit. But to those who have been at the very bottom of life and picked themselves up, I salute you and I understand.

I have had a very interesting life. Full of amazing accomplishments and epic failures. One of the hardest challenges I had to face was losing my job and being homeless a few years ago.

Let’s stop for a second and prose a question.
> # Have you ever been homeless?

A vast majority of you reading this will shake your head, NO. I’m not talking about not having an apartment to move into and mildly inconveniencing you. We are talking about having absolutely everything one week, and losing all of it in a matter of another.

It is a very surreal experience for anyone. There are so many emotions that you go through. Some are **temporary** and painful, while others are **supremely debilitating** and stay with you, even haunt you for much longer than you ever imagined they would.

## Temporary Emotions Caused By Homelessness

There were 3 temporary emotions I felt immediately.

![This is exactly who conceived the COBRA healthcare supplement.](0*BXK12p34Hq0e3zNn.jpeg)*This is exactly who conceived the COBRA healthcare supplement.*

**Fear.** I think the biggest thing I faced was the fear of the unkown. How was I going to pay for things. How were we going to eat. *What about health insurance? *How am I going to pay the car notes. The ‘humiliation’ of being on unemployment. And suddenly, I was confronted with a terrifying thought that had never crossed my mind.
> # *Will my wife still respect me if I don’t have a job?*

Up to that point, we had faced a handful of big marital trials. But in all of those situations, our roles were never really in question. But I was truly afraid of her response to me losing my income. My mind raced with fear even though my goddess reassured me that we were a team.

**Isolation.** Simply put, you feel that no matter who you are around, you are the only one there. I was consumed with my fear. So much so that I stopped answering emails,calls and other social activities. I was alone.

**Guilt.** Man did I feel like I was guilty of a major coverup. Every thought made me create this huge conspiracy in my mind that I was the mastermind behind this disaster. Somehow I caused it, and now it was my time to curl up with the blame and pain it causes.

Those were temporary. They hurt for a bit, but with each passing day and actively looking for work, those feelings faded.

## Now lets discuss the downright supremely debilitating emotions.

There are some things that you endure at a time like this that constitute psychological warfare.

**Confidence free-fall.** I was depressed. I had been down before but this was different. I wasn’t sad about having to struggle or even living at a lower level than I was used to. **I was sad that I was sad.** You see, anyone that knows me can attest to the fact that I am a fighter. I have always been one. If you’re in trouble, call me up and we will get it figured out. It’s an awesome feeling to know people count on you to be there to lean on.

And here I was, desperate to lean on myself and I was a no show. Confidence is a tricky thing. I border on egotistical in some people’s view because of my strong opinions. I’ve always been great at something. Shrugged off disappointments and moved on. But as I struggled everyday to get my juice back, *I found myself doubting what I was once so sure of.*

**The dreaded weight gain. **I gained 32 pounds. Yep. Enough on that.

**Unbridled rage. **I was mad. Most of the days I looked for work or sleeping arrangements for my family, I did in a rage. My wife was a tremendous help because she was there when I finally calmed down. It was actually her that made me realize that what I was going through was making me stronger.
> # Hey baby, I know things are tough now, but just think about how great your next success story will be.

She was trying. I probably said something crass and ungrateful. But you know what? She was right.

### Why that made me unbelievably awesome

As with all things, my low point passed and I slowly found my way. Job offers and housing made a untenable situation not as bad. Not only that, but I found time to focus on myself. Build up real strength from a negative situation. Learn. Grow.

You see, there was the lesson I learned from all of that pain. I needed to get stronger. I was an infant to the continuous cruelty of life. I had it good for a long time, I forgot what pain and perseverance really meant.

It made me reflective, self-sufficient, and content with my accomplishments. So if I never reach another feat, I’m good. Learning to appreciate my wife and our bond was the lesson. I lossed a lot, but I didn’t lose it all. Money can be replaced. Good people can’t.

### So here I am

Sharing with the world what I went thru and why I believe I am more awesome for it. I truly care about and can relate to people less fortunate because I was one of them. I know the excruciating pain of not having and the baggage that our society heaps on top of that.

And I want to help. Not charity. But truly help. The products I am determined to make are infused with empathy. I’m focused on showing people from all walks of life that I care as much about them as I do my own confidence and reputation. Why?
> # Because we all at some point in our lives fall. Isn’t it nice to know that when you do, someone like me will be there to pick you back up.
> # That is truly awesome.

# Leadership Empowerment — Finding the Purpose in Needs

## 

What sparks a leader’s passion to step up and take on a cause? What empowers a person’s leadership? What drives them to start this journey? What ignites the vision to birth so the leader can start planning to orchestrate a team to bring it to pass? Leaders have a heart for change; they constantly wish to see things continually progressing forward. They understand Proverbs 29:18 that says “Where there is no vision, the people perish”. So what sparks this vision to take on a cause?

The answer may come a little odd to you, burdens. Burdens have a way of creating a passion within you to take it on. Burdens are different from trials because burdens don’t affect you. You can walk away from a burden and still go on as if nothing happened. However, most godly leaders caught their vision when taking on a burden. Leaders don’t have to go searching for burdens to take on because most times the burden will be readily available for your calling. Through obedience your calling will come from seizing opportunities as they present themselves. Burdens do three things in the life of a leader:

**1. Burdens Purifies Motives** — You can’t take on a burden and be self-seeking at the same time. When you take on a burden it will generally draw you away from your place of comfort and into an area that more than likely will not be comfortable to you. However, you’ll soon find out that your main purpose in taking on this burden is to benefit others and not yourself.

**2. Burden Cultivates Persistence** — Taking on a burden will take hard work and dedication. There will be times when you’re physically, mentally and spiritually drained. It’s at this point that the good leaders are separated from the great leaders. It’s an ultimate sacrifice to put your life on hold to take on a more major issue. You’ll walk away with cuts, bruises and tears but in the end you’ll walk away with the victory if you just become persistent.

**3. A Burden Cements Conviction** — Leaders are convicted by burdens. They understand that burdens lead to vision. Once the vision is created, the passion to bring it to pass is sparked. This is why burdens are so powerful because it forces the leader to develop their creative side to see the vision come to past. What has convicted you lately? What issues do you see in your local community that needs attending to? Don’t always look around for help because you may be the help people are looking for.

# I Get Advice From a Murderer

## I Get Advice From a Murderer

This year, like every year, on the morning after Thanksgiving, I will go to jail. Dad drives. Mom burps up pumpkin soup. I read *The New Yorker*’s food issue in the backseat.

His name is Juice. At least that’s what everyone calls him. I think it’s a reference to the 1992 film *Juice*, the one with Tupac and Samuel L. Jackson, but I’m not sure. The film came out while he was in jail, so he probably hasn’t seen it.

In 1974, Juice killed a nineteen-year-old boy during an armed robbery in Philadelphia. He was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was twenty-two. You can read his unsuccessful petition for release [here](http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/05D1376P.pdf). His legal name is Larry, but I’ve never heard anyone call him that.

Juice grew up with my dad. They see each other for four hours each year, in the basement of a prison thirty miles from the city, where they eat lemon pies from a vending machine, share straws, and talk about the way they’re both afraid of centipedes.

And since Kindergarten, I’ve loved it: pretty badass to go to jail when you’re six. There’s the stale air; the line of fifteen urinals in the visitors’ bathroom with a puddle of urine under each one; the metal lockers in which I used to store my copy of *Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH *before walking past three prison guards.

A guy with a gun tells a joke and opens a door. There he is. We hug. We kiss, sometimes. We find a seat, find the vending machines — jails have prodigious vending machines — and buy ourselves Runts and roast beef sandwiches and Skittles. Of course he doesn’t have money, because he is in jail. So we pay.

He tells us what he’s working on: he was a finalist for Yale Law Journal’s [Prison Law Writing Contest](http://www.yalelawjournal.org/journal-news/), and he’s published one [listicle](http://articles.philly.com/2008-02-18/news/25266186_1_state-prison-big-house-guard). Sometimes we shoot the shit about the merits/demerits of adverbs.

We tell him our complaints: it was hard to get into college; harder to get a job; and, just last week, they bombed the U.S. embassy in Turkey. Harris has this condition where he has to take B12 shots every month, and if he doesn’t take them he’ll go crazy. Mom’s eczema is acute. It hurts most at night, and, I’m not sure if you’ve heard, but Philadelphia’s public school system is $133 million in debt, which is absolutely crazy, like I don’t even know what happens in these huge bureaucracies, and there was this other statistic I heard recently, that they build jail cells according to kids’ test scores in elementary school, and isn’t that nuts?

We don’t ask for advice, but we get it. We get it when we watch him eat a roast beef sandwich, unwrapping its plastic placenta. We get it when he runs his fingers down four packets of mustard, squeezing out all of each one as he calls my dad “a pistol.” We get it when he asks me how New York is going, and I say “good” and he shakes his head ten times and does that sighing thing men do, that high-pitched sigh, like he’s watching a pitcher hit a ball into the stands.

At the end of two hours, a man with a gun screams at the air, and it’s time to go. There are these small windows on the tops of the walls; by the end of our visit, they’re each solid grey. It’s November, almost December, and time for us to throw our roast beef sandwich wrappers in the trash.

We can’t really see the sun go down as we drive home. There are too many trees in Pennsylvania. All we notice is the ambient light just kind of evaporating, until it’s too dark to read, and I have to close my magazine and just sit there with Runts and croissant sandwiches and Skittles in my belly, looking at grey until we get out.

# Nothingness

## If we can say and think the word ‘nothingness’ then the implication is that ‘nothingness’ must exist. But is it nothing? Or something?

![](0*gBIT8RaMuiD1PRpK.jpeg)

In [**The Monastery of Nothingness](https://medium.com/dude-jitsu-for-everyday-life-leisure/medium-com-themonasteryofnothingness/home)**, we often state that “Nothingness is our goal.” Over many centuries, the term ‘nothingness’ has been repeatedly referred to by sages and teachers. For example, Taoism and Zen both refer to the specific term ‘nothingness’ as a mindset or as something for the student to discover and connect with. The term or its equivalents exist in many cultures and in many spiritual teachings.

Nothingness has come to be known by many names: mushin or empty mind, the Tao, Zen, the void, no mind, abiding, being in-the-moment, in the groove, bathing in the essence, channeling the everything, the Inward Teacher, the still small voice, conducting the universal flow, or what some people call a deeper inner connection to the Higher Self.

I believe this inner connection improves our relationship to ourselves and the people in our lives, and also improves our relationship to our personal goals and objectives, and the situations we find ourselves in.

I believe in practical approaches to both everyday life and to experiencing what some refer to as ‘living in the moment’. I personally promote universal principles as both ‘a way’ to improve ourselves, and as a set of signposts to help guide us along the path of discovering improved consciousness and awareness. Universal principles, in my opinion, help us to both better navigate the unknown, and to take us deeper and deeper down the trail. They are the absolutes that counterbalance the constant flux of nature’s movement, flexibility, growth and relativity.

### Implications of the terminology

Suggesting, as I do, that the Nothingness has been called many things may seem to imply that each of the terms I use are synonyms for Nothingness. Well, it all depends on how we view it. Because each of them are actually something.

I have experienced the Nothingness something like this - *there is a vast, dark sea of stillness - darkness, yet inexplicably full of light. Out of that vastness, that darkness, that stillness… something emerges. The vastness, the darkness, the stillness is what gives birth to intention.*

This, while my opinion, is based in my own personal experience. The basis for my statements are not based on faith, are not based on the sayings or writings or teaching of others. Although they may be in agreement with others, any agreement is simply because I have seen and experienced it - and it happens to agree with what others have said or written. In other words, I am not saying it because I want to be agreeable.

So, this is one of the things I have experienced and realized: that before thought is intention. But before intention is what? Before intention is the vast stillness, the darkness, the potential. Everything, in my experience, arises out of the darkness, the living stillness, the Nothingness.

I am not claiming I have a deep understanding of all of this. I am not claiming that my realizations are final destinations. Far from it, they seem to be merely stepping stones in the unknown. I am simply stating what I have seen and experienced, and I’m bringing that information back to the trailhead to share around the campfire with fellow travelers.

Nothingness is, to me, simply a term to denote a state of mind, a state of being, to express a condition, etc. So, we can say that nothingness is the absence of something, yes. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the absence of something is negative. If there is no air in a room, is that negative? Not if it is a scientific vacuum test chamber. Just because I have nothing to say, does that mean that nothing is there?

I do not view ‘nothingness’ as something that is abstract. I view it is as real and substantial, based on personal experience. But its attributes are difficult to describe.

### Mushin

In the martial arts the term ‘mushin’ denotes:
> Mushin (無心; Japanese mushin; English translation “no mind”) is a mental state into which very highly trained martial artists are said to enter during combat.They also practice this mental state during everyday activities. The term is shortened from mushin no shin (無心の心), a Zen expression meaning the mind without mind and is also referred to as the state of “no-mindness”. That is, a mind not fixed or occupied by thought or emotion and thus open to everything. It is somewhat analogous to flow experienced by artists deeply in a creative process. [Source: Wikipedia]

The expression ‘no mind’ is not implicitly negative or positive. It is an expression. And it is relative.

Similarly, the state of ‘mind without mind’ is a description of yet another state of being. These terms, similar to nothingness, are terms that describe a condition, and are not necessarily easy to describe.
> There is nothing but Nothingness, nothingness in the triple sense: nothingness because the little self has to go, and one has to become nothing; nothingness because the higher states of consciousness represent nothingness to the mind, for it cannot reach there. These states are completely beyond its range of perception. Complete comprehension on the level of the mind is not possible, so one is faced with nothingness. And in the last, most sublime sense, it is to merge into the luminous Ocean of the Infinite. – Irina Tweedie, Sufi teacher

### Use of the term

I did not select the term based on historic usage by any spiritual or similar path. And even though I have a lengthy background in the martial arts, it is certainly not a term that is prevalent, or even used in modern day martial arts. I have, however, tried to use the term to convey as a placeholder of sorts, describing something that is very difficult to describe. It seems clear that in many cases, historically, it has been used in a similar manner, regardless of any distortions that have occurred along the way.

I selected the word because it is the best word I have found to describe my own personal experiences in an aspect of the indescribable. And I have been deliberate in not stopping with the term itself, as though using the word ‘nothingness’ would be sufficient. Instead, I have devoted a great deal of thought to attempt, in my own small way, to impart a clearer sense of its meaning.

Being able to experience something doesn't necessarily mean it is comprehensible or conveyable. So, for me anyway, selecting this term is a little bit of picking a word that makes no sense, but does make sense, but doesn’t. No sense, but not nonsense, but sensible… with some explanation… at least to a relative point.

### Expressing the inexpressible

Of course, there are circumstances and experiences that bring us to a point where words fail. Inexpressible horror or grief come to mind. In such cases, the selection of any single word or group of words to describe what can’t be described will inevitably fall short. So it is with this particular term.

A commenter on the term I choose, nothingness, suggested that, “there is no sense claiming that which you cannot demonstrate. To do so is to rely on belief when reason is sufficient to discover the truth.”

In response, I am grateful to address the issue of belief versus reason. In my own case, and I suspect it is true of all of us, I doubt it is possible to entirely rid ourselves of belief that is independent of reason. But credits to the man or woman who attempts to do so. In my own life, I base my opinions on ‘nothingness’ on personal experience, not on the words or beliefs of others. Whatever faith is still involved (relative to my personal beliefs in this matter) has far more to do with faith in my own reasoning and experiences than faith in the statements and beliefs of others. I strongly agree with those, past and present, who promote the notion that each of us should listen to our own inner compass, our own inner voice, first and foremost.

And, while I agree it is far better to be able to demonstrate claims, not everything is readily demonstrable. Let’s consider that: just because something can’t be demonstrated does not invalidate its existence. Sometimes the failure to demonstrate lies in the demonstrator and his/her lack of skills. Sometimes the witness to the demonstration is incapable of seeing, hearing, understanding or comprehending, for some reason or another. Sometimes it is because the object to be demonstrated is very difficult to demonstrate or prove. Or all of the above.

Interestingly, these inexplicable things and (personal) experiences *are*, it seems to me, describable. But only, it seems, to those who have been down that part of the trail. When talking with certain people, admittedly few, there is a somewhat shared and unspoken common language that words hint at, and that the other person sometimes immediately grasps. It is clear that there exists a vocabulary that lies between words. Lovers, best friends, business partners, grandparents, parents and children can often relate to this.

### Widening the Path

I am not suggesting that the totality of the unknown and inexplicable are within our grasp. Our minds don’t seem to be in any condition to do that. But I do believe there are stepping stones along the path of the unknown, and that if we work together we can gradually find ways to convey the seemingly inexplicable.

The inner path is a ‘path’ because it not frequented. Get more people on it and pretty soon it stops being a path, now that it’s been widened and paved. History repeatedly demonstrates things that were once unknown and then eventually became commonplace. What was once a mystery becomes an everyday commodity.

These are the kinds of goals we need to be striving for, both individually and collectively — a mutual, group dilation of a small portal, converting it into a hyperspace jump into the infinite.

# Awe, Insight, and Flow&#58; The Keys to Breaking New Ground

## 

**As a species we’re intent on pushing the limit.**

There’s really no telling how far we’ll go — to the edges of space and time itself? Or to a self-inflicted oblivion?

Whatever the answer, we’re not going to stop trying to push forward anytime soon. We like innovation and creativity, we thrive off of it, it invigorates us.

There are three large areas of interest I’d like to discuss, and that I think provide a model for the most efficient and enjoyable road to innovation.

None of them are easy to accomplish, and you might consider yourself fortunate to have just one of them. But in combination, to go from one to the other, could form a sort of magical and time-alternating descent into new lands.

## Awe

“A feeling of reverential respect mixed with fear or wonder.”

The main point is to be ‘struck’ by something, to be amazed by the beauty/size/complexity or otherwise.

Awe is directed at objects considered to be more powerful than ourselves.

In [Dan Pink’s book Drive](https://www.google.com.uy/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCQQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDrive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates%2Fdp%2F1594484805&ei=VZDOVL77BYLngwT92IH4BQ&usg=AFQjCNGzqCl3E77dxRk3GfLtVAjUo9xbaw&sig2=0kAvq9yrIvEjhSxrEXB9LA&bvm=bv.85076809,d.eXY), he stresses that in work we should be looking for autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

Awe is where you find your purpose. It’s when you find something you consider to be bigger than yourself, and you know you need to know more, you’ve got to understand it, you’ve got to become a part of it and make it part of you.

And it will become a part of you.

Piaget coined two processes of learning. Assimilation and accommodation. **Assimilation **is fitting new information into pre-existing cognitive schemas, using what you know to understand something new. **Accommodation **on the other hand, is the process of taking new information and altering your pre-existing knowledge to fit it in.

Awe requires accommodation. It happens when you see or experience something that doesn’t quite fit with what you already know, so you need to alter what you know to make room for it.

That’s the feeling of awe, what causes your eyes to widen and mouth to drop, when you need to take in everything, your sense of self is lost and all that exists is this new experience.

## Insight

If awe provides you with your purpose, insight gives you your niche.

Insight is sometimes called the Eureka effect, or the *“a-ha” *moment.

But while awe is something that needs to come to you, insight has an essential prerequisite.

**Research.**

Insight shares a strong bond with creativity, but in order to experience it, before you can start to piece together parts of the puzzle deep in your subconscious, you need to have the pieces of the puzzle inside.

Once you have your moment of awe and find your direction, you need to learn everything you can, you need to go until you can’t go any further. When you’re stuck, when there’s no logical road to continue, or you run into a problem that lacks a current solution, this is your chance at insight and also at innovation.

This is where you relax and do something else. You let the deep recesses of your inner subconscious take over.

We’ve all likely had several of these moments in our lives, where we keep ourselves busy with a mundane task, or we’re at rest and daydreaming, perhaps even sleeping, and an answer to a burgeoning question comes and slaps us in the face.

Suddenly we drop everything and get to our feet, screaming *“EUREKA!”*

The way I’m using insight here though, is a little different from an everyday experience. I’m using it to define the moment where you realize something can change, something can be done differently, better.

It’s not just an answer to a math equation or an intuitive way to fix the leak in the ceiling, it’s a way to break through and go somewhere no one else has — the earth is round! And it orbits the sun!

## Flow

You found your purpose, and you’ve made a discovery. What’s next?

You go further, you take that discovery as far as you can.

[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://www.google.com.uy/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=7&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CHgQFjAG&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFlow-The-Psychology-Optimal-Experience%2Fdp%2F0061339202&ei=gZDOVNylMoGNgwSe1oG4Ag&usg=AFQjCNF_LSJ2934rjEtQ9xH1OVYN0J7KCA&sig2=WvsrmdG4Vu34rATOOTHIfQ&bvm=bv.85076809,d.eXY) says that people are happiest when in a state of flow, which he defines as completely focused motivation. A state of concentration or complete absorption with the activity at hand and the situation. It is a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter.

Flow is your movie montage moment. That part of a movie where someone’s flicked a switch and kicked themselves into action, and the next couple of minutes are filled with shots of determination and, of course, music.


*Rocky in a state of flow*

Mihaly designed the flow model, in which he places flow as the point where you have a difficult task to accomplish, but you have all the necessary skill to do it.

If the challenge is difficult and you’re a novice, the result is anxiety. If you’re skilled but the challenge is easy, the result is relaxation or boredom.

You’ve done your research, and now you’re breaking new ground. The challenge is to use what you know to go further and to make sense of your new discovery.

It could be that you want to write a book — flow will come from sitting down and getting all those bottled up thoughts out. You might have discovered a perfect business opportunity — flow will come from designing it the way you now know is going to work best. A musician that’s suddenly heard the music in their head, and now has all the skills needed to put it down, will enter a state of flow when he does just that.

## And Repeat

From there it’s up to you where to go. You’re on your own.

You could start from the beginning, wait for another moment of awe to strike you, and enter this new domain from scratch.

Or you could stay on the same page, look for new ways to mix things up.

Just try not to do nothing. That’s a waste.

In all of these states, your sense of self should disappear. They each come from the subconscious to lead you somewhere, but that somewhere is lost when ego comes in.

The motivations are intrinsic — money and wealth are left behind as meaning, curiosity, knowledge, and enlightenment take over.

And they’re not easy, either. They don’t appear when you want them to, when you look for them or try to coax them out.

It’s them that find you, when you stop looking. It’s for this reason they’re difficult to study scientifically. But rest assured they are there, and getting all three of them to synchronize together is the ultimate way to go where no one else ever has.

# Holding On To Circumstance

## Holding On To Circumstance

### Amidst our constant connection to others, we’re missing out on the present.

Personally, I’ve always been a huge fan of the power of coincidence. Running into a long lost friend in the airport; or passing an old teacher from grade school on the street - these circumstantial interactions have worked wonders for me.

In one case, I am especially indebted to a circumstantial conversation between two women in a nail salon, both of whom consequently still use old flip cell phones and neither of whom are on Facebook. They had nothing to do while waiting for their nails to dry, and so they started talking.

One mentions she knows a “nice young man” in NYC who had recently graduated from Cornell - and is single. The other woman mentions her daughter, a woman who had also recently graduated from Cornell - and is also single. So, they decided to fix them up.

I’m especially fortunate for this, because I was the young man, and that’s how I met my wife, Erica. I wonder: If these women had smartphones and iPads, would they have been talking as their nails were drying? Circumstantial interactions offer enormous potential for our lives.

This realization is especially true when it comes to our careers. Some of the greatest deals and partnerships are the result of chance conversations during the breaks at conferences or cocktail receptions - the moments when we usually dive into our email. The value of any experience is often found in the seams.

The problem is, despite how valuable of a role circumstance plays in our lives, we can’t plan for it. As we become more connected - we become less open to circumstance. We stop noticing what is going on around us.

Stay open.

Things to think about:

1. The 21st century challenge is to keep your focus and preserve the sanctity of mind that is required to create and ultimately make an impact in what matters most to you. Imagination happens when your mind has the freedom to run rampant. Unfortunately, in the modern day, our minds are usually busy reacting and digesting tons of information. We need to be aware of the cost of constant connection.

1. Value the circumstantial. Recognize how powerful it is. And then mine the circumstantial with more intention.

1. In a world of twitter, email, endless texts, internet wonder (and now Medium!), create windows of non-stimulation in your day and life - whether through habits or rituals, when you can tune out of everything else and tune into yourself. Periods of time to focus on making meaningful progress on your own projects - time spent being open to what’s around us and **creating**. Don't rely on a flight oversees or some other means of being forced to disconnect through circumstance (they’re rapidly disappearing!), force yourself.

1. Recognize the stuff you do out of insecurity or the need for constant stimulation, then compartmentalize it. Browsing analytics for your website, checking how many “likes” or “followers” you have. Don’t spend too much time doing it. You cannot imagine what will be if you’re constantly concerned about what already is.

# 4 strategic steps to productivity

## When we want to be more productive, we don’t see the big picture and no matter how quickly we apply the productivity tools by reading articles, viewing videos or listening to audio-books, we might miss something. I realized that the missing link could be a framework from which to start, and where to include the tools that we learn about.

As I am involved in academia & research activities, I analyzed a number of models for measuring a company’s performance. Two years ago, I created a strategic model called SEED Strategic Model, useful as a framework for developing business strategy.

In short, SEED Strategic Model includes:

* Strengths — companies’ internal capabilities

* Environment — Competition analysis

* Expectations — Objectives & Strategic options

* Development — Action related activities

What is the link between this model and productivity?

**Answer: Individual productivity leads to organizational performance.**

In 1908, Henry Ford revolutionized the car manufacturing industry by launching Model T (also known as Tin Lizzi), considered the first affordable car for the average American. The way this has been achieved was by increasing the efficiency of production and the inclusion of a line of production, compared to the prior system of individual manufacturing. Henri Ford, gradually increased the productivity of his employees which led to increased company performance and tremendous impact in the industry.

Certainly, you want to have more impact through the work you do, to achieve more or to know that your products / services are used by more people.

Starting from the SEED model, here are four strategic steps to **productivity**!

**1.Create a list of your strengths!**

When you want to be more productive, you need to understand the way in which you operate. Maybe you want to be more productive in the morning, but you’re not a morning person, so no matter how much you try it’s possible to go back to old habits. Change is possible, but if you do not align with who you really are, it’s possible to wake up early in the morning because of what others do and not because you really want it.

Remember! There is no magic formula for being productive. There are frameworks and ideas from which you can get inspired, but you need to adapt them to who you are or who you want to become. Your skills are important, especially if you want to be more productive in a job that doesn’t motivate you anymore.

**2.Analyze your working environment!**

The working environment affects your productivity. You become like the people you spend your time, so analyze your environment. If you work in an environment with effective meetings, you will be influenced, so when you have to hold a meeting you’ll try to be efficient. Most of the times, we analyze people like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs without taking into account the huge differences between countries and regions. A more regional approach even on who are the effective successful people in your country would be more interesting.

**3.Set your expectations for this year / month / week!**

Your goals are the fuel for growth, but expectations can act most often as a brake. When you want to be more productive, you should check if your goals require an increase in productivity and in which direction. Depending on your work, it’s possible to have too high expectations against the reality of the situation, which requires a higher flexibility to reposition yourself.

**4.Develop a clear plan of action!**

How do you act today? What makes you have low productivity? Maybe it’s time spent on email or social networks or too much multi-tasking. Small changes can lead to big results. Therefore, a change such as[planning](http://www.myproductivitykit.com/2015/12/03/calendar-planning/), time and number of times to check [emails](http://www.myproductivitykit.com/2016/02/04/5-tips-to-reach-inbox-zero/), limiting the activities on [multi-tasking](http://www.myproductivitykit.com/2016/02/11/multitasking-3-advice-for-single-tasking/) or focusing on[important and non-urgent activities](http://www.myproductivitykit.com/2016/02/18/important-or-urgent-more-productive-through-simple-planning/), could mean a lot to maximize productivity.

**Remember, though, that any idea requires action!**

# Meeting Mistakes to sabotage your week

## 

In corporatelandia I worked for a company where I would sometimes have meetings back to back, without any break, for a stretch of six hours at a time.

This is the same for many of my clients.
> Dear Corporatelandia, would you please stop scheduling useless meetings?

This week I spent twenty minutes with a client looking through her calendar trying to find time to complete her tasks. Tasks she was given during meetings that she attended.

Meetings that she attended *all day long.*

Once, she even did a meeting at 6:30am because it was the only time they could all meet. Did it shorten her day since she started so early?

Of course not.

In four days, she had about five hours total that wasn’t taken up by meetings. Basically, her company is saying this:
> “In order to do your job, you must complete your tasks on your own time, outside of your work hours.”

This is what she had been doing for several months. She had no GSD (Get Shit Done) time to really focus and work on her projects.

However, when we looked at her calendar, we found 3–4 meetings that she had scheduled, that she had automatically defaulted to an hour. This is a big mistake that most people end up making. If you give yourself an hour for a meeting, you will take an hour. If it needs to be done in 30 minutes, you’ll get on with the show. She changed these to 30 minutes and freed up a couple of hours.

She also found a couple of meetings that she didn’t even need to attend. People get invite happy and recipients get accept happy. Consider if you really need to attend the meeting. If it’s long, ask if you can just attend at the beginning or end. If you are able to multitask and check your email during a meeting, then you do NOT need to be on that meeting.

Yesterday I asked a group of 25 people if they read email during meetings and 3/4 of them raised their hands. These two tasks can’t be done simultaneously because they are using the same cognitive channel.

### The dumb part of your brain is either listening on the phone or checking your email.

Don’t be dumb.

![](0*CiyUlIoBBiIGUdPL.jpg)

What companies and people can do:

* Stop scheduling recurring meetings when you don’t need them.

* Stop defaulting to an hour.

* If you just need to touch base with someone, schedule 10 or 15 minutes.

* Try to end meetings at 1:50, 2:50 etc. This gives people a chance to actually stand up, use the bathroom and get a drink of water. It also keeps you from waiting for five minutes for people to join the call.

* Only invite people that need to be on the call. The **Rule of 7** states that everyone in a meeting over seven people reduces your ability to make decisions by 10%.

* Tell people you have a hard-stop at X time.

* Do [standing meetings](http://www.marceyrader.com/health/walking-meetings-butt-brain/). That speeds up meetings considerably.

* Don’t allow laptops or phones during meetings. This creates better engagement and focus.

* If you have non-urgent questions before a meeting, such as a 1:1, keep your inboxes clean by starting a list and saving them for your meeting. I used to ask my staff to come to me with a list at every meeting instead of emailing me every thought that popped in their head.

* In my current business, I try to meet with people first by phone and then determine if it is worth my time to meet face to face. Owning your own business results in a lot of ‘meeting over coffee’. I found that meeting over coffee was $ in money and time as it only led to something that couldn’t be done over the phone maybe 15% of the time. I know I have offended some people by saying I don’t have time to meet face to face but if I had all the time that other business owners had, I wouldn’t be able to actually work ON my business! Not every networking opportunity is fruitful. Be choosy.

# How To Set Up Firefox For Simple Productivity

## How To Set Up Firefox For Simple Productivity

Mozilla created the new Firefox with one thing in mind: speed. While they’ve succeeded — [the browser is lightning fast](https://medium.com/@ngoeke/which-browser-will-make-you-the-most-productive-22b0ec7eaa18) — it is now up to us to *maintain* that speed. You can’t do that if you clutter your browser with countless add-ons, customizations and pseudo-productive clickbait.

A simple browser needs a simple setup, in order to simply function. Hence, I’ve thought long and hard about these three aspects:

1. The home page.

1. The interface.

1. The add-ons.

Here’s how you can adjust them for minimal friction and maximum productivity.

## 1. Configuring Your Home Page

In almost all browsers, the home page defaults into showing you your favorite websites, highlights, maybe a search bar and sometimes even the news. Here’s the standard home page in Firefox:

![](1*Z8E1HqnQCWd5Bs5Zk_gLnw.png)

All of those are distractions, because they’re trying to get you to click on them. That’s not productive. Therefore, you don’t want a homepage that prompts you to *do something*. You want a homepage that prompts you to *think*.

When you open your browser, you do that because you’ve thought of a place you want to go, or you’ve just started thinking about what that place might be. Your home page should allow you to go there as fast as possible or help you figure it out faster, not block your path.

Hence, my home page looks like this:

![](1*7tejeJaDqTNRx1Wq5qrL3A.png)

Whether you choose [an inspiring wallpaper](https://unsplash.com/photos/NkEH30uoe8o), a thought-provoking question, or leave the page blank, all of those are better than starting your session with 20 minutes of mindless browsing.

Here’s how to do it: First, click the gear icon in the top right corner on the standard home page, then uncheck all four options and hit ‘Done.’

![](1*rCfVNXEhZKhwEi0G2hbkmQ.png)

Now your home page is blank. In order to set a custom image as wallpaper, you need the extension ‘[New Tab Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-tools/).’ Once you’ve installed it, go to your blank home page, right-click and select ‘New Tab Tools options.’

It will have a few ‘tiles’ set up by default, all of which you should delete. Set ‘Rows’ and ‘Columns’ to 1 on the right, then click ‘Browse…’ under ‘Page background image’ in the bottom left corner.

![](1*ADUIMAmAhSkTA-hNwQTRyQ.png)

Hit ‘Set’ and voilà, you have an uncluttered entry point into your browser.

## 2. Customizing What You See

Another common theme among browsers is that the content takes up 90% of the space, which means interfaces are a.) small and b.) densely populated.

The idea here is that the less you see of the interface, the more you can focus on the content. That’s a good thing, so you should make an effort to finish this job that the dev team started.

Here’s my Firefox interface, which is essentially limited to what’s called the ‘Bookmarks Toolbar,’ the URL/search bar and a few buttons:

![](1*iCe5Ds6EAxA-mSSDWW7Syw.png)

If you click the menu icon on the far right and select ‘Customize…’ you can adjust this small, but important aspect of Firefox.

![](1*ByiYAk-XNvthj7OIbnIEUg.png)

In the default configuration, you will see a lot of the draggable items placed left or right of the URL/search bar and below it in the Bookmarks Toolbar. I’ve removed all of them, including ‘Home,’ ‘Library,’ a few I had added before and the ‘Flexible Space’ bars.

On the bottom you can choose to show or hide the ‘Title Bar,’ make the interface a bit bigger with ‘Drag Space’ or smaller when setting ‘Density’ to ‘Compact.’ I chose the dark theme, because it’s easier on the eyes.

The reason you don’t really need any of these, let alone the ‘Overflow Menu,’ whose name says it all, is that they’re either available via a shortcut or just a click away if you really need them.

What I’d rather sacrifice the precious space for is a line of well-selected bookmarks. If you add a bookmark by pressing Cmd/Ctrl + D on any web page or clicking the star in the URL bar, but leave ‘Name’ blank, it will only add an icon to the toolbar.

![](1*5eh5BbuIJJ9lYW0DvSr6qg.png)

This is neat, because once you click that icon, it usually turns into that websites favicon, which means you can recognize what link it is without needing to describe it further. The folders on the right contain a lot of links from the same websites, which is why I left their names in, the last one being a few social media sites I only check once a week in one go.

After you add all your most important and commonly used sites, you’ll have a non-invasive interface that you can tweak as needed down the line.

## 3. A Minimalist Add-On Setup

In sci-fi movies, the villain often builds some sort of robotic, superhuman device. As he adds more and more features and power-ups to it, eventually, one leads to a fatal weakness the hero can exploit to blow up the whole thing.

Firefox is like that. A few enhancements here and there make it better, but if you stuff it to the brim with add-ons, it’ll get clunky, slow and will drag you down. To be productive, I’ve only installed three add-ons, next to ‘[New Tab Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-tools/):’

1. [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/). This is a brilliant ad-blocker. It works better than the two I have in [Chrome](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-set-up-your-mac-for-focused-work-ab3565750059) combined.

1. [Tomato Clock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tomato-clock/). A dead simple Pomodoro timer which tracks your blocks.

1. [MinimaList](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/minimalist-to-do-list/). What a digital to-do list should really be: a post-it note from which you can cross off items.

With this setup, I can open my browser, think about what I need to do, put it on my to-do list or work through what remains from the day before.

![](1*bdNyEXsePRWwyLNRn4Hd2w.png)

I pick the most important item or what fits into my current time block, then set the Pomodoro timer and off I go.

![](1*7Y3CiJUgJxZtlpvN5j_o9Q.png)

It sounds almost too easy to work, which is exactly why it works.

Yes, there are many other helpful features in Firefox Quantum, like automatically opening new windows in tabs (under ‘Tabs’ in preferences’), typing on any page to search it (under ‘Browsing’ in preferences’), or searching on Amazon straight from the URL bar.

However, all of those are best found by using the browser until you naturally end up with the question: “I wonder if it could do that?”

The new Firefox reminds me of Apple products: it is clean, elegant, plug-and-play. You turn it on and it *just works*. But if you want to do the same — just work — you need to keep it that way.

In a world of customization that worships individualism, this is harder than it sounds. It’s tempting to make every single product you use your own, and so we often forget that the people who make them are much better at it than us.

If we trust them to do their job, we can focus a lot more on doing ours.

# Leaders set the pace.

## photo credit: flickr/mhillier

“Leadership” is a verb.

It is a mindset, [a choice to accept responsibility, empower others, and make a difference](http://kendrakinnison.com/endless-evolution/).

It is available to any of us, regardless of our age, education level, title, or any other characteristic.

**Once we choose leadership, we must live it.**

For that, we need a system. I call it the Daily March, adapted from the Jim Collins book *Great by Choice*.
> Imagine you’re standing with your feet in the Pacific Ocean in San Diego, looking inland. You’re about to embark on a 3,000 mile walk, from San Diego to the tip of Maine.
> On the first day you march 20 miles, making it out of town. On the second day you march 20 miles. And again on the third day you march 20 miles, heading into the heat of the desert. It’s hot, more than 100 degrees, and you want to rest in the cool of your tent. But you don’t. You get up and you march 20 miles.
> You keep the pace, 20 miles a day.
> Then the weather cools, and you’re in comfortable conditions with the wind at your back, modulating your effort. You stick with your 20 miles.
> Then you reach the Colorado high mountains and get hit by snow, wind, and temperatures below zero — and all you want to do is stay in your tent. But you get up. You get dressed. You march 20 miles.
> You keep up the effort — 20 miles, 20 miles, 20 miles — then you cross into the plains, and it’s a glorious springtime, and you can go 40 or 50 miles in a day. But you don’t. You sustain your pace, marching 20 miles.
> And eventually, you get to Maine.
> Now, imagine another person who starts out with you on the same day in San Diego. He gets all excited by the journey and logs 40 miles the first day.
> Exhausted from his first gigantic day, he wakes up to 100 degree temperatures. He decides to hang out until the weather cools, thinking “I’ll make it up when conditions improve.” He maintains this pattern — big days with good conditions, whining and waiting in his tent on bad days — as he moves across the western United States.
> Just before the Colorado high mountains, he gets a spate of great weather and he goes all out, logging 40 to 50 mile days to make up lost ground. But then he hits a huge winter storm when utterly exhausted. It nearly kills him and he hunkers down in his tent, waiting for spring.
> When spring finally comes, he emerges, weakened, and stumbles off toward Maine. By the time he enters Kansas City, you, with your relentless 20-mile march, have already reached the tip of Maine. You win, by a large margin.

Collins goes on to explain, “The 20-Mile March is more than a philosophy. It’s about having concrete, clear, intelligent, and rigorously pursued performance mechanisms that keep you on track. The 20-Mile March creates two types of self-imposed discomfort: (1) the discomfort of unwavering commitment to high performance in difficult conditions, and (2) the discomfort of holding back in good conditions.”

**This practice is particularly important for leaders.**

**We set the pace.**

If we’re inconsistent, our teams will be too. If we seem to never leave the office, our teams will wonder if they should be pulling all-nighters too.

If we can find and demonstrate a sustainable rhythm, our teams will understand that consistent progress towards goals is what we’re seeking.
> *“Financial markets are out of your control. Customers are out of your control. Earthquakes are out of your control. Global competition is out of your control. Technological change is out of your control. Most everything is ultimately out of your control. But when you 20-Mile March, you have a tangible point of focus that keeps you and your team moving forward, despite confusion, uncertainty, and even chaos.” — [Jim Collins](http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/how-to-manage-through-chaos.html)*

It might also prevent [some of the downsides of a workaholic culture](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/02/21/5-things-you-get-from-working-too-hard/): high healthcare costs, decreased brain mass in the prefrontal cortex (not a good thing for decision-making), or disengagement.

**We must take care of ourselves.**

The familiar flight instruction captures it well, “Please secure your own oxygen mask before assisting others.” If we’re not taking care of our own health and well being, we’ll eventually be unable to provide an environment where others can be healthy as well.
> *“It is scarcely news that inadequate nutrition, exercise, sleep, and rest diminish people’s basic energy levels, as well as their ability to manage their emotions and focus their attention. Nonetheless, many executives don’t find ways to practice consistently healthy behaviors, given all the other demands in their lives.” — [Tony Schwartz](https://hbr.org/2007/10/manage-your-energy-not-your-time)*

By including basic health commitments in our Daily March, these habits will remain key elements within our days. Even 10 minutes of meditation and a walking meeting for 20 minutes can have a significant positive impact over time.

**We must keep learning.**

Our world is changing at a pace never before seen. To lead our communities and organizations to a better future, it’s essential that we make time for learning.
> *“I was at a dinner party recently with a guy who’s probably one of the top ten finance people in the world. At one point he said, “Do you know what the biggest problem is with big-company CEOs? They don’t read enough.” Isn’t it intriguing that’s number one on his list? We’ve always had to keep up. But now we need to be students in a way that maybe we haven’t been before.” — [Tom Peters](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/tom_peters_on_leading_the_21st_century_organization?cid=other-eml-ttn-mip-mck-oth-1412)*

30 minutes of an audio book on a commute or setting aside 15 minutes to read before bed will result in several completed books each month. In particular, this is one area where small daily commitments trump heroic “crams” when urgency strikes. (Looking for something new? [Here’s what other CEO’s are reading.](http://www.ceo.com/leadership_and_management/the-ceo-bookshelf-books-that-big-name-ceos-cant-stop-reading/))

**Components**

The Daily March consists of two main sections: morning and end-of day.

**Morning**

The focus of the morning section is to orient and prepare us to make good choices and decisions.

* What is your Mission/Purpose?

* What matters most today?

* What am I thankful for today?

* Which morning habits set me up for success?

For many of us, the investment of time for health habits, reminding us of our goals, and reviewing our priorities and schedule will return exponential dividends throughout the day. We’ll be calmer, more focused, and better able to balance the urgent needs of the day and our longer term commitments.

**End-of-Day**

The focus of the second section is to reflect back on our actions and decisions, making note of successes to capture and growth opportunities identified.

* What successes did I experience today?

* What challenges?

* What did I learn today? How will I grow?

* Who do I need to follow up with?

* Which end-of-day habits help me wind down, sleep well, and prepare for the next day?

While much attention is given to morning routines and their link to peak performance, growth comes from struggle and reflection. To continue to develop as a leader, the second half of the march is essential. Without it, you and your organization are likely to stagnate.

**Templates**

If you’d like to customize your own Daily March, [here’s a GoogleDoc that you can copy and make your own](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYctSCoHt2VGinyiU2oD1YVi5CUAcAKb87YnZfzZCSk/edit?usp=sharing).

# 2015&#58; To a Year of Connecting and Disconnecting Better

## Enjoying the shapes and movement of clouds above my head.

My work requires to be connected all the time, or at least that’s what I have made myself to believe. Running my own company and collaborating with colleagues and clients in different time zones blurs the difference between work time and personal time and it’s easy to catch myself writing emails at the wee hours of the day or in the middle of the weekend.

But I believe this constant, mindless, connectivity is detracting from my time in this world. After all, life is short and it’s defined more by the small things we do everyday — what I like to call ‘the small rituals in life’ — than by the highlights or peaks that fill up a CV (get a degree, get married, have children, change jobs, moved to new city, etc).

In 2015 my personal pledge is to be more mindful of life and my surroundings, connecting better with what matters most (to me) and disconnecting as much as possible from what’s not important, what wastes time and anything that does not make (my) life happier.

To do this, I’m following a few personal guidelines (calling them ‘rules’ would be to pretentious) to drive my way through a year of connecting and disconnecting better. In essence, I want to pay more attention to what I’m doing and be more present wherever I happen to be, celebrating the beautiful minutiae of being alive, while not getting stuck (too much) on the drawbacks that living itself entails. To avoid living my life distractedly and not enjoying it for what it is, restraining from living too much in the past or too much in the future.

## Mindfulness and Meditation

At the base of my old and new behaviors are mindfulness and meditation, two overly abused words these days, especially in the tech industry and in cosmopolitan cities like London and New York.

My curiosity in Buddhism and meditation started somewhere in my late teens back in Buenos Aires. In those early Internet years I could only access such topics via books, but I lacked people in my network that could point me to the right ones, and I felt that I was missing something regarding what meditation was.

In the last few years, mindfulness has creeped back into my life through daily experiences and a renewed interest in the everyday practice of meditation. My sabbatical in Japan in 2008, my erratic martial arts path (mostly Aikido, suspended now because of back issues) and the easy access to content and people via the internet has fuelled what has now become a daily meditation habit, which I intend to keep and grow by visiting a local Zendo here in London and occasional retreats to learn from/with others.

## Connecting and disconnecting while practicing sports

I like to run, especially in parks and on trails here and there. Running is a way to relax, mature the occasional idea and in general the only sport that I can regularly practice, as I travel often and it just requires packing running shoes and light clothes. Not only I find it and excellent way to disconnect from the daily hassles but also to explore new places. Istanbul, Tokyo, Madrid, London, Amsterdam, Bilbao, Milan, Rome, Buenos Aires… running has allowed me to see them from a different point of view.

Until a few years ago I used to run almost exclusively with music. I had a running compilation consisting of mostly hard rock songs (yes, Eye of the Tiger was part of it) and it helped with distracting myself from the effort required to make it through the run. Until one day, running across the beautiful Tuscan hills close to Siena in a sunny day, I realised that the music was obfuscating my senses. I couldn’t hear my own breathe or steps (or for that matter, a car coming my way) but most importantly I couldn’t hear the beautiful sounds of Nature around me. Birds chirping, the wind caressing the tall grass on the sides of the gravel road, the shuffling of leaves made by small lizards shying away from my path, the occasional dog, rooster, goat and what not.

Since then, probably 3 years ago, I stopped running with music (I might consider it for running on a treadmill, which I seldom do). To enhance the feeling of being present, I run mostly using minimalistic shoes like the Vibram Five Fingers, which allow a close sense of connection with the ground and let me feel almost the creases in the terrain, the pebbles and branches that I step on.

## Disconnecting in the bedroom

For the last 12 years or so my phone has been my alarm clock. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that except that, being my phone a smartphone, while grabbing it to turn on or off the alarm usually ended with long periods of mindless browsing through social media, the web and email. In fact, it was one of the first things I did before getting out of bed. In recent times I have eradicated the smartphone from the bedroom, and it all started with the “no social media in bed” rule and trying not to pick it up for the first 15’ after waking up. To wake up I bought an old school alarm clock. With rare exceptions, the only gadget I’m ok with in bed is a kindle ebook reader.

Another thing I like to do, alas not frequently enough, is to write down my dreams using pen and paper. It’s easier to write down my memories with my eyes half closed on paper than erratically tapping them on a screen. At a later time I take a photo of these notes using Evernote, which is my platform of choice to keep everything (notes, presentations, ideas, articles, food recipes, etc) with the hope that by doing this I’ll be able to search the content of my dreams too (it has happened a few times, when searching for a specific word or person, that a dream popped up among the results of a search query).

## Connecting better with people

I’m blessed by the group of friends I have, and my work and travels makes me meet new and interesting people all the time. Every time I meet them I try to dedicate them my full attention, shunning out any possible distractions. One way to do this is to avoid putting my smartphone on the table during meetings, lunches and dinners unless it’s needed for a specific thing or it is in some way required during the conversation. Same with Skype calls, by closing all other distractions like email or Facebook. (Friend, if you’re reading this and notice I keep being distracted when we spend time together please let me know!).

I usually send dozens of hand written postcards and thank you notes every year and during 2015 I’d like to reach out more to those people I care about with which I’ve recently lost touch. There’s nothing like unexpectedly receiving a physical reminder of our friendship.

## Connecting better with food

A famous author (who I won’t name because I couldn’t find his specific comment) said a few years ago that since he had Twitter he never ate alone anymore (reportedly when traveling). I have been guilty of eating in front of some kind of screen — be it a computer, tablet or smartphone — very often but I’ve now shunned them all while having a meal alone at home or at work, in order to connect better with the food and the ambiance of where I’m in. For practical reasons, I can have my device at arms reach but I will keep it off or with the screen facing away while I’m actually eating. (I’m ok with using it while waiting for the food or while still sitting and in need of some piece of information). If I’m very busy, I might take a shorter lunch break, but be fully into it while it lasts.

I also pledge to cooking more (an activity I actually enjoy a lot) and having friends for lunch and dinner more often, which also motivates me to learn new recipes.

These are a few ways I’ll follow to be more present during 2015 (and beyond). What are you doing to be more present in your life?

# Anxiety as a Service

## Anxiety as a Service

### When you think about anxiety, what comes to mind? Something negative — right?

It’s that thing that interrupts your life and makes things more tense and difficult — maybe even paralyzing.

Years ago, I used to wake up every morning with this sensation I like to call “**impending doom**”. It was like an alert. The feeling that something *very wrong* was going to happen. And if I didn’t in some Macgyver-like fashion find the solution to my catastrophic situation, imminent doom was on the way. So, I’d go directly into panic mode jumping up to work on whatever was on my mind.

### I Don’t Know About You, But I’m Not a Fan of Doom

The only thing is, my situation was rarely catastrophic, so all this reaction did was get me worked up. I don’t know about you, but I’m not a fan of doom. And since these feelings were an indicator that things were left way too long without being dealt with, I could either continue avoiding it *(because for some odd reason I thought that felt better than dealing with it)*. Or I was going to have to talk myself down off the cliff first before anything productive could happen.

It might seem immediately obvious to you that this isn’t any way to live, let alone a productive one. It took me a while, but over the last few years I’ve finally realized that this impending doom (and its younger cousins anxiousness, tension, and insecurity) could be my friends if I could embrace their positive traits.

So, I started looking forward to their visits with curiosity. What might **Insecurity** be seeing from his unique angle? Hold up, my boy **Tension** just pinged me, the message was a bit cryptic but he’s trying to tell me something. Sometimes the timing was obvious, like while walking down an unfamiliar alley at night — it’s not necessarily a problem, but it’s good to be aware and monitor. And yeah, thanks **Concern**, you’re right. This project is uncharted territory, I’ll slow down a bit.

Other times, my tension tracked back to the way I was connecting with others in my environment. **The feedback loop was the problem **— being around other people was making it hard to think for myself. I was like a microphone that was too close to the speaker — after getting a little distance, everything sounded much better.

All these sensations and alerts were just translated incorrectly due to the noise. Once that was filtered out, I had a new appreciation for Anxiety…
> *Anxiety as a Service — providing value on a daily basis, crunching the data in the background of my subconscious, and sending alerts with gradually increasing priority.*

Now instead of waking up in fear, I wake up eager to take action on any alerts to keep all systems online and healthy . If I’m sensing ‘impending doom’, instead of logging out — I login to see what needs attention to get happiness back online.

**Anxiety as an uptime monitor… don’t shoot the messenger.**

# This is How to Never Fail at Anything Ever Again

## This is How to Never Fail at Anything Ever Again

In 2004, Gmail was made available to the public for the first time.

The developers knew the service wasn’t perfect, but they still went ahead and released a “beta” version.

That way, they could get valuable feedback from users to make the final product as good as possible.

And there’s nothing surprising about that strategy. A lot of companies use beta testing for their products and services.

What *is* surprising, however, is that Gmail didn’t officially exit beta status until 2009.

That’s a five-year long beta test!

### How NOT to Deal With Failure

Most people tend to beat themselves up pretty bad for the mistakes they make.

Every setback is followed by heavy self-criticism and thoughts like:

* “I can’t believe I always do this.”

* “I’m so lazy.”

* “I don’t have any willpower.”

* “I’m such a failure.”

And on the surface, this might seem like a logical thing to do.

After all, if we don’t punish ourselves for straying off course, how will we ever be able to reach our goals?

But the problem with this strategy, of course, is that it doesn’t work.

Beating yourself up doesn’t make you perform better.

It makes you feel terrible. It makes you discouraged. And it ruins your self-confidence.

If anything, harsh self-criticism will make you perform *worse* than you did before.

So, what should we do instead?

### Put Yourself in Permanent Beta Mode

I suggest we learn from the developers at Google and put ourselves in beta mode.

But instead of staying there for five years, let’s stay there for life.

That’s right. **Permanent beta mode**. (1)

The beauty of this mindset is that it changes how you deal with setbacks.

Because if you’re in beta mode, missteps are to be expected.

Instead of perceiving them as discouraging failures, they become valuable data for you to use to [continually improve your approach](http://www.selfication.com/get-better-at-what-you-do/).

You don’t expect to be perfect. And that’s a huge relief.

### This is How to Never Fail At Anything Ever Again

The next time you find yourself in a situation where you didn’t perform as well as you would have liked:

1. **Remind yourself that you’re in permanent beta mode.** You’re an imperfect human so don’t expect perfect results.

1. **Forgive yourself as quickly as possible.** Not only will this make you feel better, but you’ll get back on track much faster. If you’re not used to forgiving yourself, try practicing [self-compassion](http://www.selfication.com/self-compassion/).

1. **Ask yourself what you can learn from this new data.** What went wrong? And which strategies could you put into place to get better results in the future? If you’re not sure, here are some of my favorites:

* [Start small](http://www.selfication.com/get-started-with-a-new-habit/).

* [Do a ‘shitty first draft.’](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-overcome-perfection/)

* [Use implementation intentions](http://www.selfication.com/achieve-your-goals/).

* [Set up commitment devices](http://www.selfication.com/stick-to-your-goals/).

* [Change your environment](http://www.selfication.com/change-your-habits/).

* [Celebrate your small wins](http://www.selfication.com/the-power-of-small-wins/).

* [Team up with the right people](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-use-accountability/).

* [Conduct a weekly review](http://www.selfication.com/weekly-planning/).

### Life is an Experiment

Put yourself in permanent beta mode. Treat every setback not as a failure, but as valuable data.

Then revise your approach relentlessly until you find a way that works.

It will make you much more effective. And it will make life a lot more fun. 🙂

# How to Be Audacious When You’re Scared

## Photo by Noah Grezlak on Unsplash
> “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” ~ Neale Donald Walsh

Many people stress how important it is to continuously challenge yourself. However, in my observation, leaving your comfort zone in this way often brings up feelings of fear — and how can you be audacious when you’re scared?

Here’s a lesson I learned about that during a week where I found myself *way *outside of my comfort zone:

As I stepped forward in my personal leadership, routine and comfort had been replaced by the sensation of perpetual bungee-jumping.

In expectation of another “first” that was awaiting me that day, I was pacing around the room. 
 
I did not feel ready for what was I front of me. While I had prepared myself extensively, I still did not feel like I would know what to do.

My husband was patiently sitting on the couch. Eventually, he spoke. *“You know,”* he looked at me, *“this is a big step.”*

I nodded and continued to pace.

*“You’re never completely ready to take a big step.”* My husband paused. I stopped in my tracks. *“You just do it and it works out.”*

I sat down on the couch next to him. He was right.

For a moment, I remembered earlier moments in my life where I was outside of my comfort zone:

I was not ready to study law at a Spanish university without really speaking the language at first. I was not ready to get married in another country with less than 48 hours advance notice. I was not ready to defend my Ph.D. thesis with a crimson-red face and while in pain thanks to my first-ever allergic reaction to a face cream I had tried.
> # There are a gazillion other things I was not ready for in my life.

And yet I did all of them.

And survived.

I’m not alone in this. In your own life, you can surely identify numerous moments when you took a big leap and were way outside your comfort zone.

In **these situations, it’s useful to become aware of the extent of our un-readiness for big steps.**

I’ve heard other versions of the wisdom my husband spoke that day, such as:

* Nike’s slogan *“Just do it.”*

* Susan Jeffers’ *“Feel the fear and do it anyway.”*

* John Burroughs’ *“Leap, and the net will appear.”*

None of these ever touched me as deeply.

Acknowledging that we are *never* ready for taking a big step strikes me as a more profound truth.

## Here are 4 realizations that can help you when you’re about to leave your comfort zone:

### 1. How to tell the big difference between being prepared and being ready

In the context of leaving our comfort zone, we can differentiate between being *prepared* and being *ready*. In the situation I described above, I was prepared but did not necessarily feel emotionally ready.

![Photo by [Dariusz Sankowski](https://unsplash.com/photos/3OiYMgDKJ6k?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/map?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*g8NmcLX6oVJBOmiCU8PXTQ.jpeg)*Photo by [Dariusz Sankowski](https://unsplash.com/photos/3OiYMgDKJ6k?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/map?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

There can be a [subtle difference](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/253216/how-different-being-ready-is-from-being-prepared) between these two words as I’m using them here. The first refers to taking all the preparatory (often physical or mental) action to put us in the best possible situation before taking a big leap — something we should always do to the full extent of our capability. For instance, if you have to give a big speech, preparing yourself optimally includes a lot of practice and receiving feedback from others.

In contrast, the second word describes a sense of emotional preparedness, which is something more complex and less under our control than mere logistical steps.

In a way, being prepared but not ready is actually an ideal situation for growth: by preparing adequately, you minimize the chances of something going wrong. Not feeling ready demonstrates that the gap between your current reality and what you’re about to do is so big that taking that step will help you grow.
> # When we take a step that is beyond us, there’s nothing wrong with us if we feel we’re not ready. In contrast, it’s to be expected — and demonstrates how much we’re growing.

### 2. The importance of daring to not be ready

Of course it’s more comfortable to feel ready to take a leap. And yet where would it leave us if we only did things we already knew we could do?

Taking a big step we’re not ready for is the story of humanity.

Is an expectant mother ever ready for going through labor? Is a baby ever ready for being born? I doubt it.

![Photo by [Isabella Jusková](https://unsplash.com/photos/SQszo1mP4sk?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*v5CATv2c3qBasvb3XH8QTQ.jpeg)*Photo by [Isabella Jusková](https://unsplash.com/photos/SQszo1mP4sk?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

Case in point:

I recently watched a YouTube video where male (and some female) volunteers try a machine that simulates labor pain while another person holds the control to increase the pain levels.

In one scene, a guy who was already writhing on the floor got asked if he was ready to move to the next level of the birth simulation.

Not surprisingly, his answer was, *“No, I’m not ready!”*
> # Humans are not ready for birth, whether literally or metaphorically (as in birth of a new self).

### 3. This is why you’re not ready for a massive leap

People sometimes think there’s something wrong with them if they don’t feel ready to take a big step. In reality, we don’t feel ready for an enormous change because that’s just how it works.
> # We will never be ready for the biggest steps in our lives.

Change only feels comfortable when it’s small enough to fit inside our comfort zone — but then it doesn’t *really* qualify as a big step. Massive leaps require that we leave our comfort zone, which by definition doesn’t feel comfortable.

In addition to taking us way outside our comfort zone, a leap forward signifies the birth of a new self as well as a mini death to our old self. And if there is one thing other than birth that humanity is not ready for, it is death.

### 4. You don’t need to be ready to be successful

When it comes to taking big leaps, our extent of felt readiness does not accurately predict whether we will be successful. It simply indicates how much the step will change us and how much it is outside of our comfort zone.

![Photo by [Ahmed Saffu](https://unsplash.com/photos/Ct1Mx5OTn9A?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/birth?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*V7D49hbhfwdagfDuOAilvQ.jpeg)*Photo by [Ahmed Saffu](https://unsplash.com/photos/Ct1Mx5OTn9A?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/birth?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

If we look around ourselves, there’s ample proof that one does not necessarily have to be ready to achieve positive outcomes.

For instance, to reiterate a previous point, humans are not ready for birth. Yet billions of us are here right now, demonstrating that neither parent nor child need to be emotionally ready for a successful birth.

The same is true for other big steps where we can find examples of people who have successfully taken them. No matter which massive leap we are considering, in almost every case, others have walked the same or a similar path before us. It’s very likely that at least some of them have accomplished what they set out to do.

It’s helpful to find these positive role models, as the mere act of knowing about them can help put our minds at ease, at least a little bit.
> # Once we realize that we don’t need to be ready to be successful, then we can “just do it,” we can “feel the fear and do it anyway,” and we can “leap, and the net will appear.”

First though, we need to realize that we are not ready.

And that is a good thing.

*Are you going to take a step today that you’re not ready for?*

# What Buddhism has to offer

## What Buddhism has to offer

### to humans in modern life

Writing about systematizing the processes for greater profit in less ammount of hours (which is the only thing you can not buy or replace) I found the need to continue unifying my different cores of knowledge that practice and study (and also hard work) have formed in my life.

In this process, I began to see why its so necessary today (and you just need to take a look at the amount of content generated with keywords like “[*how to improve my life](https://www.google.com.ar/search?q=how+to+improve+my+life&oq=how+to+improve+my+life&aqs=chrome.0.57j0l3.262j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)”*) the search for new ways of interacting with others and ourselves. A new way that is a little less toxic and a little bit healthier.

This reminded me of one situation where i was feeling that i was trying to *reinvent the wheel* in one of my projects (trying to code some badass CMS-fromthescratch by “need of a client”).
¡This induced my hypothalamus to fire a shot of adrenaline to my whole body!

Not only there was a fairly clear and defined way, but I had *already been studying and practicing it for some time.*

The *eightfold noble path.* A translation more or less successful according to several factors, is the path that the Buddha (the one known as [Siddhartha Gautama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_Gautama)) left to his disciples. Highly practical and applicable to any lifestyle you have, want, or whatever is the thing your up to.

It’s like the most incredible “*8 steps to be happy and make everyone else feel the same”* article —sort of thing— that I can think of, and therefore my desire to share it with you.
Try to remember to practice them in every aspect of your life: work, friend relations, girlfriend relations, family, etc. Consistency and patience ensures results in nearly almost anything.

## Eightfold noble path

![Wheel of Dharma](0*_9jUX2vx_W2ihd3S.png)*Wheel of Dharma*

### *1. saṃyak dṛṣṭi*: right view or understanding

This means, understand things as they are, try to remove all the preconceptions made in your understanding, your point of view. If you see things as they are, you will not be disappointed.

### *2. saṃyak saṃkalpa*: right intention or thought

If you have a right understanding, you should have right thoughts too. Cease all of your hidden intentions, be cristal clear, as water is.

### *3. saṃyak vāc*: right speech

If your thoughts are right and noble, why is it that your speech isn’t? speak right, correctly, and say the right things. A sage isn’t wise because he continuously talks but because he says the right things at the right moment.

### *4. saṃyak karmānta*: right action

Take action in a right way. If you think and speak correctly, but your actions aren’t, ¿what does that make you?

### *5. saṃyak ājīva*: right livelihood

How do you approach your material existence? what are you doing for a living? Do you have a position that forces you to do things you don’t agree? Change it now.

### *6. saṃyak vyāyāma*: right effort

Never heard anyone complaining about extra work? Giving all your effort is not always the right answer, such as Newton’s theory of forces, the forces (and efforts) are balanced when both your strength and the strength of a pair are equivalent.

### *7. saṃyak smṛti*: right concentration

Be here and now. This doesn’t mean that tomorrow doesn’t matter, or that there is no future (some old punk rocker —Sex Pistols style— may not agree with this hehe) but preoccupations about things happening tomorrow are that: *pre-occupations*. Getting your mind busy with things that didn’t already happened only generates stress and sick feelings, focus on what happens now, then and only then, to what happens next.

### *8. saṃyak samādhi*: right mindfulness

Do you meditate*? if not, do you practice Yoga**? if not, find time and a way to be with yourself, notice how each minute spent in states of deep meditation, helps in solving problems, and from there, helps by freeing you from stress and *preoccupation*.
A walk by a park, or the simple contact with nature, are also great ways of pushing yourself to these deep states of meditation.

* Meditation techniques allows us to go deeply inside our thoughts and feelings, getting our own awareness expanded in the process.
** Yoga are postures or pranas that allows us to be intimate with our own body and breathing, and therefore, our own energy.

# Dear Millennials — A Letter To The Lost Generation

## Dear Millennials — A Letter To The Lost Generation

*“You are all a ‘génération perdue!’,” *the garage owner shouted at the young mechanic, who couldn’t fix Gertrude Stein’s car fast enough.

![](1*nqA4125R9XSZ02GQoLnwhw.jpeg)

*“That is what you are. That’s what you all are … all of you young people who served in the war. **You are** **a lost generation**.”*

Stein later told the story to her dear friend, Ernest Hemingway, who’s largely responsible when historians today refer to those born between 1883 an 1900 by said name.

What Hemingway alluded to in [The Sun Also Rises](http://amzn.to/2mSsa3M) isn’t lost in the sense of gone, missing or forsaken, but *“**disoriented, wandering, directionless** — a recognition that there was great confusion and aimlessness among the war’s survivors in the early post-war years,”* as Samuel Hynes points out in [A War Imagined](http://amzn.to/2mSrP1k).

When I look at my generation of fellow millennials, I can’t help but feel as if history is about to repeat itself.

Hence, this open letter.

*Dear Millennials,*

*the war is over. It wasn’t a war waged with weapons, but with wires, pixels and bytes. The dot-com bubble has swelled, stretched and burst. Risen from the ashes of reckless investments and failed IPOs have we…*

***…the first generation of digital natives.***

*What we’re left with after this revolution of both technology and attention, is a world that’s changing faster than we can comprehend.*

*A world full of questions, full of uncertainty and scary decisions. Life feels like an endless game of poker.*

*But we’ve been dealt the best hand to deal with it. We’ve got so much going for ourselves.*

* [*We’re safer than we’ve ever been](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-10-23/world-actually-safer-ever-and-heres-data-prove).*

* [*We value cooperation above competition](http://fortune.com/2015/06/23/know-your-millennial-co-workers/).*

* [*We’re the most tolerant generation ever when it comes to race, religion, sex and culture.](http://www.bentley.edu/impact/articles/power-millennials-dont-know-they-have)*

* [*We’re liberal, social and politically correct](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/the-liberal-millennial-revolution/470826/).*

* [*We’re the most educated generation in history](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/19/how-millennials-compare-with-their-grandparents/)*.

*So why do we stand paralyzed as we’re facing a world of abundance?*

*Looking at the scorecard of wealth, work, health and heart, it’s only in the health department that we’re collectively winning.*

## We’re YOLO-ing away our financial future.

*We know there won’t be any social security system money left for us to retire with, yet [we remain blindly optimistic wealth will somehow work its way toward us](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/).*

[*We’re not making enough](http://www.businessinsider.de/millennial-median-wage-map-2016-11?r=US&IR=T).*

[*We’re not saving enough](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/11/why-arent-millennials-saving-money/382634/).*

[*We’re not investing enough](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/09/04/it-only-takes-10400-to-be-richer-than-most-millennials/).*

***We’re not backing up the optimism about our financial future with the actions that are needed to make sure it won’t remain just optimism**.*

## We’re too fancy at work.

*Currently, the way we go about our pecuniary and professional careers is…by [demanding more work life balance](http://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/allstate/attention-employers-millennials-have-made-their-demands/219/) in exchange for [our insanely expensive, debt-financed college degrees](http://time.com/money/4375215/student-debt-millennial-net-worth/).*

[*We’re not willing to do ‘menial’ work](https://qz.com/787448/millennials-with-college-degrees-actually-have-it-better-in-the-job-market-than-generation-x/).*

[*We’re blinded by soda machines and ping pong tables](http://fortune.com/2016/07/13/millennials-startups-job-benefits/).*

***We’re not rolling up our sleeves and asking ‘What can I do to help here?’, because we feel entitled to something we’re not yet ready to deserve.***

## We’re immature with our relationships.

*Alas, the coping mechanism we’re deploying to deal with the disappointments of work might be our biggest shortcoming of all. [We curl up in the safe bubble inside our parents’ homes](http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/pages/millennials/#snug-in-the-nest), deferring commitments left and right.*

***We’re delegating our sense of belonging to funny baby commercials, hitting a like button and meaningless Tinder dates, running away from the real thing full-time.***

*We’re called the Peter Pans, the Snowflakes, the Generation Confused of the new millennium. These calls echo from our parents and our grandparents and the worst thing about them is **they’re right**.*

*We’re too childish with our money. We’re too soft with our work. And we’re scared stiff with our relationships.*

*I can’t help but wonder. What happened to patience? To responsibility? To commitment?*

*What happened to vision, to trust, to gratitude? To work ethic, to maturity, to self-awareness and acceptance?*

*We’re told we can have everything, be everything and do everything we want. And we want to believe it so badly we’ve stopped questioning it.*

*The truth we share with our ancestors is an uncomfortable one: **we can’t.***

*Even **we** — can’t.*

*We have more opportunities than our parents, grandparents or any generation ever before us. Yet we linger in a state of paralysis by analysis, squandering those gifts, ending up months later, having done, been, and owning nothing at all.*

*But who to turn to, in times of frustration, depression and sadness? I think I know.*
> # “All that is gold does not glitter,
> # **Not all those who wander are lost;**
> # The old that is strong does not wither,
> # Deep roots are not reached by the frost.”
> # ~J.R.R. Tolkien

*Above all, one thing is carried forward to us in the comforting words of the man who’s created [one of our favorite books and movies](http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/12/50_movies_that_shaped_the_mill.html): **hope**.*

*So I say today let’s not fret. Let’s briefly avert our overly optimistic gaze from a bleak future to an admonitory past, for in the words of another mentor of the ages:*
> # *“Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”*
> # *~Benjamin Graham*

*As their strong, old words haven’t withered, so shan’t the lessons of history. I implore you:*

*If you’re a wanderer, if you feel disoriented, directionless - **pause**.*

***Pause to reflect on history.** Look to where your steps have taken you. Seek the path of those, who have come before you. See where it has taken them.*

*For only if we honor the past can we build the future we aspire to. So…*

*Let’s do away with the impatience.*

*Let’s do away with the fanciness.*

*Let’s do away with the immaturity.*

*But most of all, let’s do away with the distant, dying dreams. It’s our turn now.*

***Let’s make those dreams a reality by finally committing to our visions in the clouds and sticking our hands into the dirt.***

*Like Hemingway, born in 1899. Like Graham, born 1894. Like Tolkien, who was born in 1892.*

*All members of a lost generation.*

*I think we’re going to be okay.*

# The Cold is Your Noble Friend

## I’ve been known for doing some “crazy” stuff..

One week fasting, a ten day silent meditation retreat..tough, climbing Mt Fuji..not that hard really. My latest *stunt *is* *Wim Hof’s , aka “The Iceman” 10 week innerfire program…painful.

I first heard about cold therapy through *The 4hr Body by Tim Ferris*. I’m not quite as crazy as that. He takes regular ice baths to stimulate metabolism, among other ‘medical experiments’

Who is Wim Hof? His official job title on wikipedia is “Daredevil”.

He holds 20 guinness book records for holding his breath underwater, arctic marathons and climbing Mt Everest in nothing but shorts!
> Boost Your Immune System To Bulletproof Yourself And Feel Fully Charged
Become A “Super” Version Of Yourself
Increase Your Health And Wellbeing
Hack Your Body Using Cold Therapy To Feel Energized During The Day,
While Sleeping Like A Baby At Night”

So, what’s the verdict?

Granted, I’m on week three of the program, which involves cycle breathing and alternating hot and cold showers, and dunking hands and feet in buckets of ice..in winter.

I **do **feel charged and I’m sleeping pretty well too!

The biggest benefit for me has been a feeling of presence ,which keeps me mindful ,and the following sense of euphoria and warmth at the end of a cold shower.

Yes, it’s initially painful. But, totally worth it.

Want to boost your mood, improve blood circulation and reduce stress? A cold shower is a great way to start the day, making you feel almost invincible!

This is just the tip of the iceberg though. Next stop, ice baths and frozen lakes.

Embrace the cold and feel alive.

# That Kind of Person

## 

When we begin change there is hesitation, a moment where we pause and ask ourselves, is this *really *me? It’s like trying on a new jacket. You turn in front of the mirror, wondering, does this fit? Is this my style? Do these pockets fit my hands, can I wear a sweater under this, is the fabric right? New habits are like a jacket but we worry about the label we might begin wearing. Am I the *type *of person that meditates, that exercises, that writes? Like a new jacket, it’s going to be an odd fit at first. Your jacket has been squeezed in the back of a closet. It smells like the factory it was made in. It’s too stiff, too loose, too rumpled. We need to break it in.

It’s going to feel odd, like a pair of jeans. We know that overtime those jeans will start feeling great and that the best jeans are worn in. Our favorite books have well worn, dog-eared, underlined pages. Comfort takes time but there’s a period of discomfort that comes first.

Last year I did a month of the Whole30. It’s a program of eating mostly vegetables, some protein, a bit of fruit, and healthy fats. It felt weird cooking a diet that rivaled what a professional athlete or loci-vegetarian-grass-fed restaurant might serve. Why was someone like me, taking so much time to cook. Just eat something I found myself saying, it’s not that big of a deal. I to work through the oddity of cooking this way and not relent into what felt comfortable, comfort foods. It took time to learn the recipes and longer to learn the why behind them.

One bowl of chili at a time, it became easier. It made sense and I saw the results. Small at first and then larger. I was eating better, feeling better, and it didn’t even cost more. Like a jacket that survives a snowstorm and keeps you warm, I could feel the effects of this change. The change was becoming easier to shoulder, but was it really me. Was I the type of person that could do this? I realized that in wearing the jacket, I was a jacket wearer. In following a diet, I was a dieter.

This is hard to swallow for many people. [Amanda (freakin’) Palmer wrote](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455581089/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455581089&linkCode=as2&tag=miksblo09-20&linkId=F5DYX45MFIQVCKCT) about her fear of the Fraud Police. She imagined they would arrive and declare, “we are taking everything away and telling everybody.” She is one of the most celebrated performers alive, someone who [spoke at TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking?language=en) (with 6M views), and someone who posed as a statue. She was afraid that someone would come up to here and tell her that, no, you can’t do that. You can’t be that. Palmer eventually learned that yes, yes she can do that. Yes she can be that.

Once we start to act a certain way we become a certain way. You abstain, you swim, you take a moment to be grateful. Once you do these things, you are the type of person who does those things. You are now an abstainer, a swimmer, a grateful person. There is no ceremony to announce it, you just are and when you become that type of person the pendulum of perception swings the other way. When you wear a jacket, you are a jacket wearer. Your new clothes fit — and you love how they fit.

# Five Strategies To Live In The Present, Connect With People, And Enjoy The Life You’re Actually…

## Five Strategies To Live In The Present, Connect With People, And Enjoy The Life You’re Actually Living

What’s the value of living in the present? Health and happiness. Those are both good reasons.

But I usually remind people that the present is where your power is. You can’t change the past.

And you can’t change the future just by thinking about it. Being present is where all of your power is.

Plus, people who live in the present are more charismatic, i.e. people will experience you as someone with presence. The words are related for a reason.

## #1. Eliminate distractions.

Let’s start with our phones. How many badges and notifications do you really need to see? Just reminders and text messages? Do you even need to see text messages in real time?

Here’s what my notification center on my phone looks like. Only one app has notifications turned on: [Coach.me](http://coach.me) sends me goal reminders.

## #2. Don’t let fear pull you into the future

Obsessive thinking about the future is a sure way to lose track of the present. A lot of people are having this problem because of serious, high stakes issues like fear of corrupt government or fear of damage from climate change.

I talked to a psychoanalyst with a 40 years of experience and this is what he’s been telling his clients:
> “There’s a thing that helps with anxiety about the future. It’s called taking action.”

Taking action draws you into the present moment again. This is where your power is. There’s no power in worrying about the future.

## #3. Try the Savoring Strategy

The following comes from the book *Eat, Pray, Love:*
> Elizabeth Gilbert writes about a friend who, whenever she sees a beautiful place, exclaims in a near panic, “It’s so beautiful here! I want to come back here someday!” “It took all my persuasive powers to try to convince her that she is already here.”

The mental trick is to think of savoring your life as a sort of spotlight that you can move around. Do you savor some future moment when you repeat the experience? Do you savor the moment when you post a picture of the experience on Facebook? Or do you simply savor the moment you’re living in right now.

Not all moments are savor worthy — but the ones that are should be savored immediately.

## #4. Use breathing as a touchstone for the present moment

If you do breath-based mindfulness meditation, then you’ll be practiced in using your breath as a point of focus.

During a meditation, you’ll catch your mind wandering, bear witness to the thought that your mind had wandered to, and then direct your focus back to your breath.

This same process works outside of meditation. Witness whatever non-present moment your mind wandered to, bring your focus back to your breath, take a deep breath.

That deep breath is like a mental reset. You’ll have moved past your distracting thoughts and can now enjoy the present.

## #5. Say Yes.

The night after the US presidential election, a friend told me a story about meeting a monk in Tibet.

The monk had shared a one word secret to overcoming anxiety.

That word is YES.

Yes, this thing is true. Or Yes, this thing might be true.

Once you accept a thing, then you can move back to taking action.

What is pulling you out of the present and what you doing to get back?

# Want to Get Motivated? Here’s a Simple, Research-Based Hack You Can Use

## Want to Get Motivated? Here’s a Simple, Research-Based Hack You Can Use

Life, it often seems, is built on motivation.

The aspiring entrepreneur, who works evenings and weekends on her side project, so she can one day quit her 9 to five job; the budding actor who waits tables until his next audition; and the competitive basketball player who begins his practice schedule at 04:00 (Kobe Bryant) all have one thing in common: they are all *motivated.*

And, based on what we have learnt about the science of behaviour change (particularly, in [this](http://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/how-to-build-a-new-habit/) article), motivation is a prerequisite to breaking bad habits and forming good ones that stick.

Before a habit becomes automatised, however, you need to rely on motivation; without it, gym memberships aren’t used, musical instruments sell “like-new” and unfinished manuscripts collect dust in desk draws.

The problem is motivation, as we know, is unreliable. There’s an irony that’s cruel and unusual: when you need it, it’s nowhere to be seen. Gone without a trace. And when you don’t need it? No problem: it’s available at a moment’s notice.

But what if it didn’t have to be like this? What if there was a way to summon it whenever you needed it? There is, and as one recent study revealed, it’s a lot easier than you may think . . .

## The Power of Autobiographical Memory

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of New Hampshire, tested the effects of “activating an autobiographical memory” on an exercise habit in students. [1]

The researchers, Biondolilloa and Pillemera, asked 150 participants to recall a positive memory of exercise, whilst others remembered a negative memory. Others, in a controlled condition, were *not *asked to recall a memory. [2]

The study found, those who thought about a positive exercise memory, reported higher levels of motivation to exercise, and were more likely to exercise again in the future. Standard, right? But here’s where it gets interesting.

Biondolilloa and Pillemera learnt, much to their surprise, that even those who recalled a *negative *memory, exercised *more *than those under controlled conditions.

The authors explained:

Without explicit direction or encouragement, our sample of college students, amidst the innumerable distractions afforded by life at a large, public university, increased their reported exercise activities from their habitual levels. [3]

The question is, if this can be applied to exercise, can it be applied to others habits as well?

## Autobiographical Memory — Beyond Exercise

If you have even fallen into a rut, you will know how important it is to relearn good habits; those daily and even weekly routines that once kept you on the straight and narrow, but now, have fallen by the wayside.

And you will also know that by returning to eating healthily, exercising regularly and writing daily, among other good habits, you can pull yourself out of your slump and put yourself back on solid ground.

Granted, relearning how to [lean into your fear](http://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/twice-then-quit/) and familiarise yourself with behaviours that delay gratification can be painful. You have to resist temptation, nurse an aching body and overcome inner creative battles.

But it doesn’t have to be the challenge we perceive it to be. In fact, a simple reframe is often enough. If we return to the aforementioned study, is it possible, that participants who were motivated to exercise — despite recalling negative memories — did so because they were *also *reminded of how they felt *after *they exercised? Could it be *that *was what motivated them?

Given our need to return to pleasurable emotional states, it’s certainly possible.

How often have you made yourself go to the gym, kicking and screaming, only to feel grateful after you had done it? Seldom do we think about the pleasure we’ll receive from doing what we don’t want to do.

If you need to motivate yourself to study for an exam, don’t think about how boring it is. Instead, think about a *previous *exam and remember how you felt *after *you had completed it: that feeling of total freedom.

Dieting is hard, especially when reminiscing about past experiences; there’s meals you have to journal, calories you have to count and desserts you have to say no to.

But evoking memories of how you felt when you regained your ideal weight and looked in the mirror — having lost 14 pounds — can motivate you to want to return to that feeling, again and again. This could be your [Tipping Point](http://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/tipping-point/).

You don’t need to move mountains: all you need to do is run. Run for 1 mile. Run for 5 minutes. The metric is less important in the beginning, so make is small and start. If you’re still demotivated, look into yourself for the answer. Ask yourself “[Why](http://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/the-kaizen-way/)?” — Self-enquiry reveals a lot.

## A Final Word

As we’ve learnt, you don’t need to do a lot to get motivated. Whether you have a positive or a negative memory of a behaviour, it will serve you, so use it well. I guess it is true: hindsight is a beautiful thing.

# Baby or bold steps?

## Grand Canyon Rim to Rim to Rim

Do you start by baby stepping your way into exercise with five minutes at a time or do you sign up for a 10k race six months from now?

Do you start by turning off your email and checking every hour or go from constant notification to processing twice a day?

Knowing your habits and the performance and outcome goals will determine whether that step should be baby or **BOLD**.

BJ Fogg of Tiny Habits and Leo Babauta of Zen Habits are proponents of the baby steps approach. I agree with this for certain habits. They say if you want to start flossing, just start with one tooth. It’s so ridiculously easy how can you not? Well, for some people, it’s so easy that they don’t feel it is worth the time or the floss to do just one tooth. Hopefully, that means they floss all their teeth and not just opt to forego flossing.

I used to think unless I could work out for 45–60 minutes, it wasn’t worth putting on my shoes. Now that I do more high-intensity and ancestral training, I look for opportunities throughout the day. Sometimes I only do 20–30 minutes, but I make it really count.

If a client doesn’t exercise at all, I start with five minutes. Heck, I might even start with one minute a day. It all depends on where they are to start. Other clients need a **BOLD** goal like a race, in which case they need a more intense schedule where baby steps may not be enough.

I hiked the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim to Rim a few years ago. My friend and I could have taken our sweet time, camped at the bottom, stretched it out into two days as most people do, but we made bold moves and hiked across the canyon in one day and then turned around and did it again.
> # *Some habits require a leap across the canyon.*

When you are trying to change your eating habits it could entail bold or baby steps.

My baby step when I was a vegetable-minimal vegetarian (I call this a grain-a-tarian because that’s what an unhealthy vegetarian ends up being) was to start ensuring I ate one serving of vegetables *every day*. After one week, I went up to two servings. After another week, I increased to three servings. Once it hit four servings I had to try to develop the habit in 2–3 weeks because it was much harder. Now, it’s regular for me to eat 6–9 servings in a day. Yesterday I had one serving of grains, stone ground grits in the morning, and eight servings of veggies. This is my new normal.

However, when I wanted to stop eating gluten after being diagnosed with Hashimoto’s Disease, I needed to take a **GIANT LEAP** and stop cold turkey. I started with an elimination diet which was super-hard for about a week. I was grumpy and tired and felt like I was going to go crazy. Then it became easier until it was my new normal. I slowly added some things back in but my sugar cravings went away (rarely have them now) and I cut way back on grains to pretty much 1–2 servings a day. I am now more plant-based than I was when I identified as being a vegetarian! This took a giant leap and bold steps. It hurt in the beginning, but not for very long.

When you are considering a habit change that you want to implement, determine the performance goal and outcome goal and how you will get there. If bold steps didn’t work before, try baby steps. If baby steps got you nowhere, go bold.

*What is something that you want to change? Are you going to take a bold step or start small?*

# A Distortion Of Communication

## We’re not meant to have a window into everyone else’s lives all the time.

It’s **exhausting. **Communicating, I mean.

After spending (wasting) a lot of time questioning the mysterious motives of the internet and its strange social agenda, I’ve now resigned myself to a few things.

For one, I find it vaguely disheartening that even if we are speaking to someone right in front of us, most people find their mind wandering. To the next conversation, the unanswered emails, the inconsequential blog post we haven’t yet written, the next Skype call, not to mention the various streams of social noise that are constantly, unapologetically updating; we seem to welcome drowning in this never-ending tidal wave of information.

We are often so saturated in the fleeting, fractional moments; so harshly aware of the instantaneous and transparent world that is life right now, and we tend to forget that life can actually exist outside of our screens.
> # Believe me, when you log out (of a million and one different apps) and shut down, life doesn’t just get good. It’s enthralling.

The next problem I’ve ended up with (and do actually plan to resolve) is also a result of the unnavigable, daunting social maze. It’s do with the flesh-and-blood people who feature in my world; not the people whose names I don’t actually know, rather the ones that I trust not only to untangle me, but also with my life.

It goes something like this.

These are the people who I know will be around for a long time, most likely forever. Because there are now so many ways to talk to them, endless ways to start a conversation and even more ways to finish one, I no longer know where to begin; no channel or portal or platform seems good enough to convey what I’m trying to say to an adequate degree. Given the choice, most of the time I’d rather say nothing than try to condense and confuse whatever it is that I’m trying to communicate.

**I just don’t believe that any number of messages, sent in haste and displayed on a glaring screen, can replace the spoken word when it comes to saying anything of importance.**
> # And we are cowards.

We can easily type words that we would never dream of saying aloud, because having such a convincing barrier between two people means not only that we’re safely distanced from the consequences of our pixelated messages, but that the words never actually leave our tongues. So in a way, they remain unsaid.

Currently, the closest thing I can get to resolving this oh-so-terrible dilemma is to seriously consider going back to pen and paper when declaring feelings or explaining ideas that deserve far more than 140 characters.

And I have one last bone to pick, one that is actually more of a written translation of my overwhelmed and unbelieving face.

**Every man and his dog seems to have an online profile of some description somewhere, which isn’t so much of a problem as it is straight up incredible.**

When it comes to communication things have changed drastically, and in my opinion, far too fast. I highly doubt that anybody reading this could recall the time when every single phone call had to be manually connected, even though relatively speaking it was only a handful of years ago.
> # We are sacrificing conversation for connection.

They are definitely not one and the same. And really, that is what bothers me. If we are outrunning evolution in some ways we are certainly failing spectacularly elsewhere, and perhaps communication is one of those places; it’s so much easier to open a new tab than it is to speak to a stranger.

**The internet has become painfully necessary and the ease with which we can connect to absolutely anybody is astonishing, but I’d still rather ask you how your day went in person.**

# Why We Were the First Publication to Move to 100% Medium Members

## Why We Were the First Publication to Move to 100% Medium Members

### Our goal is to publish the world’s most **trustworthy** writing on human potential and self-improvement.

At the start of the year, we moved 100% of the [Better Humans](http://betterhumans.coach.me/) publishing efforts into [Medium’s Member program](https://medium.com/membership). I’ll give some context and then explain the details of Membership below.

This giant switch to Membership, along with a few smaller steps, are intended to add **trust** to the world of human potential and self-improvement.

In our field, the payoff for doing good work is huge. Literally, any successful professional in this field has changed another person’s life.

Unfortunately, there’s also a dark side to self-improvement that preys on people’s hope. The result is that many of you are suspicious that you’re being hoodwinked. I think of all of these suspicious people as a giant missed opportunity. Within that group are thousands and thousands of people whose lives could have been changed if our industry had held itself to a higher standard.

With that in mind, we’ve made a few changes — all with the goal of making Better Humans the most **trustworthy** publication in our field.

![](1*ZJjJRq6v4VF84haWVTW42A.png)

## The Article is the Product

*(I believe) there is an underlying mission behind Medium’s Membership: to kill content marketing.*

The status quo of free articles on the web is that they were probably produced to sell you something. The industry phrase for these articles is ‘content marketing’ and the intent is to either put advertisements in front of your face, or to tempt you to click forward into a sales funnel.

Have you ever been reading an article and had a popup offer to get a free e-book if you sign up for a newsletter? The article in that scenario is content marketing. The e-book is referred to as a lead magnet. The newsletter is most often a ‘drip marketing’ campaign, filled with emails leading up to a sales pitch. In this example, you aren’t a reader; you’re a sales lead.

Even the most well-intentioned authors are corrupted by this world. They’re tweaking their writing to appeal to Google’s search algorithms, editing their headlines to generate viral click bait, changing their endings in order to generate a call-to-action payoff.

The biggest change we’ve made is to fully embrace Medium’s Membership model so that we can abandon the world of content marketing altogether.

In the previous world, we were tempted by these corrupting influences. Our authors were mostly coming from a place of deep expertise. More than half of them are business, behavioral or skill coaches, and they’re sharing real lessons they learned from working with clients. They aren’t scammers.

However —

We used to allow our authors to include little ads at the bottom of their articles. We weren’t paying them, so it only seemed fair that these authors have some way to keep their business going.

That need for you to click onward always created a split loyalty. Were our authors writing an article as a perfectly crafted end product for you to read? Our were they writing a lead-with-value sales pitch that was meant to leave you hungry for their paid product?

Medium’s Membership gave us a way out.

Now, we’re writing for paying readers — and that’s our only goal. Our articles *are* the product you paid to read. There’s nothing more to sell you.

To be specific about two elements of the Medium Membership:

1. You can read a few Medium Membership articles for free every month. After that, you have to pay a $5/month subscription. Lots of publications are doing this now; for example, this is how the website for the New York Times operates. The industry term is *Metered Paywall*.

1. The type of content marketing I described above is banned in the Medium Membership program. Authors can’t sell, write sponsored content, or even beg you to sign up for their email newsletter. I’m fully in support of these rules.

These two changes, which originate with Medium’s Membership program, rip out the marketing side of content. Now you can **trust** that the article you read is 100% the end product.

![](1*ZJjJRq6v4VF84haWVTW42A.png)

## All Articles Have to Work

We’re not a motivational site. We don’t operate on headlines that excite you, followed by content that confuses you.

We never want to give you advice that you can’t follow and that doesn’t have an *honest chance* of working. I’m going to circle around to a practical definition of *honest chance* in a second.

But first I want to explain how insane the world of personal development writing is.

In the status-quo publishing world, writers get paid for virality and/or upsells.

In the case of virality, the article has to just look appealing. No reader is going to have time to test the advice before the article gets shared all over the internet. That’s how you get obviously untested articles, like “*Ben Franklin’s Top Five Productivity Tips.*” Here’s the reality check: the author never observed Ben Franklin. And if they’re just basing their post on notes Franklin left behind, then the skeptical reader should look for signs that the author at least tested the advice on themselves.

In the case of upsells, there’s no need for the author to provide complete advice. They are incentivized to stop short and have you click through to their paid product.

We want a reader to know that the article they’re reading is a self-contained vehicle for change. That means the advice is complete, tested, and known to work.

To reach these new goals, we are strict about publishing only authors who demonstrate the source of their expertise. We’ve banned third-hand “book reports” about what famous people supposedly did. Instead, most of our authors are coaches who are giving advice that they’ve tested with dozens of their clients. A few authors are academics. A few more are aggressive personal experimenters. All are being upfront about how they tested their advice.

Additionally, we require that all articles contain complete tutorials. You need to be able to follow the steps in the article — otherwise, all we’ve achieved is to get you excited about a destination without any means to get there.

As part of the switch, we did a huge revision of our [style guide](https://betterhumans.coach.me/draft-style-guide-for-personal-development-articles-6f641023347f) to help our authors to write a better article. Two specific style guide sections, ‘Demonstrated Expertise’ and ‘Empathic Tutorials’, give our authors a standard for writing articles that work.

This change is a matter of **trust**. As a reader, you should **trust** that the article you are reading could change your life.

![](1*ZJjJRq6v4VF84haWVTW42A.png)

## Embrace Transparency

There’s one last place that a savvy reader should be watching, and that is about the biases of the editors here.

I know that we bring many of our own biases to the process of selecting articles and guiding authors. I’ll list the ones I know about right here. If you spot any others, you can respond (unlike many people, we actually [enjoy spotting new biases](https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18)).

Here you go — our biases and beliefs:

* The success rate of any human potential advice is low, and that’s okay. Our rule of thumb is to expect a 10% success rate if you start the advice and 75% if you finish (most people won’t bother to finish). Most people will have to try multiple approaches, and so we are biased toward providing many options. [More here](https://betterhumans.coach.me/why-picking-yourself-back-up-is-the-1-self-improvement-strategy-fe287eb283b1).

* Good coaching is better than books or classes. In our view, you can read a self-improvement book like a work of fiction. You read and fantasize about who you might become, without ever actually changing. However, a coach is going to quickly become annoying if you aren’t serious about making a change. In our view, coaches are better because they are 100% focused on real change. You’ll see that bias in our selection of authors and in the stories that we tell.

* Although we tend to be science minded, we are also very aware that change requires emotional commitment. We’re biased toward tweaking articles to be more emotionally effective. The most regular tweak is that we try to frame articles positively to achieve a future goal, rather than fix a current failing. Is this manipulative? Yes. Is it manipulative for your own benefit? Yes — that’s what we’re aiming for.

If you want to discuss other potential biases, I’m happy to get into them with you in the responses.

![](1*ZJjJRq6v4VF84haWVTW42A.png)

## The Pendulum of Trust

Mostly, I’m writing this announcement for the community of productivity, self-improvement, and exercise nuts who are our core audience.

However, I’m also hopeful that some other journalists, authors and publishers will read it and find some inspiration.

The culture that Medium is trying to build here represents the pendulum of **trust** on the Internet swinging back to side of good. With that in mind, I’ve tried to write about our story, our thought process, and our results.

One obvious-in-retrospect benefit is that this style of writing is more fun. If our authors wanted to write content marketing, they would have chosen careers as marketers. But they chose to be coaches, academics, or passionate hobbyists. This style of writing lets them just be themselves — and that’s a lot more fun.

# 20 Ways To Organise Your Life With Evernote

## 

I have started using Evernote back in 2008, after reading about it in a Tim Ferriss blog post.

It didn’t seem to me at the time that It would be such an integral part of my life.

Evernote is such a versatile tool that can be used for just about anything. Below is a list of *20 ways to organise your life with Evernote*. If you are wondering what can I use Evernote for, read on.

If you haven’t used Evernote before the fastest way to learn is from Brett Kelly’s amazing e-book,

[*Evernote Essentials](http://www.lifemasterycoach.co/evernote-essentials/)*

1. **Store Important Documents. **It is those rare times that you need to find a copy of your passport, a bank statement, an electricity bill or some other document and you find yourself thinking of the last time you did a photocopy. If you can relate to that, you will certainly find that Evernote can cater for that. The premium version can also do [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) search and find data within photos. Awesome.

1. **Create a Reference File Stack. **Over the years, I have been collecting information from websites and blogs that I refer back when required. In Evernote, it is really easy to create a stack of notebooks. I have created a stack called ***Reference*** and that includes useful articles and blog posts as well as documents.

1. **Store Your Receipts. **One of the ways I keep track of my spending is through storing receipts in an Evernote notebook. Though I am currently using [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com/) for budgeting, I have found it difficult to keep track of the random purchases. To that effect, I have started using an app called [Scanner Pro ](http://www.lifemasterycoach.co/scanner/)for scanning receipts and photos of my groceries.

1. **Store Your Paychecks. **If you are receiving payslips still in paper format, you can’t find a better place for storing these than Evernote. Especially, if you need to make copies now and then for tax returns or as proof of employment. If you receive email or PDF versions, it is even easier as you can have a Notebook called Paychecks just for these.

1. **Create an Idea Notebook. **After reading James Altucher’s, “[The Idea Machine](http://www.lifemasterycoach.co/idea-machine)”, I have created a notebook called *Idea Machine. *This is where I store my daily ideas as prompted by the book. I am always looking forward to the days I get to have Idea Sex. Great book. You should really try if you want to make your brain sweat.

1. **Goals and Weekly Reviews. **As part of my [100 Day Challenge](http://www.lifemasterycoach.co/100-day-challenge)**, **I have created a notebook called *“!MasterPlan-Year”* and this includes my goals for the year, broken down into 100 Day Challenges and Weekly After Action Reviews.

1. **Kids Drawings.** It would be nice to be able to show my son what an artist I was at his age. Anyhow, It was awesome when I thought about keeping a digital record of drawings as he grows up.

1. **Run an Evernote Powered Blog.** Around 2013, there was a point when services were spawning up, that would allow you to create a blog right from your Evernote account. Having tried a few of these, the best one, that is still around is “[Postach.io](http://postach.io/site/)”**.**Postach.io is by far the easiest, fastest and best service out there. You can have a beautiful blog up in minutes.

1. **Use Evernote for school. **While studying for my Strategic Intervention Coaching with the Robbins-Madanes Training program, I have found it really useful to collect all my assignments and notes in one notebook, shorting everything out with tags.

1. **Integrate With Zapier Tasks. **If you want to get data into a notebook or a note from just about anywhere else, [Zapier](http://www.zapier.com/) will make the connection.

1. **Quickly add anything from anywhere.** One of the appealing aspects of Evernote is the fact that you can add content from just about anywhere. I mainly use the Chrome plugin and then the iPhone app, which can clip websites and anything you come across online.

1. **Share Notebooks.** It is easy and straightforward to share a notebook with family or friends and work remotely together.

1. **Lead Capturing. **One of the ways I’ve used Evernote was is conjunction with [Ninja Forms](https://ninjaforms.com/). Evernote assigns you with an email address that you can use to email information to your default notebook. You can find your Evernote email address under Account Info within Evernote. So once a form was filled in and completed on my website, it would send an email into Evernote with the contents of the form.

1. **Brainstorming and Task Automation.** My favourite use has been for brainstorming and deciding on tasks I’ll focusing on for the coming week. This is achievable through [TaskClone](http://www.taskclone.com/). TaskClone will read your Evernote Notebooks and find notes tagged with a predefined tag. It finds lines that contain tick boxes and converts them into Tasks that can be synced with your favourite To-Do app. I use [Todoist](http://todoist.com/) as it is minimal and super-versatile.

1. **GTD ( Getting Things Done) Implementation.** Another amazing use is for implementing GTD. This is a productivity methodology developed by [David Allen](http://gettingthingsdone.com/). An easy to follow implementation was done by [The Secret Weapon](http://www.thesecretweapon.org/), integrating Evernote and Outlook.

1. **Book List.** A great place to store your reading list. A useful article on how to build a book list with Evernote and [Workflow](https://workflow.is/) from Brett Kelly can be found [here](https://brettkelly.org/evernote-workflow-ios-book-list/).

1. **Clip Webpages.** I’ve found it super useful, that I can clip the whole web page and can refer to it, even if the website doesn’t exist anymore.

1. **Speaking Projects.** While preparing my speeches for [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/) and other speaking engagements, I have found it really useful to organize my notes and research.

1. **Organise Your Vacation.** Anything from checklists, to itineraries, ticket copies you can have them stored in a vacation notebook.

1. **Setup Your Business Repositories. [**Evernote](http://www.lifemasterycoach.co/evernote) provides a Business version that allows a company to create shared notebooks that are visible by everyone within the company. This is useful for setting up a knowledge base and stop emailing documents back and forth.

These are just some of the uses of Evernote I have implemented over the years and have found them invaluable. You can come up with your own and make it work for your lifestyle and work.

## Security Tip

One tip I would add is around security. Since there is so much personal information being stored in Evernote, it is advisable to set up two-factor authentication. This is essentially an additional layer of security that requires you to enter a changing passcode every time you login. You can read more about it [here](https://evernote.com/security/). Highly recommended.

# A Plug & Play Life&#58; How To Access Your Data From Anywhere

## A Plug & Play Life: How To Access Your Data From Anywhere

In Germany, there’s this running joke. If someone comes up to you holding a phone with a smashed screen — which looks like a web — you can make a smug face and ask: *“Did you download the Spider-Man app?”*

While a lot of screen-broken phones still work after their near-fatal fracture, some don’t, and the survivors won’t last long. Yet, people hang on to them, partly because repair and replacement costs suck, but mostly, because moving their life to a new device is a painful process. That’s right. *Life*.

Most of your identity is digital. Photos, videos, music, wallet, voice messages, chat history, social activity, it’s all on your phone and laptop. Same goes for your work. Whether you’re on one device as a freelancer or spread across multiple PCs in the office and at home, chances are you could get little done offline. Even a huge chunk of your leisure time takes place in 1s and 0s.

That’s mostly a good thing. It saves time, space, and energy to access most of what you need through one or two devices. What’s not so great is that it makes those devices so-called single points of failure.

![[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic)](1*_kdbTZBl-OU-X5p_47XeDg.png)*[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic)*

## Why The Titanic Sank

In the night of the 14th of April 1912, the RMS Titanic sank after crashing into an iceberg, taking over 1,500 poor souls with it into its ice-cold, dark grave. The list of potential reasons for the ‘unsinkable’ ship’s demise is long and being debated until this day:

* The captain ignored seven iceberg warnings to maintain speed.

* The watertight compartments weren’t big enough.

* Low-quality iron rivets were used in the ship’s bow and stern.

* No emergency training had taken place, which is why launching the lifeboats took too long.

* The number of lifeboats was 20, whereas 60 would’ve been required to save all passengers.

* Fire-damaged metal was used for part of the ship’s hull.

* All binoculars were locked in a special cabinet and the guy with the key to it wasn’t on board.

The list goes on and on. In IT systems, all of these would be called [single points of failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure): an element of a system that, if it fails, shuts down the entire operation. The more of those you have, the less reliable the system becomes. In case of the Titanic, all of the above could have lead to a disaster on their own, but combined, the voyage was stretching its luck from the start.

Going back to our digital lives, the devices that contain them are also single points of failure. You’ve either lived it or know someone who has: a phone was lost, a laptop died, and lots of invaluable data was lost. This is a risk most of us are exposed to out of laziness.

If it’d take you more than two days to recover from a broken phone or dead laptop, you’re not protecting the biggest asset in your life: your data.

Luckily, you only need one app to fix it.

## Living On Cloud 9

In 2012, a friend told me how she prepared for every traveler’s worst nightmare: losing their passport. *“I just keep a scan of it in my Dropbox. Worst case, I can go to the embassy and have a new one made in whatever country I’m in.” *Until then, I had only used everyone’s favorite cloud storage app to store college materials, but suddenly, the gears clicked into place.

Going through the contents of my laptop, I realized I could store not just parts, but *all* of my digital life in this app and access it from anywhere.

For over five years now, I’ve lived a plug-and-play life. I’m never worried about traveling, I can work from anywhere, my digital file cabinet is clean, and I’m okay with leaving my laptop in trustworthy places unattended.

Here’s how you can do the same.

## Getting Started

First, you need to set up [a free Dropbox account](https://www.dropbox.com/register), which gets you 2 GB of space, indefinitely. You can [earn more free space](https://www.dropbox.com/help/space/get-more-space) by completing a variety of tasks or [pay $100/year for 1 TB](http://dropbox.com/plus). A good alternative is [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com), which comes with 15 GB free.

Second, download the app on your [desktop](https://www.dropbox.com/downloading) and [phone](https://www.dropbox.com/install). You’ll get a separate folder on your desktop, which you can fill and structure as you wish, and then access from the app or any web browser on any PC, worldwide.

Here’s the structure I use, which contains four folders in three categories.

![](1*A-4bDp9FOW44SUEx3LUlBw.png)

Let’s walk through it step-by-step.

## 1. Most Important Documents

The folder named ‘Backup’ contains all of my correspondence, mostly Word and Excel documents, but also scans of essential documents, like:

* Templates for cover letters, cancellations, and my CV.

* My lease, pictures, and data of the apartment I live in.

* Scans of my ID, passport, driver’s license, vaccination record, etc.

* A sub-folder for tables with my expenses and private bills, for example for gifts.

* Applications to colleges, jobs, internships, with full documentation.

* My tax report.

* Certificates, like my college diploma, employer recommendations, language test results, and so on.

The goal of this folder is to be able to walk into any copy shop on the planet and print an important document, should I need it and not have access to it. Or to buy a new phone, download the app, and show it to any government official or airport personnel that might require it.

Next, there’s work.

## 2. Work Essentials

Over 30% of Americans are freelancers already and by 2020, it will be [close to half](http://http-download.intuit.com/http.intuit/CMO/intuit/futureofsmallbusiness/intuit_2020_report.pdf). A big chunk of freelancing happens remotely, so if you are one, setting up shop has never been easier. My ‘Projects’ folder is split into three kinds of income:

1. **Ordinary Income**: Whenever I trade my time for money, the documents go here. Coaching methods, media and call recordings, documents from translation gigs, the content and texts from my website for that service, and, of course, bills.

1. **Portfolio Income**: These are mostly reports and PDFs I read in hopes of making smarter investment decisions.

1. **Passive Income**: Each website I own gets a folder and then sub-folders for media, pages, posts, products etc. I also keep a backup of my email list.

Depending on what kind of freelance work you do, you might require a lot more space, for example because you design graphics or render videos a lot. In that case, Dropbox Plus or another paid option might be well worth the money.

If you’re *not* a freelancer and have no side hustle, then you needn’t worry because work stays at the office, but can always suggest an internal cloud backup solution there.

The second work folder I have is the ‘TUM-BWL…’ one, which contains all materials I need for school. This way, no matter where I am or what I want to work on, as long as I have access to a PC with internet, I’m good to go.

But I can also just chill.

## 3. Luxuries

For most of us, fun is the biggest item on our digital shelf already. Sure, we text and write emails, but the major space-hoarders are songs, videos, pics, funny games and entertainment apps.

While you can access most of that stuff online right at the source — Youtube, podcasts, blogs, Spotify, etc. — having a small percentage of it as an on-demand backup makes your life a little lighter, especially in those situations where you really need your supply chain in the cloud.

For me, it’s ebooks. That’s why I have a whole folder dedicated to PDFs of my favorite blog posts, books, and favorite downloaded content. It’s only a tiny selection, but wherever I am, I can always read something that makes me feel like home.

Whether you want to save a few hilarious clips, your favorite music videos, inspiring interviews, a few good novels or a classic photo album, make sure you pack a few emotions for your life on cloud 9.

![Photo by [Soragrit Wongsa](https://unsplash.com/photos/aV5xrpB0bwQ?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/memory?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*NdiFOoxRLHn2sNOSGupH0Q.jpeg)*Photo by [Soragrit Wongsa](https://unsplash.com/photos/aV5xrpB0bwQ?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/memory?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

## Optional: Memories

Depending on whether you choose a free or paid solution, you might have little space left or lots to spare. In either case, you could fill it with memories. What used to be basements full of photo albums are now hard drives and iCloud, but that doesn’t make our treasured memories less worth protecting.

I have my latest 1,000 photos synced to iCloud, do regular backups to an external hard drive with [Time Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)) and have a full, growing backup on [CrashPlan](https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/).

On any free plan, it’ll be hard to store all your digital creations, so you might want to back them up elsewhere and select your most important ones to keep in Dropbox. If you’re paying, you can store them all in one place.

## Easy Living

8.23 GB. That’s how much it takes to store my life in a lock box I can open on a trip through California, in the urban jungle of Sydney, or right at home on my couch. Besides the real thing, there are the offline files on my laptop and their copies in the cloud. No single points of failure.

How much more comfortable would you be if your laptop broke down with a solution like this? How less paranoid about dropping your phone? All it takes to protect what defines you is a little redundancy.

But you have to create it today. Not when the iceberg hits.

One of the files I keep up there is a long list of quotes, which includes one from a man who must’ve been a pioneer of the plug-and-play life:

# LA&#58; A Mother/Daughter Story

## I was the visitor. She, the guide.

Headed cross-country, I peer out the window. The plane bounces, lofts high above Vegas, where I’d taken her and G’ma to celebrate her twenty-first. Now, two years later, I’m on my way to L.A. to visit my daughter’s new home, anxious to see how she’s doing, if I’ll like her new boyfriend. She’d booked the hotel, planned the itinerary, recommended the restaurants we’d try. I, the visitor. She, the guide. A role reversal I looked forward to playing.

LAX. 2:30 p.m. I cab it to the Palihotel on Melrose in West Hollywood, my daughter’s new neighborhood, a few blocks from her apartment. It looks cool, she’d said. She wants me to stay there. I’m game. The cabbie drops me at a long, lean two-story building, lit with thick marine glass lamps with emerald green bulbs, wrapped in dark brown clapboards, organic like a tree. Neat pots of pigment-saturated geraniums line the windows. “Palihotel” in movie marquee bulbs, a porch, a patio invite me in. A gent in a piping-trimmed, navy blue blazer monogrammed with a *P. *greets me with charm, makes me feel at home. A couple of high profile travel magazines had recently mentioned the Palihotel as one of the best new hotels in the country. I expect some pretension, but receive warmth, friendliness.

Isabel wants to have dinner that night at The Hart and the Hunter, the hotel’s popular restaurant and local hangout, but they don’t take reservations. I inquire. We’d be put at the head of the line as hotel guests, the charming front desk gent says. Lovely.

I retire to my first floor room, far from Melrose. A bank of windows above a half-wall of glass blocks faces the hotel’s courtyard. Twin beds. My daughter planned to stay. Yippee. I flick on the antique desk lamp with a white porcelain base, a toggle switch. The clear orange bulb, a gizmo, illuminates the cozy forest green room, envelopes me with warmth. I turn down the neatly tucked wool blanket on one of the twin beds like at summer camp. I nap like a camper, wait for my daughter to get off work.

A knock on the door. Dressed for dinner in a lime green shift, a scarf, navy patent pumps, I jump up, rush to the door. Five months since Christmas — I’m so happy to see her, I squeeze the life out of her. “Mam!” she squeals. Leggings, a cute top, flats, her bag — a graduation present — slung over her shoulder. I see the layers: high school, college, young working woman.

The Hart and the Hunter welcomes us, crowded but lively, with a kitschy 1940’s style vibe: hexagonal white and sea green tiles, vintage floral linens, antique sconces, quirky paintings. To start we order the homemade biscuits that come with Southern condiments: pimento cheese, honey butter, blackberry compote. We smile, smack our lips, so happy with the food, with each other. The kale salad is loaded with apples, dates, pecans, sheep’s cheese. Yum. We slurp barbequed oysters, greedy for more.

Elated my only child launched herself in the world, even if it’s a world away from Boston, I listen to her describe her new agency job representing screenwriters and directors, her new life. She thinks I’ll like her new boyfriend. I’m eager to meet him, for him to allay my fears. Is he good enough for her? Good to her? Hard working?

We tuck into the homey room, watch TV, yak, fall asleep. Next morning we breakfast outside on the porch — home-made granola and bread from The Hart and the Hunter. A food truck called “The Egg Slut” idles by the porch, ready to serve the hot stuff.

I drive Isabel to work for a half-day Friday. Memorial Day weekend! She suggests I spend the morning exploring the Farmers’ Market at 3rd and Fairfax ‘til she’s done. I wander around, enchanted at the bounty, the kiosks of mom and pop restaurants, not a chain establishment in sight. I ponder my second breakfast, a mid-morning snack, scout the place for the perfect thing. Bingo. Bob’s Coffee & Doughnuts. I buy my treat, sit at one of the old-fashioned ice cream parlor-style tables under the canopy of trees that shelter the market. I cup the warm caramel-colored doughnut in my hand. I sniff its homemade aroma. I bite – crunch into the pillowy, yeasty center. An Indian mom and grandmother instruct two young boys to sit still, to wait for their doughnuts. I spy, fascinated by their attention to the details of proper behavior. The boys can’t help it. They squirm, wiggle with excitement. The father delivers a box from Bob’s, a stack of coffees. Restrained delirium.

I pick Isabel up at one. Work done! We explore The Grove, the outdoor mall next to the Farmers’ Market. A lush garden, a gurgling geyser of a fountain, a bridge, copper statues of children sucking oranges, doing a jig with joy. Yesteryear’s orange grove recreated. The shopping is strictly chain store, but seems tons better in the delightful setting. I buy her a bunch of stuff at *fresh. *“I love products, Mam!” We dine outside, order cocktails, watch for celebrities. Amused, we spot an old guy escorting a Playboy bunny, we assume. Ah, L.A.

The next morning we drive to Silver Lake for brunch at LAMILL Coffee, a spot my daughter says she and her friends love. “Mom, there’s a lot of hipsters, but the food’s great.” I want to try the food, see the hipsters. I enjoy discovering what life’s like these days for the young. LAMILL: all the world’s a stage. A chandelier, turquoise lounge chairs, Victorian paintings, sleek white countertops. The kids mill around, eat, laugh, living their lives, eating homemade doughnuts dipped in a vanilla cream, sipping organic coffees. All seems well.

After brunch we hit the ArcLight Hollywood to see “Frances Ha,” a film about a young woman launching herself in the world. Frances is so inept I have to look away from the screen, down at the light strip in the aisle. (Mam, what’s wrong?) In the end Frances endears, endures. But I don’t recommend this film for my generation. Too painful to watch the trials of being young, the trials of your younger self.

We’ve killed enough time. Finally. Time to meet her boyfriend at The Mercantile Wine Bar on Sunset. We order a selection of California cheeses: Red Hawk and Mt. Tam from the Cowgirl Creamery, Humbolt Fog from the Cypress Grove Creamery. Pinot Noirs. The woody restaurant with its bentwood bar stools and seating, a throw-back to the sixties. A blast from the past. Like we’re groovin’ in the Cali sun, like the Beach Boys might walk in. Her boyfriend’s vibe: happy, friendly, polite, interested in asking me questions. I’m diggin’ it.

I don’t remember as much from the bittersweet last day of my visit. I’m sad to be leaving. Sad my daughter lives so far away. We visit one last place for a treat. Aptly named Simplethings. They specialize in sandwiches made from meats roasted in-house, salads, pies, adorable mini pies for one, so many kinds. We order sandwiches, thinking of the pies. We visit the bakery case, pick out two minis apiece. They box ‘em up to go.

Back at the Palihotel, we’re excited to watch the HBO special about Liberace, “Behind the Candelabara,” starring Michael Douglas as Liberace and Matt Damon as his lover. We open the box of petite pies. Key Lime. Chocolate Peanut Butter. A perfect night. I try not to notice I have to leave first thing in the morning. Back to Boston.

# The Scantily Clad Elephant in the Room

## The Scantily Clad Elephant in the Room

There’s that little secret some people have that we’re afraid to openly admit to anyone else, even those closest to us. We sneak it when no one’s looking, while we’re waiting some where, in the bathroom, maybe at work, but especially late at night. With a computer in most homes and offices, access to smartphones and tablets, it seems the problem has only gotten worse and it affects kids up through retirees, female and male.

***Porn Addiction***

![](1*1bZaG84mOD5wos_Etjbzyg.jpeg)

It starts with a slight urge, a distraction, a way to alleviate boredom, but when we’re alone, it becomes a rabbit hole of what we can find, especially with it just a few key strokes away. Once upon a time, before the advent of the internet, you had to find someplace to get your hands on an adult magazine or watch an R rated movie for a 2 second glimpse of what can easily be found in copious numbers of extremely explicit clips ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. And all for free, well, for the cost of an internet connection.

What starts as a quick look can turn into hours of lost time; time you could have been catching up on personal projects, spending time with friends or family, sleeping. To those of us who become enthralled by this, it seems like only a short amount of time has passed, until we look at a clock, where some part of our psyche desperately tries to pull us back as we realize the quick look started 5 hours ago. We’ll run late for appointments and the like, or find ourselves transfixed in the middle of the night, even though we have to technically be up and get ready for work in 2 hours.

It doesn’t always lead to watching extreme content, but more often than not, it leads to watching an extreme *amount* of content.

I’ve personally fought with this addiction since I was 7. That may seem a little far fetched to people, but that was the age I discovered my step-father’s extensive porn collection of magazines and videos. Getting my first computer and internet led to the discovery of Usenet groups and access to all sorts of pictures. In my 20's I found my way to phone chat lines that only charged long distance fees and then on to various internet websites. Over the years, the ability to access so much visual stimulation has expanded exponentially. When I was in my teens and earlier, I didn’t see it as a problem, it gave me a thrill on many levels. Once I was in my 20's I realized that I was out of control, but I didn’t know where to turn. How do you bring something like this up in conversation with anyone. Would they understand? Would they look at you like a deer in headlights? Would they be disgusted by you? It’s the latter of those questions that plagued me the most, because I was disgusted with myself. I willingly gave up my self control for my addiction, which didn’t hurt anyone but me. I was disgusted at the time loss, wantonly seeking out stimuli even as I wanted to stop, and the little death that comes with masturbation, even as the build up feels so good.

Before you get any (more) preconceived notions about me, know this: I don’t live in my mother’s basement, I have a good job, a family, I’m social, I have healthy hobbies, I work hard in everything I do and nothing about me screams porn addict.

![](1*GCibksZJqT1Q0oRicn50xA.jpeg)

99.9% of the people who secretly deal with this don’t stick out like a *Where’s Waldo* illustration. Much like *Fight Club *we’re your parents, your kids, your best friends, your significant other, your boss, coworker and employee, movie star, politician, your average Jane and John Doe, rich and poor.
> # “We’re the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner. We make your bed. We guard you while you’re asleep. We drive the ambulances. We direct your call. We are cooks and taxi drivers…”
> # ― [Chuck Palahniuk](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2546.Chuck_Palahniuk), [*Fight Club](http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/68729)*

It took me years of struggling with this and trying to find a way to stop. It took years of finding an island within myself to abstain for a day or two, sometimes a few weeks before slipping. It’s taken years to admit various levels of this to my wife and to myself. I was, and still am, ashamed of it.

It wasn’t until [Tim Ferriss, author for the 4 Hour series (Work/Body/Chef), did a challenge](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/30/nobnom-no-booze-no-masturbating/) via a site called [Coach.Me](https://www.coach.me/) (then known as Lift), called NOBNOM (No Booze, No Masturbation). The challenge was to sign up and be accountable for 30 days to abstain from alcohol and masturbation, and by extension of the latter, porn. It was there in that challenge that I found a community of people who were struggling with the same problem, and this gave me hope….no, it gave me strength. For years I knew I couldn’t be alone, but this was the first time I really saw that I wasn’t alone, I could read and share that battle with others without showing my face in public for it. In those 30 days, I only slipped once, and I found it easier to abstain. I found more energy to pursue the things I enjoyed, to be more present with friends and family. I found the next 30 days even easier, as I decided to keep going. Then another 30 days and another; I found that what used to be an almost daily habit was now a rarity.

By redirecting that energy, by denying that urge and finding creative ways to cut myself off from that access, I found a freedom I didn’t know I had. I hide my phone from myself by putting it in hard to get to places and doing the same with the power cord to my computer. I threw my energy into things I wanted to learn and into exercise. I started meditating more, doing yoga. I read what others wrote in the NOBNOM challenge and other places, finding strength in what I read. I threw that energy back into my relationship with my wife. I decided to finally choose myself and hold on for dear life. I still struggle with it from time to time, but I’m stronger for it.

If putting this out there brings some understanding to those who know someone affected by this or helps even one person find their way back from late night binges, then it’s worth every moment of struggle I’ve dealt with.

If you have other suggestions on ways to avoid this addiction or want to share your story, please do so in the comments.

# How to Get More Creativity From Your Morning Pages Practice

## How to Get More Creativity From Your Morning Pages Practice

### An Ode to the Greatest Podcast Episode of All Time

The most powerful productivity hack I’ve ever used came from [episode #2](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/04/22/tim-ferriss-podcast/) of [Tim Ferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss)’ podcast.

Tim is up to episode episode #181 now, but for my money, episode #2 is still the gold standard.

His guest, Josh Waitzkin, is the author of [The Art of Learning](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000QCQ970/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1#nav-subnav). He’s also the subject of the chess prodigy story, [Searching for Bobby Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searching_for_Bobby_Fischer).

Mid way through the podcast, Josh gives a recipe for the practice of morning journaling that involves priming your brain the night before.

Lots of people are already huge fans of writing first thing in the morning.

The most popular version of this habit comes from Julia Cameron’s book, [The Artist’s Way](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006H19H3M/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1#nav-subnav). Every morning you write a stream of consciousness set of “Morning Pages” and that writing leads to:

* Clarity — the jumble of thoughts in your head get articulated and captured. That leaves your mind calm and clear.

* Reduced anxiety — again, any fears and anxieties get named and captured so that you can deal with them rationally. No more tension sitting just below the surface of your conscious mind.

* Ideas and epiphanies — your mind has been working all night. Sometimes you’ll discover new connections or brilliant ideas.

My friend [Buster Benson](https://twitter.com/buster) knows a thing or two about free writing. He’s the founder of a free-writing tool and community, [750words](https://betterhumans.coach.me/better-than-meditation-12532d29f6cd#.vh5r7vhep).

Buster makes the case that free form journaling like the Morning Pages practice is even [better than meditation](https://betterhumans.coach.me/better-than-meditation-12532d29f6cd#.vh5r7vhep). The practice has all of the calming and awareness practice that meditation has, plus a concreteness that many people find satisfying.

So, all of that is to say that the Morning Pages practice is great.

The Josh Waitzkin twist is about priming what comes out in your stream of consciousness.

His observation is that if you end your day wrestling with a difficult, unfinished problem then that problem will bounce around your head overnight while you sleep.

Then when you write your morning pages the next day you’ll have access to new insights about the problem.

The process is:

* Find your most difficult current project. This is the one that requires all of your creativity and brain power.

* Do some work on it at the end of your work day. It’s perfectly fine to have a full evening after doing this work — eat, drink, workout, watch TV. Just don’t do any other mentally straining tasks.

* The other key is that you don’t finish the work. Leave the project unfinished. For example, write a draft or a partial draft.

* Sleep.

* Wake up and write about that project. Overnight, your brain will have wrestled with the problem and will almost always have made new connections. Your morning pages capture those insights.

This method is magic for two reasons.

One reason is that it helps you get into a flow state.

If you do deep work, then you probably are familiar with a pre-flow state where you don’t seem to be getting much done other than turning on the right neurons.

So now, with Josh’s priming method, your neurons are already ready first thing in the morning. You’ll enter a flow state for yesterday’s project much faster than if you were starting cold.

The second reason is that your ideas get better. Your brain will have found insights that weren’t available to you the day before.

Here’s a concrete example.

Every morning I start my day by writing a blog post. For example, this post is the first thing I worked on today.

But I don’t start that blog post from scratch. Instead, I touch the blog post the night before.

Touching could mean writing a headline and paragraph. Or it could mean finding an old draft and doing a quick revision.

I always stop the draft just as it’s getting hard.

Then the next morning I jump back into that draft first thing.

Whatever was challenging me the night before always seems to be cleared up. And more importantly, I feel like the blog post is already loaded up in my brain.

My natural state is to wake up groggy and unsure of what to work on. Then when I try to work, I struggle to get traction. Unprimed, I don’t usually hit a groove until later afternoon.

But Josh’s priming method is the exact opposite. Now I start my day in a groove.

This is simple, right?

But I like to do the math on productivity hacks.

If this makes half of my day more productive, then isn’t this one of the most powerful productivity tricks ever?

And that’s why, for my money, Tim’s interview with Josh is the greatest podcast episode of all time. [Here’s the link one more time](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/04/22/tim-ferriss-podcast/).

# How I Lost 65 Pounds and Reversed Prediabetes

## 

In the summer of 2012 I was 8 weeks pregnant when I got a call from my nurse-midwife.
> # ***“Your Hemoglobin A1C is 6.1, you have Gestational [pregnancy] Diabetes.”***

It’s not the first time I’ve come face to face with this disease.

My grandparents, aunts, and uncles succumb to premature deaths from complications of Type 2 Diabetes. My mom has Type 2 Diabetes, my dad has Prediabetes, and I’ve struggled with Obesity since my early 20s.

But this was different.

The diagnosis is mine. Yet it wasn’t about me.

My baby could have seizures, suffer physical injuries, or stop breathing at birth.

So my story begins as a mother whose unborn child is in danger.

Like a bear with a cub surrounded by hungry predators… I would fight to protect my young.

## The​ ​unexpected​ ​adversary

My blood was toxic to the baby. I had abnormally high blood sugars.
> # ***“We want to mimic a normal womb environment so your baby can be safe until ready,” the perinatologist said. “You can do this by having normal blood sugars through eating low carb.”***

Well that’s easy. Why would I want to deliberately poison my own child?

But I find an unexpected adversary: *Conventional Medicine*.

* Eat 15–45 grams of carbs per meal. 6 times a day.

* Snack between breakfast, lunch, and right before bedtime.

* And if that doesn’t work we will put you on medication.

Well it didn’t work.

My blood sugars skyrocketed. It didn’t matter that the bread was whole wheat, whole grain, or “low carb”. Brown rice was no different.

I woke up to high fasting blood sugars. The bedtime snack was supposed to fix it. But it didn’t.
> # ***Why don’t I just *quit eating bread* and *quit snacking* so I won’t have to take medication?” I asked.***

I never got a satisfactory answer.

So I did…

And in the Spring of 2013 I gave birth to a beautiful and healthy 6-pound baby girl named Reagan.

She was okay. She was safe.

But I, on the other hand, wasn’t out of the woods yet.

## Robbed​ ​of​ ​my​ ​freedom

I definitely had Prediabetes.

But did I have undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes incidentally discovered during pregnancy?

My results were high for someone who hadn’t been eating for weeks due to early pregnancy nausea and vomiting.

I knew what I had to do.

But more importantly, I knew what I don’t want to do.

* I don’t want to prick my fingers and test my blood sugars 4 times a day.

* I don’t want to write down every single thing I eat on a food diary 6 times a day.

* I don’t want to enter my blood sugar readings and food intake into a computer so I could get a weekly blessing from my diabetes educator.

I did this for the next 7 months every single day until the end of my pregnancy.

But now it’s **my** fight.

And I don’t want to live like that for the rest of my life.

## Diet​ ​change​ ​was​ ​not​ ​enough

### 1.​ ​The​ ​gadgets​ ​were​ ​the​ ​first​ ​to​ ​go

Blood glucose meter, food log, weighing scale. I wanted my freedom back.

I already have the tools I need. An oven, a grill, a stove, pots, pans, and a large cookie sheet (for roasting my favorite above-the-ground vegetables).

**Important:** Some of you need to use blood glucose or ketone meters for medical necessity. Please ask your doctor (I did).

### 2.​ ​I​ ​didn’t​ ​focus​ ​on​ ​my​ ​goal(s),​ ​I​ ​focused​ ​on​ ​my​ ​process

Whether I’d lose weight or escape Type 2 diabetes was not in my control.

What I can control is my daily consistent action to make those results inevitable.

So I became a fan of *habits.*

Habits make you do things on autopilot. No motivation or willpower required.

Like having a *meal prep ritual* (not the woo woo kind).

The kind that gave me a natural tendency to fall into a regular pattern of preparing meals for fat loss — without brute force of willpower.

### 3.​ ​I​ ​ditched​ ​the​ ​failed​ ​strategies​ ​of​ ​my​ ​past

**All-or-nothing.​** ​I’d lose steam and flame out. It wasn’t sustainable for something I had to do *forever.*

So what if I had a potato chip? I’m not going to eat the entire bag now because… what-the-hell, right? Nope, I haven’t ruined it all.

**Perfectionism.** It got me stuck so I’d revert back to my old ways.

I don’t worry about hitting my perfect protein or fat macros.

I focus on *not eating* the foods that give me the best fat loss bang for my eating buck: *added sugar, refined and processed carbs.*

**Setting​ ​big​ ​goals.**​ It’s daunting. I was overwhelmed. My default was inaction.

Substituting rice with roasted vegetables is a lot easier to pull off than aiming for 4 days worth of low carb meals prepared by the afternoon.

*Small steps* may seem insignificant to make a difference.

But small wins perpetuate the good behavior. And before you know it you’re doing it more consistently with less effort.

Then it all adds up to produce remarkable results over time.

For years I’ve felt the demoralizing pains of repeatedly losing weight only to gain it all back plus a few more along the way.

Don’t make the same mistakes I did.

It’s not just about diet change… it’s about *behavior change.*

## Judgement​ ​day,​ ​6​ ​months​ ​after​ ​delivery

I was tested for Diabetes.

I drank 100 grams of pure liquid sugar after having fasted overnight to see how my blood sugar would respond over 2 hours. It’s called an *Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.* (I call it gross.)

*Results*
0 minutes (89 mg/dl) normal
30 minutes (141 mg/dl) normal
1 hour (130 mg/dl) normal
2 hours (107 mg/dl) normal

*Interpretation*
No Prediabetes! No Type 2 diabetes! (Exclamation points mine.)

## Today,​ ​5​ ​years​ ​later

I eat low carb-high fat meals 2 times a day inside a 4–6 hour window with no snacks in between meals. It’s called *intermittent fasting*.

* No breakfast. I drink black coffee. (Peet’s.)

* 12PM-2PM 1st meal

* 5PM-6PM 2nd meal (With my family.)

Real, whole, unprocessed-minimally processed low carb family meals that have 3–5 ingredients… kid-approved.

Give me rib-eye, pork belly, or salmon, an above-the-ground veggie. Salt and pepper, real butter, or extra virgin olive oil plus 30 minutes in the kitchen. *Sonic boom.*

Once or twice a week I do an *extended fast*:

* 24 hours

* 42–48 hours

* 72 hours (rarely)

I only drink black coffee, unsweetened tea, or plain sparkling water when fasting.

* I don’t run. I walk.

* I do yoga.

* I (try) to meditate. (A work in progress.)

I just did my 2nd *Wanderlust Mindful Triathlon* (5k, 90-min yoga, 30-min meditation)… **fasted**. My stored fat was rocket fuel.

Why the choice of exercises? It’s to reduce the stress (fattening) hormone: *cortisol*. But in plain mom speak? It’s to keep my sanity.

## My​ ​story,​ ​your​ ​journey

There’s nothing unique or special about me. I’m not an outlier.

I’m just like you, struggling to fit a healthy lifestyle amidst the stress, worries, and overwhelm of life.

After 21 years as a registered nurse and health coaching patients with Type 2 diabetes, I decide I could help more people by writing.

So I launch a part-time business writing about [a habits and mindful approach to fat loss on a low carb-high fat lifestyle](http://mindfulketo.com/)​, on top of my part-time job as faculty teaching Nursing at a local university.

I also have an (unpaid) part-time gig as an *Ube*r driver after 2:30PM when I begin to pick up my girls ages 4 and 7 at two different schools then shuttle them to swimming and soccer.

My husband has to remind me to make sure I pick them up. Because I’ll forget. (It’s happened.)

Sometimes I feel like a disoriented small-town version of Hollywood’s *Bad Moms*. Where’s the ebook on *How to Not be Over-committed*?

The hectic day doesn’t end until my husband and I have brushed 2 sets of baby teeth, then it’s story time. Until finally we can tippy-toe back into the living room to binge-watch on *Stranger Things* on Netflix.

I’m simply on a *journey* to a healthier lifestyle where nothing is perfect and mistakes are made.

All I’ve done is make a solid commitment to stay on the path and be a little bit better each day.

So please take in the truth and sincerity when I say to you…

If I can do it, **you** can too.

# 10 free things you can do now to enjoy life more

## There are few things that you can do, they are FREE with one exception — point 9, but it doesn’t count because you still need to eat anyway :)

1. **Every morning write in your journal at least three things that you are grateful for. **Your brain knows that if you are write about something on paper, it has to be important.

1. **Every evening write in your journal at least three good things that happened that day.** Again, your brain knows that if you are write about something on paper, it has to be important. It will think about these things more.

1. **Hang out with positive people. **There is a saying: “You are the average of 5 people that you spend most time with”.

1. **Cut out negative people. **Same reason as point 3.

1. **Don’t watch news. **In fact, ***get rid of TV***. It fills you with crap. You know what your brain does with crap? Yea, it thinks about it too. So cut crap out of your brain, please!

1. **Do something good every day. **Note it down in your journal (at this point you already have a journal and you know why, right?).

1. **Smile to yourself. **When nobody is watching and you don’t feel like smiling — smile anyway. Your brain thinks that if you are smiling, something good is happening so it adjusts.

1. **Smile to other people. **Again, your brain thinks that if you smile to all these people, they have to be good, nice etc. So it thinks that you are surrounded by nice people and it feels better. In fact you are probably surrounded by nice people. Smile to them and they may smile back.

1. **Eat good fats. **Your brain likes good fats. So leave this KFC piece on the table and buy some avocado!

1. **Play a song and sing along! **:) Or do something else that you enjoy! Just **have some fun**!

# Groovin’ to a New Routine

## An ascetic Gotama, before he realized that you don’t have to be so hard on yourself to be a Buddha.

“Why are you always so hard on yourself?” a colleague asked me after I psychologically flagellated myself for having a coffee with him, in spite of my “no latte” challenge.

“I don’t know. Perhaps it’s because I grew up new Pennsylvania, and some of that Puritan mindset crept in?” I responded.

That’s when it hit me that I was going about this whole self-improvement thing all wrong. Instead of coolly, confidently and enthusiastically pursuing new heights of ability and awareness, I was resigning myself to a fate of self-denial and pseudo-asceticism.

If you don’t know, asceticism refers to a lifestyle whereby the path to enlightenment (spiritual or otherwise) lies in the denial of pleasure.

In fact, years before he became the Buddha, the man named Siddhartha Gautama explored an ascetic path to enlightenment. It wasn’t long before he realized that by denying himself all pleasurable experiences, he was essentially throwing the baby out with the bath water.

After all, without the nourishment of healthy food, comfortable clothing and a clean body, how would he have the energy and vitality he needed to help millions of people avoid suffering?

He gave up asceticism and embarked on a “middle way” that promoted enlightenment through a sort of balance between extravagant luxury on one end of the spectrum and utter self-denial on the other.

Rather than make any claims about Buddhist spirituality, I am using this well-known parable of the Buddha to simply suggest that we can all start to be a little easier on ourselves.

So, inspired by this parable, and determined to make self-improvement a more exciting and pleasurable experience, I decided to turn things on its head by developing a few personal self-improvement guidelines…

* I hereby shed the cold calculation of the praise “instilling new habits” with the much more buoyant sounding phrase “groovin’ to a new routine.”

* I will hereby add an element of pleasure back into every new routine. Instead of “giving up lattes,” I will “replace my latte with a nice frothy bowl of matcha.”

* I will hereby create some pleasurable routines out of scratch. Go out in nature more, visit more museums, talk to more strangers. It’s not always what I can cut out of my life, but what I can add to it that will make it more fulfilling.

* I will hereby view setbacks as opportunities, not as failures. Life is too short to beat myself up over a take-away latte. Take this post as an example. It never would have been conceived had I not ordered that latte with my colleague.

* I hereby refuse to become a slave to my routines. It’s not about giving up lattes for life, it’s about training myself to have just a little more control over my impulses. Thirty days without a latte taught me that a bowl of matcha could easily take the place of a latte from the café. And now it does most days. But does that mean I can never enjoy a latte the rest of my life? Of course not.

I’ve decided it’s time I start enjoying this journey of self-discovery and having a little fun in the process. Imagine how debonair the next exchange will be:

“Hey dude. Want to get a latte with me?”

“Nah, man. These days, I’m groovin’ to a new routine…”

Sweet.

# What Love Will Cost You

## What Love Will Cost You

### Words of caution to those considering spending any length of forever with me

Love will cost you errant long strands of black hair on everything you hold dear: clogging the shower drain, on your clean clothes, caught in the Scotch tape you use to gift wrap presents at Christmas, neatly coiled on the kitchen counter, and woven into the carpet, everywhere, forever, Amen. Love will cost you warmth. There is a witching hour where a stray hair of mine will transform into a spider crawling down my leg. I will get up in the middle of the night, throw all of the covers off of the bed, and comb the sheets all panicked and wide-eyed without my glasses on.

Love will cost you a charity priced ticket to *The Vagina Monologues. *It will cost me gripping your hand while I rock in my chair and choke back sobs. I will raise my other hand in the air and shout, “Yes!” like I’m an extra in a Tyler Perry movie. It will cost you standing by me in a room full of women while we all coo and call each other “sister.” Love will cost you watching a nineteen-year-old list the different euphemisms for vagina and sitting next to a manic woman chanting the word “cunt” while pumping her fist with vigor usually reserved for the Super Bowl.

Love will cost you knowing that I have a hand-and-rod puppet and that I keep my condoms in a vintage *Annie *lunchbox. Love will have to reassure me that my new freckles aren’t melanoma on the regular. Love will want to hang out with me anyway.

Love will cost you a knee to the chest. I am a tall woman accustomed to passing out like a starfish diagonally across a double bed. You may wake up with a phantom bruise from poor sleeping spatial awareness. The face you wake up to won’t be cute either. The overbite and large lower lip combo like to cross-cancel each other like fractions and leave my slackened sleep face in something between a scowl and a pucker.

Love will cost you privacy. There will be moments of you detailed in my notebook, in my laptop, live on stage, and on the Internet. Our mutual friends will crane their heads to look at you and wonder, “Was that about? No, can’t be.” The answer will be yes, it will always be yes. I will write poems about the parts of you that you can’t stand and make them all public knowledge.

Love will cost you pride. I dance in the grocery store and walking past street buskers if the song is right. The two-year-old I nanny recently pointed out that I look like a squinty dinosaur when I eat anything. I anthropomorphize inanimate objects. I un-ironically love all things Spice Girls. I always think I see Mindy Kaling on Melrose and I will need you to confirm this for me while I cocoon myself in my jacket and make screeching sounds. This is the woman you will take out in public like she isn’t a large third grader with poor impulse control and a driver’s license.

Love will cost my parents treating you like you’re the greatest miracle and the biggest disappointment. My mother will appreciate your politeness (but she thinks you’re gay, she always will). My father likes that you have a firm handshake (though he wishes you prayed a bit more).

Love will cost you a shovel. Love will make you do some spelunking, will get to the roadblock that’s prevented anyone from being with me for twenty-four years and walk through it. It knows how I became all jokes and bad metaphors and why I have no interest in being pretty. It will dig through a mountain of bullshit, go through the Holland Tunnel, over the Pulaski Skyway, and make a left at the Dunkin Donuts, past the sixth grade dance, my favorite diner, and the ghost of my appendix. I will be in there somewhere. Love will come out on the other side.

In return, I will love you, too.

# Find the Time for a Wandering Mind.

## Mindfulness helps us meditate, focus, and rid ourselves of stress and anxiety. But at what cost? Focus is an in demand commodity today, we all want it, if only our easily distracted minds would play ball (or maybe that’s the problem). As you might know by now, we get distracted at rather inconvenient times—during exams, at work, in the middle of a conversation. Up to 50% of our day is spent mind-wandering, and most evidence points to it making us unhappy, so mindfulness is here to train our focus and make us aware of the moment our brains falter, so that we can pivot back.

![](1*aMVW-uU9DEAXd5zTwa_LLQ.jpeg)

Many people think mind-wandering is associated with lazy people, always with their heads in the clouds. When I mentioned that we mind wander 50% of the time, I bet for many people the reaction was along the lines of “What a waste.” “How can I lower it?” “Why can’t I focus all the time?” At some point we should consider the reasons *for *it—why did our brains evolve to wander that much? Surely it has it’s benefits if such a large portion of time is devoted to it.

Our brains most often distract us with the things it (or we) believe to be important—Job interviews, emails, fantasy football. A big problem in our ability to focus is the importance we’re placing on things that really shouldn’t or needn’t be stressed out over. In the distant past we placed importance on finding food and avoiding danger, ‘real’ important things. This is made all the more difficult when we’re connected to too many devices—we can check Facebook and emails anytime, so we’re always thinking about it, even on holiday. We’re always [being evaluated](https://medium.com/aspen-ideas/from-evaluation-to-inspiration-26636af27c62), we’re busy fighting to be seen as attractive to potential partners, worthy of promotions to our employers, and full of potential to hopeful employers; now we’re stressed out about our appearance (both offline and on), how much we know, and how we compare to others.

Stress overload, we weren’t built to deal with all of this, at least not all the time.

In comes mindfulness, teaching us to be in the moment, aware of the positive and negative thoughts that come into our head, and to remain focused on the present non-judgmentally. The [benefits are great](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/08/mindfulness-meditation-benefits-health_n_3016045.html), I cannot and will not argue against mindfulness, I think it’s a great way to clear your mind and fight off unwanted thoughts to [improve attention](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-goleman/the-four-basic-moves-to-s_b_4058294.html)—but only when you need it.

Mind-wandering gets a bad rap because the benefits are more hidden, while the negatives hang on it’s sleeves. Studies show it makes us unhappy, and there’s the obvious fact we get distracted from other tasks. But there are positives too, it helps to form [stronger memories](http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(10)00006-1), make [future plans](http://www4.lu.se/upload/psykologi/pdf/Baird_11_MW-Future-WorkingMemoryCapacity.pdf), and we’re [at our most creative](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/08/31/0956797612446024.abstract?rss=1) when we’re mind-wandering.
> # “Arriving home from the store without the eggs that necessitated the trip is a mere annoyance when weighed against coming to a decision to ask for a raise, leave a job, or go back to school.”

Let’s kill the bad points then—We get distracted because **too many things weigh on our mind**, and we’re left unhappy because those things are **too negative**.

You’re in class and your mind takes you to your chores after school—“I don’t like them and I’m tired.” You’re on holiday and you’re wondering who got the promotion back at work—“should I check my emails? I bet it was Bret, I never liked him.” You’re in bed and you’re thinking about work tomorrow—“Could I have done more today? What do I need to do in the morning? Why can’t I sleep?”

The issue is not that mind-wandering is bad, it’s that we’ve set it up to fail by giving importance to so many things that, while not irrelevant, are not worthy of the stress they cause us.

### The solution? Let your mind wander **when it’s appropriate,** but use [**Positive Constructive Daydreaming.](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00626/full#B49)**

Set some time aside to practice mindfulness, so that you learn to notice when your mind goes astray and can pull it back, which will improve your ability to focus. Then when it’s important to pay attention, you’ll be able to keep your focus longer, by being more attuned to the minds wandering.

I find a great time to use mindfulness is when I’m trying to get to sleep, it prevents thoughts about the upcoming day or reflections on what I did today from intruding, letting me get to sleep peacefully.

**But**, if the task’s not important or doesn’t require all your attention—such as when you’re in the shower, washing the dishes, or taking a walk; let your mind wander—but push it in the right direction.

*Positive constructive daydreaming *is one of three types of daydreaming. It’s associated with playful, vivid, wishful thoughts, and is free from psychological conflict.

The other two types of daydreaming are G*uilty-dysphoric daydreaming—*driven by a combination of ambitiousness, anguishing fantasies of heroism, failure, and aggression; and *poor attentional control—*typical of the anxious, the distractible, and those having difficulties concentrating, characterized by the inability to concentrate on either the ongoing thought or the external task.

Daydreaming is volitional, you can choose to do it. You can practice positive constructive daydreaming when it suites you, and become more adept at it. You can also learn to notice the change between outside and inside thought streams, allowing to to realize sooner that you’ve gone off track and can more easily adjust yourself, no matter which mode you’re in.

If 50% has been the split for mind-wandering in the past, then it should stay that way; rather than push the percentage in favor of one or the other, we should be learning to do both more effectively. We can do that by being mindful when we need to focus on an outside task, and using positive constructive daydreaming when going inside.

# The No Home Internet Experiment

## The No Home Internet Experiment

I undertook my experiment of cutting off home Internet in April 2013. I would love to say it was my idea, but unfortunately I used every excuse not to give up my precious home Internet. It wasn’t until I read [“Killing the Internet at Home is the Most Productive Thing I’ve Ever Done”](http://www.theminimalists.com/internet/) on TheMinimalists.com that I had my last good excuse ripped from my clutches. Surely I could make no home Internet work for me if a man who runs a website for a living did it. I moved into a new apartment and simply did not get Internet set up. The plan was to do my work on the Internet at coffee shops and the library.

When I had resigned myself to the giving this experiment a try, I realized there were a few bad Internet habits I had that may benefit from restricted access.

## The Ultimate Procrastination Enabler

The amount of YouTube videos and TV shows that I watched on the computer was a tad embarrassing. It’s easy to cuddle up with your laptop and binge-watch make-up tutorials in the privacy of your home.

In [The Procrastination Equation](http://procrastinus.com/), Dr. Piers Steel writes that “proximity to temptation is one of the deadliest determinants of procrastination” (pg. 64). With everything on the Internet only a click away, procrastination is easier than ever before.

*The results:*

Getting rid of home Internet has helped me cut back on procrastination in two ways. Since I have to leave my home to use the Internet, there are some days when I don’t get get access until later in the morning. By that point I dive right in to my emails, some of which were sent the evening before, because I feel that an email response of less than 24 hours is best for me. I have created a sense of urgency with my email responses, which prompts me to get to work immediately. From there, I’m on a productivity roll.

Also, the amount of useless shows and video clips that I watch on the computer has fallen drastically. In the past 4 months I estimate that I have watched less than 10 videos at times I have reserved for working. My reasons for not watching range from forgetting my earphones, to not wanting to waste my precious Internet time, to being in an environment that’s inappropriate.
> # I’m far too self-conscious to watch YouTube make-up tutorials in the middle of the day at Starbucks.

Overall, cutting off home Internet has helped me to make a significant dent in my Internet-enabled procrastination.

## **The Screen of Malaise**

Wake up. Jump right onto the computer or phone. Go to work and spend all day on the computer. Go home and stare at a computer screen until right before bed.

Does this sound familiar? This was the closest thing I had to a daily routine for the past 5 years.

During that time I was having significant problems with my sleep that resembled [Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder). I would go to sleep at 3am and sleep for 8 hours every night, waking up at 11am. Night owl or early bird, I know that [my lengthy screen time was only exacerbating any problem](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bright-screens-could-delay-bedtime).

*The results:*

Since cutting off home Internet, there have been work days when I have not used a computer at all. If I had considered a day like that before cutting off home Internet, I would have assumed that my day would be very unproductive. In reality, I have struck a balance between work that is best done on the Internet, like research, and other activities like meetings and first draft writing. I also realized that I needed to be smarter about how I spend my time on the Internet.

The [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/) app has become even more crucial to my workflow since cutting off home Internet. Most weeks I concentrate my meetings on Tuesday to Thursday, because I prefer to spend Monday and Friday focused on writing, research and social media curation. Although I’m much more comfortable with the idea of going a whole day without posting on social media, I rely on the Buffer app to help me spread my social sharing out when I’m allocating most of my curating time to the beginning and end of the week.

Another great tool for making the most of my screen time has been [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/). I use [a recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/124137) to send articles from my favorited tweets to [Readability](http://readability.com/), which is useful when I’m checking Twitter on my phone, but don’t have time for reading further into headlines that have piqued my interest. [Another IFTTT recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/124138) sends any starred posts within Readability to my Buffer account to be tweeted at my pre-selected times. Both tools are great timesavers that fit perfectly into my workflow.

As for my sleep hygiene, that is still a work in progress, but since cutting off home Internet I have gone to bed most weeknights by midnight and I wake at about 9:30am. I’m still working toward my goal of waking at 6:15am.

## **Quality Time with Quality Writing**

The last thing that I was hoping would benefit from the no home Internet experiment was spending more quality time with good books. Prolonged reading, and particularly fiction, affects our brain in ways that TV and social media can not.

![Credit: zev via Compfight](1*3uvPhJvtvuY6DM5Fajc8Ig.jpeg)*Credit: zev via Compfight*

The New York Times, in [“Your Brain on Fiction,”](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/the-neuroscience-of-your-brain-on-fiction.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&) discusses neuroscientific research involving people reading phrases while having their brain scanned by an fMRI. What the researchers found was that when reading words associated with scents, like perfume, the olfactory cortex was active — the same brain area responsible for processing actual scents. The same effect occurs with motion and emotion. Essentially, when you read something you are given “the opportunity to enter fully into other people’s thoughts and feelings.”

The effect that reading fiction has on our lives is profound. Another body of research discussed in the New York Time article examined the personality effects of fiction. Researchers found that
> “Individuals who frequently read fiction seem to be better able to understand other people, empathize with them and see the world from their perspective. This relationship persisted even after the researchers accounted for the possibility that more empathetic individuals might prefer reading novels.”

*The results:*

As a community manager, and a lifelong student of psychology, my ability to empathize is central to my success building relationships. I also love to read, but it’s common for reading fiction to take a backseat, especially when it can be seen as a frivolous pursuit. Since cutting off home Internet, I have read almost double the amount of books that I did last year.
> # “I have read almost double the amount of books that I did last year”

In 2012, I began taking the reading challenge on [GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7337668-tera-kristen). You input your reading goal for the year and then keep track of all the books you read on your GoodReads profile. So far in 2013, I have read 13 books toward my goal of 15. In fact, I increased my goal from 12 to 15 after getting a lot of summer reading done. In 2012, I only read 8 books out of my anticipated goal of 11. Although it is hard to measure the effects that increased reading has had on my life, I do know that while reading I am in a very happy place.

Some people, after hearing that I have cut off home Internet, exclaim that they could never do the same. Although it’s challenging at times, and I was not excited about the prospect initially, I do know that it has had a positive effect on my productivity, my health and my emotions.

What have you got to lose?

# Starting a Kaizen Business Culture

## Improving where improvement means more than “fixing” people

In Japanese, kaizen ([ky-zen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EbZhR9pJSE)) translates to “good change”, although a widely accepted translation is “continuous improvement”. Any workplace where the entire workforce focuses on continually improving quality, on productivity, and on customer satisfaction, is a **kaizen culture**.

![](1*1f9jsjyDHVkSB3SNz0sSqA.png)

Here, teams are empowered. They take action. They swarm on problems. They discuss options for providing fixes and improvements. In essence, *teams are nurtured, not “built”, and evolve in a spontaneous, self-organized manner*.

Kaizen also involves solid collaboration and a collegial atmosphere where everyone puts the health of the teams and the business above themselves. This systems-level thinking enhances their performance more and more over time.

## Where Improvement is Necessary

Now is a good time to mention that Kaizen is much more than a way to improve team collaboration. It’s a means of improving where improvement is necessary. And this process isn’t clocked or time-boxed — it can occur when a scenario requiring improvement becomes clear.

For example: Reviewing data captured after a project has finished — via bookends like postmortems or retrospectives — is an ideal method of spotting weak points and working with the teams (or managers) to improve them.

## Getting Buy-In

Instilling a Kaizen culture is not easy, and it certainly will not happen overnight. It requires buy-in from not only each individual team but also management. Everyone must be willful participants. Otherwise, without their willingness, encouragement and support, all efforts will be fruitless.

## Setting Expectations

Now, the bad news. Getting buy-in is the easy part. Getting it off the ground is the hard part. Even with everyone’s blessing, you might find barriers in your way. The important thing to understand here is that you’re disturbing their habitat and they do not like it.

It usually begins with unrest, and moves to chaos before everyone starts to adjust, normalize and ease back into his or her habitat. This may sound painful, but it’s no different from what we see in nature.

Of course, you can mitigate this by getting out in front and letting them know what to expect.

### Expectations for Managers

Here are a set of expectations to discuss while working with managers.

* **Managers must tolerate **small failures in the name of improvement

* **Managers must enable** “stop the line” behavior

* **Managers must encourage** teams to swarm in order to resolve problems

* **Managers must raise** the level of social capital within the teams

### Expectations for Teams

And in case managers feel they’re being singled out, here are a set of expectations to discuss while working with each team.

* **Teams must be transparent** with their work

* **Teams must interact **with others, including stakeholders

* **Teams must make time** to collaborate and help others

* **Teams must trust** Management

* **Teams must work without supervision** to make tough prioritization and scheduling decisions

## Final Words

Kaizen is not a team-building routine; it’s a culture change that starts with improving the team and then branches outwards to improve the business as a whole. It won’t be easy, and it certainly won’t be quick. But, Kaizen is a solid and proven way to improve your business where improvement is necessary.

# How To Stumble Your Way Into Happiness

## How To Stumble Your Way Into Happiness

&gt;&gt;How your brain screws you out of your happiness & how to fix it&lt;&lt;

[Daniel Gilbert](http://www.danielgilbert.com/) is a Harvard psychology professor, whom I learned about a few years ago, when watching [his fantastic TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy?language=en).

Very eloquently, he explains the science of happiness, based on our brain’s ability to simulate the future.

![It’s all in your head — Image via [Recode](http://recode.net/2015/10/21/the-tech-of-back-to-the-future-behind-the-camera-qa/)](1*7yN-8goJ9QneED18dCdrVQ.gif)*It’s all in your head — Image via [Recode](http://recode.net/2015/10/21/the-tech-of-back-to-the-future-behind-the-camera-qa/)*

His 2006 New York Times bestseller, [Stumbling On Happiness](http://amzn.to/1Pg2AhV), provides lots of scenarios, in which **simulations lead us to making the wrong decisions and false assumptions about ourselves.**

The book tries to help you become self-aware of these tricks your brain plays on you, so you can avoid them in the future and thus create your own happiness.

Here are 3 lessons about where your brain screws up, and what you can do to fix it and stumble your way into happiness:

1. *Your brain is really bad at filling in the blanks, but it keeps on trying.*

1. *You should always compare products based on value, never on past price.*

1. *Bad experiences are better than no experiences.*

Let’s look a little closer.

## Lesson 1: Your brain is really bad at filling in the blanks, but it keeps on trying.

Did you know you have a [blind spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision))? It’s a certain area of your vision that’s basically blank — you can’t see what’s there, due to your nerve fibers blocking your retina where they leave the eye.

Why have you never noticed any black spots on photographs then?

Because your brain **fills in the missing information.**

It guesses what needs to be there and adds the remaining pieces to the image. If you stop to think for a second, you’ll notice that this means **your brain completely invents a part of your vision and therefore your reality in any given moment**.

Not only is this an incredible [trick your brain plays on you](http://fourminutebooks.com/how-we-learn-summary/), **it does so all the time, and is often wrong**.

For example **your memories**. You might be at a party and have the time of your life, but right before going home, someone throws up on your new shoes.

Chances are your brain won’t store this in your memory as the greatest night of all time, but **exaggerate the bad part of the experience** at the end, leaving you to remember it as a bad party.

Similarly, you only need to think about wanting to eat pizza at a new restaurant (which I do a lot), and your brain instantly conjures up the perfect experience, smell and taste in your head.

Naturally, you believe in this **best-case scenario of the future** and are disappointed at anything less than that, neglecting the millions of alternative scenarios — the place could have burned down for all you know.
> # Your brain is not so great at filling in those blanks, but it will keep trying, so just **be aware of when it’s doing it.**

## Lesson 2: Always compare products based on value, never on past price.

Dang it! How could that coffee place raise the price again?

We usually compare products based on prices we’re used to, so if your espresso now costs $1 instead of $0.50, you’re annoyed and think it’s a rip-off.

Instead of comparing it to previous prices or other coffee, **try thinking about what you could get for the money elsewhere**.

Once you realize that $1 won’t even buy you a carrot, maybe a single sock, and 10 minutes of parking tops, the espresso will seem like a much better deal, in spite of the higher price.

Similarly, people will rather buy a $500 TV that was reduced from $600, instead of getting the same TV for $400, if the price went up from $300.
> # **Always judge based on value for the money, never make price comparisons.**

## Lesson 3: Bad experiences are better than no experiences.

Speaking of comparisons, consider this paradox: You are introduced to someone you find attractive and then given the choice between one of two options:

1. Marry them. In this case, the person will become a pyromaniac down the road (someone who sets fires on purpose for personal enjoyment, and might light up your house).

1. Not marry them. In this case, the person will become a billionaire.

**Which one would you regret more?**

Astonishingly, Gilbert says it’s the latter.

Because even if your spouse turns out to be a complete maniac, your brain can still learn something from the experience, and **see the positives in it**.

You’ll probably walk away from this experience thinking: “Ha, anyone that comes now will be better, the worst is behind me.” or “Now I can really assess people a lot better.”

But it’s hard for your brain to come up with **a positive view of something that never happened**. Since you don’t even know what it’s like to be married to a billionaire, you kick yourself for not going for it in the first place, and thus end up unhappier.
> # So whatever you do, **do something, even if it’s the wrong thing. **Action beats inaction, every time.

**Note: [**I personally believe that action is the cure to anything](http://niklasgoeke.com/about-me/). Thinking is great, but we should do it much less.

### What The F Brain?

It’s fascinating how we make [bad decisions](http://fourminutebooks.com/the-willpower-instinct-summary/) and wrong assumptions, not because of being over-confident or smug, but simply because of [*the way our brains are wired](http://fourminutebooks.com/you-are-not-your-brain-summary/).*

I think the consequences have a much bigger impact on our lives than even the book suggests. Considering our brains manipulate both our past and future to such an extent is mind-blowing.

Then again, sometimes these qualities help us see the good in bad situations.

According to this book, the only truly bad thing you should avoid at all costs is **doing nothing.**

# EVOLUTION, not Resolution

## Do you have some New Year’s resolutions planned? Are you finally going to do that thing you always wanted to do? Travel? Lose weight? Work for yourself? Go back to school? Take dance lessons?

Not. So. Fast.

## [Change is a process](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419914759&sr=8-1&keywords=prochaska)!

Sustainable change is a series of choices, thousands of choices, made over a long period of time. Unless we have already made some life adjustments to this commitment, we have some work to do.

Willpower fizzles. We build up all kinds of energy and motivation into a reserve that we use to engage with every struggle, because we don’t know what else to do. There are three hacks we can use:

1. Learn from others

1. Make it easy to make supportive choices.

1. Transform it into a process.

The first hack is to do research. What can we learn from the folks who have already been down the path in front of us? This is way wasier than figuring out how to get around them on our own.

Hack two is to manage our willpower. [Willpower is a consumable resource](http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower.aspx); we run lower as the day goes on. Once we make a million little choices, we reach [decision fatigue](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&ved=0CFoQFjAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcarlsonschool.umn.edu%2Ffile%2F49706%2Fdownload%3Ftoken%3DwNPf07PU&ei=XS2iVMLNK4L8yQTGg4GoAw&usg=AFQjCNEP2A8ZXb5CMkThudcFU5jmrWDZug&bvm=bv.82001339,d.aWw&cad=rja). We get tired of making decisions, any decision, so we start to make the easiest decisions, instead of the best ones. By putting some major choices towards meeting our goals on auto pilot, we don’t even have to think about it.

Want to eat better? Pack a lunch. Too tired to pack a lunch every day after a long workday? Buy prepacked lunches. If we had to go without autopilot in this situation, here is what usually happens:

— We want to eat better! Yes! — We commit to bagging a lunch, or to make better choices when we buy lunch. We can do this! — We feel tired from work, and right now is lunch, and we just want to take a break and not think about anything for a while. Ahhh… — Since we feel burned out, we go for pizza instead of a salad. That always sounds good, doesn’t it? — We feel guilty we didn’t make the “right” choice and beat ourselves up over it later. What happened??? — Someday, we get tired of this cycle and stop. We weren’t doing very well, so why bother? — Eventually, we might even feel guilty that we gave up and we start again at the top. Rinse and repeat.

Does this sound familiar? [On average, we give up and try again seven times before we get the hang of it](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419914759&sr=8-1&keywords=prochaska).

## There is an easier, *kinder* way by committing to the **process** of working towards our goal.

This seems slower, but it provides a foundation for us to learn and adapt more easily than expecting instant results. There are no magic bullets, but slow progress is better than no progress.

### The reason George Mallory died climbing Mount Everest is the best lesson in simplicity

George Mallory was a British mountaineer who died in 1924 while attempting the first ascent of Mount Everest. In a world that perpetually seeks or assumes specificity and certitude, his answer is delightfully simple and honest.

I always enjoy why-less-ness — [the things that just are](http://www.littlehunches.com/post/76242754179/in-a-lovely-lecture-given-in-buenos-aires-jorge) — because they force what composer John Cage described as, “[a sense of at-one-ness with whatever.](http://www.littlehunches.com/post/95396052606/he-has-changed-the-responsibility-of-the-composer)” It doesn’t mean that you ought to rid your world of questions, nor does it mean you should be pre-disposed to accept all reason that comes your way. Quite differently, I believe it gives meaning to something D.T. Suzuki said to his class on Zen Buddhism at Columbia University:
> “Before studying Zen, men are men and mountains are mountains. While studying Zen, things become confused: one doesn’t know exactly what is what and which is which. After studying Zen, men are men and mountains are mountains.”

Leonardo da Vinci said it somewhat differently:
> “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”

These may not immediately connect, but to me — along with Mallory’s quote above — they very much do.

The idea is that when we first encounter something, it just is. The waterfall we see, the person we meet, the thought we have. We meet it, shake its hand, and know it superficially. (*Men are men, and mountains are mountains.)*

Then it lingers with us, we feel its contours with our minds, we connect it to other thoughts and emotions — we [muddy the waters](http://www.littlehunches.com/post/58052899723/there-is-immense-wisdom-here-that-resounds-as) with all we ascribe to it. We stress about what it means, worry about how it will work out, preoccupy ourselves with checklists and panicked notions of if-this-then-that, house an array of expectations, and blur the line between what we can and can’t control. (*Things become confused.)*

And then, with time, the hopeful next event is something more calming: a long exhale, a mental relaxation, the idea of evaporation, a relief of stress, an acceptance of what is — the arrival at, or perhaps the return to, the place we began. The path to [that simple place](http://www.littlehunches.com/post/56965218499/and-who-are-they-in-your-life-the-people-who) has taken quite the sophisticated route. (*Men are men, and mountains are mountains.)*

And so it is with George Mallory. His answer seems vague only because we falsely link simplicity with thoughtlessness. We see a three-word answer and assume it’s lacking truth or significance. But if we cast that aside for a moment and presume that he’s asked himself that same *Why? *question a million times, maybe his answer is the perfectly-timed return to a place of acceptance.

It all begins — and ends — with the mountain being there.

# Do Nothing,
# Have Nothing,
# Be Nothing — Part 3

## 

If you’ve been following this series, you’ll already have learned the perils of [“doing something”](http://holdingyourfeettothefire.com/do-nothing-have-nothing-be-nothing-part-1/) and [“having something”](http://holdingyourfeettothefire.com/do-nothing-have-nothing-be-nothing-part-2/) in parts 1 and 2.

You’ll also know that I’m not a big fan of how our culture tries to force people to follow an agenda that only causes stress and unhappiness.

Now, let’s take a look at the concept of “Be Someone” and why you’ll be a lot happier if you aim to “Be Nothing”.

***Huh? What’chu talkin’ ‘bout, Nigel?***

Ok, let me explain before you start thinking I’m a bit bonkers.

## You’re Not Special Unless…
## You Match This List of 234 Requirements

**People are restless.** We’re an agitated, unhealthy bunch. Mentally, we’re all over the place. Scattered, directionless.

One of the reasons we’re like this is because we’re expected to become “special”, to achieve something big, expected to acquire (and show the world, dammit!).

Society has an endless list of demands for you and you’ll never be able to keep up with that ever-increasing list of 234…no, wait. 238…no…245 requirements. Ok, let’s call it 312 requirements, just to be on the safe side.

**And the requirements are changing all the time too.**

There is subtle pressure for us to constantly have to prove ourselves. We try to show that we’re wealthy, successful and like we can attract on-demand attention from the opposite sex.

We’re a nation of “try-hards”. Always striving, always with an agenda in every interaction. Be someone. Get somewhere in life. Get recognized.

## All Identities Are False

Hippie. Skater. Doctor. Sports addict. An amazing chef. The best lover. Broken. Witty and charming. A depressed, unemployed loser.

**These are all cultural identities.** Just concepts in the mind. We cling to them. They create “us” vs “them” positions and “I’m better than you”.

## “Be Someone” is Baked Right Into Our Language

Even our language is structured to propagate these lies. For example, “I ***am*** depressed”. Notice that we use the verb “to be” to talk about a feeling, state or condition.

I *am*. This is who I am. This is my identity. A depressed person. A loser. A sad, pathetic joke. I am this.

**Check out this healthier (and more accurate) mindset and usage of language:**

“I ***am*** depressed” vs “I’m currently experiencing transient feelings of low energy, shame and hopelessness.” (Subject to change. Impermanent. Not who I am. Not my identity.)

When we try to “be someone”, we are trying to prove our superiority, our specialness and our importance.

“Being someone” causes division, makes us act in unfriendly, antagonistic ways and reduces our compassion. “I’m a high-earning achiever who gets what they want in life”. (and you’re unsuccessful, in comparison to me. That’s ok though. I need people like you to make me look good.)

**Attachment to “being someone” causes immense suffering for us.** Think of the pro tennis player who used to dominate his matches while competing internationally, until he blew out his knee and can no longer play. Then he became depressed, started over-eating and began to be an angry and difficult person to be around.
> # People often come apart at the seams when they’re
> # no longer “being” the role that feeds their ego.

Here’s another example: How about the investor who loses a large portion of their money on a bad investment and turns to drugs or alcohol to cope with their downgraded status in life? This is another of the many examples of how “being someone” will get you into trouble.

## Throw Society’s To-Do List in the Garbage

**The solution to all this madness is to *be nothing.***

In “being nothing”, you have unlimited potential and open possibility. You’re not locked in to one type of persona, one modality.

You’re accepting yourself, you’re not striving to become something different. If you never become rich, outwardly successful, or famous, you’re completely ok with that.

## How to Be Nothing

**Recognize that you can enjoy different roles in life** and you don’t have to be locked into just one. You can be a musician, a business person, a parent, a mentor.

*And you’re also none of those things.*

Sometimes you’re chill, other times you hustle. But you’re not a **slacker** nor a **go-getter.** *You temporarily use those roles only as required by a situation.*

You pick up the spoon and when you’re finished using it, you put it down again. And so it is with your roles and personas.

### Be a Simple Being

If you really want to “be someone”, try being a simple being: giving, flexible and content with little.

**Or just be nothing.** So that you can be *everything.*

This concludes our series. These articles are a bit unusual for this site but they contain big-impact mindsets and are definitely worth considering.

***How does “Do Nothing, Have Nothing and Be Nothing” fit in with reaching our goals?*** Aren’t I going against the whole purpose of this site? Not exactly.

We can still [go for our goals.](http://holdingyourfeettothefire.com/proven-method-to-achieve-your-goals/) We can still have to-do lists, plans and projects. But we should do it in a skilful way that promotes our physical and mental health. The philosophy of “Do Nothing, Have Nothing and Be Nothing” does exactly that.

***How has the pressure of “being someone” affected you? In what ways do you try to assert your specialness, importance or superiority?*** Leave a comment below or email me and I’ll reply to you personally.

If you enjoyed this article, share it with your amigos by recommending it to other Medium readers. You can also share it with your compadres.

# This is How to Breathe Properly&#58; A Surprisingly Important Guide

## This is How to Breathe Properly: A Surprisingly Important Guide

Did you know that your regular breathing pattern very likely is screwing up your body and its functions in a bunch of different ways?

Yup. Without knowing it, you might be messing up your sleep, mood, digestion, heart, nervous system, muscles, brain, and even the development of your teeth and face structure. I mean yikes!

On the flip side are all the benefits to be had from learning how to breathe correctly. These include more energy, better health, decreased anxiety, less fear, better relationships, and just a happier life in general.

Sounds pretty good, right? Let’s investigate what proper breathing is and how you can use it to optimize your health, well-being, and performance.

## Proper Breathing

Correct breathing means you breathe in a way that is physiologically optimal for your body. It’s the way you were designed to breathe; only you were never taught how to.

If you’re like most people, your breathing pattern likely has some issues like, for example, over-breathing, chest breathing, and holding your breath.

Breathing habits like these lead to a shortage of oxygen and energy and are very stressful to the body.

The solution to these issues is to become acutely aware of the way you breathe and then consciously reshape the way you breathe.

Let’s have a closer look at why this is so important.

## The Consequences of Sucking at Breathing

Poor breathing habits can give rise to a lot of unexpected adverse effects. Some of the most crucial ones being:

**The nervous system becomes unbalanced **— The breath has an immediate impact on the nervous system and plays a vital role in maintaining a balanced body. A dysfunctional breathing pattern, for example a short and forced one, results in a tense body and much higher levels of stress.

**The airways get tighter **— This makes it harder for the air to travel from the mouth to the lungs. As a result, your body has to work harder and breathe faster.

**The blood vessels constrict **— Which can lead to higher blood pressure and force the heart to work harder.

**Less energy gets produced** — Bad breathing decreases your body’s ability to deliver oxygen to the cells. The cells get stressed and have to prioritize survival instead of development.

Every single process in the body is dependent on oxygen. Some of our most work-intensive organs are:

* **The brain** — Uses 20% of the oxygen we consume. When there’s a shortage of oxygen, the brain will work slower, and since the brain regulates a lot of other functions in the body, these are also affected.

* **The heart **— Constantly active and beating about 100.000 times in a single day, the heart is a massive consumer of oxygen and shortage in supply means the heart can’t pump out blood as efficiently. That leads to bad circulation, and cold hands and feet.

* **The muscles** — Oxygen shortage makes the muscles go stiff, tense, and tired faster, which naturally has a negative effect on athletic performance.

Now, there are plenty more ways that poor breathing affects our bodies, including [crooked teeth and “cranio-facial abnormalities”](http://buteykoclinic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Buteyko-Mouth-Breathing.pdf) but I won’t go into more depth here. I’m sure you get the point: Proper breathing is important.

## The 5 Simple Principles of Proper Breathing

Luckily, changing your breathing habits isn’t all that complicated. All you have to do is adopt the following five simple principles, and you’ll be sure to make the most out of the 25,000 breaths you take every day:

### 1. Breathe through the nose

Every breath you take should go in and out through the nose. You can think of your nose as a little factory that refines and prepares the air coming in to be used by the body as efficiently as possible.

When you breathe through your mouth, the lungs get a lot more “unfiltered” air that is raw, cold, dry and full of viruses and bacteria. So, be kind to your lungs and breathe through your nose, will ya?

If you feel like your nasal passages are too tight to breathe trough, that’s most likely because you’ve been breathing through your mouth for so long that your nose has adapted.

It usually won’t take more than a couple of days of nose breathing to open up your nostrils again.

### 2. Breathe with the diaphragm

The air you breathe in through your nose should go all the way down in your belly. 70–80% of the inhaling should be done by the diaphragm so that your breathing is nice and deep. That has a couple of advantages:

* It helps your lungs with the gas exchange because it’s much more efficient in the lower parts of the lungs.

* The diaphragm ”massages” your liver, stomach, and intestines, giving these organs a rhythmical balance.

* The lymphatic system, which is important for your immune system, gets the help it needs to get rid of the waste products from the bowels.

* The pressure in the chest and belly is decreased so that the heart won’t have to work as hard.

* The chest becomes more relaxed, and so does the neck and shoulders. As a result, the likelihood of pain in these areas goes down.

### 3. Breathe relaxed

No matter what you want to do, you’ll do it better if you’re relaxed. Since your breathing reflects your thoughts and feelings, situations that make you feel tense also lead to tense and stressed breathing pattern. That way of breathing then leads to a lack of oxygen which, in turn, makes your body and brain even more stressed.

By taking control of your breathing and making it more relaxed, your body ”tunes in” and becomes relaxed as well, which leads to better functioning in general.

When your body is relaxed, your health is good, and your energy is high, it becomes easier to be happy and loving toward yourself and others.

### 4. Breathe rhythmically

Everything has a natural rhythm — the ocean waves, the seasons, the moon. Your body is no different. The rhythm of your heart is measured in EKG and the brain in EEG.

The hormones in the body follow our natural rhythm. One example is melatonin that is released when you’re going to sleep.

Optimal breathing is no different: When everything is in tune, your body functions at it’s very best.

### 5. Breathe silently

Coughing, snoring, sniffling and so on, are suboptimal breaths in disguise.

It’s easy to neglect all these sounds we make, but a breathing pattern that contains a lot of them puts a considerable strain on the body. The breath loses its rhythm, and we mess up principle number 4.

Before we sigh or cough we usually take a big breath which leads to irregular breathing. Snoring means we have to compensate through breathing faster.

A lot of us breathe quicker and louder when we talk. All these noises and talking lead to incorrect breathing.

## **How to Breathe Properly**

Ok, so now you know that your habitual way of breathing is likely not very good for your health and well-being. That is important information, but it won’t help you unless you implement the habit of proper breathing into your life. Here’s how you do that:

### 1. Create Recurring ”Breath Check Triggers”

Choose five naturally occurring triggers to remind you to become aware of your breath every day. Formulate them as [“*If* → *Then* plans”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention) and spread them out throughout your day. Here are a few examples:

* *If* my alarm clock goes off → *Then* I will check my breathing.

* *If* I’ve put the last dish in the dishwasher → *Then* I will check my breathing.

* *If* I sit down at my desk → *Then* I will check my breathing.

* *If* I close my car door → *Then* I will check my breathing.

* *If* I turn off my bedroom light → *Then* I will check my breathing.

If you find it helpful, you can also use reminders like post-it notes or phone alarms to remind you. The important thing is you pause and adjust your breathing pattern several times every day.

### 2. Analyze Your Breathing Habits

To change something, you first need to become aware of what needs to be changed. So, pay attention to how you breathe in these different situations.

What’s your breath like at different times throughout the day? How does it change as your mental state changes? How do you breathe when you’re focused? Angry? Stressed? Driving? Watching TV? And so on.

Try to figure out when your breathing patterns are suboptimal and why it happens.

### 3. Adjust Your Breathing

Finally, adjust your breathing habits like this:

* Breathe through the nose. Close your mouth and place your tongue up the palate.

* Extend your exhale. Inhale for 2–3 seconds, exhale for 3–4 seconds, pause for 2–3 seconds and then repeat.

* Be ”proud.” Make sure your body posture is upright.

* Relax. Become aware of any tensions going on at this moment and let them go.

Take a moment right now to adjust your breathing, and it will be much easier to remember how to do it later. It can be helpful to put memorize these four keywords:
> # Nose → Exhale → Proud → Relax.

## Super-Quick Summary

* Your regular breathing pattern is very likely bad for your body.

* You can feel, function, and perform much better by breathing correctly.

* Proper breathing means breathing through the nose, with the diaphragm, relaxed, rhythmically, and silently.

* To retrain your breathing habits, create recurring “breath check triggers,” analyze, and adjust your breathing according to the four keywords:

* Nose → Exhale → Proud → Relax.

A couple of seconds from now, I hope you’ll kick back and breathe like this guy. Either way, thanks for reading — [you take my breath away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx51eegLTY8)! 😏

# Adding Method to Madness — The Planning Process I Use to Achieve Unrealistic Goals

## Adding Method to Madness — The Planning Process I Use to Achieve Unrealistic Goals

At the age of 15, I [burned my first boat](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/no-retreat?utm_source=Medium&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Unrealistic_Plan)…and I haven’t stopped burning them since then.

I’m not talking about real boats, of course, I'm talking about putting myself in a position where I have [“no retreat.”](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/no-retreat?utm_source=Medium&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Unrealistic_Plan)

Whenever I’m becoming a big fish in a small pond, I know it’s time to jump into a bigger pond — [even if I’m not ready.](http://el2.convertkit-mail.com/c/preview/3ydpyg/aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aWxscG93ZXJlZC5jby9sZWFybi9wbGFubmluZy1mb3ItdW5yZWFsaXN0aWMtZ29hbHM_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1OZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09RW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPVVucmVhbGlzdGljX1BsYW4=)

*I have moved to new cities…*

*I have set near impossible deadlines…*

*Or I signed up for events, competitions, speeches, etc. that force me out of my comfort zone.*

**I do this so often, in fact, that I’ve built a process to achieve the “unrealistic.”**

Think of it as a road map for those who believe they have what it takes to make it in the “bigger pond.” It won't provide a shortcut to being a big fish in that pond, but it will provide clarity on what it takes to get there.

I’m currently in the middle of[ yet another unrealistic goal](https://learn.willpowered.co/challenge?utm_source=Medium&utm_medium=Referral &utm_campaign=Unrealistic_Plan), so I provided my step-by-step planning process with examples.

![](1*Yc-VL_qllLlkmqLxgojSMA.png)

## Step 1: How Did I Get There?

Visualize yourself having achieved your goal, but instead of the power of positive thinking method, don’t just visualize how great you feel.

Instead, ask yourself:

1. What have you accomplished?

1. What challenges did you overcome?

1. Who helped you along the way?

This simulation will help you identify the key points along the path from where you are to where you want to be.

* *For help, [this checklist](https://form.jotform.com/62556243157154?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Article%20&utm_campaign=Unrealistic_Plan) provides all questions to ask yourself at this stage.*

![](1*AcG0F7cJVHU9wR6PuNEYLw.png)

## Step 2: Identify Milestones
> *Working backward, identify the key milestones you reached between now and then.*

Start with the one you achieved that “sealed the deal,” then ask,

*What major obstacle or challenge did I conquer in order for me to reach that milestone?*

Then repeat for as many key obstacles that occur from where you are today to your goal.

![](1*UAZSvDEh4A_YQA9WwB9Lcg.png)

## Step 3: Next Steps

Now, that you have an outline, it’s time to connect the dots.

This round, you want to go more detailed and simulate each step you took to get the milestones.

Because it’s more detailed this time, you want to Think about each step you took from where you are to the first milestone.

Then you can give an estimate of when you can complete those steps and hit the first milestone.

Repeat for each milestone.

![](1*JCtzYvBKUSJ9KTRVvipa7g.png)

## Step 4: How Did It ll Go Wrong?

Now, it’s time to identify all the things that could go wrong.

This isn’t to make you feel bad about yourself, it’s to identify everything that you need to be mindful of going forward.

As an optimist, this is always the crucial step for me.

It’s far better to confront your weaknesses with calm, cool-headed planning, than when you’re tired and stressed from pushing your comfort zone.

![Get my Goals Checklist](1*OxgoqtcAgh2YBaD0skLfXw.png)*Get my Goals Checklist*

## Conclusion

One of the most effective life strategies I’ve used is leaving “burning my boats” and forcing myself into difficult situations. Left with no retreat, your brain will switch from thinking about excuses, to thinking about solutions.

I haven’t always been able to rise to the occasion, and failing in those situations hurts even worse than normal. That’s why I’ve been developing a method to my madness to help me learn, grow, and increase my chances of success.

If you ever decide to jump into a “bigger pond” I hope it helps you do the same!

# How To Make Great Decisions Under Stress

## 21 miles. That’s the point in every marathon where I ask myself, “Why the hell am I doing this? This is dumb.” But there’s still five miles left.

These are the ramblings of my mind under intense stress. It’s not dumb. It’s a test of my endurance. And I’m doing it because finishing a race is personally meaningful. I’ll remember this a week or so later. That’s why I keep an important rule: I don’t make decisions while running marathons. Once I’m going, there’s no quitting, and there’s no internal discussion about the next one.

This sounds like common sense, I’m sure, but how many times have you made a bad decision in the middle of an exhausting, stressful situation? We all do it even though we all shouldn’t.

Thankfully, there are some simple tactics you can use to make sure you don’t *keep *doing it in the future. Or, at least, not as often.

## Stress Destroys Your Ability To Make Smart Choices

If there’s anything we know college students are good for, it’s psychological testing and making poor choices. In 1987, Giora Keinan — a researcher at Tel Aviv University — gathered 101 students and asked them to make a series of choices. Each paradigm had a clear winner, clear losers, and the students were given as much time as they wanted to choose an answer.

“What could go wrong?” you ask. You wouldn’t be reading this if everything had gone right. Many students ended up making poor choices they’d later regret. That’s because there was one other variable at play in this experiment: stress.

Some students were given a quiet, contemplative environment. Others were subjected to varying levels of stress. Some stressors were out of the student’s control — it just happened to them — but others had the power to control their stressors.

As you’ve already guessed, the students with the perfect scenario made logical and rational decisions — they made the *right* choices. And, as you certainly suspect, the ones who were under a great deal of uncontrollable stress did terribly. They couldn’t come to smart solutions to save their lives.

Here’s where it gets interesting, though. The same was true of students who were under just a little stress — even when that stress was in their control. They failed the decision tasks over and over. [1]

The conclusions of the experiment were straightforward. It doesn’t matter what kind of or how much stress you’re under. If you’re feeling it, you’re going to slip up when it comes to making good choices.

So what do you do when your stress levels are through the roof and you have important decisions to make? You need a strategy.

## How To Set Yourself Up For Success When Stress Is High

Stress isn’t bad. In fact, [many types are *good](http://riskology.co/your-overwhelm-is-a-gift/)*. If you have any ambition at all, you probably feel it often. But the science tells us even if you *enjoy *the stress in your life, it can do awful, terrible things to your ability to make smart choices.

This is why you need a strategy for managing stress and [making effective decisions](http://riskology.co/risk-and-gender/). For the most part, the strategy is simple: don’t make big decisions when you’re pulling your hair out. Instead, hold yourself to a few important rules, and never break them:

**1. Don’t let stress motivate your decisions.** Don’t swear off marathons at mile 21! When you’re feeling the most stress at work or during a big project, you’ll also be feeling the biggest urge to make a poor choice. You might make your mind up in these moments, but don’t hold yourself to them. Always re-evaluate when things calm down.

**2. Save 30 minutes each day for de-stressing.** When you’re under regular stress, things feel more desperate — like you’ll never get the chance to make good, rational choices. But you don’t actually need very much time to change that. If you can set aside 30 minutes each day to do something relaxing — exercising, reading, even watching TV ([if it’s all you can muster](http://riskology.co/how-to-add-8-years-and-133369-to-your-life/)), you can get yourself in a good state to make smart decisions.

**3. Run your decisions by someone calm.** It never hurts to have a second opinion when you feel like you might be making a choice under pressure. When you’re stressed, you can’t see or evaluate all the options, so running your scenario by a calm and trusted friend can quickly reveal blind spots you might not have considered.

The quality of life you live and your ability to do the meaningful things you set out to will depend almost entirely on the decisions you make. Here’s one more small set of tools to use to make sure your choices are the best ones possible.

# We’ve Caved to Sedentary Lifestyles.

## We’ve Caved to Sedentary Lifestyles.

### Stop being obsessed with a “paleo diet.” We need to be “paleo-active.”

Our society is sedentary—and we’ve caved to this as a lifestyle. Perhaps more accurately, we’ve lost sight of what “active” really means.

Yes, there are plenty of us who think we are active. But *not* counting those of you whose job literally requires you to be on your feet walking, running, jumping, scrambling, and climbing all day, every day (which I’m certain is a tiny percentage of us), how much time each day do you spend **sitting:** at a desk, conference table, coffeehouse, sofa, restaurant, fishing dock, or vehicle of some kind?

I’m a good example: I’m pretty fit. I love to be in motion. At least 3-4 times a week, I get my heart rate up to 160 for at least an hour. I walk a lot in my job (around a campus). And still, there is no doubt I spend a far greater amount of my time every day sitting at a desk or conference table or coffeehouse or on my motorcycle.

## Here’s the thing: **our bodies are fundamentally no different than those of humans 50,000 years ago.**

Our world has evolved…but our bodies have not. Now think about the lifestyle of humans 50,000 years ago: they spent a *lot* of time moving. Like, all day, every day. They hunted. They gathered. They sought shelter. And they traveled very long distances on foot. They hauled heavy loads. They dragged trees and rocks around.

A brutish lifestyle? Perhaps, but that is *exactly what our bodies evolved for: grueling, all-day physical labor*—the kind that requires great endurance. (And humans have more endurance than possibly any other animal.)

One of the latest craze-phrases is “paleo-diet,” referring to some nirvana of simple, natural, whole foods. Nothing wrong with those…but why do we never hear the phrase **“paleo-active?” **Somehow, over the last century or two in particular, we’ve come to associate all-day physical labor with low achievement, low pay, low respect, and low intelligence. As in, you better get good grades and go to college, or you might end up…*gulp*…having to get a job doing manual labor all day!

The wealthiest and smartest in our society avoid all-day labor. That’s one of the privileges of wealth and power—getting others to do your physical labor for you.

But what really irks me is the incredibly low bar we all set for the word “active.” If someone goes for a 30-minute run every day, we call them fit and active. Really? Do we really think that running for 30 minutes every day…then sitting at a desk for 8 hours is *paleo-active?* Hardly.

Okay, okay. Maybe I’m being too much of a hardass. Yes, when most of our society is obese and diabetic, running 30-minutes a day is awesome! But I can’t help but think that maybe…just maybe…we wouldn’t have so many obese, diabetic people if we hadn’t evolved into a largely sedentary society in the first place.

Anthropologists have produced countless tomes on how agriculture changed society, how the information age changed society. These two developments are generally held up as being good for us—they enabled us to form communities, to leverage our physical labor and have more time for the pursuit of happiness and art.

## **But as a species, we also lost something vital: our original connection (which remains biologically unchanged) to the intensely physical life we evolved for.**

So what can we do about this? As with any vast paradigm change, it’s got to start with recognition of the problem. Whenever you hear or read about someone trying to get healthier, the first thing that comes up is diet. Why isn’t it sustained physical activity? As a society, we are far more obsessed with diet than activity.

While a good diet is certainly beneficial, I’ve seen no research that suggests the benefits of eating a paleo-diet are anywhere near the benefits to both mind and body that sustained physical activity offers:

• Eating well doesn’t make you stronger.
• Eating well doesn’t get endorphins flowing.
• Eating well doesn’t sharpen your acuity and motor skills.
• Eating well doesn’t relieve stress.
• Eating well doesn’t increase your endurance.
• Eating well doesn’t help you think more creatively.

Yes, both are good. **But in a contest between the two, I’ll take paleo-active over a paleo diet any day.** And we need to kill the absurd notion that if you eat a paleo diet—but still sit most of the time or maybe walk to/from work every day—you’ll be healthy. You might not get sick…but that shouldn’t be the definition of healthy (see bullet items above for the things that *really* make you healthy).

When we’re physically active all day, our bodies are amazingly efficient furnaces that will burn and benefit from almost anything edible. That’s not to say you could workout all day and eat nothing but Twinkies and McDonald’s…but if you’re *really* active all day, you don’t have to resort to a paleo-diet to be in phenomenal health.

[One study of Appalachian Trail through-hikers](http://www.amazon.com/Long-Distance-Hiking-Lessons-Appalachian-Trail/dp/0070444587/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) (who carry loads of 30-50 pounds or more, all day, in rugged terrain for three months straight) revealed that most of them sustained themselves for weeks on Ramen noodles, peanut butter, Snickers bars, M&M’s, and oatmeal. (Not the organic, steel-cut oats you buy at the local co-op—just the average Quaker instant oatmeal with all their bad-for-you chemicals.) And not one of those hikers ever reported flagging health. And they were all in awesome shape by the end of their hikes.

## **The body is an incredibly efficient furnace when you fire it with sustained activity.**

Don’t cave to being sedentary. I know you can’t just quit your job and start picking cotton all day. I know you can’t just go out and wander the mountains for weeks on end.

But **you can be less-obsessed with diet and more obsessed with motion.** You can take every opportunity to do something physical—to pick up a box, to take the stairs, to get up at random times from your desk and walk a lap around the building.

And you can start thinking more about how our ancestors lived, and most importantly, how your body is no different from theirs. You can do everything they did—and you’d be amazed at the results.

# Read This The Next Time You’re Doubting Your Ability to “Balance”

## 3 VERY fresh ways to look at balance and what it means
*helloeverybambi.tumblr.com*

If you’re anything like me, when you see articles on balance, how to get more balance in your life, or how to achieve balance, you cringe inside.

The internet is especially abundantly filled with this kind of content, and it’s to no fault of the writers among us — balance is something we all crave and desire. **A well-balanced life is an attractive life.**

I’ve recently settled on an idea of balance that has completely liberated me, and helped me quiet the negative self talk *significantly*, and allows for a better way of being in order to feel I’ve achieved this desired state.

As an introverted woman, I find this *especially *difficult because I daily struggle with many paradoxes that show up in my life, such as wanting more connection, but needing alone time, and safe self-expression, versus being *exposed *to a world I’m not sure wants to hear what I have to say.

If I can be truthful for a moment — balance in our lives is really about these paradoxes that are popping up in our existence from day to day, and simply understanding them, and I think that’s all it *can *be about.

Under the layers of what looks on the outside like problems, are just two opposing states of being which both seem sensible and meaningful for us.

**The Power of Curiosity**

Lately, I’ve noticed that many of us struggle with always trying to *fix *these paradoxes and never being at *home *with the **curiosity **process. We are self-proclaimed and certified ‘fixers’ — if there’s a problem, call us! This works really well in corporate jobs, leadership positions, and in business, but in our personal development quest, curiosity is a viable alternative for feeling how we want to feel.

Balanced, yes. Restricted? No…

Remember when we were little? Curiosity is what fueled our ability to learn new things. It felt like a new world to figure out something new or for the proverbial light bulb to go off. **Curiosity was always the catalyst.**

Next time you approach a paradox in your own life, which is usually why *complexity *exists and where the taste for balance comes from, I wonder what would change if you just sat with it and allowed it to ask you some questions, like “what do you love about this experience” and “why is this important”?

The chances that what you’re experiencing has shown up repeatedly in your life are high, and you may even find yourself thinking, “I’ve been here before” or “why am I always having to decide”?

*Curiosity is a new way of approaching the paradoxes of our lives,* in order to exist **with **them, minus the guilt, shame, or judgment.

**The power of curiosity is its observant nature and need for no immediate answers or resolve.**

Having recently learned this process, I can tell you it doesn’t come natural at all for many of us — you have to make a *conscious *effort to try something different here, if you want to feel a separate experience around the idea of balance. It wouldn’t hurt to have a little fun with it, either!

**The Opportunity In Emotion**

Many paradoxes we see in our lives also bring heavy emotions with them. We can feel angry (a secondary emotion), unsupported, confused, frustrated, and even resentful when faced with a need to balance something out that feels contradictory.

I have experienced this recently with social media, and maybe you can relate. I want to express more of what I truly think and believe in a certain forum, yet I understand that the moment I do so is also the moment I actually understand what I *truly *wanted to originally express, which may not match what just came out.

*The frustration I sometimes feel about this complex process is strong, to say the least.*

Here’s what I want you to know: **Emotions are not liabilities **— they’re *assets *for truly liberated living. Owning and engaging with the emotions is paramount and something our culture has lost.

*We’re so used to fixing things,* we’ve forgotten the *opportunity *experiencing the emotions can offer us. When our culture is screaming that there has to be an answer for everything, we translate that into the full justification for an emotional reaction, which is often more about **emotional ‘control’** and **avoidance **than we realize.

When you and I emotionally react in these situations that feel contradictory, we’re *not *actually experiencing the purity of the emotion that gets us to how we want to feel.

*Research shows that we tend to cater to the emotional side of the brain as opposed to the rational.*

We can feel way more balanced by engaging with the opposite of emotional reacting, which includes: feeling the *real *emotion (curiosity can help with that), releasing control, expressing the feeling, and allowing the lesson to come through that we’re supposed to learn.

**The Peace From What’s True**

This gorgeous process of curiosity and allowing yourself to see opportunity in the emotion brings the complexity of complicated paradoxes in your life to the surface, where you’re then able to ask “okay, what’s true for me?”

The answer will feel like an inner knowing, a peaceful resonance, and a decision you can be confident in, regardless of knowing that yes, there’s another option.

**If we want more balance, maybe the answers are in the questions.**

# To perform better… quantifiably better

## Photo by Ryan McGuire released under Creative Commons Zero

I read dozens if not hundreds of books that were meant to motivate me, give me proper tools and techniques, tips and tricks to perform better, be happier or live longer. Everything from Napoleon Hill to Stephen Covey to Dale Carnegie to David Allen to Tim Ferris. I read a lot… and nothing changed.

You can probably guess what happened. I ended up in a loop. That was pretty stupid. I read so much I haven’t had enough time to execute, so I was still doing my 8 hours and reading how to finally escape from this routine, become healthy and wealthy… And every book said “execute” (ok, some of these books were exceptionally dumb, like “just imagine it and it will come to you” dumb… I read them too).

Next level, I started trying. GTD? Why not! It’s so awesome, billions of peple are using GTD and they are soooo effective… but after few weeks my inbox was full, weekly review did not existed (because I still couldn’t decide whether my inbox is complete or I need to add something) and I was not even close to getting any of these things done. Only advantage was that I threw out tons of papers and stuff I didn’t need any more.

If not GTD maybe I should take a closer look at these 7 habits of highly effective people? Sharpening the saw was 7h habit, unfortunately I started with it and my saw was never sharp enough. You know what I mean?

The point is that I am a type of person that has tendency to overanalyze. I need data. I love to learn, I love to experiment and I tend to have problems justifying efforts that are not bringing quantifiable results. As you can read in [my previous article about meditation](https://medium.com/better-humans/so-does-meditation-really-work-3e3ef6f380f5), I measured how meditation influences my cognitive skills. I also measure how running affects my performance, sleep and overall health, what kind of food is good for me and bunch of other stuff I will write about in another articles.

As you can probably notice, this is an article that you can actually read. I wrote it, I published it and I put some effort to include it in “Better Humans” to be able to reach you. I executed.

### So what happened?

This is an experiment. I am writing some articles to share my observations and things I learned about myself. This also means sharing things I’m going to do. Publicly commiting to something forces me to deliver the result. People sharing, recommending or commenting on my articles are higly motivating — it makes more sence tome to write for people, not just for some lonely web server that does not really care if I add some cat photo or something more compelling. Hopefully I will start getting feedback from you so I will be able to deliver you higher quality “product”.

In next few articles you will find a story about my journey from being a kid with big dreams to where I am now to where I will be.

# The Faith that Moves Mountains

## We tend to look at faith as something that weak people use in order to justify a viewpoint within their religion, or just another thing in this world that will ultimately lead to disappointment.

Yet faith is so much more.

In order for us to understand how faith moves mountains we must first take a look at what faith means. The dictionary defines it as “strong belief or trust in someone or something”, but the definition that really gives faith justice comes from a place most would scoff at but one that holds vast depths of knowledge. The Bible defines faith as the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen (Heb. 11:1). The act of having and practicing faith allows us to go beyond the limits of who we are, it allows us to rise above the darkness of whatever situation we be going through and grab hold of our purpose, driving us to live by a code of honor far greater than that which any mere man can create and commands us to live and do better. Only by this path can we achieve greatness.

As you see faith pushes us to do more than sit around and wish upon stars. It pushes us to go forth with boldness and assures us that whatever the obstacle, we have the power to overcome it.

However with this knowledge alone, we won’t get very far. Faith requires us to also act, and it is within our action does it link itself from being an intangible concept to one of tangible existence. To experience true faith and not act isn’t having faith at all.

## Faith means we’re not in this alone

When it comes to our careers, faith takes on a much bigger meeting. It’s what goes into us overcoming the difficult times, and it picks us up when we’ve been knocked down by an unexpected obstacle. As creatives, it doesn’t matter if our job is to take someone’s order, or to program the backbone of a business infrastructure.

What does matter, however, is our conviction to always stand up for what’s right regardless of how difficult it is. Above all, it is knowing that our strength alone may be limited, but it can be reinforced if we ask for help. Life is fair because it isn’t fair, but that doesn’t mean that we should have to go it alone.

Asking for help doesn’t mean that you’re weak, it just means you’re strong enough to know you aren’t in it alone.

Regardless of how awful your day/week/month may be, know that this isn’t the end. Life will throw punches when you least expect it and kick you even harder when you’re down, but what matter is that you get back up.

The world needs more people willing to use their faith to move mountains. The truth is, the world needs more people like you. People who can see the solutions to the problems we face, and people who care enough to create the good the world needs.

Being a creative is tough work, but together we can make a difference if we’ll just have a little faith. What will you place your faith in today?

# 8 Movies That Will Give You a Rush of Willpower

## 8 Movies That Will Give You a Rush of Willpower

*“Have I told you that story about how Charlie Parker became [Charlie Parker](http://www.cmgww.com/music/parker/home.html)? Parker’s a young kid, pretty good on the sax. Gets up to play at a cutting session… and he (screws) it up…and he’s laughed off-stage. Cries himself to sleep that night.*

*But the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And he practices and he practices with one goal in mind: Never to be laughed at again.*

*And a year later, he goes back to the Reno… And he steps up on that stage and he plays the best solo the world has ever heard.*

*So imagine if Jones had just said: ‘Well, that’s okay Charlie. Eh… that was alright. Good job.’ Then Charlie thinks to himself, ‘Well, I did do a pretty good job.’ End of story, no ‘Bird.’ That, to me, is… an absolute tragedy.*

*There are no two words in the English language more harmful… Than ‘good job.’”*

I was floored when I heard [JK Simmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Simmons) say those words in his Oscar-winning performance in the 2014 movie, [*Whiplash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash_(2014_film)*.

That speech completely [changed my perspective](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/frame-of-reference) on how to become truly great in my field. I think about it probably once per week, and whenever I do it gives me a rush of willpower to keep pushing and [never settle](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/perseverance) for “good enough.”

That is the power of inspiration you can get from a movie.

## INSPIRATION FROM MOVIES

I’ve been writing a lot recently about the [power of stories](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/use-stories-to-inspire-action). And another place you can look for that inspirational power is from movies.

Whiplash is my personal favorite because it shows the grittier side to the pursuit of excellence. Rather than show the “ra ra” speeches, it shows the sacrifices. However, like any piece of art, you may see it completely differently.

So I wanted to see which movies others use as their source of inspiration. To do this, I reached out to fellow writers from around the world to see which movies inspire them and why.

Here are their favorites. I hope they fuel your willpower as well!

This movie always gives me a rush of inspiration because of all its amazing scenes where the young black and white players learn how to look past their differences and work together as a team. If you’re looking for a touching movie with plenty of inspirational moments and have somehow missed Remember the Titans, now is the time to go see it!

**Favorite quote: ***“This is where they fought the battle of Gettysburg. Fifty thousand men died right here on this field, fighting the same fight that we are still fighting among ourselves today. This green field right here, painted red, bubblin’ with the blood of young boys. Smoke and hot lead pouring right through their bodies. Listen to their souls, men. I killed my brother with malice in my heart. Hatred destroyed my family. You listen, and you take a lesson from the dead. If we don’t come together right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed, just like they were. I don’t care if you like each other of not, but you will respect each other. And maybe… I don’t know, maybe we’ll learn to play this game like men.” — Coach Boone*

**Movie: [**Unbroken](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1809398/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

**Summary: **Watching Louis Zamperini survive plane crashes, shark attacks, starvation, torture and the most inhuman conditions thanks to his prepared body and unbreakable spirit leaves me empowered every time. Based on true events, you can’t help but think: “If a normal guy like Louis can do this, I sure can solve my problem.” If you ever need the willpower to make it through a stretch of discipline and hard work, this movie will give you the boost you need.

**Summary: **Life is a struggle for single father Chris Gardner. Evicted from their apartment, he and his young son find themselves alone with no place to go. Even though Chris eventually lands a job as an intern at a prestigious brokerage firm, the position pays no money. The pair must live in shelters and endure many hardships, but Chris refuses to give in to despair as he struggles to create a better life for himself and his son.

His talents and skills, along with his willpower and honest personality, earned the trust of several people who signed contracts with the brokerage firm. In the end, he goes on to get a paid position and his life changed dramatically from that moment.

# It’s Never Too Late…Until You’re Dead

## It’s Never Too Late

### Until You’re Dead

I have this terrible habit of comparing myself to those that are my age or younger who are *more successful*. I think, “Well, he already has it made and I’m older than him, so I guess it’s too late for me. Might as well pack up now and head to the nearest nursing home.”

Well that’s not healthy! Here’s a few problems:

* I’m only 23, I shouldn’t be thinking like that

* No one, of any age, should be thinking like that

* It doesn’t help anything

* It’s not true

* Success is a poorly defined term anyway (but that’s for another post entirely)

Here’s the thing. **We tell ourselves all kinds of lies to avoid taking action. **And one of the biggest lies is “It’s too late.”
> # ***It’s never too late!***

When I crawl into bed and curl up with my blanket and my boyfriend (read: stuffed animal), and then realize I forgot to brush my teeth, I think “Eh, it’s too late, I’m already in bed.” Lie! It’s not too late. I’m being a lazy ass.

I was recently inspired by a woman named Phyllis Sue. Phyllis went skydiving last month.

![[Photo from Phyllis Sue’s article on Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phyllis-sues-/skydiving_b_5641903.html)](1*6VVUf50WZMruicsKb7ghuQ.jpeg)*[Photo from Phyllis Sue’s article on Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phyllis-sues-/skydiving_b_5641903.html)*

So what? *Big Deal. *A lot of people go skydiving.

Phyllis is 91 years old.

You know what else Phyllis did? She started her own fashion label at 50. Learned Italian and French in her 70s. Became a trapeze artist at 80. Phyllis is 91 and is *still* doing amazing new** **things all the time.

![Phyllis dancing the Tango with her dance partner, Felix Chavez](1*D69m1lWU8djRfc9xdBJ-wQ.jpeg)*Phyllis dancing the Tango with her dance partner, Felix Chavez*

So why on earth would I think that it’s too late for me to do anything?!

A friend of mine called this kind of thinking “looking side-to-side instead of forward”. And it’s toxic. It creates a never ending dissatisfaction with our lives. It’s pointless to look at someone else and think that they have it better. Because you don’t know. They might be looking at you thinking the same thing.

So next time you have the thought “It’s too late,” bitch slap yourself across the face. It ain’t over until they’ve sealed the lid on your coffin or burned you up in the furnace. (And fellow AHS fans know that even then, it isn’t over…)

![Yes, please.](1*a9NMLd_KQEBCHQv1WRWorA.gif)*Yes, please.*

Bottom line: My grandma learned how to text. Nuff said.

(For more about Susan, check out her [articles](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phyllis-sues-/) that she writes for Huffington Post.)

## Action

Identify one thing that you’ve wanted to do that you’ve thought: “I can’t, it’s too late now.”

For me, it’s learning to play the piano. It seems that most people who play the piano beautifully began when they were in grade school. So I think “Well if I didn’t start when I was a kid, it’s too late to start now.” Which is just not true.

Now add it to your growth list. If you don’t have one yet, [read this article where I explain what it is and how to start one](https://medium.com/@denniscorsi/embrace-discomfort-c174a87db73a).

If you are unsure of what to put down, here are some common things that people think they are too old to start:

* Learn a new language

* Start a business

* Become a dancer

* Write a book

* Figure Skate

* Run a marathon

And don’t forget to visit your growth list often and actually DO the things you’ve written down.

# This is How to Overcome Procrastination

## This is How to Overcome Procrastination

I love this piece of advice from novelist Raymond Chandler:
> *“Write or nothing. Two very simple rules, a. you don’t have to write, b. you can’t do anything else.”*

As I’m writing my new book, *The Self-Discipline Blueprint*, I’ve applied that strategy with great results using what author Cal Newport calls [The Monk Mode Morning](http://calnewport.com/blog/2017/02/24/the-rise-of-the-monk-mode-morning/):
> *“The execution of the monk mode morning is straightforward. Between when you wake up and noon: no meetings, no calls, no texts, no email, no Slack, no Internet. You instead work deeply on something (or some things) that matter.”*

Now, I realize not everyone can spend their entire morning in monk mode. If that’s the case for you, I warmly encourage you to try it for just an hour a day.

You’ll probably find that it will have a huge effect on your productivity. And then you’ll naturally be motivated to find ways to extend your time in monk mode.

Here are some practical advice for getting started:

## 1. Find your space

The first thing you need to do is locate a spot where you’ll put yourself in monk mode every day. That could be a room in your house, your office at work, a space at the library, or someplace else.

The important thing is that you can lock out interruptions. If that means hanging a “Do Not Disturb” sign on the doorknob or letting your cube mates know that your headphones mean you’re unavailable is up to you and your circumstances.

In short — find a space where you’re not tempted by distractions, and distractions have a hard time reaching you.

## 2. Prepare your stuff

Once you’ve decided where you’ll be spending your time in monk mode, the next step is to prepare everything you might need while you’re there.

That might mean textbooks, other study material, your laptop, snacks, and drinks. By having everything close at hand, you prevent yourself from coming up with excuses for leaving monk mode.

You have everything you need, so there’s no valid reason to get up and do something else.

## 3. Remove all distractions

Next, you need to search your space for anything that could potentially distract you, and remove it.

If you’re working on a computer, turn off all notifications and close your email program. Use an app like [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) to restrict Internet access while in monk mode.

If you have your phone with you, set it for “Do Not Disturb” mode or turn it to silent until you’re done.

Remember, you don’t have to work. But you can’t do anything else, either.

## 4. Let everyone know

Before you launch into monk mode for the first time, make sure to tell the people around you about it.

Explain why it’s important to you, and why you hope to accomplish by doing it.

By setting very clear expectations about when people will have access to you, you’ll most likely find that you won’t be bothered.

## 5. Celebrate your progress

Finally, I highly recommend you keep track of, and celebrate, your accomplishments in monk mode.

I keep a wall calendar in my space where I put a big X over each day I stick to my monk mode habit.

That small reward at the end of each monk mode morning is enough to keep showing up and doing it. Why? Because at this point I got a long streak going, and I don’t want to break it.

## How to Overcome Procrastination, In Summary

Here’s how to put yourself in monk mode:

1. **Find your space.** Lock out all interruptions.

1. **Prepare your stuff.** Work material, snacks, and drinks.

1. **Remove all distractions.** You don’t have to work, but you can’t do anything else, either.

1. **Let everyone know.** Tell the people around you about your monk mode times.

1. **Celebrate your progress.** Record your successes on a wall calendar — then don’t break the chain!

# A Call for Cisgender Action

## Creating gender-inclusive spaces and moments in everyday life

The gradual push for marriage equality in the U.S. has created a lot of buzz around queer culture, specifically around gay, lesbian, and bisexual identities. These communities have gained mainstream visibility within straight and cisgender culture. You can get a Human Rights Campaign Visa card from Bank of America. Corporations like Nike and Microsoft now march in gay pride parades, laminated in sleek rainbow decorations and logos. However, inclusion for gender identity and variety is happening at a much slower pace, and it often comes at a higher price.

## **So What’s Cisgender?**

This question comes up a lot in both queer and ally groups I’ve worked with. Everyone pretty much knows what “straight” is. You can mention “straight” or “gay” at the office, at school, and at home, and most people will know what you’re talking about. But “cisgender” isn’t part of everyday use.

Cisgender means that your gender identity matches your assigned-at-birth sex. Generally, cisgender means that you are not trans*, intersex, or gender-variant. I really like the word “cisgender,” because it names what most people deem to be “normal“ and calls it into question.

The word “cisgender” serves as a reminder that:

* not everyone identifies with their natal sex, such as trans* people.

* some people cannot be medically categorized within the neat (and problematic) “boy” and “girl” boxes, especially in cases of intersex births.

* “Man” and “Woman” don’t account for the great variety of gender identities out there, which span different cultural traditions and histories. Examples include genderqueer, two-spirit, and fa’afafine.

## **Why Does Gender-Variance Matter?**

Since mainstream culture is currently fixated on sexuality, many gender-variant people in the LGBTQIA community live in silence. Often, the “T” and the “I” parts of our acronyms get sidelined — the trans* and intersex communities. “Trans” is often stuck on as an afterthought, and intersex is almost completely unheard of, even in organizations dedicated to queer awareness. I find it odd that intersex people are overlooked so often. Medical experts say that only 1 percent of the world’s population are born with ambiguous sexual characteristics. Well … that’s actually **70 million people **who don’t fit into the medical binary of “male” or “female” at birth.

*New York Times *writer Michael Schwirtz acknowledges the push and pull of the gender visibility struggle in his article, “[Embarking on a New Life, Transgender Woman Has It Taken Away](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/nyregion/embarking-on-a-new-life-transgender-woman-has-it-brutally-taken.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0).” As he chronicles the brief and vibrant life of Islan Nettles, Schwirtz writes, “And though the leaps toward equality made by gay men and lesbians in recent years seem to have left transgender people behind, they have become more visible in politics, entertainment and sports.”

It’s true. Gender-variant people sometimes get to step into the media limelight, as celebrities … or as hate crime victims. In fact, GLAAD estimates that 53% of LGBTQ hate crime victims are **transgender women. **How can we prevent this type of violence and phobic behavior? Well, we can start by making everyday environments more gender-inclusive and encourage respectful discussions.

## **How Cisgender People Can Help**

Change in everyday institutions, such as your school, office, home, church, and non-profit organizations won’t happen overnight. However, you can speed up that process by showing peers, colleagues, and bosses that gender inclusive environments are important to everyone.

This isn’t an exhaustive list, but here are some ways cisgender people can help.

* **Introduce *yourself *with your name and preferred pronoun.**

“Hi, my name is Loraine, and I go by ‘she’ and ‘they’ pronouns.

Starting a conversation with *your *preferred gender is very different from asking someone *their *preferred gender. It’s more inviting, and doesn’t put an individual on the spot. Sure, it’s gonna feel weird the first few times. It’ll raise eyebrows when you share preferred pronouns with new coworkers at the office or friends at the pub. You might get some strange reactions. But it’ll also serve as an invitation for others to share their pronouns. Just having the *option *to define your identity with greater precision can be a great freedom.

* **Encourage Sharing During Group Introductions**

If you are facilitating a group discussion, consider asking everyone to share their preferred name and gender, along with all those other icebreaker questions. This is already happening in some classrooms and learning environments in the US. I attended a writing class hosted by the [BENT Writing Institute](http://www.bentwriting.com/) in Seattle that did an excellent job of using preferred pronouns during introductions.

* **Create Unisex Spaces**

Barbara Walters hosted a 20/20 special called [“My Secret Self,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utpam0IGYac)” discussing the pressures transgender children face in social environments, like school, where they are expected to adopt strict gendered styles and behaviors. Some of these tensions can be relieved by not forcing binary color coding (pink for girls, blue for boys) on signage or name tags. Unisex bathrooms, dressing rooms, and other facilities create comfortable settings for non-binary folks and those faced with the question, “Which bathroom should I use?” When it comes to language, avoid gendered titles and roles such as Miss / Mister, waiter / waitress, etc.

* **Avoid Intrusive Questions**

Calpernia Addams has an excellent video online called “[Bad Questions to Ask a Transsexual](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjqsB1huDxg).” While I found myself bursting into laughter at some of the questions, like “Did your surgery hurt?” I was also horrified by the thought that people actually ask such intrusive questions. It’s hard to tell you exactly what to avoid, since some people may be very open and forthcoming with their gender identity. If you want to ask someone a gender-related question, be very respectful, and think about whether anyone would be comfortable answering it.

* **Naming Transphobia**

One of the most powerful things a cisgender person can do is name transphobia when they see it happening. Writer [Eli Steffen](http://elisteffen.com/) suggests using a direct statement, such as “That was transphobic,” to help people reassess the impact of their words and actions. When it comes to bullying behaviors, many people fall into a passive bystander mode. Think back to arguments or schoolyard brawls when words like “sissy” or “tranny” are thrown around. Naming transphobia can help snap people *out of complicity *and serve as a reminder to be respectful.

I hope this list serves as a good starting point for creating safe environments and encouraging discussion. I would love your feedback to make this a better list. I’ll be experimenting with these methods and posting updates on how they work out. Feel free to share your own experiences by saying hi on social media or contacting me at loraine@lorainekv.com.

# What 26 Coaches Have to Say About Successful New Year’s Resolutions

## What 26 Coaches Have to Say About Successful New Year’s Resolutions

I asked 26 coaches to give advice about how to actually successfully set a New Year’s Resolution. You’ve probably heard that only about 8% of Resolutions succeed.

Below are some of their highlight soundbites — these are the patterns they see with clients that work and the patterns that all of us should avoid.

## First, how do you even pick a resolution?
> *Your resolution should make you feel a bit uncomfortable or scared, but at the same time excited. You want a goal where you aren’t 100% sure if or how you will achieve it. Jad Abumrad, co-creator of Radiolab, calls this feeling “**radical uncertainty**.” ~ [Jeff Fajans](https://www.coach.me/jefffajans) (Leadership Coach)*
> *Create a 90-day plan that fits into a 25 year vision. What does your life look like in 2043? Refresh your 90-day plan every 3 months in 2018. BIG DREAMS, baby steps. ~ [Christine Conforti](https://www.coach.me/plans/524651-pocket-life-coach-plan) (Life Coach)*
> *Create a resolution from a place of love and abundance, not from a place of fear. ~ [Jess Coco](https://www.coach.me/CoachJessicaCoco) (Weight Loss Coach)*
> *Choose one resolution that will make you truly happy. After that everything will seems easy to achieve ~ [Virginia Bense](https://www.coach.me/VirginiaBense/529676#goal) (relationship coach)*

## Get specific
> *What would you need to have achieved in 6 months, 3 months or each week? Have the big goal, transform it into smaller goals and **focus solely on achieving the small ones**. ~ [Serey Mao](https://www.coach.me/sereymao) (Fitness Coach)*
> *Your resolution needs to meet the QUAD test.*
> *It should be a specific **Quantity** (ex: 20 lbs. of weight reduction, running 100 miles).*
> *It should be **Useful**. i.e. one has to deeply feel about this resolution else it should never make the list.*
> *It should be **Actionable** regularly. i.e. don’t make resolutions which can be started towards the end of the year. They will mostly fail.*
> *It should be an odd **Date**. Don’t make resolutions with a deadline of 31st. December. Make it 23rd. of February or the 23rd week of the year. Keeping them odd increases the importance of the date dramatically.
~ [Sanil Pillai](https://coach.me/sanil) (Career Coach)*
> *Make your resolutions **about how you want to behave differently**, not specific outcomes. Resolve to make better food choices, not to lose weight. That way you stay focused on what you can control. ~ [Jared Simmons](https://www.coach.me/Jared) (Career Coach)*
> *Write out an **implementation intention** to help with this by using the following template. You want to read this sentence once a day or ideally twice in the morning and at night. The gist is to figure out the (1) what, (2) where and (3) when of the action you need to take to achieve your New Year’s Resolution:*
> *“During the week, I will [insert activity and length of time here] at [location] on [time and day(s) of week].”*
> *~ [Eric Kaisen](https://www.coach.me/kaisen/524003#goal) (Habit Coach)*
> *First establish a WHY for the resolution that’s big enough. Don’t just look at the task but the process and the reason. For example, lot’s of people come to me for financial coaching saying their why is to get out of debt.*
> ***But that’s not a why, it’s a what**. It’s a step or goal not WHY. Why is to provide a better future for my kids. Why is to be able to take a vacation without worry or guilt. Why is to be able to quit this job I hate and do what I love. Getting out of debt is a what along that journey. So whatever your resolution make sure your WHY is big enough to sustain you through the pain and frustration, cause that WILL happen. ~[ Scott Maderer](https://www.coach.me/scottmaderer) (Personal Finance Coach)*
> ***Get crystal clear and specific about your goals and how you’ll get there**. For example:*
> *Specific Goal: I’m going to quit drinking alcohol for 1 full year.*
> *How?*
> *I’m going to memorize a script for saying no when my friends and family ask me why i’m not drinking*
> *I’m going to swap alcohol for Club Soda (or red bull) every time I get an urge to drink*
> *I’m going to read 1 article a week on the benefits of not drinking alcohol.*
> *~ [Leo Tabibzadegan](http://www.coach.me/lifelessons) (Sobriety Coach)*

## If you want to succeed, create accountability
> *Find an accountability partner to help hold you accountable. ~ [Darleen Barnard](https://www.coach.me/DarleenBarnard) (Habit Coach)*
> *Tell a trusted friend about your resolutions, and ask him/her to help hold you accountable. It’s easy to let yourself down, much more difficult to disappoint a trusted friend. ~ [Christopher Sowers](https://www.coach.me/Chris11873) (Habit Coach)*
> *Share the action that you want to do each day with lots of people. Post it for example on your blog of Facebook profile. This way you have an accountability partner in the crowd. ~ [Erno Hannink](https://www.coach.me/ernohannink/) (Sales Funnel Coach)*
> *Ask a friend or family member to be your accountability partner. Or sign up for a free week with coach.me to try out a certified accountability coach. But do it WITH someone. ~ [Julie Harris](https://www.coach.me/jhwordsmith) (Habit Coach)*

## Even more tips
> *Build a good awareness of your strengths. Most people understand their weaknesses far better than their strengths yet it is your natural strengths that are sources of mastery and success at work. ~ [Patrice Matteson](https://www.coach.me/PatriceMatteson/529656) (Strength Finder Coach)*
> *Start small. Instead of committing to exercise every day or for hours at a time, try committing to 15 min a day 3–4 times a week. Once you can build that momentum, add a little bit more time. ~ [Robin Abellar](https://www.coach.me/Coach_Robin) (Fitness Coach)*
> *Consistency is key, so make every habit you’re building a daily habit. Now, some habits aren’t meant to be done every day, but you can **transform any habit into a daily habit by using a placeholder habit**. For instance, if your resolution is to go to the gym 3 days a week, you can turn that into a daily habit by doing 2 minutes of pushups and situps on the other 4 days a week, at the same time you normally go to the gym. ~ [John Fawkes](https://www.coach.me/JohnFawkes) (Health Coach)*
> *Scheduling a recurring event on your calendar. Then track your hours lins an app like [timeboostapp.com](http://timeboostapp.com), so you can see the value of your investment. ~ [Kirby Ingles](https://www.coach.me/Kirbyingles) (Life Coach)*
> *Start meditating TODAY and do so daily! This brings mindfulness and leads you to your most inspired self, not to mention the millions of ways meditation is scientifically proven to make you more focused, healthier, and determined. ~ [Coach Jess Coco](https://www.coach.me/CoachJessicaCoco) (Weight Loss Coach)*
> *Resolve first and foremost to be kind to yourself. Acceptance, kindness and forgiveness are the only substrates for real change. ~ [Daren Nicholson](https://www.coach.me/daren) (Career Coach)*
> *Focus on the process, not the outcome. Having an outcome in mind is helpful as a signpost, but many outcomes also involve factors beyond your control. You don’t want to get hung up on these at the expense of focusing your attention and energy on the things you **can** control. ~ [Hannah Braime](https://www.coach.me/hannahbraime) (Writing Coach)*
> *Break your resolution down into bite sized chunks and try to make them habit forming bite sized chunks to cultivate monthly. Using weight loss as an example, maybe my client chunked his weight loss goals into exercising daily, eating more fruits and veggies at every meal, drinking more water, and hitting 20,000 steps a day. I would say take a deep breath and pick JUST ONE to develop the habit into your life starting today. ~ [Coach Jess Coco](https://www.coach.me/CoachJessicaCoco) (Weight Loss Coach)*
> *Review your goals daily. There is power is doing this daily. Writing them daily is best, followed by reading them. It’s the action of reviews them where you find the magic. What happens through this daily reading of your goals is one of two things — you find a way to achieve them or you decide they aren’t important and take them off our list. ~[Donita Brown](http://coach.me/Donita) (Habit Coach)*

## How to deal with failure
> *Plan for failure. You will experience setbacks. Plan for what you will do in the setback. ~ [Joe Timmins](https://www.coach.me/energyandempathy) (Life Coach)*
> *A person shouldn’t set a New Year’s Resolution to please a loved one. It is thoughtful, but it doesn’t work. ~ [Karine Galland](https://www.coach.me/Karine) (Habit Coach)*

Did you pick a New Year’s Resolution? What are you doing to succeed?

# The Puzzle

## The Puzzle

### Observations from 5 years on the road

We travel for many reasons – entertainment, growth, comfort, appreciation, ego, and, probably, some of each in different amounts at different times. I like to think that I travel to grow — ideally, uncovering some remaining piece of information that will help me be a better person. Hoping that I’ll assemble enough pieces so that the puzzle of life begins to resolve into something I might recognize. As Pico Iyer famously said, “We travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next, to find ourselves.”

For the past 5 years, I’ve been on the road more often than not. To places and experiences remote in both distance and familiarity. I’ve spent sweltering afternoons in monasteries, sheltered in the high Himalayas, zodiacked around Antarctic Icebergs, spent 3 days around the Dalai Lama, cruised at the edge of Space, wandered among remote South Pacific tribes, ridden through endless tea plantations, explored both Poles, worked the fishing lines in Indonesia, and cried at more than one sunrise. I’ve seen and experienced more than I deserve, hoping that somewhere along the way, I’d find myself. What self-respecting explorer communes with Buddhist Monks at the foot of Everest and doesn’t have a spiritual awakening? In the movies: none.

About two years ago, I began to realize that it just wasn’t going to happen for me. There would be no enlightenment in an Ashram or conversion in Jerusalem for me. Coming to this conclusion brought on a kind of “wanderer’s melancholy.” If the answer wasn’t out there, I might never find it. But having no easy alternative, I simply packed up and headed back on the road, doubling down on my search.

As the years have passed, I’ve collected a few more pieces. They occasionally fit together to form small archipelagos of knowledge in some enormous *Terra Incognita. *Nothing spiritually transformational but my lens on the world has definitely changed.

For me, those islands come in flavors of convictions or truths that I’ve observed and know to be true. Interestingly enough, none of these observations are novel. From philosophers to grandparents, we’ve heard them countless times. But, hearing something isn’t quite the same as observing it. I won’t bore you with specifics. Suffice it to say, I think the Buddha had it right when he said craving, desire and attachment are the sources of suffering. Everything else is window dressing.

I’ve observed that poverty and happiness are not mutually exclusive. I’ve seen more dissatisfied 20 something’s in SoHo than their counterparts in rural Jodhpur. I know that there is real joy and meaning to be found outside the secular system of wealth, status and eternal youth. It’s not our fault; it’s our programming. But the answers can’t be found in accumulating more. You knew that already. Well, so did I, but I’m not sure I really believed it. I do now. Happiness is reality minus expectations. And Americans, in particular, have some pretty high expectations. You do the math.

I’ve collected enough pieces now to begin to suspect that they don’t belong to a single map. They simply don’t all fit together. But, perhaps, knowing that makes the journey even more sweet. I may not have found myself, but I think I now know where to look.

***We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.***

***- T.S. Eliot***

# How to Have More Time

## “I don’t have time.”

Think about this statement for a moment. How often do you say it to others? How often do you tell it to yourself?

Have you ever considered what a killer of dreams this sentence is?

* ‘I’d like to work out more, but I don’t have time’.

* ‘I’d like to read more books, but I don’t have time’.

* ‘I’d like to start my own business, but I don’t have time’.

* ‘I’d like to meditate, but I don’t have time’.

* ‘I’d like to be with my family and friends more, but I DON’T HAVE TIME’.

The list goes on and on. But what’s fascinating is that the most accomplished and busy people seem never to say this. Warren Buffet’s schedule, for example, is almost empty (1). How can this be?

### Time is Our Most Precious Resource

The big idea is this: **Time is more valuable than money. You can always get more money, but you can never get more time.**

Most people are way more careful with their money than with their time. If someone tries to take our money, we tend to be very protective. But if someone is trying to take our time, usually we don’t care as much.

Realizing this critical blind spot is what separates accomplished people from the rest.

In his essay, ‘On the Shortness of Life’ (2), the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca writes that we suffer from a “foolish forgetfulness of our mortality” and reminds us that if we waste our life, nature will not give us any warnings or signals. Instead, life will “silently glide away”:
> *It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use it.*
> ***— Seneca***

### How to Have More Time

According to the World Health Organization, the average life expectancy in wealthy nations is about 80 years (3). So, assuming if you’re lucky enough to live in one of these countries and that you’re not a statistical outlier, you can expect to live about 80 years x 365 days = 29,200 days.

Of course, you cannot know exactly when you’re time is up. All you can know for sure is that once you’ve spent one of your days, you will never get it back.

So, obviously we’re not talking about having more time in terms of adding more days to your life here, but rather how to have more time for what is important to you. And the first step to doing that is to appreciate fully how scarce a resource time is.

Once you’ve done that, you have to make a commitment to change. You have to decide what is truly important to you and start to ruthlessly cut out everything else.

### Defend Your Time
> *“The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.”*
> ***— Warren Buffet***

OK, so now that you’ve decided that your time is precious to you, let’s look at some ways to defend it:

1. **Cut out TV.** The average American spends more than 5 hours a day in front of the TV (4). That’s freakin’ nine years of our life. And I suspect the rest of the world isn’t doing that much better.

1. **Get off the Internet.** Limit the time you spend on computers and smartphones. Use apps and extensions like [Self-Control](http://visitsteve.com/made/selfcontrol/), [Freedom](https://freedom.to/), [Anti-Social](http://anti-social.cc/), [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji) and [Facebook Newsfeed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en) to limit the time you spend mindlessly browsing the web.

1. **Reduce your commitments. **Question all your obligations. Experiment with temporarily delegating or cutting out commitments. See whether you suffer from cutting it out, or whether you like the extra time. Despite what we often think, the world won’t collapse when we withdraw from a commitment.

1. **Say no.** Every yes that’s not important to you bring you further away from your goals. So from now on, no more yeses. It’s either HELL YEAH! or no (5). Learn to decline politely and quickly get back to what matters.

1. **Declutter.** Say no to unnecessary stuff in your environment. [Spend a couple of minutes every day decluttering your home, workspace and digital devices](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-declutter-your-life/).

You have plenty of time. You just need to defend it.
> *“Time is what we want most, but what we spend worst.”*
> ***— William Penn***

# How I Reduced Stress, Increased Productivity, and Made Myself Happy Again

## How I Reduced Stress, Increased Productivity, and Made Myself Happy Again
> # “His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy.
> # There’s vomit on his sweater already, mom’s spaghetti.
> # He’s nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready…” -Eminem, “Lose Yourself”

This was me.

No, I’m not Eminem. And no, I’m not walking around with spaghetti on my sweater. I don’t really even wear sweaters.

But I was dealing with constant feelings of stress and anxiety. Starting a company [is fucking hard](https://medium.com/@apitt24/your-startup-must-be-steph-curry-97d33cd2c16a). There’s no manual for first-time founders.

On the surface I looked and acted as normal as I could. But truthfully, I was overwhelmed.

I was a swelling balloon that never popped. But rather I began to deflate gradually. You don’t recognize it at first. After a while though, you notice something isn’t right.

![Me^](1*btliImXbCsOAtR5Pg31vPw.png)*Me^*

It was the *way I worked* that enabled the worst in my obsession with productivity. An OCD-like infatuation that resulted only in self-sabotage.

It had created an unhappy person obsessed with all of the wrong things about work. An unsustainable modus operandi.

And so I needed a fresh start. I began to embark on a complete reinvention of my operating model. A full reset of the mind and the creation of a new system for doing things.

### *Fast forward to now…*

I’ve gotten more work done this week (it’s Tuesday at 4:30pm) than I would have previously in a 7-day week.

And — I’m not stressed, or anxious, or even close to burned out.

I’m happy. I’m energized. I’m fucking excited.

*Here’s how I did it…*

## **1. Start Fresh. Question Everything.**

I used to read non-stop about productivity. I still read and experiment with it — only now I have a clearer picture of what it looks like.

Do this, try that. Schedule this, snooze that.

I ended up with so many productivity hacks and exercises that I spent more time on them than actually getting shit done… you know, *being productive*.

So I dropped it. I dropped it all.

The reminders. The apps. The tasks. The bullshit.

I looked up the definition of productivity. Here’s what I got:

![](1*VisvnuvfOJOKSiceaO2wWQ.png)

And since I’m not a crop farmer, I decided to define it myself…
> # Getting shit done that moves things forward

That’s what productivity is.

And with that, I began to build a personalized productivity system from the ground up, with a focus on moving things forward.

For everything I was doing, I would stop and ask,
> # “Does this move things forward?”

It’s a healthy exercise to do, even if you aren’t struggling the way I was. Audit what you do and ask why you do it. Over time things tend to pile up. It’s important to do some housecleaning once in a while.

So I cleaned house and focused on my new system. One designed to get important things done before dealing with anything else. One designed to optimize my time and my mind.

The rest of the list are the actions that followed…

## 2. “The Post-it System” and The Death of Digital To-Do Lists.

By questioning everything I did, one thing became abundantly obvious: I needed to stop using Google Inbox.

The reasons are detailed here: “[Why I Quit Google Inbox](https://medium.com/@apitt24/why-i-quit-google-inbox-e17ffdfccfa3)”. And the most common question I’ve gotten since writing that is…

*“So what do you do now?”*

I use a Post-it note. Just one.

![My new system](1*lzmkiIdQVKhduJxxy51gIg.png)*My new system*

Digital To-Do lists can be endless. You can put thousands of tasks and reminders in there and have room for millions more.

On a Post-it, I can fit 3.

And so I write on it the three most important things I can do that day. They are prioritized based on their impact; #1 being the most impactful.

“Impactful” meaning it move things forward for the company or for me personally.

In my situation, these two blend…
Company success = personal success
Taking care of myself personally = I perform better for the company

I’m aiming for tangible progress. For movement forward. The Post-it provides the tactics to achieve this.

And notice the list is prioritized. Something digital To-Do lists tend to fall short on. Throwing reminders and tasks into an unordered list makes them all appear equal.

Sure you can call that important client -OR- you could quickly post a photo on the company Instagram. Either way you get the gratification of crossing something off the list. So you are actually incentivized* *to do the thing that is quick and easy.* *The reward is the same.

But the results are drastically different.

This mindset compounded over time derails your goals or, at the very least, significantly delays them.

The Post-it System has you force-rank the top three things that you need to get done. It provides focus. It advances your goals. It moves shit forward.

I create it at the end of each day.

And the next morning it sits on my desk, staring judgmentally until I cross off item 1. The visual cue is powerful.

I’m happy when I get to cross something off. It’s gratifying. Pursuing that gratification hungers me to start my day.

This strategy yields incredible results. Rather than trying to “build the wall”, I stay focused on laying bricks. I feel happy and accomplished each time I do. And soon — you start to see a wall forming.

## 3. The Morning Routine.

The Post-it strategy frames the entire system. Now let’s backtrack to the start of each day.

The first thing I do after getting up is make tea. I switched from regular coffee. While tea doesn’t give me the immediate energy spike, I’ve found it’s a more sustained charge and doesn’t make me crash.

![](1*lPA1OCMhnnhdL7pbzkdo4Q.png)

This, coupled with some minor physical exercise (stretching, maybe pushups or squats), wakes my body up and gets my mind going.

Next I meditate for 10 minutes.
*(Don’t ignore meditation. I’ve done it for a while and it was important to keep in my routine. I recommend [Headspace](http://headspace.com) to start.)*

And immediately after that — I write.

I don’t write long but I force myself to get those early thoughts out. Some of the clearest, most creative thinking comes first thing in the morning, when you’re waking up, getting ready, or taking a shower.

It can be a blog post draft, a journal to myself, or some new idea related to work… it doesn’t matter. I want to get these thoughts down.

After all of this, I typically have about an hour before our regular team check-in. I’ll use this time to start, and maybe finish, item 1 on the Post-it.

## 4. Digging Into The Work.

Now it’s time for our meeting. We try to keep it to 15 minutes or less. Perhaps I’ll have another cup of tea (hardcore, I know).

I take notes during the meeting and catalog any needed followups. If I’m blocking someone — I do that immediately.

**This is an important note.
**Yes, in this case I am spending time on something that isn’t on the Post-it. But it’s important to get the team mobilized before working on my own tasks. The meeting already forced my mind to switch contexts. So it’s more efficient to stay in that context, take action, and get others moving forward.

Then it’s back to the Post-it.

Now I’m caffeinated, I’m intellectually stimulated, the team is mobilized, and I’m more than ready to tackle my list, one at a time.

Notice — I haven’t checked email yet. It used to be the first thing I did.

That comes *only* after item 1 is complete. At that time I will check email, take a walk (coupled with scheduled calls), and eat lunch. The afternoon is dedicated to items 2 & 3.

![Don’t underestimate [the power of walking](https://mattermark.com/fitness-startups/)](1*0Y_DgN2rwgs1Y4mlvIMtmw.png)*Don’t underestimate [the power of walking](https://mattermark.com/fitness-startups/)*

After those are done, I check with the team, look at email again, and use all of those inputs to create tomorrow’s list.

This email philosophy is very “Four Hour Workweek”, of course. [That book](http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Anywhere/dp/0307465357) is almost 10 years old but the principles are as sound and relevant as ever.

## **5. General Rules.**

**Stop procrastinating. **Make decisions and take immediate action. Don’t “snooze” things that need to get done. Force yourself to be decisive — moving important things forward and cutting ruthlessly things that are not.

**Prioritize yourself. **Make happiness something you work on. It’s a state you achieve, rather than one that magically comes and sustains. Work at it. Take measures to do things that you enjoy and eliminate things you don’t. Be honest with how you feel about doing certain things. Cut out the ones you dislike. Make time for the ones you love.

**Get rid of the negatives. **This bears repeating.** **Stop doing shit you hate. Especially unnecessary shit. It can be people, tasks, or activities. Get rid of any that are negative. Any that make you feel bad. Ask yourself if it moves things forward. Ask yourself if you like doing it. It should only be done if the answer to one of those questions is “yes”. And if it does move things forward but you dislike it — perhaps someone can help, or even do it for you.

**Set macro goals, create micro systems. **My weekly goals became the end of me. I set too many. And many I set were unimportant but existed due to my necessity to be busy. They consumed me. Instead, I now set goals for the year. I then implement systems (a chain of behaviors and actions taken daily or weekly) that further those bigger goals.

**Don’t suppress yourself. **If there’s something you want to do or an idea you’d love to pursue — try it. Stop any thoughts that come about saying, “you can’t do that because of XYZ.” Stop that. You can. If it’s meaningful, make time for it. Prioritize it. Don’t suppress ideas… explore them fully. Let them run their course. That’s the only way they evolve and grow.

### Most of this is simple but eluded me for so long.

I’m glad I’ve made these changes. They’ve had a profound impact on my life, both personally and professionally. But it’s all a work in progress. I’ll always try to improve myself — living in “[permanent beta](http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/09/opinion/career-permanent-beta-hoffman-casnocha/)”.

Of course not everyone has the same commitments, goals, or life circumstances. Try your own version of this and see if you have similar results. When it comes to being happy and being productive — there isn’t one true answer. Pick out things you like and ignore things you don’t. If you’re self-aware and always strive to be better… you will.

# What? I’m a Total Empath, and an Intuitive?

## What? I’m a Total Empath, and an Intuitive?

### My interesting path to self discovery.

I always knew I was different. I felt so much pain from the time I was a young girl. Not so much physical pain, but a deep emotional pain that makes you feel sick all over. I sometimes panicked in crowds and felt as though I was overwhelmed and closed in. I have always been labeled as “too emotional” or overly sensitive. I can’t watch violence or hear about it at all. I feel sad and become engulfed in others problems, when those close to me feel sad, or, are going through life issues. I get my feelings hurt easily. I become nervous and distraught by excessive talking, noise or drama around me. Sometimes, if I am around people for any length of time, I take on whatever personality traits they may have. This, can be a curse. Especially when you don’t realize what is happening to you.

You see, I have always been a total empath, intuitive, psychic, and strange, (as others would say). I have also always been very intuitive of my surroundings, people, and places I visit. I have walked into homes, businesses, and other places and felt both overwhelming good, or overwhelmingly bad vibrations. Sometimes I want to leave immediately, because I pick up on something I cannot handle to be in the presence of. I never knew exactly what this was all about. I have touched people and felt their sickness, which is super frightening. I never cared to hone these gifts until recently. I ran from them. I feared them, because I didn’t understand what to do with them.

An old freind I had lost touch with recently came back into my life. He is extremely psychic and intuitive as well. He told me things, and spoke with me about myself. He told me things about myself that he could not have known. This, being the one thing I could no longer deny about myself. I started to read things all day, that brought me to realize, my abilities are undeniable.

One of the first [articles ](http://www.drjudithorloff.com/Free-Articles/emotional-empath-EF.htm)I read made me angry with myself for waiting so long to delve into them. Why have I ignored this gift for so long? Because, I was in denial, I was fearful of how to go about using it for mine and others benefit. I have never felt as though I could do anything with all these strange gifts I have.

I discovered that these gifts, especially the empathic gift, can make me sick as well. Not shielding yourself from negativity and darkness takes a toll on an empath. Something I discovered very recently when I realized I was being stabbed in the back/chest by someone that lives close to me. Because I left my shield down, it was a literal attack on me, both emotionally, and yes — physically.

I am a very happy person when I stay alone for long periods of time. I have to carefully shield myself when I go out now by meditating daily, reading positive things, and listening to positive music.

I am learning why I have these gifts, and what it means for not only myself, but those in my life. I am gaining like minded friends without asking. They have just sprung into my life recently.

Do I know everything about this? Not at all. I am just learning. I do know how to live happy, and how to bring happiness to others without material gifts. I was recently called a “Blissworker” by two of my friends. I’m not completely sure what this means yet, but I have an idea. I plan to use this gift wisely. It may take time, but I’m in.

I will probably lose some people in my life for coming out with this, and that’s alright. They shouldn’t be part of my life anyway. I still l love them. I love everyone. There is only so much you can say or do about this. Not everyone believes in spiritual things. Not everyone believes in the paranormal. All I can do is give back with these gifts I have. And…I plan to do so, with all my heart.

For those of you who can go along, let’s find your bliss.

# Five Productivity Hacks for Working Remotely

## 

You start work early and end work late.

You answer calls at all hours and even on weekends.

Wait….there’s an end to my work day when I work remotely?

Here are five hacks for being productive while working remotely whether it’s in a hotel, airport or your house.

1. Set a schedule and stick with it. It’s easy to get sucked into 6:00am meetings (I’ve done meetings between 4:30–6!) and 6:00pm meetings. Blocking out time on your calendar for when you start and stop your day is important. Yes, you *could* be available but it doesn’t mean you have to be. Exceptions should be discussed with you prior to meetings being scheduled. I have one client who is single with no kids. She works long hours and doesn’t feel like she can end at a reasonable time. She was going to Italy and I started telling her that if Italy were her child and she had to pick them up at the bus stop, there would be no question what her priority would be. Just because you are a [SINK or DINK](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-deakers/the-manifesto-for-the-single-income-no-kids-female_b_5003608.html) doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a life. Business traveler? Same deal. Just because you are in a hotel doesn’t mean you are required to do evening meetings. You teach people how to treat your calendar. Keep it sacred. If you allow people to schedule at all times then the abuse will continue.

1. Set up a real workstation. Your couch, dining room table or a chair at the airport can work in the short-term or even as a break from your regular environment, but it shouldn’t be your permanent office. It’s not going to help you feel professional or inspired sitting in the same place you eat dinner or watch The Walking Dead. Get a standing desk or adjustable desk, proper lighting, a whiteboard….whatever you need to make you feel like creating. I have a couple of pictures as well that make me smile and remind me that I’m a person. Traveling? Consider a [StandStand](http://www.standstand.com) portable desk. It weighs less than two pounds and can be set up in seconds.* *More and more airports are offering quiet rooms, business centers, and tall tables to be able to stand.

![StandStand](1*2pIDhbaHoVbAuSAE9yFWmg.jpeg)*StandStand*

1. Distract yourself. Right now, if I were to turn off my background music, I would hear dogs barking at the day care behind my house. This would be incredibly distracting to me, but not in a good way. I need to be distracted from the distraction! At home, I use [Focus At Will](https://www.focusatwill.com/?utm_source=AF3&utm_medium=text&utm_content=FaWStandard&utm_campaign=affiliate), a neuroscience productivity tool. It is a low-cost program I can set to a timer, choose what types of background music I need and the tempo and energy level. I love this program and use it with headphones when I’m traveling. The din of a coffee shop has actually been shown to increase productivity in some people. The background noise has even been recorded and can be purchased in an app or on Focus At Will. Alternatively, the Spotify Playlist Deep Focus is great.

1. Use a document sharing program. I came from a company that had a document sharing system that people hated using. Instead, they would keep attachments on their computers, send them back and forth, with no one ever having the latest version. This is pretty common with almost any company I consult with. USE IT. I use[ Google For Work](http://goo.gl/qSDucq) and like that my updates are always in real time with whoever I am collaborating with. I also use Dropbox and Evernote.

1. Have a real office number. I use a Google Voice number for my office line. It rings to my personal cell phone because I don’t want two mobile phones, but at least I know when something is business as opposed to personal. There’s nothing productive or professional about answering a call while standing in line at the coffee shop (plus it’s annoying to the baristas who just want to take your order) or being asked confidential work information when you are in a crowd of people. It also allows you to turn off your personal cell phone during the day so that family members, who don’t quite understand what ‘work remotely’ means, try to call you during your work hours.

# Get Your Ideas Out of the Shower and Into the World

## 5 steps to birth your ideas and give them life

![](1*30PE5Mzlk9DGxYuZqm2RAw.jpeg)
> # “Everyone who’s ever taken a shower has an idea. But it’s the person who gets out of the shower, dries off and does something about it who makes a difference.” (Nolan Bushnell)

We all have ideas. Especially when we are having a shower or walking the dog. But only a few people turn their ideas into reality. So how do we give birth to an idea and bring it to life? And how do you determine a good idea from an average one?

As Goethe said,
> # “Thinking is easy, acting is difficult, and to put one’s thoughts into action is the most difficult thing in the world.”

So here’s a 5 step process I use all the time. It never fails to produce great results. These 5 steps are really easy to follow and will help you develop your idea and bring it to life.

Whether the idea you need to uncover is for a new business, a brand, a new product, your PhD topic, or a new film, the process is the same.

This process is loosely based on the four stages of creative cognition by Hermann von Helmholtz.

## **Stage 1: Preparation**

This is the research phase where you intentionally gather all the information. Find the key facts, the problems you are trying to solve, gather the data and create an information base.

Using this information base, have your first brainstorm.

Grab a large piece of paper with no lines (or whiteboard), and go for it. There are no rules here, no wrong ideas. Simply get all your ideas out on paper. Sometimes it’s helpful to include others, sometimes it’s best done on your own. You choose. I do both.

It can also be helpful to introduce restrictions and boundaries to your brainstorming. This can encourage greater creativity. Restrictions push us to think with more focus by placing a frame around our ideas. That frame can be a limited time-frame (you have to come up with the idea within the hour), a physically limited space within which our idea will be communicated (you have just three words to describe your idea), or by choosing just one problem for one niche target group (how can we help pastry chefs improve their social media?).

When you think you have enough information move on to stage 2.

## **Stage 2: Incubation**

This is the hardest part. Do nothing. No really, just stop thinking about it.

Let the information and ideas incubate. Cease to focus consciously and allow your unconscious mind take over. Go do something else.

The key function of the unconscious mind during this period is connecting ideas.

So how do you know when to move to this stage?

Basically when you become distracted, irritated and bored. This is usually your mind telling you to take a break and let incubation begin.

This phase can take an hour, a day, a week, a month. How long it takes can be anyone’s guess. Sometimes in my experience this stage has literally lasted 3 minutes. In those instances, I stopped what I was doing, made a cup of tea and clarity came to me in an instant. Other times weeks have gone by and nothing.

What you will know however, is when this phase ends, as it always ends with a bang. A bolt of inspiration seemingly out of nowhere. Bing, the idea is ready to take out of the oven.

*Note: If this phase goes on for too long and you feel nothing is incubating it’s a pretty good sign that you need to go back to stage 1 and build your information base. Only you can be the judge when you need to revisit stage 1.*

## **Stage 3: Illumination and documentation**

Ok so you have arrived at the “aha” lightbulb moment of inspiration. The idea has matured as your unconscious mind did what only it can only do. Bake ideas.

You arrive at this stage when the new idea or solution passes from the unconscious mind to the conscious mind. This is the time to write like crazy documenting your new idea.

Be prepared as it often hits you while doing something totally unrelated—like taking a shower. This is why I bought a set of waterproof markers, so I can document my idea immediately.

Once you have documented your idea, move to stage 4.

## **Stage 4: Implementation and verification**

This is the phase where your new idea takes form and you begin the testing process to see if it works.

If it’s a new business or product, this is when you test the business plan. This is when you ask if you have the skills and resources needed to make it work. This is the time to consult experts, do market research, get feedback from friends, and put your idea to the test. Scary, but essential!

When you have tested, reworked, tested, reworked, tested, you’re ready to move to the final stage.

## **Stage 5: Release into the world**

Congratulations, your idea is ready for the world. Release it into the world and celebrate that you have birthed something new.

And if I was to add in another step, I would suggest monitoring to see how your idea is being received by the world and gathering data to improve, upgrade and release it again.

What’s your process? How do you generate ideas and bring them into the world?

# How to Be an Extreme Night Owl and Fail Miserably

## My bedtime before and during the experiment

This past month I attempted to live and work as an extreme night owl. What do I mean by “extreme night owl?” — staying up and working until dawn. As one might guess, it’s been a bit of a disaster. Today is the final day of this experiment and a chance to write about it.

### Life Before Staying Up All Night

Before I decided to shift my schedule, I was already a night owl regularly getting to bed between 2:00–4:00am. My schedule as a musician, music teacher, and accountability coach rarely requires me to be anywhere before noon. Teaching and gigging prevent me from getting home before 10:00pm.

I mostly enjoy being up late. I thrive at night. It’s when I can get the most done. It’s when I’m most creative. Most people are asleep. I’m less tempted to check news, social media, emails, football games, whatever. Fewer distractions = greater productivity.

Most of my life, I’ve fought this desire to be up late. The earlier you get up, the better human you are, right? I’ve met a few of these idyllic human specimens. They wake up at 5:30am on purpose! (Oh, and they’re always happy, they’re in great shape, their teeth are white, and they have great sex.) Getting up early does seem appealing, and there are plenty of health [benefits of aligning your circadian rhythms with the earth](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201306/circadian-rhythms-linked-aging-and-well-being). There have been a few periods where I’ve been able to get up “early” (like 9:00am), but I always end up slipping back to a late night schedule.

Recently my schedule was slowly creeping later and later, and rather than fight the desire to stay up, I thought, “What if I just stay up way late every day for a month? How productive can I be?”

There were a few other reasons why this seemed like a good idea:

1. As I mentioned above, there are fewer distractions, and I get more done at night.

1. I’m recording an album which requires me to go to a music hall one day a week which is only available to me after 10:00pm. Getting up later would allow me more energy during late-night recording sessions.

1. There MAY have been in a long distance relationship that was keeping me up, too. (It has since ended, ladies.)

For those reasons, I decided to give this late-night schedule a try.

### The Routine

My average day went something like this: Wake up around 1:00pm, rush to start teaching piano lessons until 9:00pm, practice piano, drive to Denny’s (or Sheetz) and work until dawn or until my laptop ran out of battery. Many nights were also spent at home practicing or doing housework.

So, what were the results of this experience? Let me talk about the positives first, since that won’t take long.

### Pros:

* Email — My inbox is back at zero and has consistently stayed there.

* Cleaning and Organization — I got the house REALLY clean and organized.

* Creativity — I posted a grand total of one [new YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8l4Ct_lnzY).

Overall, I was somewhat productive and got caught up on several nagging projects that were neglected.

### Cons:

* No Morning Routine — Waking up was followed by cursing at the clock, debating if I have time to take a cold shower, struggling to convince myself to keep the water cold, eating leftovers for breakfast while driving to teach or perform. My previous routine of wake up rested, meditate, exercise, and cook a healthy breakfast was eradicated.

* Sleep Quality — My sleep amount and quality were drastically reduced. I woke up feeling tired and stressed trying to run out the door, or I slept right through my alarm. Several times this led to…

* Arriving Late and Missed Appointments — I was late for lessons, late to performances, I missed three morning meetings (one was rescheduled and I missed that, too!), and a CSA pickup, all because I didn’t get up in time. My students were getting tired of hearing me apologize for being late almost every week.

* Eating at Denny’s and Sheetz — As a freelance [health coach](https://www.coach.me/robkovacs?ref=2nJAG) and someone who values being healthy and eating nourishing, low-toxin food, this was not ideal. Where I live, they were the two closest 24-hour places with internet. So I patronized and did my best to keep my meals within my diet.

* Yard Work— Mowing the lawn in the dark is challenging to see which part of the lawn you’ve already cut.

* Not Really That Productive — Yes, I did get some work done. But I probably could have gotten the same amount of work done, if not more, during the day. The feeling of having endless time to do something allowed me to take endless time to do it.

### **What I Could Have Done Better**

* Plan ahead — When I would work at night mostly on my laptop, I would just do easy things, like respond to email or read articles. If I would have made it a priority to plan ahead a little better, I could have been more efficient and been more disciplined at going to bed at 6:00am rather than 7:00 or 8:00am.

* Avoiding scheduling anything before 2:00pm— This is difficult since the rest of the world is on a normal schedule. But if I could consistently sleep through noon, this experiment may have been more successful.

### Wrapping Up

My intent and hope were to find a way to make the desire to stay up at night work for me and possibly for others. I believe there is a way for this to work, but it would require a lot more discipline and control over one’s schedule.

I was hoping this past month would have been a bit more fruitful. But sometimes learning what paths don’t work eventually lead to finding the ones that do.

I plan to go back to my regular schedule for a couple weeks and try again to shift my day, but this time towards waking up with the sun. No more writing blog posts at 3:30am.

If you’ve had more success (or failures) at being a night owl, please share your ways in the comments!

# Six Quick Ways to Boost Your Creativity

## By: Alexandra Kostoulas

![](1*Qfa4W60iiKn2wITzz9Hzfw.jpeg)

When I was a little kid, our school had a volunteer-led program called “Art at Your Fingertips.” I remember being so excited when they came in because they brought construction paper, paint, glitter, rocks, and other cool materials. I always felt calm and at ease during this time; you could find me humming away happily as I glued stuff down on my art project. I was in “flow.”

Flow is very important to our overall well-being as human beings, as well as to our survival as creators.

Famous social psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi wrote about the concept of “flow” in the creative encounter. People who are in a state of “flow” are the happiest and the most productive. They are completely absorbed in the activity at hand, and everything else, including time, just falls away. They are just doing what they love to do and they are completely engaged in the task in front of them.

We need to get into a state of flow in order to produce great work. However, just getting to that state of mind can be an uphill battle.

Whenever you’re in a dynamic environment that relies on your being able to produce new ideas all the time, it’s easy to get blocked. Here are some of the things I do to stay limber creatively. Try them.

**1. Write in a journal.** This is a big one. Julia Cameron, in her definitive book on becoming unblocked, *The Artist’s Way*, proposes writing two to three pages by hand in a journal every morning. She writes these “morning pages” about whatever comes into her head. Handwriting, she says, is essential. It unplugs you from what you’re doing. It makes you go slow. It doesn’t make it easy to edit or erase what you’ve written, so when you get a new idea, you have to write it down consciously.

**2. Let yourself think all of your thoughts.** Blurt them all out on paper before you self-censor. Self-censorship is part of what blocks us. We are taught to behave, to fit in, to sit up straight, and to pipe down in in order to operate in society. But really, what’s needed is the zany, creative part of ourselves to generate all the creative accidents that burst forth into the world unapologetically.

**3. Take a class.** Because I’m in the business of teaching creative writing, I’ll say that a writing class can really help you articulate your thoughts. But the class might also be about drawing, cooking, painting, dancing, or singing. I took a figure drawing class last year and it helped me conceptualize ways of putting a story together that I hadn’t thought of before. These classes can also help you to discover your voice. We are all searching to speak from a true place of strength that defines us, to feel self-actualized. Taking a break from the office routine and studying something creative can help feed and inspire you artistically, which has an incalculably huge return of investment when it comes to replenishing your well of ideas, flexibility to meet challenging demands, and general *joie de vivre.*

**4. Let yourself work fast, loose, and messy.** You can always fix things later. My first writing teacher, Jack Grapes, says: “Don’t let your talent get in the way of the accidents of your genius.” He taught me that genius happens by accident. It comes through experimentation and the potential for failure. Geniuses have failed more than most. Working things out in your journal is a low stakes way of letting yourself fail. As a respected professor told the incoming class of multimedia graduate students this year at The University of California Berkeley’s School of Journalism: Fail. Fail forward.

**5. Walk away from the project for a bit.** It’s easy to beat yourself up when you are in the throes of a project, but sometimes you need to clear your head. Take a stroll. Walk the dog. Pet the cat. Cook dinner. Work out. Talk to a friend. Play a game. Watch the sunset. Work on a different project. (I figured out the end to a story that had been languishing in my hard drive for a year and sent it out for publication while on deadline for this article.)

**6. Enjoy art.** Art is full of ideas. It is beautiful. It feeds the senses and makes us think. We have to nurture ourselves if we want to come up with new ideas. It’s easy to get into the business of self-punishing when we’re in deadline mode. But does that really help you think of ideas any faster? You have to give things to yourself, to live a life of abundance in order to be able to make something out of nothing. It’s what we creative people do best.

“As an entrepreneur mother of three, it is important to stay always positive and happy. What I found is **happiness is a question of decision and a process of learning**. Also, by teaching happiness, you can find learning happiness as well. Decide that you want to be happy and enjoy life. Find your passion. Find what you like doing the most. Then practice it, and share your happy experience. It’ll get back to you!”
 — [Agnes Molnar](https://www.coach.me/aghy?ref=P7G1v), [Aghy’s World](http://aghy.world/)

![](0*X0Rs_3Ps9FTvQctr.jpeg)

“My number one advice for someone who truly wants to start improving their life, especially at a great time like New Years, is a 2 part answer. The bottom line being consistency.
**1.) Meditation**: if you haven’t tried it yet, do it. If you don’t have ten minutes per day to do this, then you should not only do it, but double the time to 20 minutes. Deepak Chopra has FREE apps for your cell phone, that makes it very simple to plugin your cell, and unplug your brain. Allow a guided practice to simplify and clear your energy. 7 days a week. Your whole life will improve.
**2.) Mindset**: positive affirmations, I AM statements, replacing words in your every day conversation to kind ones. You can still be a rockstar business person and be positive and kind. You will actually feel more energetic and organized having a positive mindset. Louise Haye has some FREE apps for your cell phone with mantras to repeat. Do this daily. Re-setting your energy and mindset in these ways improves your daily thought processes, how much more aware you are and what you will see that had gone unnoticed before–it is completely amazing. Good luck to you in your practice, Namaste and Happy New Year 2016!”

![](0*SXBKQeXiaqkYtZtd.jpg)

“In order to enjoy life to the fullest, you need to **eliminate fears in your life**. The way to do is not to run away but to define it through clarity. We fear what we do not know. By understanding what is holding us back, we can take conscious steps towards overcoming it. Start by writing your obstacles down. Next, write down one thing you can do to get 1% better at it or work towards eliminating it TODAY. Set aside 10mins to work on it every day. It’s ok that you are not where you want to be. But it’s not ok to not work towards it.”
 — [Winson Teo](https://www.coach.me/winson?ref=P7G1v), [Average Alternatives](http://www.averagealternatives.com/)

![](0*gK40YeCWiOHaSQp6.jpeg)

“**Be grateful for everything** — people around you, situations, money. Every cent and every smile counts. Whenever I get home from basketball I’m grateful that I didn’t break any bones or tore a muscle. And please, be humble. Lottery winners often end up poorer than before because they spend everything. Don’t be excessive. By the way, you’re moving around in a combination of molecules through three-dimensional space on a big round rock that gravitates perfectly around a hot ball to sustain life — HOW CRAZY IS THAT?”
 — [Max Kohler](https://www.coach.me/masterynow?ref=P7G1v), [Knowly](https://www.facebook.com/knowlyorg)

![](0*GM4MXrm725K6cYWY.jpeg)

“1) **Purchase a gratitude journal**: It is easy to lose sight of the many blessings you have in your life when you choose not to reflect in a quiet space to give thanks.
2) **One a day**: Think about the special people that are close to your heart, especially if you are married. In order to avoid taking our family and friends for granted, verbally express one thing to them that you are thankful for. I always say, “It’s the little things that make a BIG difference!” What you appreciate, appreciates!
3) **Serve the less fortunate**: This is one act that keeps my heart continously in a humble posture. Whenever I interact or see the homeless I immediately consider how rich my life is. I begin to give thanks for a roof over my head, shoes on my back and food on the table.”

# How to get things done without time becoming your enemy.

## How to get things done without time becoming your enemy.

Time is the great excuse in that we all often say that if we only had more time we would have {insert item not achieved here}.

It is critical to remember we are not the masters of time and at best we may be connoisseurs of it. We can express in terms of time, we can relish time and more often acutely feel the lack of time or a lack of ability to control our time.

Push come to shove we can calculate a vast array of details to conclude how much time is needed to complete minor everyday things. However most of us float on the current of time rather than swimming or paddling in a manner that gives us any hope of claiming complete satisfaction with time.

Not a minor issue when you consider that we really only get three key elements (Time, Money & People) with which to achieve anything.

Not to over simplify money and people however they are straightforward enough elements that can be influenced and managed. I can raise money and hire people or even network my way to getting support or money from people.

Time however, as the saying goes, slows for no man (actually it is very equal opportunity and slows for no woman as well). It is finite and on pace. A minute lost is just that: a minute lost *forever* or worse yet, a minute that was better used by the competition.

There are tools, systems, disciplines, habits, coaches, mentors, leaders and managers all who will seek to aid you as time-sensi.

The hard reality is you will not master time or change time. You can only change what you *do* with time.

As a species we are poor perceivers of the passage of time. When we are young, each day seems infinite ( and as we get older time seems to accelerate.maybe because it represents a larger percentage of the whole of our time experience)

Quick 2 minute drill: try running a stopwatch by closing your eyes and anticipating when two minutes has passed. For many the two minutes will seem *very* long. Most if not all will have no success with correctly anticipating 2 minutes.

Failing this drill is more about having a lack of reference point and lack of experience.

Most people who drive in a city regularly can get from place to place at any hour (in most traffic conditions) do so with surprising degree of accuracy. This is their collective experience working for them. They know, almost intuitively, how long it will take factoring in many complex variables such as weather, time of day, flow of traffic, special events, etc. to get to their destination on time.

However, in life and business there is much that will come along that we will lack sufficient enough collective experience to be able to intuitively know how much time and resources are needed to achieve success..

So how does one take on new and innovative things?

For this we will need to go back to the basics and get out the trusty map and compass. Remember those?

A plan (aka the “map”) is critical.

The plan must include more than just the goal(s).

Case in point:two groups of Boy Scouts were told to get from Point A to Point B during a race. One team was given a map (which showed elevations and landmarks) and a traditional compass and the other team was given a GPS with the two points specifically marked.The first team studied the landscape, made a path and then followed it. The second team took the fastest and straightest route as predetermined by the GPS unit altering their path only for what obstacles they came upon.

Team 1 got to the end point first having taken a path that was not the straightest or fastest but was the most achievable. Team 2’s path was direct, however they could not see or anticipate cliffs and obstacles until they were upon them. They then had to work around these problems until they ultimately achieved their goal. They had a clear direction, but not a clear plan that took into account the actual terrain.

Think of time management tools as the GPS system team 2 used. It’s a helpful bit of technology, but it lacks the real work that goes into creating a plan. With this route, you’re assured to suffer setbacks along your path.

A solid plan (at a minimum) will have:

* **Goals** that are measurable, achievable and where others are involved negotiating and agreeing on the goals.

* **Core Values** that define what is critical to you or your team.

* **Issues of Concern** which are the controllable elements which will hinder your efforts.

* **Plan Assumptions** which are the elements and factors that are out of your control and will may impact your efforts.

There is a lot more one can add to the plan (and for some endeavors must add) but at a minimum one must consider all of the above. This applies to starting a business or something as straightforward as increasing your personal sales. It can even apply to something as personal as getting in better shape.

One of my current goals is working on getting better at playing an instrument. The goal is straightforward in that I want to be able to enjoy playing the instrument for other people at social gatherings, with the ability to play 3–5 popular and common songs (measurable and achievable). For this goal my core values would be both sociability as wel as learning songs people will generally enjoy. An issue of concern (as an example) is making the time to practice. The plan also needs to factor in the assumption that no one really likes to hear people practice music. With these things worked out, I can start creating steps and tasks to achieve my goal.

Now a plan is great, but the “compass” is a critical component as well. The compass is the thing that helps measure and keep you on track. It is critical that your compass is never out of sight or out of mind.

The compass is made up of measurements and factors that the plan and the progress towards the goals are judged against.. It is about regular status checks to make sure you are progressing along the path set out in the plan.

Your goal might need to be broken down in smaller bites and measurable periods, so you can keep track with the compass to ensure that you’re indeed still on the right path. Weekly (or in some cases daily) and monthly check-ins are critical.

If my goal is to be a more recognized writer or personality, then I must quantify that in terms that can be relatively measured. Perhaps I have a yearly sales figure, which must then be broken down to monthly sales. If my plan determines that one blog post per week will help drive overall web views, then I must check off my achievement of those posts and measure the resulting impact in view perhaps in terms of measurement against a goal such as website views.

My compass will be a tool (or discipline) that allows me to accurately track that I’m on the right path to my goal, or a tool to alter my efforts if I’m getting too far off the path (as set by my plan).

By now you may be wondering about all the time that will be spent on the map and compass as opposed to the actual goal. That right there is the pressure of time you’re feeling. The real issue for most is that they are not satisfied with their time management. . These people are often in the category of team 2 (with the GPS). They are certain of where they are and where they are going, and have determined that action is critical. However, they rely solely on faith that they are on the “best” path (or even right path). They therefore spend this time unwisely. .

Perhaps in reality their goal, path and timing required some 12-hour days and a few 6-day weeks to achieve. But in the end, a lack of awareness of the actual passage of time (against their progress) leaves them frustrated when they come up short. Simply not factoring in the time needed with allowance for the the unanticipated obstacles and even failing to perceive the need to adapt on the fly can create a measure once cut twice reality.

Imagine this: a person who wishes to lose weight with their goal being 25 pounds in a realistic time frame. They have their scale and they have time, yet they lack a realistic plan of action which causes them to fall off track. This could be attributed to their lack of anticipation or factoring in plan assumptions or issues of concern. This frustration with their inability to master the goal (and time) make their efforts a demoralizing failure.

The ultimate truth is you have the time to do it right initially, and you *don’t* have the time to do it wrong. The key is to appreciate unmeasurable gain of time not lost in the future to lack of a solid plan and compass.

We all tend to discount that which can’t be quantified, namely time lost revising, pivoting, and backtracking. But if we use our time smartly by planning first then our efforts will produce results and progress. We unfortunately, tend to be more acutely aware of the time spent (and assumed lost) in planning and setting up our compass.

Our instinct is to go with what we can see and quantify, however those with experience realize the map and compass are worth the effort and time.

So next time you feel there aren’t enough hours in a day, ask yourself “Do I have a plan?” and if your plan is solid, then start by asking when was the last time you looked at your compass?

# Choose Greatness over Comfort.

## “I’m continually trying to make choices that put me against my own comfort zone. As long as you’re uncomfortable, it means you’re growing.” — Ashton Kutcher

![PC: Mykie Valenzuela](1*mQr_alcDVzY2phYDv5V1Jw.jpeg)*PC: Mykie Valenzuela*

I want you to think about this question, **“Am I comfortable?”**

Your answer is most likely yes, at least in many areas of your life. I am here to challenge you to change that answer to no.

I would imagine that many of you are thinking, **“Why would I want to be uncomfortable?”** My answer is simple: **to become great!**

I’m not asking you to trade in your comfort for a life of misery, anxiety and unhappiness. **I want you to trade in your comfort for greatness.** Many of us wish to accomplish great things and live life to the full potential it offers, but we find ourselves back in the same spot time and time again. We allow the mindlessness comfort of our lives to keep us exactly where we are, and why shouldn’t we? Things are relatively easy in that state. **However, deep down you will always long for more growth.**

**You cannot be happy, fulfilled, or great, without continued growth and improvement.**

Comfort makes us accept where we are and gives us excuses for not moving forward. Tim Ferriss wrote, **“People will choose unhappiness over uncertainty.”** That statement is true, and very sad. I challenge you not to be one of those people.

Uncertainty is scary. Being uncomfortable is hard. However, being less than you know you can be is scarier and much harder.

**If you want to do something great; if you want to be someone great; If you want to get the very most that life has to offer, then I challenge you to get uncomfortable.**

**Step outside your comfort zone because everything you want to become is waiting for you on the other side!**
<|endoftext|>

# This is How to Get Out of Your Comfort Zones&#58; “Bring it ON!”

## This is How to Get Out of Your Comfort Zones: “Bring it ON!”

Do you remember the last time you had to step out of one of your comfort zones?

How did it make you feel?

Was your heart pounding in your chest? Your palms sweaty? Your mouth dry?

Stepping out of your comfort zones is, by definition, uncomfortable.

And it’s also one of the most important things you have to do.

Luckily, there’s a powerful strategy that makes it much easier.

### Your Potential Exists Outside Your Comfort Zones

Most people hate the feeling of discomfort so they do pretty much anything they can to avoid having to step out of their comfort zones.

They rationalize all kinds of excuses to get themselves out of challenging situations.

And while that is a pretty great way to alleviate immediate stress, it’s also a terrible way to realize your potential.

That’s a huge problem because, [as Abraham Maslow put it](http://www.selfication.com/happiness/how-to-feel-fulfilled/): *“If you deliberately plan on being less than you are capable of being, then I warn you that you’ll be unhappy for the rest of your life.”*

If you want to live a fulfilling and happy life, you have to [become the very best version of yourself](http://www.selfication.com/happiness/the-number-1-way-to-be-happy/).

And that requires you to step out of your comfort zone routinely. Why? Because that’s where every single great thing you’re capable of exists.

A fulfilling life is an uncomfortable life. To be happy, you need to [get comfortable being uncomfortable](http://www.selfication.com/mental-toughness/comfortable-being-uncomfortable/).

### Reverse Your Desire

Each time you get out of your comfort zone your going to experience a delightful cocktail of stress, fear, anxiety, pain, and doubt.

I say delightful not because I’m being sarcastic, but because that’s the attitude you need to bring to these challenges.

In their book, The Tools (1), psychotherapists Phil Stutz and Barry Michels refers to it as ”reversal of desire”; instead of avoiding pain, you learn to love it.

Within psychology, this technique is called ”cognitive reappraisal (2),” which means that you reinterpret the meaning of an emotional stimulus.

So, in other words, when you start to feel your heart pounding, palms getting sweaty, and your mouth drying up, you don’t perceive that as reasons to run and hide.

You instead choose to see these moments as the gifts they truly are — opportunities to step into your full potential!

### How to Get Out of Your Comfort Zones: ”BRING IT ON!”

This all might seem easier said than done. And it is. That’s why you have to practice it. Again, and again, and again.

The only way to get comfortable being uncomfortable is to desensitize to it. For each uncomfortable situation you put yourself through, you’ll notice that it gets just a little bit easier next time.

And luckily, Stutz and Michels describes a tool that makes the whole process easier.

The strategy is simple. The next time you start feeling even an inkling of fear, doubt, anxiety, etc., SCREAM to yourself ”BRING IT ON!!!”

Then continue the chant by yelling ”I LOVE PAIN!! PAIN SETS ME FREE!!”

I’ll admit it sounds a little nuts, but it’s true. Pain is the doorway to your ultimate potential.

So, step through it right now.

BRING IT ON!!

# This is the Best Way to Focus, Backed by Research

## This is the Best Way to Focus, Backed by Research

I got one of my first fully functioning cell phones back in the early 2000’s.

It was a beautiful piece of technology called the Nokia 3210 (1).

This badass phone had cutting edge features like a built-in antenna, vibrate alert function, and “picture messages” (not to be confused with actual photo messages).

But the best feature of them all was undoubtedly Snake. You know, the game where your job was to maneuver a line that grew in length for every pixel it ate?

### What Snake Can Teach Us About Deep Focus

If you’ve ever played this game, you know how hard it is. The longer your snake grows, the more concentration is needed to avoid crashing into yourself and ending the round.

And if you’re interrupted and have to hit pause (for example to check out a cool “picture message”), you’ll be much more likely to fail soon after returning to the game.

As it turns out, this happens to be an excellent example of a psychological effect known as “attention residue” (2).

Research has shown that there’s a cognitive cost involved with switching your attention (3).

Each time you turn your attention from one task to another, the first task will leave a “residue” that reduces your cognitive performance.

And that’s the case even if the switch is very brief.

So, whenever you’re interrupted from your game of Snake, the interruption will leave a residue that affects your play negatively when you return to it.

### Switching Costs at Work

Now, this article isn’t just about how to become a top-level Snake player (although that’s obviously very important, too).

The concept of attention residue is crucial to consider when you approach any kind of work.

Imagine that you’re deeply focused on a work task. Then someone or something interrupts your attention.

You might think that you’ll quickly switch back to the task once you’ve dealt with before the interruption. But, unfortunately, that’s not the case.

Each and every call, message, notification, alarm, and well-meaning colleague that knocks on your door has a switching cost.

And they’ll all leave an attention residue that gets in the way when you return to your work task.

### The Myth of Multitasking

Doing a lot of things at once can make you feel highly productive. But in reality, it’s quite the opposite.

The problem with multitasking is that you’re not really doing a lot of things at once.

You’re just switching your attention between tasks in a rapid fashion. And, as we’ve learned, each one of these switches involves a cost that causes you to work slower and less efficiently.

And even if you’re usually single-tasking, it’s important to know that mixing this work with a series of small “just checks” can be just as bad as multitasking.

Every quick check of your phone, email inbox or something else leaves some amount of attention residue that affects your focus negatively.

### The Best Way to Focus

The takeaway here is that deep focus requires you to** work for long blocks of time without any interruptions. **Here are some ideas for how to make that happen:

* **Plan proactively.** [Schedule time](http://www.selfication.com/weekly-planning/) blocks for deep, undisturbed focus. [Plan out](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-plan-effectively/) exactly what you will be working on and avoid switching tasks until it’s completed.

* **Remove distractions from your phone.** Take a deep dive into your phone settings and relentlessly remove all unnecessary apps and notifications. If you don’t decide your phone’s behavior, it will decide yours.

* **Remove distractions from your computer.** Delete unnecessary icons, apps and programs. Remove all notifications. Have your most important programs launch automatically when you start your computer.

* **Set up commitment devices.** Breaking old habits can be hard. Unless you remove the possibility of doing them, that is. Check out this list of [commitment devices](http://www.selfication.com/change-your-habits/) and implement the ones you’ll need to stay away from your usual distractions.

* **Create an interruption-free zone.** Let your colleagues, family, and friends know about your deep work blocks of time. Close your office door, set your phone in “do not disturb” mode and put on some ambient music (or something else that helps you get into the zone).

I hope this helps. Now, I’m off to play some Snake. Please, don’t disturb me. 😉

# How to Make Sure Your Team is as Brilliant as the People On It

## 

The Ford Pinto goes into production. Mortgage-backed securities bring down an economy. Vanilla Oreos are a thing.

One of the biggest pitfalls for a team of people working together is groupthink — the tendency for individuals on the team to go along with whatever the group seems to be deciding, simply because the group seems to be deciding it. After all, there’s no way *all* of these people can be wrong. Right?

If they’re not continually challenged, even strong, high performing teams can get complacent. And when they get complacent, the team members stop challenging each other, stop appropriately questioning one another’s conclusions, and stop making great decisions. Groupthink sets in.
> # “*If we are all in agreement on the decision, then I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about.”*
> # — Alfred Sloan, Former Chairman / CEO, General Motors

So how does a team avoid groupthink? First of all, they perform. It’s the definition of high-performing teams — they don’t get lulled into ‘because-that’s-what-everyone-seems-to-believe-itis.’ They continually push one another, asking each other the difficult or sometimes child-like obvious questions. They aren’t afraid, and they don’t hold back.

Some tools for avoiding groupthink:

**Host A Premortem. **You’re probably familiar with the concept of a Postmortem — or its more optimistic cousin the Lessons Learned Session — where the team dissects the root cause(s) of a failed project after the failure has occurred in an effort to avoid those causes in the future.

Premortems take place in the early- to mid-stages of a project, and get the team thinking about how the project might fail. “Pretend its 3 months after launch, and this project has failed. Write down as many reasons as you can think of for this failure.”

The team then examines their predicted root causes, and determines steps they can take to preempt the failure where feasible. Our pretend failure was because we didn’t engage the purchasing department early enough? We can do something about that now. We failed because global warming turned the entire surface of the planet into an ocean? Not so much. You get the idea.

**Have A Debate. **Even if you weren’t captain of your high school debate team, chances are you did this at some point during your education. The teacher assigned an issue, and assigned you to argue one side of the issue. Didn’t matter how you felt about gun control, your grade was based on how well you argued the side you were assigned to.

Try this in a project meeting with a contentious issue. Have everyone vote for what side they’re on, then make them argue the opposing side in a debate in your next meeting.

**Assign A Role. **Designate someone in the room as the Devil’s Advocate. Whenever the group seems to be at consensus, or when groupthink might be settling in, it’s the Devil’s Advocate’s responsibility to speak up and do their thing. Rotate this responsibility so that everyone on the team has a chance to take on this role and to keep it fresh.

Whatever approach you take, address groupthink head on. Talk about it with the team. Discuss measures you want to take as a group to avoid the trap. This will keep it front and center in everyone’s mind, and will keep them on the lookout. Even better, they won’t be afraid to talk about it when they sense the team falling into it.

# Is Red Light Therapy Safe?

## Is Red Light Therapy Safe?

### The Truth about Red Light Therapy Side Effects

Deep penetrating red light therapy is actually a *non invasive, cost-effective, alternative *treatment to all sorts of skin problems, skin appearance and is very effective as a natural pain reliever.

But:

I**s red light therapy safe **and what are the side effects?

Red light easily penetrates the skin, boosts circulation and bringing more blood and nutrients to the area.

It also stimulates vital collagen and elastin production. Collagen helps plump the skin, while elastin firms the skin.

**The red light is **energizing and repairing damaged cells, stimulating collagen and elastin and giving the skin back its youthful look.

## **What is Red Light Therapy and How Does it Work?**

Developed by NASA to heal wounds, red light therapy was found to promote and speed up skin regeneration.

This is what makes red light therapy so effective in removing scars and general skin rejuvenating.

(**Read: [4 Astonishing Skin Benefits of Red Light Therapy](http://www.infrared-light-therapy.com/red-light-therapy-skin-benefits/)**)

Red light is able to penetrate the skin to a depth of 8 — 10mm encouraging the cells to naturally stimulate the production of collagen and elastin.

The anti-aging effect is produced by increased collagen adding volume to the skin and extra elastin firming and toning the skin.

Red light penetrates to the bottom of the dermis down to the fatty layer; which also makes it beneficial as a natural anti-inflammatory.

**Is Red Light Therapy Safe?**
> Laboratory studies have shown that skin cells grow 150 — 200 percent faster when exposed to certain light wavelengths, and research studies have shown red light penetrates the epidermal layer of the skin and begins to heat the dermis.
> With the rise in temperature, new collagen and elastin is naturally produced by our body, delivers powerful therapeutic benefits to living tissue.

The result?

Increasing your own production of collagen which in turn smooths and reduces wrinkles and creates more youthful looking skin.

**(Read: The [9 Best Red Light Therapy Home Devices](http://www.infrared-light-therapy.com/red-led-light-therapy-comparison/) in 2018)**

## **Is Red Light Therapy Safe for The Eyes?**

According to the FDA, red light at 633nm has a “non-significant risk” status and is completely safe for the eyes.

## **Can Red Light Therapy Damage Your Skin?**

Too much sunlight can affect the skin due to the emission of broad spectrum ultraviolet energy through the atmosphere.

Red Light treatment bed lamps utilize the visible spectra of light at 633nm (red), but contain no UVA or UVB rays.

## **What’s the Difference Between Red Light Therapy and Laser Treatments?**

Red light therapy does not cut, burn or break the skin as with laser treatments. It produces no vaporization or burning of the tissue, and therefore no inflammation or erythema.

## **Does Red Light Therapy Work for ALL Skin Types?**

The Collagen Red Light Therapy is safe and effective for all skin types and colors. The main prerequisite is that skin be clean for effective light transmission.

## **Are There Any Short Term Side Effects?**

There are some testimonials of skin redness after treatments. This side effect is usually caused by improper use of red light therapy, especially over-use.

Any side effect can be avoided by following the manufacturer’s instructions and not being tempted to speed up results by over-use.

## **How to Choose a Red Light Therapy Home Device**

There are many red light therapy home devices, and it can be quite over whelming to choose the right device for you.

You should know that some red light therapy devices are FDA approved, yet some are not.

[**This is a simple (but complete) guide](http://www.infrared-light-therapy.com/red-led-light-therapy-comparison/) to choosing a led light therapy home device.**

It will help you find out the best type of device for you, based on your specific needs, and will give you examples of FDA-approved red light therapy devices.

# How to Be a More Influential Person

## A counterintuitive way to sell anything

![Photo: [http://www.freeimages.com/photo/for-sale-1563827](http://www.freeimages.com/photo/for-sale-1563827)](1*2HajlSzS2ZlNaJOcr4ljRQ.jpeg)*Photo: [http://www.freeimages.com/photo/for-sale-1563827](http://www.freeimages.com/photo/for-sale-1563827)*

I’ve sold three cars by advertising their flaws.

I am not a salesperson, at least not in the traditional sense. We’re all selling something in some way or another.

But I am not a *professional* salesman.

This explains why, when I need to sell a car, I tell the prospective buyer everything that’s wrong, malfunctioning, or in need of repair.

This explains why I feel a deeply rooted need to make sure the buyer knows exactly what he or she is getting — warts and all.

My stereotype of a professional salesman is that they don’t care about either.

However, I have sold three cars within the past few years. Each car sold to the first person who looked at it. Each sold for a price above what I was willing to take. Each with the buyer driving away knowing that the vehicle had a lot of problems.

There’s a greater lesson to learn here about a particular form of honesty and its relationship to influence.

![](0*E11KD1tOlacq1prI.)

## You Might Not Sell a Product, But You Probably Sell Ideas

A colleague of mine, Anne, is an engineering director at a large industrial manufacturer in the Midwest. Anne had a new idea, but like many large industrial manufacturers in that region, her company seemed like the place that new ideas went to die.

Touring one of the company’s overseas plants, Anne noticed a system that allowed any employee on the manufacturing line to raise an alert on a quality issue. The system worked. The plant had the highest quality rating of the company’s two dozen manufacturing sites. Line workers used the system regularly, and the result was that the company saved tens of millions of dollars in warranty and recall costs.

Anne compared this with her experiences in the company’s U.S. plants, where employees tended to take a “not my job” approach, afraid to call out teammates’ potential assembly mistakes or admit to their own.

If you’ve read *The Toyota Way*, you may be familiar with similar dynamics. U.S. and Japanese car manufacturers had a similar dynamic, with one empowering the workers and the other trying to systematize them to the point of mindlessness.

![[flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/photos/52248755@N03/4814796133)](1*NF9L5p6xkdQGkeSWBQOYtg.jpeg)*[flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/photos/52248755@N03/4814796133)*

On the flight home, Anne thought about how to import that system to the United States: Who would she need to involve, what obstacles would she encounter, and how long might it all take? While it would take time and certainly wouldn’t be easy, it would be relatively straightforward. She could think of six or seven other similar manufacturing processes that the company had implemented across plants. There was a blueprint.

Then she got her idea.

What if that same system could be adapted to her company’s engineering work?

The company’s engineers had many of the same issues as the assembly workers. Driven relentlessly by senior management to meet cost and delivery targets, the engineers faced underlying negative consequences for speaking up if they noticed substandard technical work or a poor decision. So they stayed quiet, and the company’s products were suffering. Market share was nearing an all-time low, as was the engineering organization’s morale.

Anne saw the potential in this idea and knew it could change the culture of her organization. She also knew that she couldn’t implement the idea herself. It was going to take support from her boss, and her entire team was going to need to buy-in.

Anne secured 20 minutes on the agenda in her boss’s next staff meeting to pitch her idea. When she stood up to present, many of the team members were checking their phones or tapping away on their laptops.

“I have an idea,” Anne started, “and it has all kinds of problems.”

Most of the eyes in the room were suddenly fixed on her. Laptops were ignored. Phones retreated face-down to the table.

![](0*Gf7xASOLcFUbkn8y.)

## How and Why Leading With Flaws Works

In his book [*Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World](http://www.adamgrant.net/originals)*, Adam Grant outlines several benefits of Anne’s technique. It turns out that being up-front and honest about an idea’s flaws can actually help “sell” the idea to skeptical audiences. Here’s the how and why.

### **1. It’s disarming.**

The audience is expecting you to sell them on the strengths of your proposal, not tell them what’s wrong with it. They’ve come prepared to poke holes in your idea, to shoot it down, to find reasons not to pursue it. When you do it for them, you catch them off-guard. It’s surprising, and you’re likely to have their full attention. Disarmed, they’re more willing to truly listen to the merits of your idea.

### **2. You seem smarter.**

[Teresa Amabile’s research](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022103183900343) has shown that we perceive negative, critical reviewers of intellectual work as more intelligent than positive, effusive reviewers. We’ll judge the film critic who rips the movie apart as smarter than the one who lavishes praise upon it. We’ll assume the positive reviewer was somehow “duped” into thinking the film was worth the small-business loan it takes to go to the movies. How smart can he possibly be if he thought it was *that *great? And who’s paying him off, anyway? Being openly critical of your own idea can raise the audience’s assessment of your IQ.

### **3. You’re perceived as more trustworthy.**

Accentuating the flaws in an idea you’re selling to a skeptical audience shows transparency and authenticity. One of the guys who bought a car from me said to a mutual friend, “He knew everything about the car, including everything that was wrong with it. I felt like I *had* to buy it.” You leave your audience with the feeling that they truly understand what they’re getting, not the sales pitch version of it.

### **4. The audience likes your idea more**.

By presenting the flaws, it makes it more difficult for your audience to find more of them, and they’re left with a more positive impression of your proposal.

![](0*P-MFARFs7Ie2pSH5.)

## Turning Skeptics into Advocates

The real magic of selling ideas by accentuating the flaws comes next, when you turn the audience of problem-seeking, let-me-find-the-holes-in-this-argument skeptics into advocates seeking to help you resolve the issues.

By presenting flaws instead of selling points, you kick your audience’s brains out of problem-finding mode and into problem-solving mode. You’ve given them a problem to solve, and they’ll be more than happy to oblige.

Disarmed and engaged by your approach, your audience automatically stops trying to figure out what’s wrong with your idea and starts thinking about solutions to the problems you’ve presented.

![[Photo: Tomasz Stasiuk](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zstasiuk/5650719702)](1*5eUKSiPwqVHqSQgQLaCBeA.jpeg)*[Photo: Tomasz Stasiuk](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zstasiuk/5650719702)*

And now they’re hooked. Bought in. They’ve participated in making your idea even better, solved a problem you couldn’t solve on your own, and it isn’t just *your* idea anymore.

**It’s *their* idea, too.**

And the next time you encounter an unexpected roadblock, the next time you need to replan, the next time you need to convince a member of the leadership team that your project makes business sense and is going to pay off after implementation, it won’t just be you doing the convincing.

![](0*zKJQZ0rd6J5tJalK.)

## My Latest Sale

I just sold a 2009 Toyota minivan with lots of miles on it. We used it to haul three young boys to all the places that you haul three young boys, including several cross-country road trips. It’s well worn and has mechanical issues.

There’s a small leak in the air-conditioning system, and it needs to be recharged with freon every summer. The lamp on the passenger-side seat warmer indicator is out. The glove compartment sticks shut, and you have to bang it with the heel of your hand in just the right spot to get it to open.

I disclosed all of this within the first 10 minutes of talking to the first potential purchaser. I even showed him how to bang the glove compartment open. I gave him the key to take it for a drive, and he offered me a credit card as collateral. I shook my head.

“I trust you.”

He returned a short while later. We shook hands. I’d sold another vehicle.

# My Information Vacation for an Overflowing Brain

## 

Do you feel like there’s so much information that you can’t possibly keep up?

Do you cringe every time your friend says ‘did you see that post/click on that link/read that book?

## Maybe you need an Information Vacation.

As an entrepreneur and for the most part, a solopreneur, I am constantly in need of researching to learn about various aspects of my business, on top of what I need to know to stay up to date on my industry and clients needs.

For example, this week I’ve spent time researching:

*YouTube Creator and YouTube Academy*

*Updates to Google Apps*

*Marketing workshops*

*If topical magnesium is better than oral*

*The Ayurveda diet*

*How the travel industry uses data*

*Recovery techniques*

*How lack of vacation affects productivity for employees*

*Modules for my Integrative Nutrition Health Coaching Program*

*What aspects of my speech will be judged in the Toastmasters Humorous Speech competition*

Since I perform 95% of the aspects of my business, or at least have to learn them to let my VA know what I need, I can easily get overwhelmed with everything I have to digest. This is in contrast to my former job as a Corporate Trainer where I was mostly creating and didn’t spend much time in the learning process unless it was just learning to regurgitate and then move on. That was mostly a ‘doing’ job. When you are new to a job or chosen career field the amount of information you take in seems infinite.

I schedule in one [Pomodoro](http://www.marceyrader.com/productivity-2/forced-focus-tomato-can-make-produce-sauce/) of research time every day during the week, which might include reading the newsletters, posts or videos that I’ve subscribed to, and four Pomodoros on Saturday.

When I first started my business it was 90% learning. Of course I won’t ever stop increasing my knowledge, but at some point research has to be on the negative end of your time since it doesn’t buy your groceries or pay your light bill. When you have to prioritize your learning, focus on what’s ultimately income-producing. This week I needed to decide between researching YouTube Academy or Odesk. Since part of my marketing is through videos, that’s what I chose.

It’s easy to get sucked in to reading every blog post in your inbox, link on social media or book that someone recommends. I have a Goodreads queue that I may never get through and that’s okay. It’s not my job to get through it. I have a Netflix queue with recommendations from friends but I pretty much just watch one hour a night with my husband with maybe an extra hour some evenings in the winter (Favorites are Downton Abbey, Luther and Sherlock). I listen to podcasts at home all the time, whether it’s while I’m cleaning, getting ready in the morning and sometimes having lunch or dinner. My top three right now are — Tim Ferriss, Chris Kresser, and Ben Greenfield Fitness.

As a fairly-new entrepreneur I can’t take vacations every quarter like I want to, but I have made the decision to take an information vacation every quarter for one week. Hold me to it people!
> # One week every three months I am going to NOT LEARN!!!

What will I gain from this?

*More time to spend on my business working on what I already know*

*More time to digest what I learned in the previous three months*

*More time to read for fun or watch movies that have been in my queue for almost a year*

*More time for hanging out*

This doesn’t mean I’m not going to work unless it’s also a scheduled vacation. I’ll just be focusing more on **doing**. I’m going to strategically plan them out so that they fall in line with already scheduled vacations or holidays. I had my first one December 22–28 and it felt wonderful.

# Thoughts on Intentional action

## Photography by David Yarde (http://davidyarde.com/photography/)

The past few weeks have been crazy. Days starting anywhere between 5:00- 6:30 am and filled with meetings, redesigns and strategy sessions. Rounded out with a conference that required preparation for a presentation and a panel moderation, and just when it seems like there’s a moment to breathe there is even more on the to-do list to be done. So much to do, so little time and even less time to hear oneself think.

In the midst of this, one thought has persisted with me. Intentional action. The ability to merge discipline with passion and forward motion. The drive to never give in regardless of the pain or heartache. The will to succeed above all odds.

It seemed as if every conversation I had, this theme would be present. It was as if everyone unanimously got tired of being counted out, pushed aside or used and drew the line in the sand when it came to the outlook they had on the future.

If one listened quietly enough, the chants of a crowd in full support of those willing to keep pushing forward and upward could be heard.

## Push against the fear

Often, I’m asked how I found the time to write a book, or where I find the time to volunteer while being a business owner. Usually, my response is something along the lines of not quite being sure, that all I really remember is really wanting to write a book and stumbled into participating in a NaNoWriMo one year.

The part I rarely share is how I couldn’t bring myself to publishing it out of fear. I didn’t feel important enough to publish a book and I didn’t think anyone would read it.

After much internal debate and immense help with editing from a cousin of mine, I published my first book on my twenty-sixth birthday and went skydiving a couple days later.

Looking back I’m glad I took that risk, I learned what worked and what didn’t. I came away with an experience that I can share with my daughter someday versus looking back and asking what if.

**Sometimes when we fear things it’s a sign for us to push forward and aim upward even more.** Nothing can be gained from sitting on the sidelines and nothing can be improved upon without a point to learn from.

Life gives us only a few chances to do amazing things, why spend time waiting for the perfect moment?

## Climbing passion mountain

Growing up, every kid gets hit with the rhetorical question of, what do you want to be when you grow up? We admire the answers kids give and if we were to look back at what we wanted to be, I’m sure there would be a chuckle somewhere.

There are many things we like to do, a lot of things we have to do but few things we truly love to do.

**Once we find the things we truly love to do, that’s when the journey up the mountain actually begins.** We’ll find valleys of discouragement, loose rocks of risk and a peak that is worth every step of the way up.

It’s a path that has no shortcuts. It’s a path few are willing to take. Instead, many trade a life filled with possibility for one of safety and mediocrity. Allowing their dreams to rot alongside the way and neglecting to see the community that is willing to support them.

For years, I’ve dreamed about working for myself and using my business as a platform to really help people. To make a real difference within a community and inspire someone to make their dream a reality using the skills I’ve built up since the start of my career.

At first, it seemed to be impossible and it didn’t help having people around that only saw all the reasons why it would fail. Thankfully, I had more people around me that were encouraging me to continue forward.

It’s been over ten years since I’ve had that dream and I’m ever thankful that now I have an opportunity to work on that dream.

Right now your passion may feel more like a hobby than a way to support the requirements you need to live or raise a family, but that is no reason to give up on that dream.

***Every day, do something that helps you get closer to the point where you can live and work on your dream.*** Some days will be tougher than others, but with each step forward, you’ll one day reach the top of the mountain.

The journey to the top is never completed alone. Whether the team is visible or not, success is always a result of a combined effort.

## Embrace the community

We often ignore being an entrepreneur, philanthropist or whatever non-traditional career path we may have dreamed about.

Chalk it up to fear, procrastination or discouragement in some other form, we fail to get out of our individual perception bubble. We get locked into thinking that we have to do everything alone. That the burden is solely on our shoulders. When in reality it isn’t.

Sure, not every person we meet will be genuinely good but that doesn’t mean everyone is bad.

What we contribute to the communities we are a part of, tends to come back around and affect us in either positive or negative ways.

**The more good we create, is the more good we’ll be able to enjoy.**

In the end, it’s up to us to choose whether or not we’ll give in to fear, pursue our dreams even if the odds are stacked against us or how responsible we are as members of our community.

What will you choose?

# The Many Faces of Adventure

## The Many Faces of Adventure

I’ve always been enamored with stories of men and women taking great risks, discovering new places and being heroes of their time. I’ve always wanted to live a life full of these stories, full of adventures. But my attempts at adventure seeking have always been pretty disappointing.

In high school anything that was against the general norm was a playground for potential adventure. Skipping school, partying and experimenting with all types of substances had me convinced the world of adventure had opened before me. In reality, most of the time I was listening to bad music and wondering when things would get better. In college, it was more of the same minus a few substances. After a couple drinks I thought of myself as a captain of adventures. Never sleeping, hanging with kids who hopped trains and sleeping with girls I just met felt adventurous. But, it was all pretty pointless in the end and definitely not worth the hangovers.

It hasn’t all been pointless. In the last ten years, I’ve traveled. I’ve tried new things. I’ve learned a lot. But none of it has amounted to the grand adventures I see in movies or read in books. Those larger than life experiences, those sweeping moments of high excitement and intrigue have eluded me. My adventures have been mild at best.

Until recently.

Today, I have a new definition of adventure. I used to think adventure was simple. I used to think it consisted of extreme tests of human strength, endurance or fearlessness. I used to think you had to travel to exotic places or take life-threatening risks or live a life with no rules. It was a simple choice: live on the fringe or be normal and boring. But that’s bullshit.

In fact, adventure is simple. But not in the way I thought. Adventure is anything you do by choice that has an unpredictable outcome. That’s it. It doesn’t require you to go cliff diving or walk across America. Viewed in this way, adventure waits around every corner.

Talking to that woman you see everyday, the one you’ve never met but has you dreaming of a future together. That’s adventure. Finally challenging your client who’s been a jerk through this entire project and doesn’t truly understand your vision for the work. That’s adventure. Being honest about the time you cheated, signing up for that marathon or starting your fifth band because this time its gonna work, that’s adventure.

It took a series of misadventures for me to realize my perception of adventure was completely off. I was trying to emulate something I saw in the stories of others, instead of attempting to write my own. Through tons of encouragement and some fortunate achievements I began to define my own path. As I started to pursue the things I was interested in – writing, meaningful conversation and community involvement – the highs and lows of emotion I experienced offered plenty of adventure. Investing myself in my goals connected me to my experiences. I was so committed to what I was doing that every misstep and success felt monumental, every action was life and death. I saw that it doesn’t take the adrenalin rush of running with the bulls to really feel something adventurous. Trying to pursue a goal that was meaningful to me had enough excitement and danger to fuel me for months!

The trouble with the idea of adventure-as-extreme is that it always takes us away from where we are. It always requires some level of escape. Hiking Everest, kayaking the Amazon, driving cross-country or buying a one-way ticket to Sumatra is undoubtedly adventurous. However, I’ve come to believe that it’s possible to find adventure where you are. It still takes risk, but it is an internal risk. It’s the risk we take when we question what we’ve come to know as true. When we challenge [the story of “I can’t.”](https://medium.com/american-dreamers/a5126c2ae1d1) When we let the fear of the unpredictable rest for a moment and move confidently towards a meaningful goal.

Drinks with kids who lived on trains, nights with girls in their prime and traveling with friends throughout Europe were fun for sure. I still keep those memories close to my heart. But it has been my adventures in self-discovery, in challenging my preconceived ideas and pursuing my deepest interests that have offered the opportunity for a life of continuous excitement and intrigue.

If you want adventure, don’t wait all year for that two-week vacation to finally experience some excitement. Let yourself have adventures every day. Talk to someone new. Be honest about your feelings. Make something and share it with the world.

Adventure is waiting. Go grab it.

# Enjoy Life Now

## Enjoy life now, this is not a dress rehearsal. – Unknown
*Private fishing boat tour of the bay around Cat Ba Island in Vietnam*

**Enjoy life now… seems like it should go without saying, but sometimes enjoyment is the very thing we forget to do while living.**

We function, we act, we do, we perform, while enjoyment gets relegated to back burners and two week vacations amidst year long 40 hour work weeks. We daydream of better days and brighter tomorrows, but our decisions and plans revolve around procuring the same today.

I remember this story from [The Alchemist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FCKC4C?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B000FCKC4C&linkCode=shr&tag=myaddlife-20&linkId=2GI6WSRRYGXTAKLU) of a shopkeeper that owned a crystal store. He promised himself that one day when he made enough money or had enough time that he’d take a trip to Mecca. Eventually after years of working, the time came that he could afford the investment, but he decided against it because dreaming about it seemed so much more alluring than actually going. *What if it wasn’t the way he imagined? What if it didn’t prove to be as interesting as it was in his dreams? *Somewhere along the way he convinced himself that yearning for dreams was better than realizing them. I found it so odd at the time, even silly. But how many times had I done the same?

But this quote is quite the wake up call, this really isn’t a dress rehearsal. As far as time is concerned, there are no do overs when you think about it. Once that year is gone, it’s over – there’s no way to reclaim the time or relive the past.

But there is a way to make amends. **You can enjoy life now.**

Maybe yesterday’s decisions didn’t pan out so well, but it doesn’t mean that all is lost. You can still take **this moment – **this very moment and do something. You can enjoy life now. If you make the best of your present and live for today – then tomorrow works itself out in the end.

All you ever really have is today.

# The importance of self-care in parenthood

## The importance of self-care in parenthood

Four and a half years ago, I became a parent. And almost two years ago, just as we were settling into the routine of one toddler, I became a parent of two. Life changed pretty substantially. The irony of parenthood is that it reveals all your areas for improvement, and simultaneously takes away 95% of the time you could use to work on those areas.

In some ways, parenting is the ultimate leadership position. There are small humans whose template for how to be a person in this world is *you. *“Do as I say, not what I do” just doesn’t work with highly perceptive young children, soaking everything up like a massive sponge.* *It’s a huge responsibility and an enormous privilege.

The great thing about kids is that they really test your emotional well-being at all times, so whether or not I’m taking care of myself is abundantly clear to me at home. When I’m not taking care of myself, I can’t believe I signed up for 18+ years of this. My daughter picks up on my internal state, and will ask me why I’m not happy. Or she starts to act up, letting out loud *“UGHHHH”* groans when I don’t do exactly as she demands. On the other hand, when I’m taking care of myself, I can find delight in the smallest interactions with my children.

Self-care does not come easily to me. I’m writing about it, but I’m not very good at it. That’s why the post is “The Importance of…” not “How to…” Writing this post and clarifying my own thoughts is part of my own struggle to find time for self-care. In sharing tips about self-care, I’m hoping that I will get better at it myself — sort of like when I tell people they should try meditation because the science shows it’s really good for you, but I haven’t established a meditation practice myself.

Here are some of the common traps I find that I fall into.

## Common self-care traps

### *Shouldn’t I be doing &lt;something productive&gt;?*

I do this one all the time, including right now as I write this post. In fact, for the first time in a few weeks, I have a few hours of unscheduled time. And I’m using it to write about self-care. Other things I considered doing include but are not limited to: re-caulking our bathtub, reading a leadership book, full email audit, and clearing leaves off the roof.

### *“Self-care”*

I’m really good at this one too, and it looks like reading a few pages of my dry book on being a successful consultant. Or watching Netflix while folding laundry so I don’t feel guilty just watching Netflix. Or what I did a month ago when I had a day off, which was to check out a new local co-working space. Exciting!

### *Only use in case of emergency*

When my youngest was 6 months old, I told my husband I desperately needed a break, and stayed overnight at a nearby Airbnb. I ate a burger and watched *The Good Wife*. All too often, self-care is reserved for catastrophic times — when burnout is imminent or has already occurred. As a parent, I feel guilty carving out that time for myself unless I’ve reached a breaking point. And we both work in the tech industry, which does not help — companies proudly advertise their 70–90 hour workweek, and success is often tied to long hours and busyness, despite [abundant research](https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies) that says otherwise.

Self-care is still very much of a struggle for me. My kids are 4.5 and almost 2 years old. They demand a lot of attention. I’ve started my own coaching business, which affords me some flexibility in my schedule, but I sometimes feel even more driven to take every call or coffee to build my business. But it’s clear when I have a week or day when I don’t take any time for myself. When the weekend rolls around, and I’ve cared too much for others and not enough for myself, I’m impatient with my kids and husband.

Over the years, here are things that have worked at times.

## Give your future self permission

Somehow I find it easier to be kind to my future self than my present self. Schedule ahead — block off time to do something that brings you joy. Before my husband and I had the second child, we used to alternate having a night off each week. If I hadn’t made plans with a friend, I just read at a coffee shop after work and had some much-needed alone time.

## Take time off work — but don’t go anywhere

This is an especially good one for people like parents who have weekend obligations. The idea of taking time off and hauling small children somewhere for a “vacation” is *daunting*. I’d rather go to work. But if you have regular childcare already, take a day off every quarter or however often you can pull it off. No need to pay for babysitting! If you have a partner and can pull off coordinating time off, it can be a great time to reconnect and have a long day date.

## Find a #treatyoself crew

I’m in a slack team for moms in tech, and I created a #treatyoself channel, in which channel participants share tips and indulgences. Being part of a community can give you new ideas for self-care. I lamented to a friend that massages are expensive, and she suggested some low-cost alternatives like spending time at a coffee shop and writing some cards to friends (and *not* responding to emails). We’re much kinder in our advice to our friends than we are to ourselves. *“You deserve it! Take the day off! Get a massage 💆!” *So find a friend or community who will tell you those things you need to hear.

Even though I rationally know that I can be a better partner and parent if I take care of myself, I still feel guilty and selfish for doing so. There is always pressure to give more and more of yourself to being a parent — to sign up for yet another music class, or go to so-and-so’s birthday party who you’ve never heard of. If not for yourself, do it for your kids, so that they may default to a healthier sense of balance and self in their own lives.

Earlier this year, I travelled internationally to Singapore by myself for a week to visit a friend. This was so outside my comfort zone of what I thought was ok for me to do as a mother of two children. But as I talked to my husband and explored my own hangups on the issue, I realized that I really needed the vacation, but I also wanted my daughter (my son was too young at the time) to see me taking care of myself and my needs.

I hope that she can see that I have an identity and life outside of being a mom, especially as she grows into adulthood.

# Five Motivations to be a Better Human

## Here are some quick thoughts and reads to help motivate you this week.

## #1. Gets Measured, Gets Done

I see variants on this quote all the time, but this is by far my favorite:
> # “What gets measured gets done, what gets measured and fed back gets done well, what gets rewarded gets repeated.” ~ [John E. Jones](http://www.thebusinessofgood.org/articles/september-quote-john-e-jones/)

Why is this my favorite version? Well, it’s because there’s no point in merely getting work done unless you’re going to do it well and repeatedly.

## #2. A Note-Taking System For Self Awareness and Learning

We’re all the way up to episode #8 on the Better Humans podcast and [this episode](https://www.betterhumanspodcast.com/listen/a-note-taking-system-to-increase-self-awareness-and-learn-more-from-life-with-slvia-bastos-008) from [Sílvia Bastos](https://twitter.com/this_is_silvia) is an excellent, mind-expanding trip.

If you like her episode, make sure to subscribe to the podcast: [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/better-humans-podcast/id1466824826), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1AdDlJGcsaGitlSeDbf9pV) and [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/matt-east/better-humans-podcast)

## #3. Something I’ve been meaning to try: Float Tanks

Have you tried a float tank? What did you think? If you’re thinking of trying one, read this article from [John Fawkes](https://twitter.com/johnfawkes): [Is Floatation Therapy the Ultimate Mind Hack?](https://medium.com/better-humans/is-floatation-therapy-the-ultimate-mind-hack-8bb7b543f647)

## #4. A Productivity Listicle and Assessment

How many of these [84 Productivity Killers](https://medium.com/better-marketing/84-productivity-killers-and-how-to-avoid-them-804d9416fdc5) have you experienced today? I only counted three for myself, but the day is young.

## #5. Three Gratitude Methods

This is a [nice article on gratitude](https://medium.com/better-marketing/3-methods-of-gratitude-that-can-immediately-transform-your-life-c84754d1c25c) that I’m grateful to have published. What are you grateful for?

# The ‘TEAR-FActory’ Personal Trainer Model for habit formation

## 6 guiding principles of a Personal Trainer that’ll help you design a new breed of products that enable people to achieve their life goals

![](1*zhb3AJp0VTmOlAMbrVZ1tg.png)

There is no dearth of health and fitness apps that promise to help you improve your life in every meaningful way possible. They can help you lose weight, stop drinking and smoking, eat well, sleep better, exercise more, be fitter, track any body metric you can imagine, run, bike, practice yoga, meditate, challenge your brain, train your thoughts, regulate your emotions, be more mindful in your day and basically be just that bit more happier.

These apps are in many ways like a personal trainer in your pocket. But are they able to fully deliver on that promise?

Here are the key principles of the model I’ve developed, that great personal trainers abide by and you can use to make your product more effective at creating healthy habits that stick.

***TEAR-FAc**tory** **is an acronym for Trust, Education, Assessment, Regimen, Feedback and Accountability.

1. **TRUST
Establish credibility and build trust**: Come across as an authority on the subject matter; people believe and follow trainers they can trust. Share evidence for the scientific validity of the activities you are asking your users to do. Showcase your past results to establish your credibility (social-proof principle). The best Personal Trainers form a personal bond (therapeutic alliance principle) with the user, show up consistently and effect beneficial change by enabling people to help themselves.

1. **EDUCATION
Educate interactively**: Teach the key points of the subject-matter by making the user interact with you/trainer or the education material in a playful manner to foster learning and maximize retention. A Personal Trainer employs thoughtfully put together content to facilitate the right mindset, clarify expected benefits and keep the user motivated.

1. **ASSESSMENT
Periodically assess motivation, beliefs, needs and goals. Understand relevant environmental & lifestyle factors: **It’s your job to** **understand and be on top of your user’s underlying motivations, beliefs, needs and goals. You should know about the lifestyle and environmental factors that tend to affect their goals. You should track this data diligently while being aware of periodic changes in any of the above factors.

1. **REGIMEN
Prescribe a personalized, always-adapting regimen or program: **Provide a personalized action plan of core activities; make them easier or turn up the difficulty based on user’s performance. Provide simple, clear instructions along with the activities, to get compliance that’ll build up to meaningful results. Start with micro-habits to get a user their first victory and increase the likelihood of habit formation. Focus on making it super easy to start the day’s activities. Adapt the regimen based on their changing needs.
A Personal Trainer fosters compliance to the right regimen and keeps user’s on track.

1. **FEEDBACK
Provide well-timed, personalized insights, user-effort based feedback and change recommendations: **Get the user to a first win early in their experience and if possible, make that win explicit. Give simplified but metrics based feedback derived from true data. Acknowledge and encourage good compliant behaviors. Discourage harmful practices and habits. Provide environment & lifestyle change recommendations as needed. Provide positive reinforcement to keep motivation high. Use negative reinforcement only to kick start the habit and to ensure compliance in the right manner. Most importantly, maintain variability in the feedback, so the user looks forward to the next step in the program.

1. **ACCOUNTABILITY
Create accountability: **Check-in with the user regularly and if possible daily. Get a user to make a solid commitment, preferably in writing. Provide scheduled reminders as triggers. Create pressure to comply by getting them to make their commitment or even their progress visible to friends and family.

# Are You a Curious Person?

## The answer is yes! You are curious! You clicked the link that brought you here, and you have the one quality we need to achieve anything, with enough time and patience.

## Being curious is like flipping a switch from dead end to finish line.

It is the difference between,

### “I know what I’m doing, so go away”

*to*

## “That is an interesting idea. What do you mean?”

The first one slams the door in the face of people who can help you: **EVERYONE**.

The second one invites them to participate in the process, which benefits both of you, and the project.

In our personal lives, we switch from,

### “I have no idea what I am doing,”

*to*

## “What can I try next?”

If you are curious to see how it works, you should try it out. Let me know how it goes.

# Success Requires a Change of Mind, Not New Year’s Promises

## You Need Action, Not Wishful Thinking

![Avoid wishful thinking. Jump into action instead. [Pic by Paul Bence](https://unsplash.com/@bency).](1*O69zqDgoce1vum4MzCnkTw.jpeg)*Avoid wishful thinking. Jump into action instead. [Pic by Paul Bence](https://unsplash.com/@bency).*
> Make New Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody’s ever made before. Don’t freeze, don’t stop, don’t worry that it isn’t good enough, or it isn’t perfect, whatever it is you’re scared of doing, do it.
> Make your mistakes, next year and forever.” ― Neil** **Gaiman

It’s *lying season* again.

Before December is over, half of those reading this piece will write their New Year’s resolutions. But only 8% of will succeed. **The problem is not making resolutions, but to turn the habit of breaking promises into a tradition.**

Don’t lie to yourself. That’s what happens when you set unrealistic goals or lack a clear plan to achieve them. Wishful thinking undermines your personal development. Avoid turning failure into your new normal.

You are the product of your broken promises. Before making new resolutions, reflect on your past attempts. The list is not *the* problem, your lack of method is.

This article doesn’t include the formula for success. But a framework to help you change from within.

## Five Reasons Why Resolutions Fail
> # “For last year’s words belong to last year’s language 
> # And next year’s words await another voice.” ― T.S. Eliot

Learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.

To adopt new behaviors, you need to let go past ones. To grow requires stretching beyond your comfort zone. But that doesn’t mean it has to be painful either.

Stretch yourself without stretching too thin. Only you can determine what’s the right tension.

![](1*zKs6RLN52Okrrgp4ojj6SA@2x.jpeg)

Most people fail because they set unrealistic goals. Don’t commit to run two marathons in 2018, if you don’t exercise at all. Resolving to become fitter won’t help either. It’s too unspecific. Challenge yourself without hurting your ability to succeed.

Before repeating the same mistakes as last year, reflect on what didn’t work. You don’t need new resolutions but a new mindset:

### **1. You are too rational or too emotional**
> “I would rather die of passion than of boredom.”― Émile Zola

Driving change requires using both sides of your brain. [You need passion to reach your goals](https://chopra.com/articles/why-you-need-passion-to-reach-your-goals#sm.00007ftnhx255f8pq9l23bmj1o03z). Embrace your resolutions with all your emotions. Own them, visualize them, enjoy them: turn your goals into a vision.

On the other hand, passion alone will take you nowhere. Building a clear plan will keep you focused and drive you into action. Having measurable goals will make you more accountable and help you monitor progress.

### **2. You set goals to please others**
> “I can’t give you a sure-fire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time.” ― Herbert Bayard Swope

Peer pressure is more prominent than we realize. It’s easy to get derailed by other people’s expectations. And their definition of success easily becomes ours.

Don’t fall into that trap. Set goals that are meaningful to you. Clarity and ownership drive motivation. Avoid pleasing others if you want to succeed.

### 3. You believe self-improvement is linear
> “Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.”― Winston S. Churchill

Most of us are taught that the path towards achievement is a logical one. *“Follow this hack, show up every day, and you will thrive.” *— they tell you. That’s why you expect to succeed at the first attempt.

Changing behaviors is not impossible, but it doesn’t happen overnight either. Expecting things to be too easy is as silly as to quitting because you reverted to ‘bad’ behaviors. The rhythm of the heart has waves and intervals. Life is not linear; everything is always in motion.

### 4. You are afraid to be happy:
> “Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.”― Ernest Hemingway

Self-doubt affects everyone from time to time. Happiness is much more than a smile or enjoying a movie. Happiness is a mental state that we desire and fear at the same time, [as I wrote here.](https://betterhumans.coach.me/this-is-why-you-are-afraid-of-being-happy-33b7302cfff7)

We all wish a perfect life. That’s why we build a list of resolutions. But, sometimes, we feel we don’t deserve them and boycott ourselves. Self-doubt puts our chances to achieve a better life in jeopardy.

### 5. You are chasing the formula for success
> “Have no fear of perfection — you’ll never reach it.” ― Salvador Dalí

If the formula for success existed, it would be available on Amazon at a much higher ticket price than that of a self-help book.

You won’t find the road to success on your GPS. [There are no shortcuts either](https://blog.liberationist.org/your-life-is-not-a-trip-to-the-supermarket-2451f2d11d50). Real change happens from within. Stop looking for outside solutions, spend that time doing soul searching instead.

Become your flaws best friend. If you accept your weaknesses, you will be able to benefit from your strengths to the fullest. Self-pity, guilt, self-doubt, envy, remorse, frustration, chase you because you don’t accept who you are.

Become your own best friend. [Self-acceptance will remove unnecessary emotions that get in your way](https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-shadow-of-the-man-i-used-to-be-c13dcc7c65e7).

## A Seven-Step Approach to Change
> # “A new you can still emerge from the old you.”―**Bamigboye Olurotimi**

Use these steps as a framework to drive change. Take the principles and experiment with them. Tweak them, adjust them, or replace them as needed. It’s your life, and you are its Chief Designer.

## 1. Start by reconnecting with your purpose
> “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. “ — Mahatma Gandhi

Live your life the way you want to be remembered. Your life’s purpose should be the North Star that guides your resolutions. When you have clarity on your ‘why’ it’s easier to find motivation and stick to your goals.

We take life for granted. The (false) belief that we will live forever is why we waste our time. When you accept that life is uncertain, it’s easier to focus on what really matters. Check out this exercise to i[dentify your life purpose by writing your own obituary](https://medium.com/personal-growth/is-not-how-you-live-but-how-you-die-that-matters-f1ddcaac1ea2).

## 2. Adopt a learning mind
> “The capacity to learn is a gift; the ability to learn is a skill; the willingness to learn is a choice.” — Brian Herbert

New Year’s resolutions are full of uncertainty. We know what we want, but we don’t know what we are getting into. Learning a new sport or how to play an instrument is fun at the beginning. Initial progress gets us excited. But the more we learn, the more we realize how little we know. And that can be daunting.

[One of the reasons people quit is that they compare their abilities ](https://medium.com/@GusRazzetti/the-learning-mind-how-to-stop-fighting-what-you-dont-know-c1a184decc6e)when they are beginning to those who’ve already mastered the subject. Adopting an *ignorant mindset* can free yourself. Instead of worrying about what you don’t know, think of yourself as a blank canvas. Celebrate every brush stroke as progress without being obsessed with how the final artwork would look like.

## 3. Embrace rejection and failure
> “If you live for people’s acceptance, you will die from their rejection.” — Lecrae

We are all wired to let others dictate how *we *feel about ourselves. That’s why we fear rejection.

But no one knows you as well as you. People might not trust your ability to learn something new. Or maybe laugh at you because you tried to lose weight many times before and failed. **Don’t let rejection stop you. Use it to keep you on your toes.**

No one can tell you how strong you are but your actions. [Turn rejection into fuel](https://blog.liberationist.org/why-i-love-being-rejected-and-you-should-too-310a45615570) to make your resolutions come true.

## 4. Make choices and prioritize
> “Action expresses priorities.” ― Mahatma** **Gandhi

Those who want everything get nothing. Having too many goals can be as damaging as having none at all.

Every new year is full of hope and magic. And it’s easy to get under the influence and believe that we can change our entire life in January. **Being overly ambitious can backfire.**

Once you’ve built your resolutions list, [check out this exercise](https://blog.liberationist.org/focus-on-what-really-matters-to-you-4c45cbb3eeea). Focusing on what really matters, will increase your chances to succeed.

## 5. **Break down your goals into smaller-goals**
> “Nail it then scale it.” — Nathan Furr and Paul Ahlstrom

Lower your goals without lowering your ambition.

If you want to become the most successful person in your field, go ahead. But set your goal in a way that will get you started rather than paralyzed.

When I committed to riding my first century (100 miles), I started by setting weekly goals. First, I had to get used to cycling 30 miles in a row. When that became my new normal, 50 miles became my next challenge. My original ambition was to ride 3–5 centuries each summer. But I created a goal that was much easier to digest and accomplish.

## 6. Track progress and adjust
> “I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes.
> Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You’re doing things you’ve never done before, and more importantly, you’re Doing Something. — Neil Gaiman

As I mentioned earlier, if you can’t track your goal you don’t know if you are moving forward. Wanting to lose weight is vague. Committing to losing 10 pounds in 2 months is much specific. You can break it down into smaller chunks and set weekly goals.

Be compassionate with yourself. That won’t affect your commitment. If one week you fall behind, add an extra effort for the following week. **Flexibility doesn’t mean fooling yourself. But being too harsh can damage your willingness for good.** Many people quit because they confuse one small failure with failing to achieve the larger goal.

Being flexible also applies to not letting your goals blind you.

If, at some point, you realize your resolution lost meaning don’t stick to it just to test your resilience. I spent months learning to play the piano, and it wasn’t my thing. I refocused that energy into something new. That kept my energy flowing rather than being drained by unrealistic expectations.

Stop doing something can be the best resolution.

## 7. Self-improvement is a lifetime journey
> “New Year’s Day is every man’s birthday.” — Charles Lamb

You don’t need to wait for Monday to start a diet. Or for January to kick-off new projects or resolutions to improve your life.

Every day is the perfect day to start something. The sooner you get started, the bigger your chances to succeed.

Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio demonstrated that our feelings decide for us 95 percent of the time. You feel before you think. Check out [this 5-second rule exercise](https://www.success.com/article/it-only-takes-5-seconds-to-change-your-life). It will help you overcome your emotions and jump right into action.

Don’t wait until January. Start your new year’s resolutions. Today.

# Sharpening The Saw&#58; Why Productive People Always Have Time For Exercise

## Sven and Jack are two hearty loggers. One day, Jack challenges Sven: who can hand cut the most trees in a single day? Sven, sure of himself, accepts the challenge.

The rules are simple: each gets one saw to fall the most trees by the end of the day. The winner gets a gourmet lunch prepared by the other for a whole week.

When the whistle blows to start the competition, Jack picks up his saw and gets right to work. Sven takes a different route. Instead of hustling to his first tree, he pulls out his sharpening kit, sits down with his back against a stump, and spends 45-minutes honing the several hundred serrated edges on his trusty tool.

The other loggers taunt Sven. “What are you wasting so much time for? Hope you like wearing a chef’s hat!”

But Sven knows better. He knows the 45 minutes *look* like wasted time, but they’ll actually translate into many more minutes in productive tree-cutting.

When Sven finally starts, Jack is a full trees ahead of him. But he’s also tired. The dull saw is overworking him, and he’s slowing down. Sven, however, rips through tree after tree. His razor-sharp saw falls them effortlessly.

By early afternoon, Jack has given up. He’s hunched over, exhausted. Sven blows past him, falling trees well into the evening and, at the end of the day, stands tall looking over his accomplishment without so much as a heavy breath. [1]

## To Be Your Most Productive, Sharpen Your Saw With Exercise

![](0*0R1ZQsa44FWn9OWa.jpg)

The reason Sven chose to sharpen his saw rather than jump right into the trees is the same reason many of the most successful and productive people on Earth also are morning runners.

Bill Gates, Oprah, Richard Branson. They’ve all revealed that, though they’re incredibly busy, they go for a run each morning before jumping into work. Why do they make this a priority when the demands on their time are so great? Do they want to be all-star athletes? No. They do it because exercise helps them be their best.

I’ve discovered this myself. Before becoming a runner six years ago, I was ready for bed by 2:00pm on a busy work day. Considering the popularity of coffee and other ridiculous energy drinks, it seems I’m not the only one.

But after a few weeks of my morning running routine, something changed. My mind was clearer and I felt more alive. Most notable, though? Difficult problems started getting easier to solve, I could work faster, and I didn’t get tired midday. The only thing that could take me down was a massive lunch (which I quickly learned to stop eating).

Just like Sven, I learned I could significantly increase my energy and productivity by “sharpening my saw” with a morning running routine before I started work.

It’s not just me, though. In 2014, three medical researchers conducted a randomized, controlled trial testing the effects of aerobic exercise for people with a sedentary lifestyle. Through several different tests, they learned even a *little* light exercise improved feelings of energy. [2] And some preliminary research on mice has shown exercise might slow the aging of the brain. [3]

If you want the benefit of better energy and a sharper mind, the research says you just need to get a bit of aerobic exercise. Take a little time, every day, to sharpen your saw. If it feels like you don’t have time, remind yourself it’s the exact opposite that’s true.

# Doing isn’t Trying

## The power of words.

Since I decided to embrace my entrepreneurial journey instead of working for a company, I asked myself more than once:
> # *“What are you doing ?”*

More than once, I heard myself answer:
> # *“I try!”*
> # **Trying might be part of doing. But it isn’t doing.**

*TRYING* is the manifestation of fear or uncertainties. When we try, we are afraid we won’t succeed or worse, we consider that we might fall. It feels like something holds us back and prevents us from being confident, in full ownership of our means. In another way, *trying* means that the purpose doesn’t empower ourselves enough to drive us to our destination.

*DOING* takes us away from failure. Even if we fail, failure is part of the journey and doesn’t stop us from reaching our purpose. When we do, we crave experience, invent our rules and we enjoy the road as much as the purpose.

I realized I can try as much as I want. However,** if I don’t believe I’m actually doing, I prevent myself from fully embracing the project, my ambition, the life I want.** I prevent myself from being fulfilled as an individual and from [living in the NOW](https://medium.com/life-tips/is-time-on-your-side-eaf28bb52e0f).

That is why, I recently pushed away the notion of trying. I changed the *“What am I doing ?” *for the *“How can I do ?”*.

# How to use Stoicism, Humility and Gratitude to actually follow-through

## A lot of self-improvement literature strives to make it all seem easy. The truth is, making yourself better involves a lot of hard work. Sometimes even sacrifice.

Here’s three articles that show you how to do the really difficult — and really rewarding — things that make new growth possible.

## [A Guide to Stoicism for Creatives, Entrepreneurs, and Freelancers](https://betterhumans.coach.me/a-guide-to-stoicism-for-creatives-entrepreneurs-and-freelancers-8ad3fb8dafc8)

You may have heard a bit about Stoicism recently. It’s making a comeback in personal development circles; notably, Tim Ferriss is a big fan. But the philosophy has been around for ages. Literally. Zeno of Citium founded Stoicism in Athens during the early 3rd century BC.

It just so happens that the principles of Stoicism are dead-on relevant to people in the creative professional realm (entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, freelancers, and independent workers). I think the increased interest is tied to a rise in both entrepreneurship and freelancing.

## [How To Spot Your Next Big Opportunity With Humility Exercises](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-spot-your-next-big-opportunity-with-humility-exercises-a36e2559f84f)

### Winning Your Inner Battles With Aspiration, Success & Failure

Our ego can get in the way of our success. Constantly. Whether you’re hoping to achieve a goal, trying to preserve previous accomplishments, or recovering from failure, it’s all much easier when you’re humble.

Ego takes many shapes, but essentially it clouds your understanding. When your ego is in charge, it severs your direct and honest connection to the real world. Remove ego and you’re left with reality and a healthy sense of respect for what’s next, which helps you understand what’s possible and how to move forward.

Today, I’ll give you three exercises to develop the humility you need to spot where the next opportunity lies. [***Read more](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-spot-your-next-big-opportunity-with-humility-exercises-a36e2559f84f).***

Back in 2015 I came across the concept of “Hedonic Adaptation” — our tendency to adapt to pleasures. I became fascinated with the idea. I started to think about how I might beat Hedonic Adaptation, and started thinking about an idea I termed “Hedonic Reset”.

Using the concept of Hedonic Reset has changed my outlook drastically.

# The Dreaded Diet Plateau

## 

## What is a Diet Plateau?

In the last year of coaching people on high-protein-low-carb diets the most common scenario is a loss of 2–5 pounds in the first few weeks and then a downward trend of about 1 pound per week over the next 6 months. At some point however (often more than one point on the journey) you hit the dreaded “diet plateau”.

The diet plateau is not exclusive to a low carb or slow carb diet. In fact, people generally reach a plateau with every diet under the sun. In researching the various diet plans over time, I’ve come up with a curated list of methods that have seen some success in getting people off the diet plateau and on their way to further weight loss.

## Why Do We Plateau?

It seems like everything is cruising along fine, you’ve got the hang of the diet and your sugar cravings are in control. Seeing that gradual weight decrease on the scale in the morning is enough to keep your spirits up, even if it is only .2 lbs. Then….a week goes by with no decrease. Then another week. This is when the going gets tough. Many people will give up at this point, blaming the diet because they *know* they have been 100% compliant.

Fat loss plateaus can be extremely frustrating at times, but generally they are temporary bumps in the road. It’s important to keep focused on your goal, and look at the overall downward “trend” of your weight loss, rather than minor changes in measurements or weight from week to week.

Sometimes a fat loss plateau can be traced back to some minor changes that may have happened over time (i.e., too many domino foods). Sometimes it is fluctuations in water weight due to stress, hormones or lack of sleep. And sometimes it’s just mysterious voodoo.

Often, after being on a plateau for a couple of weeks you will see a “whoosh” where your body just seems to all of a sudden release a few pounds.

## Ferriss on the “Diet Plateau”:

Some of the following methods come directly from Tim Ferriss’ book “The Four-Hour Body”, some of it is what I have seen work in the last year and a half of diet coaching, and some is curated methods from health and fitness blogs and podcasts.

Briefly, here is what Tim Ferriss says about the plateau:

1. “Don’t start thinking that you’ve plateaued until you have been on the diet 6 weeks. It is not unusual for women to experience their greatest weight loss around the 6-week mark. “

1. “Eating too late, not eating enough protein (my note: you need at least 20–25 grams a meal), drinking too little water are the three most common causes of hitting a weight loss plateau.”

1. ” The total percentage of body fat lost per month naturally decreases over time. The number of mitochondria in your muscle tissue largely determines your rate of sustained fat-loss (my note: this is why you need resistance training as part of your exercise routine!). Targeted exercise, even just 20 minutes per week, will often double fat-loss that’s plateaued, and should do so for at least two to four months.”

## Simple Tips for addressing a Diet Plateau:

1. Check ingredient lists of any pre-packaged foods you have been eating and note the sugar, the carbs and the calories. Opt for food that has the least sugar, and then go on to compare carbs and calories. If the food label has 3 grams of dietary fiber for every 20 grams of carbs, it is considered a “slow carb” that will not spike blood sugar in the same way as a simple carb.

1. Reduce the amount of beans in a day. While beans are allowed (and necessary for energy levels), you only really need about 1 cup per day. More than that and the calories and fats in legumes can stall your loss. Alternatively, if you aren’t on a slow carb diet, have smaller portions of food — essentially decreasing your calories by doing either one.

1. If you have been using any kind of protein shake, discontinue use for a week and replace it with a whole food, like eggs, chicken, turkey, salmon, tuna, etc.

1. Drink more water, it is really necessary for high-protein diets. Insufficient water intake seems to be particularly common among women. Make a special effort to drink more water on your cheat day.

1. Portion out or do not have “Domino Foods”. There are certain foods that, while technically fine to eat on a high-protein diet, are prone to portion abuse. Almonds, which are easy to consume by the handful, contain 824 calories per cup, 146 calories more than a Whopper from Burger King. A few nuts are (5–10), but rarely do people eat just a few. Self-discipline is overrated and undependable, so portion them out ahead of time.

1. Have a proper cheat day, if you have skipped any recently. There’s a lot of data that shows a spike in calories, and a spike in carbohydrates will help your body to avoid a lower metabolism due to dieting.

1. Eat more than 60g, but less than 230g, of proteins every day.

1. Eat healthy fats. Getting enough healthy fats from foods like avocados, coconut oil, nuts, eggs, and fish can help stimulate the right hormones to ensure that your metabolism doesn’t shut down, even when you’re cutting back on calories. Not getting enough healthy fats will cause your hormone levels to suffer and create a risk for adrenal fatigue, which can cause all sorts of problems, including weight gain. Healthy fats are also what keep you full and give you long-term energy, so always make sure you’re getting enough in your diet.

## More Robust Ways of Addressing a Diet Plateau:

1. Start exercising more intensely, this is often the key to getting off the plateau in terms of fat loss — get in some sort of strength resistance exercise of your choice for 3–4 times a week. Some experts estimate that every extra pound of muscle on your body burns 30–50 calories extra a day, while others estimate each pound burns 6 extra calories a day, compared to 2 calories burned by fat. Either way, if you want to increase your metabolism, gaining muscle is the best and most sure way to go about doing so.

1. Intermittent Fasting . There are several different types of IF and that is another whole post. Google intermittent fasting and get knowledgeable to see if it’s for you.

1. Find out what your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is using one of the calculators on the web and start tracking calories. The reason for plateauing at each level is usually related to the fact that your metabolism starts to slow down as you consume less food. In addition to building muscle and taking cheat days to increase metabolism, there is some evidence that getting cold (either by taking cold showers, sleeping cold or drinking ice water in the morning) can help boost metabolism

1. Follow the very, very stringent meal plan that Ferriss lays out in his “Last Mile” Chapter of 4-Hour Body. It is effective for the short term, but not a sustainable way of eating.

# How I’m Going to Wake Up at 5 AM Every Single Day in 2016 (& How You Can Do It Too)

## How I’m Going to Wake Up at 5 AM Every Single Day in 2016 (& How You Can Do It Too)

Do you know those annual review posts household names publish every year?

Like [Pat Flynn’s annual income report](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/annual-income-report-review-2014/) (I’m sure he cracked $1 million this year, go Pat!).

![](1*-7yqcFZ6Z6ldcc5iknDodg.png)

Or [James Clear’s annual review](http://jamesclear.com/2015-annual-review).

![](1*-q9YBreEggzKBXVy_a1sAA.png)

Well, what about those?

**They suck!**

They’re supposed to be inspiring and helpful.

But the truth is, **you’re nowhere near having any of the problems these guys have.**

Yes, some tidbits here and there are helpful, but let’s face it, when you read them, you mostly get:

1. Depressed, because you’re not remotely as successful.

1. Solutions to problems you can only wish you had.

I have no doubt that these guys wrote them with the best intentions, and I’m thankful that they do write them, but please, make them more helpful for the average Joe.

I’m glad [Nathan Barry was honest in his annual review](http://nathanbarry.com/2015-review/), because I think **they really are for the people who write them, not for the reader**.

![](1*7hIYMWHQ1l0zmwXIacNFzw.png)

So when I set out to write my own review for 2015, I wanted to make sure it didn’t just help me.

As a [habit and accountability coach](http://niklasgoeke.com/coach-nik/), only one thing made sense:
> # [**A public review of all my habits](http://niklasgoeke.com/habit-review-2015/).**

## Why a habit review?

The truth is, your habits shape much more of your year than any single event.

I could have written about [getting on Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/if-its-not-a-hell-yes-its-a-no-1723393142),doing my first webinar, or making zero pre-sales of my first attempt at creating a product.

But **what I do every day is a much bigger determinator of my success**.

If I can improve my habits in 2016, [just 1% at a time](http://niklasgoeke.com/start-here/), then 2016 will be a great year.

Plus, sharing how I did with cultivating 10 good habits and trying to break 5 bad ones will also help anyone who’s struggling with the same habits.

Of course I used [coach.me](https://www.coach.me/?ref=zO0m5) to track all my habits, what else?

All I had to do then is pull out the graphs that showed my progress over the year, and take a good hard look at how I did with each habit.

Then I came up with one tip both I and my readers can use to improve that particular habit, and moved on to the next one.

**Note: **You can find the graphs by clicking on weekly stats in your dashboard.

![](1*cUd_TRMRTbauiXGLylVzlA.png)

## You snooze, you lose. I guess I lost in 2015.

One of the first habits I looked at was **waking up by 6:30.**

I’m a morning person, always have been, and for a while in 2015, [this habit went well](http://niklasgoeke.com/how-to-wake-up-early/).

But what I saw when I looked at the overall stats, I didn’t like so much.

![](1*IAJJJ4QzBxO-BP543LA0BA.png)

133 checkins overall. That’s only 36.44% of the year. Granted, I started tracking only in March, but still.

**Note: **I picked waking up early because it’s the habit I took the most immediate action on. If you want advice on several other habits, like no alcohol, no complaining, drinking more water, taking cold showers, or nofap, [check out the full habit review](http://niklasgoeke.com/habit-review-2015/).

**Doing something less than every other day is not a habit, it’s a pain.**

Imagine you had to live in one apartment on Monday and Tuesday, then in a different one on Wednesday and Thursday, and go back to the first one for the weekend.

You completely lose your routine every time, which is worse than having none at all.

I knew all along that getting up early was a [keystone habit](http://jamesclear.com/keystone-habits) (a habit that creates other good habits right with it) for me, so why didn’t I put more effort into it?

I don’t know.

Girlfriend, changing places a lot, shitty bedtime routine, [insert another random excuse here].

What I do know is that in order to get out of a slump, **I need to step up my game, and make a big commitment** — I’m a [Sudden Sammie](http://niklasgoeke.com/ways-to-break-bad-habits/), after all.

**Note: **If you don’t know what type of Bad Habit Breaker you are, [you can take my quiz to find out your type here](http://niklasgoeke.com/ways-to-break-bad-habits/#quiz).

That’s why I chose to shoot for the moon and **start getting up at 5 am**.

Yup, that’s right.

My new year’s resolution was clear.

Here’s how I’m pulling it off.

## Step 1: Create your own purpose

The first thing I needed was [a reason to get up](http://niklasgoeke.com/the-miracle-morning/).

So I created one.

I picked 2 other habits I feel strongly about, that I didn’t do well at, and decided to build my early mornings around them.

**Reading & Writing.**

If you paid attention to the screenshot earlier about finding the graphs, you’ll have noticed I’m on a **182 day streak for reading** already.

Go ahead, scroll up to double check, I’ll wait.

…

Back? Good.

My writing streak is exactly as long.

![The screenshot was taken on 12/30](1*0qNjQEBKjkFsJ3I6vF6FFg.jpeg)*The screenshot was taken on 12/30*

Wait.

If I’ve read and written every day for the past 6 months, then how can I be doing a bad job at those habits?

A lot of days I just read a single page of a book summary, a newsletter email, blog post, or something else **that’s rather an excuse for reading.**

What’s more, **I didn’t do it consistently in the mornings**. Sometimes I’d cram a few pages before bed or on the train, which I wasn’t happy with at all.

The same with writing. While I did it every day, I’d sometimes sit in front of my laptop at 8 pm, freaked out about what to write.

I knew having read and written before starting my workday would make me feel amazing, but to make sure I’d do it, I had to give it a direction.

That’s why I decided to start a side project, or **passion project**, if you will.

I would read a book summary on [Blinkist](http://fourminutebooks.com/what-is-blinkist/) every morning, which takes around 15–20 minutes, and then write down what I learned.

This way the reading and writing would be connected, and I’d have a structure to follow.

But what good is a passion project, if you don’t tell everyone you know about it?

That’s where step 2 comes in.

## Step 2: Get some accountability

Question: What happens if I don’t get up at 5 am to read and write?

That’s right, **NOTHING.**

Not good.

You want someone to rely on you being up early, or you might as well not try altogether.

Accountability can come from:

1. A friend

1. A machine

1. A coach ([hint, hint](http://niklasgoeke.com/coach-nik/))

1. A customer

1. An audience

Let’s look at your options.

A friend is likely not invested enough in your success to be enough of a pain in the butt (unless they pay for your failure, [great idea Leo](http://zenhabits.net/awesome-2016/)!).

A machine can work, [Thomas Frank has a nice setup with Buffer that forces him to be up at 5:55 AM](http://collegeinfogeek.com/early-waking-with-buffer/), but your bed is a powerful place, and eventually, you won’t care about the stakes and snooze.

Coaches work. Period. And they’re cheaper than you think. Got a number in mind? I bet it wasn’t [$2/day](http://niklasgoeke.com/coach-nik/).

A customer is a very good person to hold you accountable, but guess what, you need customers for that. Unless you’re already selling something, not a good choice.

Lastly, **an audience**, my weapon of choice. An audience is great because:

1. It holds you accountable for free.

1. It gets angry if you miss a deadline.

1. The accountability grows with the size of your audience.

Hmm, you want an audience that holds you accountable to writing every morning, I wonder what that could look like…

Any ideas?

Exactly! 2.47 seconds later I came to the same conclusion as you and set up a blog.

Ta-daaaaa, [Four Minute Books](http://fourminutebooks.com/) was born.

![What my passion project looks like](1*c_nlnGqjgNbO0DyqNzh5xA.png)*What my passion project looks like*

Now, if a day in the blogroll is missing, i.e. I didn’t publish anything, I can expect some angry emails.

At the latest, people will know I’ve fallen behind schedule when I don’t email out 7 new summaries a week.

Will it happen? Maybe. I’m 25 days in and haven’t missed a day.

Wait, it’s only the 10th of January as I’m writing this, so how can I be 25 days in?

## Step 3: Start ahead of time

This is the last, and maybe most important step.

When you want to wake up early as of March 2016, then by all means, **don’t start in March 2016.**

You have to start in February. Or January.

More time invested means more failure means moving faster towards success.

For this reason I started waking up at 5 AM on December 17th, **a week before Christmas**.

Stupid time to start a new year’s resolution? You bet.

Was the site perfect before I started publishing? Hell no.

**But did I need every single bit of that time to make it work? 100% yes.**

So don’t postpone to tomorrow that, which you can do today.

Especially if it’s a keystone habit.

## Your turn to kick ass in 2016.

So, does it work?

![](1*UhTO1tYlcKnLM_TY4ydr2w.png)

Yes. Yes it does :)

After doing [my Miracle Morning](http://niklasgoeke.com/the-miracle-morning/), reading a summary, and writing for about an hour, I’ve consistently published a new post at around 7:30 AM every day.

What will you do with your early mornings?

Here are your 3 steps again to finally wake up early in 2016.

1. Create your own purpose, and make sure it’s like good coffee — STRONG!

1. Get yourself some accountability in one of the 5 ways I showed you.

1. Start before you’re ready.

Oh and if you need more resources about habits, willpower, or your mindset, I know a guy who writes a lot of book summaries these days.

# Beautility, My Ultimate iPhone Setup

## Beautility, My Ultimate iPhone Setup

### A guide to balancing beauty and utility on your iPhone

While I understand and appreciate the value of disconnecting from the digital world, so much of my life happens through the 5.5" screen on my iPhone that I’ve become addicted to it. Even as a tech nerd, I hate the constant buzzing and the incessant need to check my phone every 5 minutes, so I decided to change things up a bit and modify my phone to serve me, not the other way around.

To start, this is my home screen.

![](1*wwNWMc756AVs5U731rXCtQ.png)

This is what I see every time I unlock my phone. There’s an abstract landscape in the background, but most of my home screen is, well… nothing, by design.

Gone are the pages of app icons littered with little red badges beckoning me to pay attention or take an action.

The two hard-to-see dots above the bottom app tray are the bare minimum because there’s a default page to the left containing useful widgets, more on that later, but I intentionally resized the wallpaper graphic to conceal the dots as best I could.

My home screen makes me calm. It feels like a blank canvas which, for a creative person, is inspirational. I played with a variety of solid-colored wallpapers, but something about this [simple landscape](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/08/21/wallpapers-of-the-week-minimalist-mountains-continued/) hit the target for me.

You might have trouble in making the dots less obtrusive with this background in a scenario where iOS changes the dots from black to white. Fortunately, there is the work around. This happens due to some Apple magic that only gets triggered when the background behind the dots is pitch black. If you rearrange the background so that the background is merely very dark grey, then you’ll work around this feature.

![](1*AtDu4cwBjqdcgBD1HReyUA.png)

## Step 1: One folder to rule them all

Put all of your apps, except three, in one folder named “Apps.”

The single folder shown above containing all ~130 of my apps, alphabetized, was the most drastic change with this setup. 135 is the maximum amount of apps you can put in a single folder, 15 pages with 9 apps on each page. Coincidentally I had about 130 apps on my phone after I deleted around 10 or 15 while moving them into this folder. I have no idea if that’s more or less than average.

I organized them using iTunes, which I assumed would be faster, but I’m not sure it was as the UI was buggy and slow. Also, alphabetizing the apps was unnecessary because now I use search to do pretty much everything.

I hardly ever used search on my phone before this change, but now I use it for finding and launching apps, pulling up a contact to call or text, searching the web, etc. Swipe down, start typing, and tap the result you need. Searching for everything felt laborious at first, but after a few days I felt like I had a new superpower and I’m still surprised how quickly I can get to exactly what I need. (Note: If you use the Slack app and search on your phone doesn’t work well, or at all, try [this fix](https://t.co/QPXkP5VZKB) which worked for me. cc: [April Underwood](https://twitter.com/aunder)!)

The other three apps on my home screen represent the 3 things I will *choose* to do on my phone if I’m not responding to a push notification: Chat with friends or family (Messages), see what’s going on in the world (Twitter), or work via email (early private beta of [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/), my new favorite email client).

You might choose different apps than I chose. There’s definitely a school of thought that Twitter and texting are interruptive time-sucks. If you feel that way, maybe you should choose the Podcast and Kindle apps.

![](1*AtDu4cwBjqdcgBD1HReyUA.png)

## Step 2: No-no-notifications

After I put everything into one folder, notification badges plagued me because they would appear on apps several pages deep in my folder and I couldn’t tell where they were without swiping through the folder.

Turning all notifications off isn’t an option for me, but this setup made me realize how many notifications I received each day that did not require my immediate attention. Spoiler alert: most of them. So for the next few days when a notification arrived I did one of three things…

1. If the notification was important and time-sensitive (Slack mentions, voicemails, etc.) I kept notifications enabled for that app and moved the app to the first page in the folder.

1. If the notification was important, but not time-sensitive and wouldn’t appear often (Settings, Testflight, etc.), I left the app where it was and kept notifications enabled.

1. If the notification was not important or time-sensitive (IG faves, Medium claps, etc.) I kept the app where it was and took 30 seconds to disable all notifications for that app in Settings.

After a few days, I had my most important apps on the first page in my app folder and most other notifications disabled. I added a few of my most-used apps on that page also like Phone, Google Maps, etc. though I still search to launch those apps as well.

This is the first page of my Apps folder.

Alternatively, if you are ready to give up all notifications in one big push, you can go straight to your Settings, find the Notification section, and then go app by app.

Here is what the before and after after disabling notifications for a single app.

![](1*AtDu4cwBjqdcgBD1HReyUA.png)

## Step 3: Widgets

Prior to this setup, I never used widgets. The word “widget” brought back too many Web 2.0 memories, but I’ve grown to love them again. The widget screen is always one swipe away and provides easy access to things I might need to check or use throughout the day. In order, the widgets I use are:

* **Google Calendar**, to see upcoming meetings I’ll cancel

* **Stocks**, to see how much money I lost that day

* **Dark Sky**, to see what kind of weather will ruin my weekend

* **Tesla**, so I can start my car with a widget like a true Silicon Valley d-bag

* **Phone Favorites**, to call/text my friends and family

* **Find Friends**, to see where my friends and family are ignoring me from. (*Joking aside, everyone in my family shares our location with everyone else so we can always see where everyone is. This has been incredibly useful not only to locate each other, but more often than not to locate a misplaced phone!)*

The best thing about the widget page is that you can get to it without unlocking your phone. Yes, this means someone else could see my upcoming calendar events or start my car, but maybe they’ll locate and take my car to the meeting I didn’t want to go to anyway, so everyone wins!

![](1*OZrisFwBJdu2StGiL_IcdA.jpeg)

![](1*AtDu4cwBjqdcgBD1HReyUA.png)

## The Results

The way I use my phone has changed** a lot**. I still have easy access to things I want or need to do, but I’m no longer beholden to never-ending pings of apps trying to get my attention. I used to swipe through pages of apps looking for a specific one, but would end up getting distracted and wasting time in another app.

**I hardly waste any time on my phone anymore, unless I want to!**

I’ve been surprised by how many apps I forgot about after a couple weeks, like Reddit, ESPN, the App Store, and many others, because I very rarely swipe through the 15 pages in my app folder. Out of sight, out of mind…and for most of my apps that’s a good thing. I would even argue that’s a healthy thing.

I’ve also realized how good the iOS software has become over the years. My old habits started with the first iPhone and hadn’t changed much. They prevented me from exploring new features like search, widgets, and Siri. Turns out the nerds down in Cupertino have been improving iOS, I was just too set in my ways to appreciate it. Old dog, new tricks.

![](1*AtDu4cwBjqdcgBD1HReyUA.png)

I love my iPhone setup. I feel like I gained a lot without losing anything. That said, I’m open to other ideas, tips, and tricks. What am I missing? What could I do better? How could I improve this setup?

# Becoming Dad

## 

Certain moments are etched, indelibly, into that mysterious clay that makes us human. They change us forever, breaking up our otherwise routinized existence, adorning our short stay on earth with substance and meaning.

“Maura, grab your baby!”

Because most of the time, hours melt together in the inevitable monotony of modern life, drifting ever forward, pulsing like an ocean swell.

Eventually, the swell runs into a shallow spot. A beach, a reef, an ocean ledge that speeds up and launches liquid energy up towards the sky. A wave crests and breaks, crashing down upon itself. But unlike a wave that expires at the shore, life rushes on, looking for another patch of sand.

“Maura, reach down and grab your baby!”

You hear a million times that having a kid changes your priorities, that becoming a parent makes you realize that the daily crap through which you sift couldn’t be any less essential. All that’s true of course, but it doesn’t begin to capture what it actually feels like, to witness the front end of the arc of existence, that continuous ring of birth and death. To be present as life springs forth from the loins of love to dance around the world.

“Andrew! Let go!”

We sat together on the edge of the bed, limbs wrapped together for leverage. But I wouldn’t let go. I wouldn’t release Maura’s arms to reach down and grab her baby.

After 24 hours of gradual, grinding progress, things were happening fast now and my mind couldn’t keep up. I couldn’t process that for Maura to reach down and grab her baby — our baby — I had submit to what was about to happen, to how my life would be forever changed. All these months of waiting, wanting, led up to this moment. This wave. It had crested and was falling back to earth.

You hear a lot about mom having to let go in order for the baby to come. It turns out dad needs to let go too.

I guess I finally did, because the next thing I knew this slimy slithering little thing was hoisted up onto my wife’s naked chest. This tiny screaming human, coned head from wedging herself out into the world, limp body from the shock of expulsion, was now ours. Ours to cherish, ours to love, ours to teach about things like waves and beaches and everything in-between. Ours to keep alive.

“Holy shit.”

That’s exactly what I said. Because that’s exactly how I felt.

Two hours later, after the midwives had cleaned up and checked the baby, ensuring what we already knew (that she was perfect), it was just us. Just the three of us, alone in our quiet home. And as my daughter, my living breathing child, lay prone on my bare chest, clutching my skin and soothed by the beating of my heart, a door quietly closed on my old life.

In those first few precious days, the pulse of the ocean slows down. Like the quiet fizzle of churning whitewater after a rogue set rumbles through the impact zone.

I felt a remarkable calm in the wake of what had just happened. Like the spirits who crank the gears of the world were smiling down on me, overlooking our little cocoon for those first few precious moments so I could be truly present to soak in that indescribable serenity a freshly printed baby somehow exudes into the world around her. My freshly printed baby.

As our midwife Maria said, “these are the days when your heart is cracked open.”

No parenting book can prepare you for what it feels like to hear your daughter squeak, or coo, or scrunch her lips together and stick out her little pink tongue. Or why you can’t stop smelling her head and kissing her cheek. Or what emotions rush through your body when she falls asleep on your bare skin, tiny fingers and tiny nails grasping at your chest hair. As if you weren’t already holding onto her for dear life.

What a privilege to be so needed, for another human being to be so absolutely reliant on you for life. One you’ve never heard speak a word, about whom you know nothing other than it’s up to you to show her the world.

Here lies a living breathing human being who has done no wrong. Never made a mistake. Never said or felt ill towards another person. She is actually, perfect. Oh sure she’ll err and hurt and worry and scare many times throughout her life, but for these few sweet days we the flawed and scarred have the privilege of holding the flawless and pure, literally in the palm of our hand.

And it’s not just about the baby. Sometimes my wife will catch me just looking at her, gazing at her now placid face remembering back in awe at the courage it took to endure an experience that felt, in her words at the moment, “like a huge ball coming out of my ass.” My affection for her has transformed, ballooned and grown in ways I could have never imagined.

As the dad, your role in labor and delivery is ill-defined. Our doula wasn’t lying when she said her job was to make sure I could do mine. The problem is that there’s no way to prepare for what that will actually entail. You just can’t recreate the intensity, physical and emotional, coursing through your sleep-deprived body of your wife giving birth to your child.

You never practice squatting in the middle of the kitchen, supporting her entire body as she groans and grunts and pushes, exhibiting an instinctual fortitude that leaves you literally speechless. Pushing, like her life depended on it, even though the last dozen pushes yielded nothing but pain.

It was the most inspiring thing I’ve ever seen. You begin to believe everything you hear about women being built for this, about somehow finding within themselves the strength to complete this impossibly difficult task that yields the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen.

As it turns out, my job was just to be there for Maura, whatever that meant. To show no fear, despite the fact that I was terrified. To be encouraging, yet soothing. Optimistic, yet practical. Loving, yet firm.

To watch this person you have grown to love more than you imagined it possible to love another person go through the anguish of labor, to see her eyes bug out with pain and fear, and to have to sit there and ignore her pleas of “I can’t do this anymore,” is heart wrenching. But my job wasn’t to pat her head and tell her everything was going to be OK. My job was to keep us moving forward, keep her spirits up and do my part to keep the fear at bay.

Every time she would moan, “I can’t do this,” I countered with “You *are *doing it. Say it with me!” And every time she’d respond, without hesitation, with the strongest and most convincing, “I can do this, I can do this!” I’d ever heard. And she did.

I now get to watch as my wife’s mom imparts wisdom to her daughter, hints and tricks passed down from her mother, and her mother before that. To bear witness not just to my tiny and ultimately insignificant sliver of life, but the living breathing extension of the human existence through generations. That innate ability of the species to endure, to keep its progeny alive despite having never done it before.

We are so programmed to not ask for help. To think that we can Google anything and learn enough to get by. And while maybe YouTube can teach you to wrap a better swaddle, it can’t recreate what it feels like to watch your wife’s mother teach her how to bathe your daughter with chamomile tea in the bathroom sink.

A few days after Emilia was born, a writer friend of mine asked, “how’s fatherhood going?” He’s going to be a dad in a couple months and if he’s anything like me, he’s already warming up his notebook in the hopes of capturing some witty prose about what it’s like to be a new dad. What amazing material!

“I put down about a dozen words trying to describe it, then gave up. I’m just living it,” was all I wrote back.

It’s not that I don’t have these thoughts that I’d love to put down on paper, these amazing insights and realizations that can only come when you have literally just witnessed miracle of life. But every minute spent actually writing down those thoughts in any sort of coherent manner is a minute I’d have to spend away my wife and daughter. No thanks.

I want to *live *these early days of fatherhood. I don’t want to miss a coo, a squeak, a wiggle. I still can’t hold her enough. I don’t want my wife to go a second longer than she should without a fresh glass of water. I can always try to record my thoughts later.

So if these words don’t accurately convey the visceral and ultimately indescribable feelings and emotions that welled up inside me during the first few days of my child’s life, it’s just not a big deal.

Because there won’t ever be another wave like this.

# A Guide To The Science Of Giving

## A Guide To The Science Of Giving

### Develop an abundance mindset, give freely, feel fulfilled

Last weekend we went out to enjoy Madrid’s gorgeous weather in the park. My three-year-old son Rafa started playing with a new truck. The kind of toy with all the moving parts, lights and colors that can make a kid go mad at that age. At some point, another kid roughly his age approaches him and says:

*“Hi, can I play with your truck?”*

I braced for the classic in-your-face *“No. It’s mine” *of my three-year-old, and got ready for the awkward smile exchange with the other kid’s parent. But instead, my son replied:

*“Yes, here you are.”*

I could not believe my eyes. The other kid, grateful and somewhat surprised, responded with *“Thank you! Would you like to play with me?”* And so they went to enjoy each other’s toys in the sand.

It was such a small moment, but it reminded me of the importance of giving and how it helps us lead more fulfilled lives. I’ve learned a lot about the science of sharing over the years and today, I’d like to share that knowledge with you.

## The Abundance vs. The Scarcity Mindset
> # “The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes of mind.” — William James

My son had unknowingly chosen to believe in a paradigm of abundance. This concept became popular thanks to Steven Covey and his best-selling book [*“7 Habits of Highly Effective People.”](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary/dp/1511317299)*

The paradigm of scarcity is one in which you consider life to be one big pie. A global zero-sum game. If someone takes a piece, then there is less pie for everybody else. Your gain is my loss. People in this mindset are defensive. Worried about protecting what they have more than they are willing to grow out of their self-imposed boundaries to achieve more.

People living in an abundance mindset believe, instead, that there is enough out there for everybody. That a partnership may be better than going solo. That taking care of stakeholders matter. That decision making, profits and good ideas are worth sharing to build something bigger than themselves.

## Abundance Is Practical

Embracing a giving mentality in life is not only the right thing from a moral perspective. From a much more practical point of view, it has a phenomenal impact on our psychological well-being and can be a core driver of our success in life.

Let’s explore why this is the case.

## Our Brains Are Wired To Give…
> “Suppose you could be hooked up to a hypothetical “experience machine” that, for the rest of your life, would stimulate your brain and give you any positive feelings you desire. Most people to whom I offer this imaginary choice refuse the machine. It is not just positive feelings we want: we want to be entitled to our positive feelings.” — Dr. Martin Seligman

In 2014, a study led by neuroscientist [Molly J. Crocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_J._Crockett) shed light on how much humans care about others relative to themselves. The [results ](https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/nov/22/behind-the-scenes-of-a-shocking-new-study-on-human-altruism)were surprising. They showed that, on average, people were willing to pay *twice as much money to prevent someone else receiving an electric shock* than the amount of money they would pay to prevent receiving the same amount of shock themselves.

At first, the conclusions seem puzzling. How does this fit with our *survival bias,* our innate sense of self-protection in the face of danger? A little experiment may help us understand this apparent contradiction.

In the next few days, do the following two things:

1. Something fun.

1. Something altruistic.

Plan both events and write about how you *think* doing those two different acts will make you feel. Then, immediately after completing the two activities, write down how you *actually* feel. At the end of the day, write down how you feel again, long after both events happened.

More likely than not, the *high* of doing something fun will last for a little bit and then fade away. It is a satisfaction that consumes itself shortly after the activity ends. If you go to the cinema and you enjoyed the movie, you will feel good after leaving the premises, but you won’t carry that feeling much longer after that.

However, if you perform a random act of kindness the *feeling-good* effect will endure for hours after the event happened. Try helping a little boy with their homework, or listening to someone in need. Or donating to a cause you truly believe in. The positive feelings stemming from the altruistic act will last for a long time after the event happened.

## … And Positive Psychology Knows Why

Positive psychology is the field behind the scientific theory of happiness. Not so long ago, psychology focused only on helping troubled minds go back to a healthy state; Patients suffering from depression and other mental disorders. It sought to bring these patients back from “-10 to 0” on the well-being scale.

Positive psychology, on the other hand, looks to answer the question *“what can make a healthy mind thrive?”.* It looks scientifically into how we can go from “0 to +10” on the well-being scale. The father of positive psychology is [Dr. Martin Seligman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman), author of books like *“Authentic Happiness”* and *“Learned Optimism”* and the founder of the [Positive Psychology Center](https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania.

After years of research, he came up with 5 core pillars that act as the infrastructure to our psychological well-being and happiness. It is called [the **PERMA** model](https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/learn-more/perma%E2%84%A2-theory-well-being-and-perma%E2%84%A2-workshops):

* **P **for Positive Emotion: feeling good, optimism, pleasure and enjoyment.

* **E** for Engagement: doing fulfilling work, having exciting hobbies, immersing oneself in a sense of “flow”.

* **R** for Relationships: deep social connections, love, intimacy, emotional and physical interaction with others.

* **M** for Meaning: having a purpose in life.

* **A** for Accomplishment: setting and pursuing goals, realizing your ambition, living with a sense of achievement.

You can experience all of these in a single act of giving, whether it’s sharing a meal with a friend or donating a large sum to a good cause.

## Why Giving Fulfills Us

Giving adds to our lives in many different ways, but is also exactly in line with the PERMA model.

* When we give, we generate **positive emotions. **This, among other things, triggers a physical reaction: [the release of dopamine](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/happiness-role-of-dopamine-and-serotonin-on-mood-and-negative-emotions-2165-7548-1000350.php?aid=88949). This hormone is secreted by the brain and regulates pleasure. It also helps us create habits by stimulating the repetition of the activity that brought us pleasure in the first place, over and over again.

* Giving also helps us make our **relationships** more **engaging**. It enhances the quality of our interactions with others. To receive the appreciation of someone we have just helped is not only rewarding at an individual level, but also a powerful way to cement our social bond with that person.

However, giving goes well beyond facilitating positive emotions or better interactions with others. It can become a profound driver of our success in life, by contributing directly to the meaning and accomplishment components of the PERMA model.

## Giving As Purpose

In [*“Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance”](https://www.amazon.es/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108) *by Penn’s psychologist [Angela Duckworth](https://angeladuckworth.com/), I learned about [Kat Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kat_Cole). Cole started her career waitressing at Hooters while finishing her high school. She later rose up to become vice president of the company at age 26. Today, Kat Cole is Group President of Focus Brands, an investor, humanitarian and advisor.

Here’s [her attitude on giving](http://web.archive.org/web/20131124101724/http://www.katcole.net/2013/08/see-whats-possible-and-help-others-do.html):
> “By doing good for just one person, in just one moment, you can affect the trajectory of many things, of many lives, all over the world. Even if in some situations it’s not easy to be kind, gracious or positive, keep in mind it’s not just that moment that you are affecting, it’s many moments into the future.”

She differentiates between **productive achievers and destructive achievers**. As per her own description in [a recent interview](http://learningleader.com/episode-078-kat-cole-from-hooters-waitress-to-president-of-cinnabon/):
> “There are a lot of people who have been incredibly successful by the typical person’s definition, financially or in terms of career acceleration, but have done it destructively, by not lifting others up and bringing them along. Then there are those who have been productive achievers, who have also brought others along with them and made a difference.”

For Cole, her giving attitude implied raising others and bringing them along in her path towards growth. A deep sense of purpose, rooted on an abundance mentality, had a significant impact on her professional success.

## Giving And Happiness: My Experience

As a father, I pay close attention to the way my two children interact between them, and how they do so with others. I am curious about the motivations behind their daily choices. About their *why*.

My son’s instinctive reaction in the park reminded me of my shift towards a more giving stance. Over the past two years, I have discovered that my sense of purpose is increasingly linked to people, and less with money and the definition of “success” by current social standards.

Two factors contributed to shaping this:

1. The [Impact Investing](https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/) activity that my fim leads in East and Southern Africa.

1. My interest in the development of human potential and well-being, and my personal ambition to help people become better versions of themselves.

The two ways above are two expressions of the same mindset. Believing in abundance — without giving ourselves mindlessly nor denying our ambitions in the process — can lead us on a path towards personal well-being and success in life.

Happiness has to be earned. It cannot be chased. It cannot be manufactured. Happiness is about the consistency of our daily actions with our principles. The way we respond to the daily demands of life. In that context, a virtuous circle of gratitude and giving — as proven by positive psychology, the science of happiness — becomes a critical element of a fulfilling life.

## **Conclusion**

To summarize, life is not a zero-sum game. An abundance mindset is both possible and practical. Science has shown our brains are wired to give because they prolong positive emotions from such interactions. Positive Psychology confirms this and gives us a model we can use to become productive achievers: PERMA.

And how did that day in the park with my three-year-old son end? Ah, yes! Well, at some point we decided to leave. It was already lunch time. As we were leaving the park, the other kid my run out towards us and stopped my son. He then asked:

*“What is your name? Will you be coming back tomorrow?”*

I guess on that day, giving created a new friendship.

# A PSA for stressed creatives

## A PSA for stressed creatives

### Help us to free creatives from stress.

Let’s face it. Creatives (any kind of creative people) often think that being stressed or under pressure is normal and sometimes expected in our line of work… Well, pardon my French, but f*#k that sh!t.

Let me ask something to every designer, writer, journalist, photographer and basically everyone who works in the creative business… Do you really think that stress is a necessary evil? And don’t tell me that your “best work” always comes in the worst moments. Because if you really think that, you should add the word “Masochist” to your LinkedIn profile.

Stressful situations have nothing to do with creativity.

Your best work, whatever it might be, will always come when you’re feeling in balance —when you’re feeling happy and confident of your own talent.

That’s why I’m trying to start this *movement*. A sort of wakeup call to every creative out there who feels suffocated by his own job.

I call it: **“*PSA for stressed creatives.”
***It’s based on some phrases and thoughts that I repeat to myself every time I feel stressed or burned out.

Nothing cheesy, just basic (but important) reminders that help me to gain back my dharma.

This project will consist of a series of graphic posters beautifully designed by great and talented people who agree with this powerful idea:
> # « We can —and must— fight back stress »

So far we have two messages out there: [***Breathe. It’s important](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Breathe-A-PSA-for-stressed-creatives/9253331)*** and [***If you don’t love it, it’s ok to leave it](http://www.behance.net/gallery/If-you-dont-love-it-A-PSA-for-stressed-creatives/9546879)***. And we’re not planning to stop any time soon.

This is just the beginning. You can expect more to come in the next weeks.

The important thing here is for every poster to serve it’s purpose, which is to comunicate it’s message in an appealing and creative way.

And as a plus for anyone interested, most of the posters (and other cool related stuff) are going to be available for purchase.

If you consider yourself a creative, I would like you to join us and help us spread the message. Visit the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/CreativesPSA) or [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CreativesPSA) and be part of this movement.

***I encourage you to share, comment and even participate in the creation of one of these posters. ***You might end up helping other colleagues to release some pressure and you’ll also feel better about yourself.

I know I did.

# How to Learn to Negotiate Easily— For Those Who Avoid It

## Negotiation doesn’t have to be scary, and it can quickly be learned.

![Photo by [Tim Bogdanov](https://unsplash.com/photos/4uojMEdcwI8?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*IzYulQ-5wPX7FHHECM6oOw.jpeg)*Photo by [Tim Bogdanov](https://unsplash.com/photos/4uojMEdcwI8?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

When I took my first job, it never crossed my mind to negotiate my salary — or any other component of my offer for that matter. Later, I asked a colleague if he negotiated his offer — even though the salary was fixed. “I tried,” he said.

*“I try to negotiate everything.”*

This conversation was illuminating. Unlike my colleague, I didn’t try to negotiate anything — ever. The idea of negotiating felt at best, awkward, and at worst, scary.

Over the next year, I came across some information that made me realize that by failing to negotiate, I was missing out on two major things:

1. Income ([about $500k over my lifetime](http://www.salary.com/most-people-don-t-negotiate-due-to-fear-lack-of-skills/)) and

1. Equality.

After all, [women still only make 80% of what men do](http://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/). This data inspired me to overcome my fear of negotiation and develop this critical skill — for the next time I had the opportunity to negotiate my salary or a job offer.

To build my comfort negotiating, I intentionally started small. And I made my first attempt in a low-pressure situation, where I had little to lose, for example when I would never see the person again.

My first negotiation occurred about ten years ago — in a mall. I found a sweater I liked at J. Crew with a broken button. So, when I was checking out, I simply said: “This button is broken. Is there anything you can do?”

Without blinking, the cashier said “Sure. 30% off.”

That was my first success. It was so easy — and inspired me to keep negotiating in low-pressure situations, like at stores, at the coffee shop, or on my cable bill, so that I could build the skill for when I really needed it.

I later used the negotiation skills I built in my career — most notably to negotiate job offers. In my last job search, [I successfully got seven companies to raise their salary offers by up to 20%](https://theascent.biz/how-to-negotiate-and-make-half-a-million-dollars-f85da310af3b).

## **Why you should negotiate in your career**

A fear of negotiation is so common that [almost half of all job candidates](https://www.fastcompany.com/3021381/49-of-job-candidates-never-negotiate-an-initial-employment) never try to negotiate their initial offer.

But here’s the thing: most companies *expect* you to negotiate. [In a recent study](https://www.fastcompany.com/3021381/49-of-job-candidates-never-negotiate-an-initial-employment), half of all companies say that they would be willing to negotiate a job offer.

People who don’t negotiate their salary [miss out on $500k](http://www.salary.com/most-people-don-t-negotiate-due-to-fear-lack-of-skills/) — or more — over a lifetime. Negotiating your salary from $50k to $55k — merely an extra $5k — [can lead to half a million dollars of additional earnings over fifty years.](http://heatherhund.com/job-search-resources/) You can also use [this calculator](http://heatherhund.com/job-search-resources/) to see how much your negotiations could generate over the course of your life.

On average, women miss out even more. According to [*Women Don’t Ask](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002WJM4P6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)*, we are four times less likely to negotiate than men — and when we do negotiate, we ask for less and receive 30% less than men. This is likely a contributing factor to the pay gap — currently, on average [women make only 80% of what men do](http://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/).

So, how do you learn to negotiate — especially if you’ve spent a lifetime avoiding it?

## **1. Start by negotiating the small things**

To get comfortable negotiating, start small. Ask for a discount on a product. Or, ask for two stamps on your coffee loyalty card. Or, negotiate a discount on your monthly cable bill. For other ideas on things you can negotiate, [check out this list](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/02/things-you-can-negotiate-entrepreneurs-finance-negotiation_slide_2.html&refURL=https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2F2009%2F12%2F02%2Fthings-you-can-negotiate-entrepreneurs-finance-negotiation_slide_2.html&referrer=https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2F2009%2F12%2F02%2Fthings-you-can-negotiate-entrepreneurs-finance-negotiation_slide_2.html).

You will probably end up being shocked at how often you’re successful negotiating, not to mention that it always feels good to get a deal.

By negotiating small things frequently in your personal life, you will gain the comfort and skill necessary to negotiate larger things in the future — like a job offer or a raise.

## 2. Use friendly language — and questions

A common misperception is that negotiations must involve language a la *Wolf of Wall Street — *words like: “I’m worth this, or “if you don’t pay me X, I’ll take my talents elsewhere,” or “this is my final offer.”

But this perception of negotiation couldn’t be further from the truth.


Negotiation language does not need to be hostile — in fact, using amicable language gives you a better chance of succeeding in a negotiation. According to Harvard Business School professor Deepak Malhotra, [being likable in a negotiation leads to a higher success rate](https://hbr.org/2014/04/15-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer).

I definitely have felt more comfortable — and authentic — using a friendly approach to negotiation.

Recently, I was purchasing a couple new couches for our living room and had sticker shock when I received the quote. So, I called the salesperson and said: “I saw that you had a 20% off Summer clearance promotion that ended last week. Any chance you can still honor this?” Without hesitation, the salesman said: “Sure.” Success!

What I’ve found is this: Negotiation is often as simple as

1. Providing convincing data and

1. Asking a question.

Next time you are buying something — anything — try to negotiate. Here are some ways to practice negotiating with data and/or a question and get great discounts along the way:

* Is there a promotion going on right now? If they say no, try: “This is a large order — any chance you can offer XX% off?”

* I found the same product listed on Amazon (or another retailer) — can you offer it to me at the same price?

* I noticed this small defect — can you offer a discount?

* I saw that you were offering X% off last week — any chance that can still be applied here?

* Would you be willing to provide this service for less? Ideally suggest a number.

## **3. Always try to negotiate**

Getting comfortable negotiating in your personal life is good practice for negotiating larger things in your life — like a job offer or a raise. So, start looking for opportunities to negotiate on a daily basis — then, try.

I almost always ask for deals and discounts, and I’m shocked at how often people unblinkingly just say: “Yes.” I would estimate that I’m successful about 80% of the time.

And when they say no, the relationship always stays cordial. If you approach the negotiation in an friendly way, how can they be upset with you?

So, why does negotiation work so often?

Think about it: negotiation is mutually beneficial for both parties.

In the couch example above, they wanted me to purchase this large order. And, I wanted the product — and to feel like I got a good deal.

We both won.

In a job offer negotiation, the company wants you to work there. And you want to be paid fairly. If you negotiate, you both win.

As a result, you may make an extra half a million dollars — or more — over your lifetime.

# How To Escape The Incoming Stream of Unfiltered Noise

## 

There is an endless stream of mind numbing and borderline useless information posted online every second of every minute of the day. They have a way of finding their way in front of us and grabbing our attention in the form of notifications that lure us into endless streams of posts or video timelines.

Falling in the trap of mistaking the fact that reading hours on end, articles with sticky headlines that lack in substance and content, isn’t parting knowledge.

I’ve been there.

This creates confusion and a sense of void. While we consume so much, we falsely lead ourselves on to believe that we are acquiring knowledge and wisdom but most of the time we are really collecting listicles. Sometimes the same listicles over and over in the same week or month.

Repetition is the mother of skill they say.

So what skills do we develop when we get sucked into marketing speak and are left with nothing thought provoking?

It is as bad as watching the news.

Terrorism sells. That’s why it is a centrepiece of any news story. Once I realised this sometime ago, I changed.

It didn’t happen overnight. It was all about changing my habits.

First I stopped watching the news.

Then limited my Facebook and Twitter endless mode reading.

So what do you do next?

The important disctiction to make here is that you can’t get rid of a destructive habit just by stopping.

It has to be replaced by an empowering one.

So, what habits can you start developing today that are guaranteed to change the quality of your life dramatically for the better?

Below is an indicative list of 5 ways with which I’ve replaced my negative habits. I don’t want to give you another list to follow but just to make you conscious of the fact that do you have the time to direct your learning that to be directed.

### 1. Read Books

If you ask people like Warren Buffet, if they had a superpower what would that be?

The answer you’ll get is to be able to read books faster.

With all this extra time, I started reading books. Real books, mostly kindle versions but something that covered a subject in depth. Not surface reading.

### 2. Listen To Audiobooks

Some people might argue that books take too much time to read and they are too busy for that.

Well, where there is a will, there is a way.

You can now listen to those same books. Most of them have an audio version, which you can get from places like [Audible](https://www.audible.com). Set it to 1.5x speed and listen to the book, while driving, cooking, exercising or while doing any other task that require NET time (No Extra Time).

### 3. Watch Documentaries

If you are the visual kind, like me, you can watch documentaries.

I love watching documentaries.

So you probably have Netflix. It is not just for binge watching House of Cards.

I plead guilty.

Netflix also has a selection of documentaries on various subjects that you can learn so much in those 50–60 minutes.

I recently stumbled upon another service called [Gaia.com](https://www.gaia.com) which has an amazing selection of documentaries and movies that are quite different from the mainstream stuff but still have amazing collections.

For example, I watched a mind blowing documentary this week on the [Secrets of Water](https://shar.es/1ZEFXk). It was done brilliantly and included a lot of the information I’ve read in books and read in scattered articles over the years, condensing knowledge in an hour.

### 4. TED Talks

A new phenomenon in the last few years are TED Talks. They are about 18 minutes in length and can provide though provoking ideas that can create sparks of motivation or even aha moments.

### 5. Medium Authors

There are exceptional writers on Medium, which I follow. Some of them were mentioned in this [post](https://betterhumans.coach.me/five-people-to-follow-right-now-to-be-superhuman-5da16cdc3893?source=linkShare-fac8dc402dd1-1471037943) by [Tony Stubblebine](https://twitter.com/tonystubblebine) and I’m also going to add [James Altucher](https://twitter.com/jaltucher). I find his rants insightful, but again that’s a personal preference.

I guess what I’m really trying to say is to be mindful of what you focus on and what you allow your mind to get sucked into.

I hope you have found this post helpful.

I’d love to know, how do you deal with this daily noise?

# I Think I Found the Ultimate Growth Hacking App.

## 3 unexpected things I learned during my first 50 days using Lift.

I’m on a 50 day meditation streak and I’ve started dreaming about going to Singapore. Oh, I’ve also lost a few pounds and am eating more cupcakes. Before I forget, this post actually has nothing to do with growing your startup, viral marketing or converting users. Instead it has everything to do with achieving your personal goals and making your life better.

Recently my colleague Dan introduced me to [Lift](http://www.lift.do), an app that *“helps you reach your goals.” *While there are lots of apps that I enjoy using and have made my life more efficient ***(***i.e. Dropbox, Skype, WhatsApp, etc), I’m not referring to those here. I’m referring to apps that have fundamentally made my ***life better,** *I don’t come across those too often. I was kind of skeptical at first, but after 50 days of using Lift, I’ve noticed a number of positive results and believe that the app actually works. To help provide some context, here are a few features of Lift that I love:

* Goal Streaks — Lift calculates how **consistent** you’ve been on accomplishing each of your goals (e.g. *Floss for the 16th day in a row).*

* Goal Count — If you’ve missed a day or have a gap in your streak, instead of restarting the count from zero, Lift tells you how many **times** you’ve accomplished the goal instead (e.g. *Wake up by 6:30 for the 23rd time)*

* Reminders — Lift allows me to send myself automated reminders throughout the day (e.g. at 10:30 pm everyday, I get a push notification that says: “*REMINDER: Floss. Today will be a 14 day streak*”). So when I’m about to forget or get lazy, that little** nudge** puts me over the top.

Now that you know a little bit about Lift, here are 3 unexpected things I learned over the last 50 days:

### **1. Lift sparks a journey towards a better understanding of your own psychology.**

I never really understood why I couldn’t stick to my new year’s resolutions, or goals that I’d set for myself every year on my birthday. I didn’t end up going to the gym 100 times in 2011, nor did I finish reading the 24 books that I committed to reading back in 2012. I got started on each of the goals, but somewhere along the way I fell off the wagon and couldn’t figure out how to get myself back on. I just couldn’t motivate myself to start again, and as time passed, the goals became unrealistic, so I never accomplished them. With the help of Lift, the last 50 days were different and here’s why:

* **Getting a Little Push** — I really need it, especially in the beginning when I start on a new goal. Lift’s goal streaks combined with automated reminders, give me the extra push I need to get things done. On some days the push forces me to act on my goals; even if only just to maintain my streak, but who cares it works.

* **Feeling a Sense of Accomplishment** — By checking my goals off in Lift as I complete them, I feel good, it gives me a sense of satisfaction. Looking at a list of 6–10 goals that are all accomplished at the end of the day, makes me feel like I’ve had a productive day.

* **Sharing Publicly Works** — When I share my goals publicly, it reaffirms my commitment to them. I hate starting something and not finishing it, especially when I’ve told people about it. So now, when I meet my friends, I share my goals with them. Since I also have the data available, I also tell them about my goal streaks or how many times I’ve accomplished a particular goal. Publicly sharing my personal goals allows me to talk about them more, and thereby reinforces the fact that I must continue working on them.

* **Habits First, Results Second** — Before I’d set a goal to try and lose 10 pounds by swimming more, eating healthy and going to the gym. Now I’ve learned that I should try building 1 habit, and then allow the results to come over time (i.e not be fixated on losing the 10 pounds). In the case of swimming, I started small, by trying to go once every two weeks. I achieved that goal, and then bumped it up to once a week. I now go twice a week and have actually noticed positive results when I step on the scale. As a result, I’ve now started working on building other fitness related habits like running into my routine. I’ve learned what it takes (*i.e. the how) *to actually build an effective habit for myself.

### **2. Lift sparks meaningful conversations in unlikely situations.**

Getting together with friends often leads to a conversation about new apps we’ve each discovered. The last few times I brought up Lift, I noticed something very different take place. While the conversation started off with usual questions like- what does Lift do, is it free, is it available on both iOS and Android etc, the follow up after was where it changed. My conversations lead to longer discussions about self improvement, trying to accomplish a specific goal and the experience of using the app towards achieving that goal. In some cases, I even gotten into deeper conversations relating to things like technology’s impact on society, human psychology and the current state of public education. So instead of showing off some new photo-sharing app that ends with a quick show and tell demo, conversations around Lift end up being actually meaningful. A simple conversation about the “Lift App” often acts as a gateway towards a more personal discussion on growth, life and happiness.

### **3. Lift sparks a change in workplace culture and peer relationships.**

As I mentioned earlier, I was introduced to Lift by my colleague Dan, making me the second person within our company to start using the app. What’s interesting is that in a short period, we now have five out of our small team of ten on the app as well. Seeing as we have a ‘critical mass’, we now regularly talk about our goals and the challenges we’re experiencing during lunch. In fact, we look forward to it and have even scheduled weekly *Self Improvement *lunches centered around Lift. We all try to help each other with our goals, share what’s working, what’s not, and celebrate each other’s progress.

I think there is something unique here. While some companies try to host events like evening yoga sessions, I find that these sorts of events are forced and ineffective in getting broader team participation. Only a handful of people end up benefiting from the event. Since Lift is really just an app, it allows people to work on personal goals that matter to them, ***on their own time***. You can be doing yoga, paragliding, meditating or even scrapbooking— it doesn’t matter, the point is you’re working on something you want to do for yourself. Oh and by the way, it still manages to build a sense of community through the app’s *Follow* and *Props* features. For example: I follow Dan and if I notice he’s completed a meditation session at 8pm, I don’t feel awkward in giving him props in the evening. What ends up happening is that we’ll even talk about his meditation session the next day when I see him, since I know he had one. Lift is a unique app that’s safe for work and helps to build a positive culture, both when you’re at the office and at home. I’ve learned more about my co-workers by using Lift, than any other app.

### **Conclusion**

Everything I’ve described within this post supports building and sustaining motivation. People start things all the time, but getting back on track after falling astray is the difficult part. Sustaining that initial motivation when you begin your journey is incredibly difficult and Lift’s helped me with that over the past 50 days. I know that’s a short period of time, but I can already see the difference and that’s why I love it. Gaining a better understanding of my psychology, having meaningful conversations, and building a supportive workplace culture have created this threefold strategy that continuously keeps me motivated. Somedays all three converge where I feel like my goals are coming out of my skin, and nothing can stop me from accomplishing them. That’s why I think Lift is a personal growth hacking app. It has these redundancies built into it that help you growth hack at a personal level, towards achieving your own goals and living a better life.

# How To Be The Best Version of Yourself, Even In Bad Weather

## How To Be The Best Version of Yourself, Even In Bad Weather

Last night there was an election. I learned that I’m in the minority— and that was news to me. But I didn’t learn anything new about myself.

For awhile, I’ve been placing articles inside the Better Humans publication that go beyond productivity and diet. They’re not partisan per-se.

But they are about achieving a life that is measured beyond todos and body fat percentage.

As you read Better Humans, I want you to always be considering to what end? To what end do you want to be more productive? Hopefully it’s for a grander reason than just being able to afford a bigger television.

Here is a little inspiration to stay on the path toward Better Humans, whether life goes your way or not.

### We are all allies.

[A person’s political views are their generous attempt to improve the world. By definition, a political person is a person trying to do good](https://medium.com/@tonystubblebine/how-to-be-political-1d9efa2d091e).

However, we are manipulated to be at each other’s throats through the insertion of a simple fear: that life is a zero sum game.

It’s not.

When you win, I often win as well.

There are millions of opportunities for common ground. Sure, please evaluate the other side for mental illness. But all sorts of racists, misogynists, and angry selfish people have eventually come around to the side of good.

More often though,

### Your morals are not a fashion statement.

You don’t choose your morals based on what’s in fashion. You choose them based on a deep examination of your values and the world around you.

But what are your values?

Here’s an idea: write down your values and keep revising them your entire life. The idea is to build up a book representing your accumulated wisdom. This is a life’s work project. We call this your Codex Vitae and [here’s mine for reference](https://betterhumans.coach.me/codex-vitae-635f97552092#.yx4803fw8).

Articulating your values, helps you live them.

### The best medicine is to do good.

Doing good transforms the helped and the helper. If you find yourself in a funk, today or in the future, consider just doing a simple good deed.

* Text someone “I love you.”

* Smile at the person who serves you coffee.

* Send someone a note saying you appreciate them.

These are simple acts of altruism that make you feel more connected and happier. [This is just the tip of the iceberg for reasons to adopt an altruistic mindset](https://betterhumans.coach.me/altruism-as-a-path-to-happiness-c8797ea500f3#.lhmiyiyno).

Maybe this advice is too early to hear. I know my family and extended family is still feeling raw, as am I, from US election results.

I don’t expect everyone reading this to feel the same way. But if you do, one thing that warmed my day and made me feel more connected and more optimistic for the future was a note from a family member to say that he loved us.

These acts of kindness matter and you are capable of delivering them.

# This is How to Feel Fulfilled&#58; Advice From Abraham Maslow

## This is How to Feel Fulfilled: Advice From Abraham Maslow

Do you feel like you have more potential than you’re expressing?

Like there’s this gap between who you are and who you could be?

That can be a frustrating place to be.

Luckily, one of the most prominent psychologists of all time studied this exact problem.

And he came up with some pretty fantastic ideas for solving it.

### Abraham Maslow & “The Self-Actualizing Individual”

Back in the day, mainstream psychologists like Sigmund Freud and B.F. Skinner focused most of their time on mental illness.

When Abraham Maslow came along, he was one of the first psychologists to instead focus primarily on happiness.

He studied the greatest people of his generation, folks like Eleonore Roosevelt and Albert Einstein, and in the process coined the phrase “the self-actualizing individual.”

Maslow argued that “*What human beings can be, they MUST be.*”

So, he wasn’t talking about a mere wish or desire. No, according to Maslow, you have a NEED to “self-actualize” — to express your latent abilities and live your full potential.

Just like you lungs need oxygen, your mind needs self-actualization, or it will suffocate.

Deprived of it, you might not gasp for air, but you will experience other painful symptoms like stress, anxiety, or even depression.

### What Must YOU Be?
> *Musicians must make music, artists must paint, poets must write if they are to be ultimately at peace with themselves. What human beings can be, they must be. They must be true to their own nature.
 — Abraham Maslow*

If you want to feel truly fulfilled, you need to realize your potential.

You have to ask yourself what truly makes you come alive, and then do those things.

If it helps, you can start by reflecting on questions like these (ideally in a [journal](http://www.selfication.com/self-improvement/how-to-write-a-journal/)):

* What did I spend time doing as a kid?

* What activities absorbs me so much that I forget to eat and sleep?

* If money wasn’t an issue, what would I spend my time doing?

Then, it’s all about taking consistent action toward realizing those things.

But don’t feel like you have to make a huge change overnight.

As always, small and consistent steps in the right direction is the best approach. Take [the tiny first step](http://www.selfication.com/personal-productivity/how-not-to-procrastinate/) and then [build the momentum](http://www.selfication.com/habits/get-started-with-a-new-habit/) necessary to carry you where you want to be.

Also, note that the self-actualizing process doesn’t necessarily have to be about finding a more meaningful career. It’s an individual process that can just as easily be about becoming a great parent or friend (or something else entirely).

That’s why Maslow asks the question the way he does:

What must YOU be?

### Growth or Safety

According to Maslow, you have two options at any given moment. You can either:

1. Step forward into growth.

1. Step back into safety.

I like to think of it as a voting game. Every time I take a step forward, I cast a vote for self-actualization. And each time I step back into safety, I cast a vote against it.

Here are some examples:

* I wake up in the morning. If I get up immediately, that’s a positive vote. If I snooze, that’s a negative note.

* It’s time to hit the gym. If I go there, that’s a positive vote. If I stay at home watching TV, that’s a negative note.

* I feel the need to pursue an interest. If I take the first step, that’s a positive note. If I ignore the feeling, that’s a negative note.

These are, of course, just a few possible situations. The truth is, every single moment is a chance to step forward into growth or back into safety.

And here’s why paying attention to your votes is so important: At the end of the day, they will determine how fulfilled you feel.

If your negative votes outweigh your positive by 10,000, you’ll experience some level of stress and boredom. And, as a result, you’ll likely turn to comfort foods, alcohol, TV, or something else that temporarily alleviates those feelings.

But if your positive votes instead outweigh your negative by the same number, you’ll experience happiness and contentment. There won’t be a need for alleviating negative feelings, so you can use that time to take even more action toward self-actualization.

Your positive votes make things spiral upward. And your negative votes make things spiral downward.

So, if you want to feel fulfilled, what you need to do is step forward into growth, instead of back into safety. Again, and again, and again.

### How to Feel Fulfilled, In Summary

Here’s what we’ve covered in this article:

* According to Abraham Maslow, you have a NEED to “self-actualize.” Otherwise, your mind can’t breathe.

* To feel truly fulfilled, you need to realize your potential. You need to find what you’re passionate about and take small steps in that direction.

* In any given moment you can step forward into growth or step back into safety. Pay attention to your votes because they will determine how fulfilled you feel.

* Positive votes make things spiral upward. Negative votes make things spiral downward.

Now, before we part ways, a friendly warning is in place. Dr. Maslow also said: *“If you deliberately plan on being less than you are capable of being, then I warn you that you’ll be unhappy for the rest of your life.”*

I mean, yikes!

Luckily, he also encouraged us not to be perfectionists about it: *“It seems that the necessary thing to do is not to fear mistakes, to plunge in, to do the best that one can, hoping to learn enough from blunders to correct them eventually.”*

So, before you move on to whatever you’re doing next, I encourage you to cast a positive vote right now. Then, as you go about your day, remember that each new situation is a chance for you to step forward into growth.

Make a game out of casting as many positive notes as you can. Before you know it, all those small self-actualization actions will start adding up.

Your mind will get the oxygen it needs, and you’ll feel fulfilled, energized, and excited.

Sound good? Let’s plunge in! :)

# Email is not important

## An alternative title to this post is, “How to get to inbox zero in sixty seconds”, or, “How to get to inbox zero in two steps.”

If you’re wondering how, you can skip to the last paragraph.

Email is not what it used to be. It used to be a way for people to communicate with each other. Then *companies *started using it. When you checked your email, you had some emails that were from people, and some emails telling you the latest update from a company.

Then people *stopped *using email to communicate with each other. Now they text. Or use Facebook. Or Twitter. Or some other social network. In some cases, they don’t really communicate at all. They just post things and hope other people look at it.

All that was left over in email was companies. Now I check my email and it’s just a bunch of product updates.

That might have been okay, but then companies started using Facebook, too. And they made apps. Those apps can send you updates.

When I check my email, there’s a product update. I check my Facebook account and I see the same update. Sometimes they even text me.

Ten minutes before a meeting, I get a reminder email from my calendar. Then I get an alert on my computer. And an alert on my phone. And an alert about the reminder email.

It’s too much.

Email is not important anymore. Information is everywhere. I only need the update once. Usually I don’t even need it once.

Everybody talks about inbox zero. It’s supposed to be about getting things done and being productive. “Reclaim your email, your attention, and your life,” they say. I have an easy way to do that.

Every morning, go into your email and do the following:

1. Click “Select all”

1. Click “Delete”

Don’t even read the titles first. You wont miss anything.

# Größte Demonstrationen seit über 20 Jahren in Rumänien

## Größte Demonstrationen seit über 20 Jahren in Rumänien

### Zehntausende Menschen gehen seit mehr als zwei Wochen gegen die Zerstörung der malerischen Naturlandschaft von Roșia Montană auf die Straße.

Es ist schon spät und die letzte Metro fährt in einigen Minuten, als kurz vor 23 Uhr die Spitze des rund zwei kilometerlangen Demonstrationszuges wieder ihren Ausgangspunkt erreicht, den Universitätsplatz im Herzen Bukarests. Zuvor schallte es über Stunden „Uniți Salvăm Roșia Montană!“ (Gemeinsam retten wir Roșia Montană) oder „Roșia! Roșia! Vine Revoluția!“ (Roșia, Roșia! Die Revolution kommt!) durch die Straßen der rumänischen Hauptstadt.

Knapp drei Wochen zuvor hatte Premierminister Victor Ponta einen Gesetzesentwurf ins Parlament eingebracht, der die Goldförderung in der Gemeinde Goldbach (Roșia Montană), in den siebenbürgischen Westkarpaten, endgültig auf den Weg bringen sollte. Die eigentliche Goldgewinnung wird demnach spätestens 2016 beginnen. Auf diesen Tag wartet das Unternehmen Gabriel Resources, welches etwa 80 Prozent der Anteile an der Roșia Montană Gold Corporation hält, seit 1995. Die restlichen Anteile hält das staatseigene Unternehmen Minvest Deva.

Die Edelmetallgewinnung in der Gegend um Goldbach ist kein neues Phänomen. Seit über 2.000 Jahren wird in der ältesten und bedeutendsten Lagerstätte Europas Gold und Silber abgebaut. Doch nach Willen der Investoren sollen in den kommenden Jahren zwei Talschaften und vier Berge gesprengt sowie hunderte Menschen umgesiedelt werden, unter dem Einsatz von Tausenden Tonnen Zyanid jährlich. Dem Unternehmen winken als Gewinn 300 Tonnen Gold und 1.600 Tonnen Silber, der Bevölkerung eine Kraterlandschaft mit einem vergifteten See von acht Kilometer Durchmesser.

Zur Bewerbung des Vorhabens hat das kanadische Unternehmen in den vergangenen Jahren eine gigantische Medienkampagne gefahren und sich mit Millionenbeträgen insbesondere die Fernsehanstalten zum Untertan gemacht hat. Finanziert hat Gabriel Resources auch die Propaganda-Dokumentation „Mine Your Own Business“. [[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wth_p4p0rfY)] So ist es wenig verwunderlich, dass mehr als 657.000 Menschen die Facebookseite des „Projekts Roșia Montană“ gefällt und laut aktuellen Meinungsumfragen 70 Prozent der Rumänen die Förderung befürworten. [2] Die kurzfristige Aussicht auf ein gutes Einkommen wiegt bei vielen Menschen, insbesondere auch in der Gegend um Goldbach, höher als der Umweltschutz und die damit verbundene langfristige Sicherung der eigenen Lebensgrundlage. Für die Bewohner wurde allerdings auch eine neue Wohnsiedlung in Karlsburg (Alba Iulia) geschaffen.

Auf der anderen Seite stehen die Gegner, Menschen in Goldbach, die ihre Häuser nicht verlassen wollen und Umweltaktivisten, die seit Jahren gegen die Pläne des Unternehmens mobilisieren. Auch die Erinnerungen an die Umweltkatastrophe von vor 13 Jahren in Neustadt (Baia Mare), einer Bergbaustadt im Norden des Landes, sind noch klar vorhanden. Damals brach der Damm einer Golderz-Aufbereitungsanlage und mindestens 100.000 Kubikmeter hochgiftiger Zyanidlauge gelangten über Somesch und Theiß bis in die Donau und ins Schwarze Meer. Über 1.000 Tonnen toter Fisch wurden allein aus der Theiß gezogen. [[3]](http://www.taz.de/!47800/)

Im August fand bereits zum achten Mal das sogenannte FânFest statt. Zu den Konzerten, Theateraufführungen, Workshops und Filmvorführungen kamen rund 6.000 Menschen in den Ort, darunter viele junge Menschen aus Klausenburg (Cluj-Napoca), einer Studentenstadt mit rund 320.000 Einwohnern, die seit Jahren Zentrum des Protests ist. Schon am 2. September, dem zweiten Tag der neu aufgeflammten Proteste, demonstrierten hier 3.000 Menschen gegen die Goldförderung — ebenso viele wie in Bukarest.

In den folgenden Tagen versammelten sich stets 1.000 bis 2.000 Menschen in den Abendstunden am Bukarester Universitätsplatz. Die wöchentlichen Großdemonstrationen wuchsen von rund 12.000 am 7. September auf etwa 25.000 Menschen am vergangenen Sonntagabend an. Insbesondere junge, gut ausgebildete Menschen sind es, die laut pfeifend und trommelnd ihren Unmut, nicht nur gegen „Roșia Montană“, sondern auch gegen die Ignoranz der Politik, den Blackout der Medien, die Korruption und den Ausverkauf des Landes, auf die Straßen tragen.

Wurden die Proteste zu Beginn von den Fernsehsendern fast gänzlich ignoriert, werden sie nun oftmals heruntergespielt oder die Vorteile der Goldförderung beworben. Dabei handelt es sich um die größten Demonstrationen seit der „Revolution“ und den anti-kommunistischen Protesten 1989/90.

# Better Humans and the Death of Content Marketing

## Behind the scenes of the world’s the most trustworthy writing on human potential and self improvement.

Today’s newsletter from Better Humans is a bit different.

Usually we curate some great reads for you to enjoy over the weekend on a particular theme — and don’t worry, I’m including some of those below!

But I also wanted to give you a behind-the-scenes look at what we do to bring you Better Humans.

You’re used to quality content from us; after all, our mission is to bring you the world’s most trustworthy writing on human potential and self improvement. That’s not just hype.

Better Humans began as a way for [Coach.me](http://coach.me/) coaches to highlight their expertise. As we grew, we expanded beyond coaches and opened the doors to any writer who had deep experience with their own self improvement and positive change.

You know how the web is: published “content” is often seen as nothing more than a marketing vehicle, designed to get your clicks, your eyeballs, your attention, and ultimately your wallet. We didn’t want that to happen with Better Humans.

We began curating content so that egregious “listicles” and fluff pieces were banned. Most importantly, we tried to kill a category of articles that was essentially “made up advice.” You’d call that snake oil.

Then [we went all-in on the Medium Members program](https://betterhumans.coach.me/why-we-were-the-first-publication-to-move-to-100-medium-members-a324cd2ef27d), which included banning calls-to-action in articles, so you wouldn’t read an article only to find a plea to join some program at the end. (Not that the programs advertised were bad…but the articles had to be valuable in and of themselves. We trust you to be able to connect with an author if you want to deepen that relationship.)

We began commissioning articles to pay authors a guaranteed rate for high-quality articles. (Interested in writing for us yourself?[ Get all the details here](https://betterhumans.coach.me/write-for-better-humans-4c6c9884fc08).) We work with those authors to help them bring outstanding information to life for you.

Along the way, we’ve found some shocking things.

We discovered plagiarism — usually more in the form of lazy writing than purposeful copying — and kicked off the authors who engaged in it.

In one case, we tried to verify some interesting data from a study cited by the author. We found that the “data” was actually from a book published by a company which lobbies for the fast food, meat, alcohol and tobacco industries, and killed the related assertion in the article.

We found made-up references — in one case, an author mentioned some research findings third-hand. Because we prefer primary sources, we went deeper and investigated to find the primary source. Then we found that it didn’t exist…and that the “respected” publication where it was originally mentioned probably hadn’t even checked to see if it existed!

We’ve talked to academics, asking them, “do you know the source of the data in this graph that appears in all these articles” and heard, “I have no idea!” and — you guessed it — whacked it.

In Better Humans, we plan to follow interesting threads and bring you the most exciting, compelling, and cutting-edge personal development we can. Some of it might even be controversial.

But none of that works if we aren’t trustworthy.

We’re bringing you world’s the most trustworthy writing on human potential and self improvement. That’s job one.

Below are four articles you might like that exemplify our approach. I hope you enjoy them.

In service,
Coach Tony

# The Incredible Power of Your Intuitive Brain — And How to Master It

## 

*“What is going on here?!”*

Thought the head doctor of Vienna General Hospital in 1846. He had a major crisis on his hands as**1 in 6 women were dying of childbed fever.** [[1](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1412804671/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1412804671&linkCode=as2&tag=willpowered-20&linkId=KBRP3YJGVOLALIMR)]

The risk of death was so bad, in fact, that women were choosing to give birth at home rather than going to his hospital–a practice not seen the middle-ages.

This was an embarrassment to him and all he had worked for, so he was determined to find the root of this problem.

He and the rest of the doctors on staff began brainstorming what could be the cause of the disease. Many had theories such as the poor diets of women in Vienna, as well as the problems with the ventilation ducts in the department.

But a doctor named [Ignaz Semmelweis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis#Discovery_of_cadaverous_poisoning) proposed a completely radical theory.

He noticed that all of the doctors that were involved in the birthing process were also doing separate research on dead bodies.

This was before the discovery of germs, so these doctors didn’t sanitize their materials, use gloves, or *wash their hands* between working on dead bodies and delivering babies. So they unknowingly carried all of the diseases with them!

When he made this discovery, Semmelweis immediately began requiring that doctors in his department wash their hands before and after performing medical procedures.

After some time had passed, Semmelweis felt that he had enough evidence to bring to the head of Vienna General and make the hand washing procedures required hospital-wide.

After listening to Semmelweis’ theory and evidence, the head doctor not only refused to make the hand washing rules a hospital-wide practice, he forbid the doctors in Semmelweis’ department from adhering to them!

**He simply could not fathom that the doctors were the ones that were killing their patients.** So he ignored Semmelweis, and attributed the disease to the ventilation system. Which, of course, led to more deaths and no progress.

## THE POWER OF OUR INTUITION

Most of you will look down on the head of Vienna General Hospital–and for good reason.

*How dare he refuse the evidence and allow innocent women to die!*

But the question is…was he just an arrogant or immoral person? Or is it possible that you and I are just as likely to ignore evidence that we don’t want to accept either?

Let’s try to understand *why* this doctor made this decision.

Assuming this man joined the medical field with the purpose of saving lives, we can speculate that he believed his work was doing good for mankind. And at that point in his career, he probably had a lot of evidence supporting the positive impact he had on Vienna.

He likely saved many people, trained many doctors, and helped create advances in medicine.

So with every year of work, he reinforced this message to his [cerebellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum) or “[intuitive brain](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/knowledge-understanding).”

The intuitive brain is responsible for our ability [to ride a bike](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/knowledge-understanding), for our [survival instinct](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/fear-kills-willpower), and for our deeply held beliefs about politics, religion, and [principles](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/principles-benefit-willpower).

In his book [*The Righteous Mind](http://amzn.to/21pN0C5)*, University of Virginia professor [Jonathan Haidt ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Haidt)refers to this part of our brain as “the elephant” because it is powerful, difficult to control, and has a great memory. [[2](http://amzn.to/21pN0C5)]

When you make a snap judgment about someone you meet — good or bad — this is your elephant using years of stored memories of inter-personal relationships to help you understand how you should act towards this person.

## THE TRUE ROLE OF RATIONALITY

By the time Vienna general was having issues with childbed fever, the head doctor already had**years of his elephant believing that doctors are the good guys.**

Doctors *save* lives — they don’t put them in danger.

So when Semmelweis presented his evidence and theory, he made the same snap judgments about it that you would make when hearing evidence contrary to your religious or political beliefs. [[3](http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/fazio/documents/cogemo.pdf)]

Let’s examine why this happens…

When we are presented evidence for or against our beliefs, we think it is communicated to our[cerebrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum)–the conscious, “rational brain.”

Then we believe our rational brain takes the role of a “scientist.”

It searches for the truth, examines the evidence, and makes a well-informed decision. The scientist then informs the elephant about what our beliefs and ideas should be based on the evidence.

### What we believe:

![](1*0Bt7go0PDx65G3q_gT77pw.jpeg)

**However, it is actually the opposite.** It is the intuitive brain that determines our beliefs, and our rational brain acts much more like a “lawyer.” It rationalizes *why we made our judgments*, rather than trying to understand the evidence.

### **What really happens:**

![](1*06zNm7MRydjsa2D0RnGCdw.jpeg)

This is seen perfectly with the head of Vienna General.

When Semmelweis presented the evidence, he didn’t try to understand it and form a judgment based upon his understanding. He saw the evidence, formed an intuitive judgment that it can’t be right, then tried to rationalize his judgment by blaming the ventilation system.

## HOW SNAP JUDGMENTS INFLUENCE DECISIONS

We make [subconscious](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/how-to-influence-the-subconscious-mind), intuitive judgments about almost everything around us.

When you saw the title of this article, you made an intuitive judgment about reading it. When you[woke up this morning,](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/perfect-morning-routine) you made an intuitive judgment about hitting “the snooze.”

When you read words like:

*Inspiration…*

*Terrorism…*

*Friendship…*

*Poverty…*

Your elephant reacts to each of those words through years of memories and associations with what they really mean.

And based on the reaction your elephant takes to a particular word, your lawyer will be more likely to see the rest of the sentence through a different lens. This is called “[Affective Priming](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691808000309)” and it has huge implications for how we see the world, and each other.

In a very popular experiment, researchers showed groups of words like those below and had participants categorize only the second word as either good or bad:

Flower — Happiness

Hate — Sunshine

Love — Cancer

Cockroach — Lonely

Because participants had to respond quickly, it was difficult to categorize the words like sunshine and cancer in the proper category. The elephant was heading in the wrong direction, and the lawyer had to scramble to find the right evidence. [[4](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691808000309)]

The same experiment has been conducted to test various intuitive prejudices against race, age, and social group. You can take it for yourself by [clicking here.](http://projectimplicit.org/index.html)

Of course, your willpower is not immune to this power of the elephant.

When faced with the decision to work on your goals, if your elephant starts heading too far down the path to [procrastination](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/why-we-procrastinate), the rational part of your brain will turn into a lawyer [seeking justification](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/feeling-good-justifies-doing-bad)for putting that work off.

## HOW DO YOU AVOID THIS PATTERN?

So how do you make the best decision and get your elephant going in the right direction?

When I learned about this phenomenon, I immediately believed that if you teach people “how to think” like we do in our top colleges and universities, that will train them to become scientists, rather than lawyers.

Once again, the opposite is true.

The more educated someone is, the more likely they are to act like the head of Vienna General. Even though their rational brain is stronger, it isn’t the scientist that sees the benefits, it’s the lawyer. [[5](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232454999_Everyday_reasoning_and_the_roots_of_intelligence)]

Rather than being better at understanding the evidence, most well-educated people are simply better at rationalizing their judgments. The best debaters aren’t those who are best at finding the truth, but those who are best at arguing.

This shows us that we shouldn’t focus on turning our lawyers into scientists, we should focus on taming our elephants.

Here are three things you can do to gain more control over your elephant:

## 1. BE SELF-AWARE

The first step towards taming your elephant is to simply be aware that it exists.

Understand that you will be powerfully [motivated](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/motivation) to favor justification over understanding when forming your decisions. Those decisions could be as large as your beliefs, or as small as your trip to the gym. Regardless of the decision or implications, your elephant will take the lead.

So take a moment of self-awareness to recognize when this happens, and simply ask *why?* Why do you think your elephant is taking you in this direction? What intuitions is it basing that decision on? Is it really justified?

Being mindful and curious in these moments will shift power from your elephant to your scientist.

## 2. LEARN HOW TO TALK TO YOUR ELEPHANT

The more chances you get to have those moments of self-awareness, the more you will understand your elephant.

The next step is to learn how to communicate with it.

Understand where your intuitions are likely to take you, and come up with ways you can motivate your elephant to make the right decisions.

Be careful to remain curious of your elephant in this step, not judgmental. It is very easy to blame yourself for why you feel a certain way, but that will only shift power back to your elephant.

**This happens me all the time. **As an introvert, my elephant will lead me away from attending events, giving talks, etc. And even though I’m aware of this, it's really easy to blame myself for being shy, rather than to be curious about what I'm really trying to avoid.

By remaining curious, it helps me see the situation for what it is, not what my elephant is building it up to be.

## 3. SHAPE THE PATH

Once you learn how to communicate with your elephant, then it is time to shape your path ahead time to get the elephant moving in the right direction. [[6](http://amzn.to/1q0fu7X)]

For example, one of the biggest struggles I have with my elephant is writing every day.

Oftentimes I sit down in my desk, begin answering emails, checking some marketing numbers, and when it’s time to start writing, my elephant is doing everything it can to distract me. Then I can feel my scientist turn into a lawyer trying to justify putting my writing off.

So I use a method called [the nothing alternative](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/nothing-alternative). Beginning at 8 o’clock, I can either write or do nothing. I can stare out the window or pace around the room, but *I cannot do any other positive work* until I have written at least 500 words.

This subtle change in my path tames my elephant through sheer boredom.

## CONCLUSION

Many of us would believe the head of Vienna General Hospital is sadistic for blatantly ignoring the evidence and costing the lives of countless innocent women. But, unfortunately, his decision is natural and human. **We are not rational–we are intuitive and judgmental.**

Think of your intuitive brain as an elephant. It is powerful, hard to control, and has years of stored memories that shape your judgment. And too often we use our rational brain as a lawyer to justify the elephant, rather than as a scientist to inform it.

You can break out of this pattern by being self-aware of when your elephant takes over, learning how to communicate with it, and shaping the right path ahead of time to make the best decisions.

You cannot silence your elephant–but you can learn how to tame it.

# Ikea Effect&#58; The Science Of Labor, Love, And Crappy Furniture

## A home down the street from me went up for sale the other day. It’s fun to keep track of the market activity around me, so I stopped by the open house to meet the realtor. When I got to the door and saw the asking price, though, my jaw dropped.

They’re asking *how much* for… that!?

Since I keep track of real estate activity, I immediately knew they were asking at least $30,000 too much. “How could they possibly think they’ll get that much for it?” I wondered.

The realtor greeted me and told me a bit about the owner. She had the home built herself and customized every aspect of it to her taste. She picked the carpets, countertops, fixtures, tiles, and paint colors. She’d really poured her creative energy — and a lot of labor — into this place. She saw it as a masterpiece.

Unfortunately, I saw a house like any other but with paint colors I’d never choose.

The seller was suffering a case of what’s know as *Ikea Effect* — a psychological phenomenon that explains how we come to love and value the things we put effort into.

In this case, our home seller was experiencing the negative side of the Ikea Effect, but there are a few positive ones you should know about because they can, in fact, save you a lot of money (or even make you a lot) and add an extra layer of happiness to your life.

![](0*hWWsSPXgAklb5z89.jpg)

## Ikea Effect: Why We Love The Things We Labor On

A few psychologists at Harvard had a hypothesis — you’ll pay more and enjoy more the things you create yourself. One of them had attended a Build-A-Bear workshop and walked away wondering why he spent so much on a teddy bear *he* had to put together when he could have spent half as much to have some else do it for him.

A psychologist as you know, though, cannot simply ask a question and leave it unanswered.

He and a few colleagues designed an experiment to test whether building something yourself — even if the end result is garbage compared to the work of an expert — will cause you to value your own creation higher. [1]

To test, they rounded up a bunch of college students, handed them a box of unassembled Ikea furniture, and set them loose to put it together. Over the course of several experiments, some subjects constructed their pieces masterfully. Others, not so much. Others, still, were instructed to build the piece and then take it apart.

At the end, each subject had the opportunity to buy the thing they’d just labored on. The ones who succeeded in finishing the project were eager to pay top dollar for the brilliant craftsmanship (that they judged themselves, of course).

To know just how *top* that top dollar was, though, there had to be a comparison. So, other students who were not part of the building experiment were brought in and shown the Ikea creations of the others and asked, “How much would you pay for this?”

Unsurprisingly, the answer was, “not very much!” All they saw was some shoddy furniture.

Across several different tests, the research showed people who built things themselves were willing to pay, on average, anywhere from 2x to 5x more than those who didn’t.

That’s how this phenomenon earned the name Ikea Effect. When it’s in a box, it’s just a pile of parts. But once you assemble it, it’s *your *pile of parts! That furniture now represents more than just a chair, a box, or a 17-piece drawer organizer with specialty hinges. It represents your time, your attention, and your skill in creation.

You really do [love what you make for yourself](http://riskology.co/building-happiness/) more than anything else, and that’s why you pay so much more for a teddy bear you had to assemble yourself.

## How To Profit From The Ikea Effect

Just knowing you’ll enjoy and appreciate the things you sweat for more than the things you don’t will pay huge dividends in life. Rather than opting for ready-made solutions, you’ll find happiness in the struggle of creating your own.

Don’t buy pre-built furniture. Get out the tools and put it together yourself. Don’t pay someone to fix things around your house, do it yourself. Car needs a new fan belt? Download the manual and install it on your own.

Just doing these things will make you a happier, more satisfied person. But there’s also profit to be found in the same strategy — [the profit of inconvenience](http://riskology.co/profit-of-inconvenience/).

When you value the things in your life more, you’re less likely to want to replace them as often. I had a special bond with my old car because I always [worked on it myself](http://riskology.co/fix-it-yourself/). And when my iPhone broke down last year, I pulled it apart and learned to fix it so I could keep using it.

And if you run a business, you can reap massive rewards by putting the Ikea Effect to work for your customers. Whenever you can, let them customize the products and services you offer to fit their needs. Make them feel like their own creativity and effort went into getting what they need from you. They’ll pay more for it. [2]

So labor on and love your creations. The science says you really don’t have a choice, anyway.

***Sources/Notes:** 1. [The “IKEA Effect”: When Labor Leads to Love ](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/11-091.pdf)2. The research did find, though, that people only paid more when they were successful at completing their task. If they failed, the effect disappeared. Keep this in mind!*

# Everything is Permanent

## Once something is done, there is no going back. It doesn’t matter how amazing or foolish it was, the past is in the past. That time and those opportunities? They never come again in quite the same way. We are always wiser, with more regrets, or less courageous, depending on what we taught ourselves from the last experience. We can never undo the past.

And yet, our stories only make sense when we look back on them. The farther back we look, the stranger the story seems. The future is always this somewhat vague, murky fog of confusion, so we play it safe. We stay close to shore. If we stray too far, we tend to steer back, afraid of what might wait out there. There could be an ambush!

But, what if sticking close to shore is what holds us back? What if, in our effort to stay safe in the short term, we undermine our confidence, and our capacity for transformation, in the long term? Staying next to shore also means never making amazing discoveries. We might find something new, but it tends to be more of the same, not radically different. We keep digging the same ditch as the guy before us. Why?

Here’s the thing: going forward, everything is confusing. No matter how close we stay to the coast, the unending fog of an unknown future will *always *press in, eventually. When it happens, we **never **expect it. We kept hoping it would never happen, so here we are, totally unprepared. When we aren’t used to navigating in the unknown, we panic. We try to go back to the familiar, but that isn’t always possible. We don’t know how to get there. We can’t do anything to change the weather, we just have to cope.

We can’t get rid of the fog, but we can learn to work with it. We can learn to use different skills. We can learn to follow our hearts, to follow our heads, and trust maybe not in our current skills, but in our ability to gain new skills as we discover they are needed. If confidence and resilience are the key factors to success, staying too close to the coast is a trade route towards failure. The only way forward is forward. The only way out of crisis is through.

# What Rosa Parks Can Teach Us About Changing the World

## As a child growing up in an urban environment, my initial awareness of the civil rights movement was from a purely historical context. My immediate family and neighborhood reflected cultural diversity, and I projected that onto the rest of the world. Acceptance was all I knew. It wasn’t until I moved to a rural area that I realized that wasn’t the case everywhere. Those experiences in my teenage years both troubled and transformed me into a lifelong student of how societies evolve.

![](0*bH3VgS8cOWPXoOE2.jpg)

Charles Duhigg’s recent book [*The Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400069289/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400069289&linkCode=as2&tag=kendrkinni-20)* includes a riveting discussion of the role habit plays in successful movements. (For anyone seeking to have a meaningful impact on the world, I’d consider it required reading.) In the first case study, Duhigg explores the Montgomery Bus Boycott from a fascinating and surprisingly insightful perspective.

**Rosa Parks was not merely symbolic of a larger movement. She was its epicenter, and quite possibly, one of the few individuals capable of doing so. If not for her actions in the decades previous to her refusal to stand on that December Thursday in 1955, the Montgomery Bus Boycott and its ripple effects might never have happened.**

Rosa Parks was woven deep into the social fabric of Montgomery, across nearly every racial and economic line.

*“She was the secretary of the local NAACP chapter, attended the Methodist church, and helped oversee a youth organization at the Lutheran church near her home. She spent come weekends volunteering at a shelter, others with a botanical club, and on Wednesday nights often joined a group of women who knit blankets for a local hospital. She volunteered dressmaking services to poor families and provided last-minute gown alterations for wealthy white debutantes. She was so deeply enmeshed in the community, in fact, that her husband complained that she ate more often at potlucks than at home.”*

She was a common thread between groups that didn’t otherwise intertwine. Upon her arrest, the unique combination of those threads would be apparent.

Parks called her parents from the police station, panicked. Not sure what to do, her mother called the wife of E.D. Nixon, the former head of the Montgomery NAACP. She called her husband, and he immediately called Clifford Durr, a prominent white lawyer that knew Parks because she had hemmed dresses for his three daughters.

They were the first to recognize the opportunity and asked Parks if she would be willing to let them fight her arrest in court. Despite her husband’s fear for her safety, she agreed. “If you think it will mean something to Montgomery and do some good, I’ll be happy to go along with it.”

**As Duhigg explains, “the first mass movement of the modern civil rights era … began with Rosa Parks because she had a large, diverse, and connected set of friends — who, when she was arrested, reacted as friends naturally respond, by following the social habits of friendship and agreeing to show their support.”**

*That night — just a few hours after the arrest — news of Park’s jailing began to filter through the black community. Jo Ann Robinson, the president of a powerful group of schoolteachers involved in politics and a friends of Parks’s from numerous organizations, heard about it. So did many of the schoolteachers in Robinson’s groups, and many of the parents of their students. Close to midnight, Robinson called an impromptu meeting and suggested that everyone boycott the city buses on Monday, four days hence, when Parks was to appear in court.*

*Afterwards, Robinson snuck into her office’s mimeograph room and made copies of a flyer. Early the next morning, Robinson gave stacks of the flyers to schoolteachers and asked them to distribute it to parents and coworkers. Within twenty-four hours of Parks’s arrest, word of her jailing and boycott had spread to some of the city’s most influential communities — the local NAACP, a large political group, a number of black schoolteachers, and the parents of their students. Many of the people who received a flyer knew Rosa Parks personally — they had sat next to her in church or at a volunteer meeting and considered her a friend.*

Those friendships were critical.

Without them, the movement may have ended before it began.

“Studies show that people have no problem ignoring strangers’ injuries, but when a friend is insulted, our sense of outrage is enough to overcome the inertia that usually makes protests hard to organize,” Duhigg elaborates. “When Parks’s friends learned about her arrest and the boycott, the social habits of friendship — the natural inclination to help someone we respect — kicked in.” (To carry the movement further, two other societal habit patterns would need to emerge, and the book explains those in detail as well.)

**Rosa Parks sparked a movement that changed the world because she was so active and respected in her community. “Rosa Parks was one of those rare people of whom everyone agreed that she gave more than she got,” according to Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize-winning civil rights historian. “Her character represented one of the isolated high blips on the graph of human nature.”**

If we want to change the world, the same must first be true for us as well.

# How to Avoid Plateauing in the Quest for Personal Growth

## Lessons from the therapy couch

![Photo: [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/@anastasia_p)](1*Pdmv9M2hk6e8dQGqw1cImQ@2x.jpeg)*Photo: [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/@anastasia_p)*

Think back to the last time you had a coach. Maybe you were on a high school sports team or learning a musical instrument. Think about the progress you made (or didn’t!). Did you practice the same thing day after day, or did you gradually develop various skills at once? Did you practice on your own, inspired by the skills you were learning? Or were you like me with the trumpet, knowing I should practice on my own, that practice would make me better, but letting my skills stagnate anyway?

Plateauing, or reaching a state of little or no change after a time of activity or progress, is very common in therapy—and in goal setting in general. The less accountable or committed you are to your goal, the more likely you are to plateau. Having a coach makes you accountable to someone. Having a therapist who consistently reviews your goals helps make you accountable as well.
> # “If nothing changes, nothing changes. If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’re going to keep getting what you’re getting. You want change, make some.” —[**Courtney C. Stevens](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6431805.Courtney_C_Stevens)**

Even people in therapy can plateau, despite the best efforts of both patient and therapist. Cognitive behavioral therapy, one of the more widely researched and empirically supported therapeutic approaches, is generally considered a short-term therapy, meaning results are expected within 10 to 20 sessions (three to six months). Despite this, patients can often end up in treatment for more months or even years. Often this is through no fault of their own, and it may even be the case that remaining in therapy does not mean the patient is not benefitting from treatment.

Nevertheless, getting stuck when you’re trying to change or improve something in your life can be one of the most frustrating experiences, and it causes many of us to give up on our goals.

There are many different prevention and interruption strategies we can use to deal with plateauing in our goals. Here are some that have been useful to my patients.

![](0*L_oB54fvFAR42Ftv.)

## Clarify Your Goals

Often when people come into therapy, all they know is that they want to “get better” or “feel happier” or “fix their relationship.” These are fine goals, but they are far too broad to know if or when progress is being made. In session, I’ll ask my patients specific questions to help them drill down not only on what they want to improve but also *how* they will know if it is improving or not.

These questions are useful when the plateau is starting to set in and can help jump-start new approaches or behaviors:

1. Imagine this wasn’t just a plateau, but the beginning of you failing to reach your goal. If we were to work backwards, where would you say you stopped making progress? (This premortem question is asked primarily at the start of work but can also be useful prior to or during a plateau.)

1. How will you know you are ready to end or reduce the frequency of our interactions? What will be different?

1. Is there a way to make your goal absurdly specific? For me, I have frequently wanted to “get better at basketball.” I have been better served by deciding “I want to develop a left-handed layup.” Similarly, dieting is much more likely to be successful when we choose to cut out something specific like soda rather than just having the goal to “eat healthier.”

![](0*ZOfNmQh0AZsnCN9k.)

## Keep Introducing Changes, Even Small Ones

Often people plateau in their progress because they slip back into old routines or ways of thinking. There are a lot of reasons this happens, but if you think about how long we have had to settle into our behavior and thought patterns, we often set ourselves up with unrealistic expectations. We think and act the way we do because of years, even decades, of conditioning. Those patterns are not so easily changed by flimsy New Year’s resolutions or a couple of therapy sessions. That being said, there are ways to throw these patterns off and make change more accessible.

Here are some examples of small changes that have helped kick-start progress for my patients:

1. If you’re trying to cut down on a negative behavior like smoking or biting your nails, use an app or a small notebook to track the number of times throughout the day that you commit the offending behavior. This helps make the automatic or unconscious behavior more conscious.

1. Change your physical environment. This could mean rearranging your bedroom or your workspace. If you see something differently, you just might think and act differently, too.

1. Practice [tiny habits](http://tinyhabits.com/), or baby steps to restart the change process.

It’s a myth that you must have all these strategies in place on day one. And likewise, just because you have some success early doesn’t mean you should stop adding changes.

![](0*ZNdmfsy9FiW5lRky.)

## **Practice Forgiveness**

When I worked with patients struggling with drug addiction, it was very important that they not let a relapse (or recovery plateau) turn into ongoing drug use. Unfortunately, the guilt and shame of having a setback or making a mistake (like indulging in fast food while on a diet) often turns into people completely abandoning their diet instead of acknowledging that relapse (or plateauing) is often a part of recovery. When framed this way, you can acknowledge that you are technically right on track in your quest for personal growth and need only forgive yourself and return to working toward your goal.

![](0*pxgh5_uaTOCOZeDb.)

## **Create Accountability**

It is much more difficult to hold ourselves accountable than it is to be accountable to someone else, whether that be a therapist, coach, parent, or partner. This is also why having a sponsor is a main tenet of Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous. If you know that you aren’t the only person who would be let down if you don’t achieve your goal, you are more likely to push through those early plateaus, and you would also have the encouragement to help you avoid it in the first place.

Accountability resources:

1. [**Coach.me](https://www.coach.me/):** I have used this resource as a client and as a [coach](https://www.coach.me/Ryan_Engelstad?ref=VDmmB) and have found it to be very effective in helping people stick to their goals and preventing plateaus. [*Editor’s note: I run Coach.me, so take Ryan’s recommendation here as biased.*]

1. [**Stickk.com](http://www.stickk.com/):** I have used this service as a client to help hold myself accountable to regularly posting to my blog in the past. The general way it works is you link your bank account and assign a referee (I used my mom). If you don’t meet your weekly commitment, your referee informs the website through email check-in, and then a predetermined amount of money is transferred to your Stickk account. You can choose to have this money moved into a separate bank account or sent to an “anti-charity”—a charity to which you would *not* want your money sent. This concept is known as “loss aversion” and has been shown to be a strong motivator.

1. **The personal route:** This includes everything from getting a friend to be a gym buddy to finding a writing partner through a writers’ Facebook group to telling your family about a new project you’re working on, because you know they will ask you about it every time they see you.

1. **The social media route:** Announce your goal and progress on your social network of choice. Knowing your goal has been announced to the world will make you more likely to stick to it—or it will make you delete that social network account to avoid the embarrassment of not following through, which will have its own benefits!

![](0*G4y11glvAdqLfBZh.)

## A Note About Working with a Coach/Therapist

One thing I cannot emphasize enough when working with a coach or therapist: If you are plateauing in your work with that person, don’t be afraid to question their approach or methods. Coaches and therapists may be experts, but it doesn’t make them (or me) perfect or infallible. Ask if they have any alternative approaches that they are willing to try with you. If it really isn’t working, you can even ask for a referral to another coach or therapist. You don’t owe your coach or therapist anything, and you deserve to work with someone who will help you continue progressing toward your goals.

In summary, even though plateauing is often a part of the behavior change process, it does *not* have to be, and using these methods can help keep you on track.

# Make The Most Of Scarce Time & Money With This Simple Tool

## Photo by Aaron Benson on Unsplash

It’s easy to waste your time. You can sweat and toil and only achieve a tenth of your potential. So how do you focus on what makes the most of your scarce resources?

Use the Impact vs Effort Matrix.

With it, you can discover which of your ideas have the most value. You’ll focus on maximising impact and minimising effort. If you’ve already heard of it, keep reading as I’ve put a new spin on it.

I am going to walk you through an example I used in my line of work. All you need to know is that I am responsible for coaching people in my organisation. I help them to use technology to do their job in a better way, to be more efficient and effective.

## Getting Started

The Impact vs Effort Matrix is easy to create. Grab a piece of paper. Draw a vertical axis for impact and a horizontal axis for effort.

![](1*zUBjEhzc7qmAEW2q_CCeQw.jpeg)

You’ll need some unit of measurement. For impact this could be profit, time saved, happiness gained or skills learnt. Make it whatever matters most to you.

Effort is usually measured in money or time spent. It could also be the number of favours you need to call in or energy expended. Make it whatever fits best with how difficult the task is. Effort should be whatever is your constraining factor or bottleneck. If you are cash-rich and time-poor, it’s time, and vice versa.

You can also think about effort like a production line. On any production line, there is always a bottleneck. The slowest machine or process is the bottleneck. How do you measure how long a widget take to pass through this machine or process? That is how you measure effort. You’ll want to optimise for this. What is your bottleneck?

Don’t overthink your units. Use this model to help you think through options, not undertake perfect analysis.

For this example, I based impact on the change it would make to my coachees’ work. There are three thousand people in my organisation. The highest impact was a game changing intervention for those three thousand. I made an assumption that a modest improvement for ten people was as good as a game changer for one. That’s debatable, but–as I said above–the analysis doesn’t have to be perfect.

I measured effort in time spent by me and my team. Note this is actual time worked. I didn’t include downtime e.g. whilst waiting for someone else.

## Add your ideas

Then I started to add some of the ideas we have for coaching people.

![](1*B8BrB-VifokuNtKGjAjMrw.jpeg)

Anything in the top left is high value; it has high impact for low effort. As you can see there isn’t anything in that category, yet. We’re going to start dancing around the matrix until we get there.

## Improve your ideas

The first thing you can do is focus on doing what is highest value. But first, can you improve the value of any of your ideas? There are two ways to improve the value of an idea. Make it easier or increase the impact. Logically you’ll do this on your highest value ideas, but to show the technique I’ll do this with our lowest value idea.

Let’s consider increasing the impact first. One of the ideas on there came from a brainstorming session: the roboadvisor. The idea is to programme a robot that runs around the office giving people tips whilst they’re at their desk. At first, it felt like a fun, but low-value idea. Something we would never do. We don’t have the skills to program a robot and it feels like a gimmick.

I started thinking about how to increase the impact. The robot could only get around a certain number of people. I expect it would have a clunky interface. A software solution, however, is something everyone can use. A chatbot to offer advice. That immediately boosted the impact.

![](1*FcL57Fq9Zq4TsKKJT2b5-A.jpeg)

Now, how can we reduce the effort? My team is small. We have more cash than time at the moment, so we can reduce effort by trading cash for time. In this case that would be bringing in a contractor to program a chatbot for us. That shifts us to the left.

![](1*7SA_0xA9X_8jNCGuzSwx2w.jpeg)

## Keep improving your ideas!

Can we make it even easier? We can trade off some of the impact for effort. A chatbot is engaging, but do we need something so fancy? Would a searchable knowledge base offer most of the needed features with a lot less effort? Yes!

![](1*elPPL-fAdMfxq6w-6WxzuA.jpeg)

It would be easy to stop here. We’ve moved a lot to the left and a fair bit up too. Don’t stop until you have exhausted all your options. How can we make this knowledge base even easier to create?

My team has a network of ‘champions’ throughout the organisation. Tech-savvy people who help us coach the rest. Rather than my small team generating all the content, could we set up a wiki? That reduces the effort, at least from my team’s point of view. It increases the impact as the network can crowdsource ideas. It also gets people using the system straightaway.

![](1*Q1LDRN6BOjIFDSagSlri7w.jpeg)

A throwaway idea from a brainstorming session becomes our most valuable intervention. Imagine if you did this with all your ideas.

## Apply the Impact vs Effort Matrix to anything

Whilst I’ve given an example from my work, you can apply this method to anything you are doing. Here are some ideas:

* Time spent with the family — what are the most enjoyable things you can do with the least cost or effort to organise?

* Food — what recipes are the healthiest or tastiest whilst being the cheapest or quickest to make? See this [blog for why icing is BS.](https://medium.com/@dasbarrett/cake-as-work-255567171e3f)

* Investments — what is going to make you the most money with minimal oversight?

* Fitness — what is going to make you stronger, faster or more mobile in the least time?

* Applying for jobs — where should you apply and how?

I’d love to hear how you apply the Impact vs Effort Matrix. Let me know in the comments.

# This is How to Consistently Make Progress on Your Goals

## This is How to Consistently Make Progress on Your Goals

Jack Nicklaus is widely regarded as the greatest golf player of all time.

During his career, he racked up 18 major championships, 19 second places, and 9 third places over a period of 25 years (1).

When asked what makes a golf player great, Nicklaus gave a fascinating answer:

“I have always felt that the mettle of a player is not how well he’s playing when he’s playing well, but how well he scores and plays when he’s playing poorly.” (2)

No matter what your goals are, this is a key idea to keep in mind. Let me explain why.

### The Importance of Playing Poorly Well

We all know what it’s like to work on our goals when we’re feeling inspired. And it’s pretty awesome.

Without much effort, we find ourselves doing the required work day after day.

There’s a feeling of effortlessness as our burning motivation carries us through each task.

Unfortunately, we’re all also very familiar with what happens when that initial inspiration goes away.

Suddenly, we have to muster up a ton of [willpower](http://www.selfication.com/the-science-of-willpower/) to get anything done.

What previously came together pretty much all by itself now requires a ton of discipline.

It’s in these moments that it’s crucial we learn how to play poorly well.

### The Power of Momentum

The team at Coach.me ([where I’m one of the coaches](http://www.selfication.com/coaching/)) build all their coaching training around one core principle — momentum (3).

The reason for this is that when a client is sitting on their couch doing nothing, it can be very hard to spark a change.

But when someone is actively moving toward a goal, suddenly there are thousands of opportunities to do it.

With consistent action comes greater confidence and optimism. You can measure what’s working and make continual refinements. And you have constant opportunities to [celebrate small wins to reinforce good habits](http://www.selfication.com/the-power-of-small-wins/).

Momentum is a super important principle in behavior change. And it’s also one of the most overlooked.

### Momentum First, Results Second

We tend to think about our habits in a vacuum: “If I skip the gym today, it won’t make much of a difference in my long-term results.”

And although this is true, we’re forgetting about the importance of momentum.

If you skip one day, you might as well skip two. If one day off doesn’t affect your results, two won’t either.

Once you’ve skipped two days, you might as well skip the entire week. It still won’t affect the results much, and you’ll get a fresh start on Monday, right?

Well, not really. With all of your momentum gone, it will be much harder to get back into your routine.

It might take you weeks, months, or even years to get going again.

And this is why, on any given day, it’s not your results that are important.

**What’s important is that you keep your momentum going.**

### Keep Big Mo Happy

Author Darren Hardy refers to momentum as his friend “Big Mo”:

“You can’t see or feel Mo, but you know when you’ve got it. You can’t count on Mo showing up to every occasion, but when it does — WOW! Big Mo can catapult you into the stratosphere of success. And once you’ve got Mo on your side, there’s almost no way anyone can catch you!” (4)

In my experience, it only takes a couple of missed occasions to scare off this precious friend.

If you miss one day, Mo gets cranky. If you miss two days, he’s packing his bags. If you miss three, he leaves and won’t return for a LONG time.

So, how do you develop the [consistency](http://www.selfication.com/consistency/) to always have Big Mo by your side?

You learn how to play well when you’re playing poorly.

### Minimum Daily Quotas

We all have days when we’re not on top of our game. And it’s crucial for our success to be prepared for these occasions.

The most effective strategy I’ve come across for playing well when I’m playing poorly is **minimum daily quotas.**

Whenever I find myself particularly tired and uninspired, I forget about the results. And instead, I focus on getting the absolute minimum done so I can keep Big Mo happy.

* Instead of writing 1,000 words, I write 100.

* Instead of going to gym, I go for a run or a brisk walk.

* Instead of meditating for 10 minutes, I sit for 2 minutes.

I find a way to do something, no matter how small, to move me closer to my goal.

By doing this, I ensure I make some progress every day and keep myself from having to start over without Mo.

And as a very nice bonus, once I hit my minimum daily quota, more often than not, I’ll find that I’ll WANT to keep going.

Almost always, [getting started is the hardest part](http://www.selfication.com/how-not-to-procrastinate/). So by aiming for a smaller goal than usual, you can often “trick” yourself into what becomes a great performance.

And that’s a very powerful tactic for playing poorly well.

### How to Consistently Make Progress on Your Goals, In Summary

* You never know when inspiration will go away. Therefore, you need to know how to play poorly well.

* Momentum is a super important principle in behavior change.

* On any given day, your results aren’t nearly as important as keeping Big Mo happy.

* If you miss one day, Mo gets cranky. If you miss two days, he packs his bags. If you miss three, he’ll leave and not come back for a long time.

* When you’re not at the top of your game, use daily minimum quotas to keep Mo happy.

* By aiming for a smaller goal, you can often “trick” yourself into what becomes a great performance.

It’s okay to have days when you’re not on top of your game. We all have them. What’s important is that you still show up every single day and make some sort of progress.

Play poorly well and keep your momentum going. If you can do this, the results you want will show up as a natural side effect of your consistent efforts.

# Superhuman — why you MUST leave your comfort zone to find happiness

## why you MUST leave your comfort zone
to find happiness

![](1*3Ww5c4bQ6vtcuAN_tMe-jw.jpeg)

![](1*smcVNfk2cuMB89GVvIjNZg.jpeg)

![](1*RuT4g6HRoAzXCbIrH1ndbQ.jpeg)

![](1*ek7ICeiApfzzHckw9PHhHQ.jpeg)

Look around where you are right now.

I guess you are reading this on the big screen of your computer at work, sitting in your height-adjustable office chair, coffee mug right next to you.

Or maybe you are at the library, checking facebook, using their free wifi during a study break.

Unless you are already home for the day, cuddled up on the couch in your pajamas with your iPad, freshly delivered pizza in the still warm box sitting on your lap.

Wherever you read this, I am betting you are knee deep **inside your comfort zone.**

I’ve been there. Often times I still am. But then I remember that I must leave it.
*Damn, that’s comfy.*

Before convincing **YOU** to leave it as well, I would like you to do **one thing.**

No worries, you won’t have to get up (yet). I just want you to ask yourself a bunch of questions. Look at the important areas of life:

**Motivation – **are you excited to get out of bed in the morning? Do you wake up 1 minute before your alarm goes off and say: “Let’s do this!”?

**Exercise – **are you working out regularly? Do you walk a lot during your day? Did you take the stairs or the elevator this morning?

**Diet – **what did you have for your last meal? If it included “Frosted”, “Sweetened” “McSomething” or “Fried”, you might want to look at your dining choices again.

**Initiative – **is your brain quick and sharp? Did you do the crossword this morning? Can you solve an integral by hand? When is the last time you found a creative solution for a problem at work? Does your bank account reflect your work in appropriate numbers?

**Calmness – **are you anxiety-free? Are you afraid about what the cute co-worker from the office next door said to her friend about you in the kitchen? Do you wake up at night, worrying about tomorrow?

Try to come up with a number for each of those categories. Add them up, divide them by 5, and you will get the average.

**A rough estimate of your happiness.**

**Now: Tell me your number.**

(Seriously, [do tell me!](http://niklasgoeke.com/en/contact/))

If it’s a 7 or higher, kudos! You will feel right at home here, maybe we can get together some time and exchange ideas!

If it’s anything less, then you have **all the more reason to stay.**

Because here is a **secret**:

As wondrous and useful as all these **modern comforts **we rely on are,
they sometimes actually **keep us from being happy.**

Case in point:

While, according to Wikipedia, office chairs are indeed [‘adjustable to provide the maximum comfort’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_chair), guess who originally came up with the idea?

[**Charles Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin).**

He put wheels on his chair in order to be able to work faster and investigate even more specimens. The guy spent 5 years on a ship, facing earthquakes and seasickness, studying natural history and geology – topics no one remembers him for today – and worked so much that it almost killed him on multiple occasions.

Sounds pretty **uncomfortable **to me. Here’s a quote from the man:

“A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.”

How about facebook?

Invented by a guy who learned programming when he was 10. The only thing I learned when I was 10 is how to get Charmander to evolve to Charizard. The guy also wouldn’t let people eat during work marathons.

**Very uncomfortable.**

And the iPad? Work of a man who battled cancer with all his power multiple times, in order to push the human race forward. He spoke publicly for as long as possible.

His last major keynote took place only 122 days **before he died.**

**They stepped out of their comfort zone on a daily basis,
so you can now remain in yours.**

**Was their life all rainbows and marshmallows?**

**Hell no.**

**Will they leave this world with a smile on their face?**

**You bet.**

But what’s their lesson? I believe it to be the following:

It is not when we turn on the hot water in the shower in the morning for the 14237th time that we are most happy, but when we **push our limits, learn to deal with something new, feel the burn in our muscles as they grow and go out of our way to help others.**

**Discomfort leads to growth. And growth leads to happiness.**

The good news is that makes happiness very easy to find.
Literally, all you have to do, is **search for it.**

If you **start leaving your comfort zone today**, I guarantee you will become **superhuman — **with the power of healing yourself, your health, your wealth, your love life, and, most importantly, your **happiness**.

No matter where you lack in any of the above areas, change one thing today, one tiny thing, and I promise you will be happier for it tomorrow. Because you stepped out of your comfort zone – and that made you grow.

Now I’m not suggesting you jump out of a plane, run a marathon or solve a Millennium Prize Problem right away.

But ask yourself this:

**When did you last make a conscious decision to leave your comfort zone?**

**Decisions, such as:**

* **Taking the slightly longer way when walking to work.**

* **Actually walking to work or taking the bike rather than the car.**

* **Having your coffee without milk and sugar.**

* **Putting on 5 kg more than your regular working out weight, just to see if you can do it.**

* **Eating your fries without ketchup, or the burger without the fries, or even go vegetarian or vegan for a full day.**

* **Reading a book on genetics or rocket science.**

* **Finding out according to what formula your bank account’s interest is generated.**

* **Writing a full page by hand, no matter what the topic may be.**

* **Thinking of a clever way of asking out the girl you have been sitting next to all week.**

* **Calling an old friend whom you haven’t talked to in years, and saying thank you for the good times you had together.**

**What is the one thing you can do today, to make a small step outside of your comfort zone?**

There is nothing wrong with starting small, Rome wasn’t build in a day, as they say. What’s the worst that could happen? You don’t like it, and you go back to things the way they were before. And sometimes you will. But sometimes you won’t.

No matter what the outcome might be, your brain will reward you with **dopamine, endorphins, oxytocin** and a few other happiness hormones. It will be the brain’s way of saying:
> # **„Thank you for trying something new,
> # thank you for leaving your comfort zone
> # and learning something today.“**

If Darwin, Zuckerberg and Jobs had to agree on one sentence to leave you with, I’m sure they’d say this:

**Every step outside of your comfort zone is a step towards happiness.**

# How George Lucas Lost His Integrity…and Why it’s So Important

## 

*“People don’t realize Star Wars is actually a soap opera and it’s all about family problems —** it’s not about spaceships.”***

Said [George Lucas](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/george-lucas-lost-integrity#) soon after watching [Star Wars Episode VII](http://www.starwars.com/news/category/star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens) in an [interview with Charlie Rose](http://www.slashfilm.com/george-lucas-charlie-rose-interview/). This was the first time he’d put Star Wars in someone else’s hands, and he felt like it had been abused.

*“There were two things that have been abused from the original release of Star Wars.*

*The first was that people thought the success of Star Wars was about special effects and space battles, when there was much more to it than that. So they became obsessed by the latest special-effects tools and no longer cared about the story.*

*The other thing that got abused — especially in an American capitalist society — is that studios said ‘WOW we can make a lot of money’ and they did it.*

*The (stories of Star Wars) were my kids…I loved them, I created them, and I sadly sold them to the ‘white slavers’ who take these things and…”*

As he spoke, I could see the pain and regret in Lucas’ expression. Here was an artist who created a universally loved piece of work, and now he believed it was being milked for every penny it was worth by the studio system he always resented.

As a kid, I was a huge Star Wars fan. I greatly admired Lucas for his creativity, innovation, and for imagining any young boys fantasy weapon–[the lightsaber.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber) But as I dug deeper into the truth behind Star Wars I realized…

*Lucas is deceiving everyone… including himself. [[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jWtbJxzGpQ)]*

## THE ROGUE FILMMAKER

*Where is the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?*

Those were the questions on Lucas’ mind as he set out to create the original *Star Wars.*

Along with his good friend / producer, [Gary Kurtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kurtz), the two wanted to create a homage to the [Flash Gordon adventure serials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Gordon_(serial)) that they used to watch as kids. However, studios believed their ideas were all too weird and risky, so they refused to finance the film.

**This reinforced Lucas’ hatred for the studio system.**

He hated that the non-creative executives he met with had the final say on creative decisions. But, he knew the film needed studio financing, so for the next 2 years he wrote for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, revising his screenplays

Finally, 20th Century Fox accepted Lucas’ revisions. However, they had so little faith in the movie, that they infamously allowed Lucas to control the rights to the sequels. And after filming, it appeared their lack of faith was justified. The first cut of Star Wars [was a disaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSuDjjlIPak). [[2](http://deadline.com/2015/12/star-wars-franchise-george-lucas-historic-rights-deal-tom-pollock-1201669419)]

This wasn’t good enough. Lucas knew that Star Wars had to be good. He already had the vision of creating a trilogy, so he had to make fans love it enough to convince the studio to finance the next film.

This put enormous pressure on Lucas to focus on every detail when trying to fix the movie in the editing process–pressure **which would lead to the spectacular effects that would save his film, and revolutionize the industry.**

Against all odds, the rogue filmmaker proved the studios that doubted him wrong, and created a fantasy world with iconic characters that were universally adored. [[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mztK3s63_OM)]

Unfortunately, this was the last movie that the rogue filmmaker ever made.

## THE ENTREPRENEUR

With the success of Star Wars, Lucas could see that there was a chance of studios trying to “milk” Star Wars for all it was worth. Being a man of principle, he strongly considered walking away from the series and pursuing other projects.

But he realized that he could leverage sequel rights to control merchandise as well. This would give him enough capital to create his own production company and allow him more freedom from the studios by financing future films with the profits from Star Wars.

And thus, [Lucasfilm](http://lucasfilm.com/) was born — and so was George Lucas, the entrepreneur.

With that mindset, it was time to start adding to the mythology of Star Wars. So Lucasfilm began building up the myths about its creation, and its creator.

They claimed Lucas had already written 12 star wars stories, and that the first movie was always intended to be Episode IV of this series. Theoretically, this would allow Lucasfilm to continue producing Star Wars movies without looking like they were mindlessly creating sequels just for money. [[4](http://www.amazon.com/Secret-History-Star-Wars/dp/0978465237)]

## THE CEO

After the massive success of [The Empire Strikes Back](http://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back), Lucas realized that he was making 3 times as much revenue in toy sales than he was for the actual films. Thus, if he could sell more toys, it would mean more projects for Lucasfilm, and even less need for studio financing.

So Lucas began sharing ideas with Kurtz — who was still his partner — for the third film that would help the company increase merchandise sales. He wanted to add the “[Ewoks](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ewok)” and make the film more kid friendly than The Empire Strikes Back.

Kurtz pushed back on these ideas, but to Lucas the ends justified the means. *After all his freedom as an artist was at stake!*

Tension between them was so bad that Kurtz flat out refused to be a part of Star Wars anymore.

*I could see where things were headed. The toy business began to drive the [Lucasfilm] empire. It’s a shame. They make three times as much on toys as they do on films. It’s natural to make decisions that protect the toy business but that’s not the best thing for making quality films….*

*The emphasis on the toys, it’s like the cart driving the horse. If it wasn’t for that the films would be done for their own merits. The creative team wouldn’t be looking over their shoulder all the time. *[[5](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5611489/original-star-wars-producer-explains-what-went-wrong-after-empire-strikes-back)]

In other words, Gary Kurtz left because the films were being “*abused” *when George Lucas realized, *“WOW we can make a lot of money” *off of the sale of toys.

## THE “SPECIAL-EFFECTS” TELLER

This all took place behind the scenes. Kurtz didn’t speak out about this until over 30 years later. And despite the unnecessary inclusion of the Ewoks, most fans still loved the final episode of the trilogy.

Then over the next decade, Lucas went through a very nasty divorce — keeping him out of the directors chair — but remaining the head of Lucasfilm, he had another amazing success with the[Indiana Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones) trilogy.

With his life back in order in 1994, Lucas was inspired to write and direct his first film since 1977: [Star Wars Episode I](http://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace). But this time, he would have total control, huge financial support, and new [computer-generated imagery (CGI) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery)to help tell his story.

Lucas loved this new CGI Technology. He loved it so much that *every single scene* of the prequel trilogy used it. In some cases he even used it to replace actors! The famous Storm Troopers (or “Clone Troopers”) weren’t played by actors, just computer-generated images.

These special effects were impressive for the time. But unfortunately, the dialogue, the characters, **and the story of the prequel trilogy were stale, flat, and uninteresting** — even to the most hard-core fans of Star Wars. [[6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da8s9m4zEpo)]

It appeared that Lucas had become, “*obsessed by the latest special-effects tools and no longer cared about the story.”*

## HOW LUCAS LOST HIS INTEGRITY — AND WHY IT’S SO IMPORTANT

I apologize if this story seemed like one of the many personal attacks by fans on George Lucas. The man deserves a lot of credit for the creativity, belief, and persistence he showed on a project that nobody believed in.

I also don’t think he’s trying to deceive us. I truly believe that *he* believes in every word he says.

I use Lucas’ story because it shows how someone with purpose, principles, and the willpower to see his goal through to the finish, can tragically go down a path to losing all those things–then be in denial about it.

So let’s dissect his story to see how we can avoid his fate.

## 1. HUBRIS BORN OF SUCCESS

Imagine how sweet it must’ve been for Lucas to see his movie that nobody believed in not only be a success, but be a game-changing aspect of cinematic history.

The pride that he must have felt when he saw the crowds come back again, and again, *and again, *must have been extraordinary.

People loved his work, and for good reason!

But rather than seeing this love as a result of the time, effort, and care he put into it–he believed the idea that he was a creative genius for making Star Wars. This made him feel as if he didn’t need to work as hard when he returned to directing. After all, he was a genius!

You may not experience nearly the amount of hubris when working towards your goals, but you are just as vulnerable to relying on your talent, rather than your work ethic. This is the downside of focusing on self-esteem, rather than self-control. [[7](http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec02/selfesteem.aspx)]

It is a great feeling to celebrate great results–but don’t forget the reason *why *you achieved them.

## 2. COMPROMISING HIS PRINCIPLES

Once he was believing his own hype, we saw Lucas begin to lose his identity as “The Rogue Filmmaker.”

He saw that Star Wars was going to become a giant of pop culture, which meant there was a lot of money to be made by either himself or the studios. Never wanting to allow money to influence his decisions as an artist, Lucas strongly considered walking away.

However, he recognized the money from Star Wars could give him the freedom he always wanted. So he compromised [his principles](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/principles-benefit-willpower) as The Rogue Filmmaker to become The Entrepreneur because the ends justified the means.

This not only made him care about about the bottom-line, but it also positioned Star Wars in his mind as a “money-maker” for future films. So he justified doing things like build a mythology of about his genius and his ideas for the 12 Star Wars stories.

This led him to become the very thing he hated by prioritizing business decisions over creativity.

There are many instances where the ends justify the means for us. **But once you start compromising your principles, you begin to lose the willpower to live up to them**. Especially if you lose your sense of self awareness along the way.

## 3. LOSS OF SELF-AWARENESS AND DENIAL

*“I’ve never been that much of a money guy, I’m more of a film guy.”*

Despite all of his actions to the contrary, George Lucas never admitted (at least to us) that he was anything other than The Rogue Filmmaker.

He grew up in Northern California during the 60s and claims that has a lot to do with his political beliefs. Before the release of the original Star Wars, he openly spoke out against studios, capitalism, and overusing special effects at the expense of the story.

And that never changed.

I would like to believe that he isn’t just saying this to create a certain public persona. I genuinely believe that he still believes that he is The Rogue Filmmaker, rather than The CEO.

That’s why he could justify to himself that he wasn’t selling out, he wasn’t overdoing it on special effects, and that he really was focusing on writing great stories, and creating great films.

Then rather than admitting the truth to himself, and working hard to earn back the title of The Rogue Filmmaker, he chose to criticize the people who made exactly the same decisions as him.

To prevent yourself from going down this path, use [self-monitoring ](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/self-monitoring)tactics to constantly review the evidence, and ensure you are genuinely trying to[ live up to your principles ](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/principles-benefit-willpower)through your actions, not your words.

## CONCLUSION

**The phrase “actions speak louder than words” doesn’t give actions enough credit. **It doesn’t take any willpower for someone to talk about their plans, promises, or principles. It takes extraordinary willpower, however, to live up to them.

I hate to pick on George Lucas. He has done more for the happiness of this world than I probably ever will. The problem is not that he became a hugely successful entrepreneur, it’s that he compromised his principles, denied the truth, and lost his integrity by deceiving us.

In your life, be sure to judge yourself and those around you by actions, not words. Because actions truly do not lie.

# Fell so fast I crashed

## How the girl who loves abundantly can stay that way.

First stop — I am an only child and yet usually play well with others. My parents have raised me to be accepting and open to others and their choices. This means I was the only family member at my cousins secret lesbian wedding [ Not that I could tell anyone until she did months later ]. I was the one she felt able to speak to — even if the big secrets had to be written down on napkins or in a text — I was still the one receiving them. My ability to be open to others has made me sometimes maybe too open? I’ve tended to fall into “like” and “lust” and “love” very fast without having much control over it. How do you tell yourself not to care and actually make it work? Well, you could become a bitch and hate everyone…but I prefer to try and stay away from that. I’ve said many times that I don’t want to become jaded and I’ve worked very hard within myself to make sure that never happens. There are some things I’ve realized over the years though from being the person I am.

One — ***I must always accept myself for the person I am. ***Sometimes this is hard and sometimes it doesn’t work for a while but in knowing that is what I MUST do…well I eventually get back to it.

Two — ***I will get hurt. ***I’m not talking physically but emotionally. When someone doesn’t understand how I work or we just aren’t matched to handle each other there will tears and man am I good at those.

Three — ***I will hurt others. ***Again, emotionally! Not that I would ever mean to but when you’re me…like the title says. I can fall fast and it’s not always what I imagined, sometimes it doesn’t make me happy and I need to do what is best for myself.

Four — ***I will figure it out. ***I will, day by day, figure out what works for me and what doesn’t. It’s not a perfect system and I am always changing as the world is also. It’s just a matter of not giving up.

Five — ***There is no one exactly like me. ***I am unique even in the most boring of ways, and so are you!
> *A simple truth to live by — You deserve love & happiness — whether loves comes from a pet or partner and happiness from a lazy Sunday or skydiving.*

We, as humans, are beautifully flawed. We don’t always figure things out right away and sometimes we never do. That’s alright, it’s okay to fall! It’s okay to stumble! These simple lessons are not just for the girls but I believe can be seen and used through many eyes, man or woman. Believe in yourself and you can fly [though probably not like the redbull commercial indicates]

I hope you can find something useful in the simple lessons I’ve learned for myself. Be who you are! Who else could possibly be as fun?

# The Art of No Return

## The Art of No Return

A [recent study](https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/12/users-have-low-tolerance-for-buggy-apps-only-16-will-try-a-failing-app-more-than-twice/) on mobile applications showed that only 16% of users will try a failing app more than twice.

This study proved to show that if the application failed to open on the first try, the user will simply hit delete and not return. In most instances, there is more than one app that has the same functioning capabilities and the user will move on hoping to find an app that works for them.

There are four reasons that lead to user app deletion upon their first try:

**1. **Things are weird

**2. **It takes too long

**3. **It is not clear and concise

**4. **There is no purpose

In leadership and life, these reasons can often lead to why people walk into our lives and unfortunately do not return. As leaders, we are expected to keep those around us moving forward by refining the relationships we have with them.

**Things are weird.**

If people are not ‘normal’ or just relatable, things can tend to get pretty awkward and weird. Great leaders provide a relational ability that others are able to follow and connect with. The ways that you become relational and relatable are to put yourself out there, be open to new experiences, and by not judging those around you.

**It takes too long.**

Most people already are uncomfortable the first time they open up to a new relationship, new job, new community, new meeting etc.… If we take for granted the time that we have, it can become a painful experience for those giving us their time. It is typically known that if you are ‘on-time’ you are late. Respect the time that others give you and make the best of each opportunity that you are given.

**It is not clear and concise.**

Too often there is so much going on that we get lost in the clutter of information and lines of miscommunication. Well-defined leaders communicate efficiently. Having a plan immediately shows that you know what is going on. It shows that you care about moving forward and have a vision for the future. Have a plan, communicate well, and be easily accessible to those around you are great steps to being clear and concise.

**There is no purpose.**

People don’t buy what or how you do things, they buy why you do it. When you know why you are doing something – something that you really care about, you do not have to be pushed. There must be something that pulls those around you to return. Why do you do what you do?

# why do we accept the love we think we deserve

## why do we accept the love we think we deserve

i spent my fourth of july at home, curled up in my bed and watched [the perks of being a wallflower](http://perks-of-being-a-wallflower.com/) while fireworks exploded outside the window behind me.

this whole story is about participating in life, so it was rather ironic that i chose to islolate myself, during a holiday, and watch it alone while eating a cupcake. whatever.

this book, this story by stephen chbosky, helped me through highschool. eight years later, it’s still helping me through life.

there’s a moment in the story where the girl the boy is in love with has just been broken and she asks him “why does everyone i love keep choosing the people that hurt us.” the boy is so desperately in love with this girl and he tells her:
> # we accept the love we think we deserve.

this couldn’t be more true. i thought about my friends who have been with shitty guys that don’t treat them right; or the ones who shared themselves with guys just because they were looking. i thought about the hearts i had broken. the ones that had broken mine. then i thought about how, when my friend asked me why things didn’t go well with a boy i was seeing, she questioned “why do you have to have a type? why do you have to be so picky?”

that stuck with me. it rang back through my ears when i read [this thought catalog article](http://thoughtcatalog.com/2012/you-need-to-go-after-the-things-you-want/) and when i watched this movie.

are we being picky? are we picking and choosing who we date to be selective and find someone perfectly fitting to our standards?

no. i don’t think it’s that at all.

i think we do accept the love we think we deserve. but that we often accept what’s convenient. we accept what’s there, in front of us, telling us they want to love us (but only for a little bit) and we accept it because we’re afraid to wait.

the sad part is, we know it’s not going to work out. so why do we just accept it? because [“it’s better to feel pain than nothing at all.”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GFvUCcljkM)

maybe, in some ways that is true and i used to believe that for awhile.

then, one night, a friend and i met these two guys we just wanted to fall so head over heels in love with. we danced, we drank. we were on cloud nine. but, we didn’t go home with them and were instead left the next morning to wonder why they didn’t call us. we were left feeling terrible, wondering *what was wrong with us?* *when do we get to have someone who loves us back? why don’t we have that, aren’t we good people?*

i remember thinking how i never wanted to feel that way again.

i thought about how so many people play this game on a routine basis.

i rember thinking that it wasn’t better to feel this pain; not that i wanted to not feel anything, but that maybe waiting didn’t have to mean sitting around, loving random people until we find “the one.”

because sitting still and waiting sucks. i get that. who wants to spend half their life waiting around, hoping we sit next to the right person at an event or that we’ll be sitting in the right coffee shop at the right time.

but i think it’s totally normal to wait for something better. to know that you don’t have to settle for what’s convenient. you deserve to be loved by someone who has just as much love to give you as you do. you deserve to accept the love you deserve - that doesn’t make you picky; it doesn’t make you selfish or mean you’re going to spend forever alone because your searching for something too perfect.

i think the best thing we can do is put ourselves out there and do what makes us come alive and not settle. do things in the world and find the people who want to do good things with you. accept that you do deserve better; accept that he is going to find you one day and that you’re going to be greater than what he imagined.

![](0*5zf8PxjpcbeDln0y.jpeg)

he is out there. she is looking for you. and when you do end up together, you’ll know, and it’s going to be so beautiful.

# The Surprising Trait of Great Leaders — and how to develop it.

## The Surprising Trait of Great Leaders — and how to develop it.

“I don’t know.”

I was standing in front of more than 200 owners at my first annual meeting as General Manager. It felt like I’d been at the microphone for hours on every subject imaginable — operations, capital projects, insurance, fund balances, team development, specific fees and allocations, and so on. It was their main chance to get questions answered, and they deserved full accountability and transparency.

I don’t recall the topic, but I do remember what it felt like to say those three words. I’d been dreading it all morning, reaching into the far corners of my mind and our supporting material. It could no longer be avoided. The words of my mentor echoed silently between my ears.

*Just admit what you don’t know.*

So I did. And … nothing happened. There was no lightning strike or angry mob. The owner nodded, and I followed up that we would research it and be back in touch. That was it.

**Aside from releasing mountains of anxiety and expectations, I learned a powerful lesson that day — to be respected and trusted, I had to be vulnerable.**

I had to be open about my weaknesses and knowledge gaps. In order to have confidence in what I did share, they had to know I could admit when we were venturing into an unknown.

**If we plot vulnerability on a spectrum, there’s certainly a sweet spot for leaders. Pitfalls exist at either extreme.**

![](1*i7dR3W_L76yRBOK0L427Nw.png)

To the far left are leaders that will not allow any chinks in their armor. They’re either unaware that they have any deficiencies, or unwilling to admit them.

To the far right are leaders that draw attention to every obstacle or challenge in their path. They want to be sure everyone is fully aware of the stress or workload they’re carrying.

We’ll want to avoid either of those approaches, and focus on behaviors that move us closer to the right balance.

Here are some examples to consider:

When tasked with a new project by your manager, do you:

* Express unwavering confidence in a successful outcome,

* List the countless distractions and challenges that could arise, or

* Acknowledge that the project is a stretch for your skill set, and that you’re committed to researching and talking to team members with more experience to gain their insights.

When confronted with a funding shortfall, do you:

* Tell no one, until the consequences are imminent,

* Call an all-hands meeting to share that half the team could lose their jobs if you’re not able to secure the investment, or

* Gather your senior team to explain the gap and timeline, brainstorm potential solutions, and outline a plan of action.

In each set, the third option navigates with appropriate vulnerability.

The key factors to consider are:

* Audience — sharing with others that have context and capacity for understanding. (Otherwise, we’re just rolling stress downhill, and that’s the opposite of leadership.)

* Transparency — disclosing a balanced perspective of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

* Bias for action — focusing on timelines and action steps that can be taken to move forward.

* Resilience — staying emotionally balanced (except in the rarest of circumstances) in order to focus on the best outcome for the entire team.

It takes practice, and we’re likely to misstep from time to time. That’s a part of the leadership journey. The key is to be intentional and learn from each experience.

**Have you ever been vulnerable with your team in a tough situation? Was that a difficult choice to make?**

# How to Deal With Pain&#58; First & Second Darts

## Last week I wrote about the Buddhist idea of The Two Minds, and how knowing the difference between your thinking mind and your observing mind is the first step in effectively dealing with emotional problems.

Since a lot of readers wrote back to me saying how helpful that article was, today I thought I’d to share a related Buddhist idea that I’ve found extremely helpful in my life. This concept is known as:

### First & Second Darts

Physical and psychological pain are inevitable parts of life. It’s just the way we humans are designed. To survive physically, we need our body to let us know when it’s ill or injured. To work psychologically and socially, we need minds that send different signals of distress such as loneliness, anger, fear, rejection, threat and grief.

Losing these physical and psychological signals of pain is in fact very dangerous. We need to know that we’ve accidentally put our hand on the stove to do something about it. Or feel guilty when we’ve mistreated someone else. Pain is what lets us know.

In Buddhism, these unavoidable pains in life are known as ‘**first darts**.’ These are the darts life throws at us that we can’t do anything about.

But what we can do, is avoid throwing ‘**second darts**‘ at ourselves. These second darts are our judgments and reactions to the first darts.

For example, let’s say you get a sudden headache. This is the first dart. The second darts come in the form of your thoughts about the situation: ‘Why does this always happen to me?!’, ‘This headache is driving me crazy!!’, ‘I hate this pain!’ and so on.

Each time you buy into these thoughts you make the experience of the headache even worse. You’re putting logs on the fire. Now, it’s not just the pain from the first dart you’re experiencing; you’re also hitting yourself with a bunch of second darts that are causing you to suffer.

### “Pain is Inevitable. Suffering is Optional.”

This Buddhist proverb simply and brilliantly sums up how this works. Pain is the first darts. Suffering is the second darts.

You’re always going to have to deal with pain because that’s how humans function in the world.

But whether or not you’ll SUFFER from that pain is completely up to you:
> *“It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.” **— Epictetus***

In my experience, I’ve found this to be very true. Over the last couple of months, I’ve had to deal with a persistent feeling of a lump in the throat (the clinical term is [Globus sensation](http://patient.info/health/globus-sensation-leaflet)). This lump used to drive me crazy but over the last couple of weeks, I’ve tried keeping this idea of first and second darts in mind.

The Globus sensation is the first dart. My judgments about it make up the second darts. The more I’ve managed to be mindful of the lump in my throat without getting caught up in negative thoughts and feelings about it, the less I’ve suffered from it.

### Pain x Resistance = Suffering

The next time you’re experiencing pain, keep this simple equation in mind. Experience the first dart without resisting it since this will only cause suffering. This is another aspect of life where [mindfulness](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-practice-mindfulness/) is extremely helpful:

Simply hold the painful sensation or emotion in present awareness. Imagine your mind as a clear blue sky. Know that the pain will pass through it like a storm cloud, never tainting or harming the mind itself.

Next, look for second darts. Pay attention to the thoughts and feelings[your thinking mind](http://www.selfication.com/two-minds/) is adding to the already painful experience. Try to disidentify from these as well. Remember that [you are not your thoughts](http://www.selfication.com/you-are-not-your-thoughts/)and do not buy into them.

Let the first dart do its thing without judging or resisting it. The more you practice this, the less unnecessary suffering you’ll have to deal with.
> *“I’ve lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened.” **— Mark Twain***

**Footnotes**

I learned about the concept of first and second darts in Rick Hanson’s awesome book [Buddha’s Brain: The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love, and Wisdom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6796675-buddha-s-brain).

# This Framework Will Make You Better At Changing Your Habits

## This Framework Will Make You Better At Changing Your Habits
> “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson

We always tell each other to just “be ourselves.” Have a presentation or talk to give? Just be yourself. A job interview? Just be yourself, you’ll do fine. A party or date to go to? Just be who you are.

Just. I hate that word. Nothing easy ever follows it.

The reason we constantly have to reassure one another that it’s okay to be ourselves is that it’s the hardest thing in the world. It’s based on two lofty assumptions:

1. You know who you are.

1. You’re comfortable expressing it in any setting.

Most of us can say neither for ourselves. At least not to the degree we’d like to. I hope what follows alleviates some of that pain.

## What You Should Know About Yourself

Soul-searching is a great hobby. You’re never done. The question is: where does self-exploration stop being useful? For me, the following framework marked a clear milestone.

When I first started coaching on [coach.me](http://coach.me/?ref=zO0m5), [Tony Stubblebine](https://twitter.com/tonystubblebine) graciously sent us a book that influenced my coaching a lot. It’s also helped me understand my own behavior a lot better. The name of that book was [*Better Than Before](http://fourminutebooks.com/better-than-before-summary/)*.

[Gretchen Rubin](https://twitter.com/gretchenrubin), a former lawyer turned researcher, author and human behavior aficionado, wrote it in 2015 to much acclaim and success. One of the key ideas, if not the centerpiece of the book, was a personality framework called [*The Four Tendencies](http://fourminutebooks.com/the-four-tendencies-summary/)*.

Using this framework will help you understand how you deal with your internal and external expectations. This’ll allow you to better manage your life and work. What’s more, you can try to spot other peoples’ tendencies, which’ll help improve your relationships.

Here’s what it looks like:

![](1*OrC8CkjGyahQsRBWdbjOsA.png)

## Where Does This Idea Come From? Well…

When we’re babies, no one expects us to do anything. Our parents celebrate it when we eat, clap when we poop and let out a huge sigh of relief when we finally fall asleep.

As we grow up, this changes. Fast. It starts with “clean your room,” soon turns to “you need to contribute to the household” and ends with “you have to take care of yourself now.”
> # Most of us aren’t ready for all the expectations the world piles onto us, let alone the internal ones we have of ourselves that add to the pressure.

And yet, *somehow*, we deal with them. We learn, we struggle and over time, hopefully we get better. All of this, our approach to dealing with our internal and life’s external expectations, is formed subconsciously.

[*The Four Tendencies](http://fourminutebooks.com/the-four-tendencies-summary/)* framework helps you identify this approach and trust me, there’s a lot to discover. Each tendency is linked to a specific strategy for dealing with the two kinds of expectations we face: resisting or meeting them.

Here’s a little cheat sheet you can use to identify yourself, remember what’s distinctive for each type and how to deal with them better:

## **1. Upholders**

Upholders meet inner and outer expectations. They love rules, having a clear plan and are self-motivated and disciplined. Clearly tell them what needs to be done and they’ll lead the way.

## **2. Questioners**

Questioners meet their own expectations, but resist outer ones. They need to see purpose and reason in anything they do. Make it clear why what you want from them is important.

## **3. Obligers**

Obligers meet other peoples’ expectations easily, but struggle with their own. The must be held accountable by a friend, coach or boss to get things done. They thrive when they have a sense of duty and can work in a team.

## **4. Rebels**

Rebels defy both outer and inner expectations. Above all, they want to be free to choose and express their own individuality. Give them the facts, present the task as a challenge and let them decide without pressure.

It’s pretty easy to recognize yourself based on those descriptions alone, but if you’re not sure, you can [take a quiz](https://gretchenrubin.com/take-the-quiz) Gretchen designed specifically to help you find out.

## How Can This Help You Change Your Habits?

Expectations are a huge determinant of what we do. You juggle all the hopes people have for you, mixed with those you have for yourself. Based on that mix and your tendency, you determine the right middle ground.

Meet…or resist?

Is this still okay? What’s a no-go? Who must I live up to? Who do I disappoint? How much? How often?

Constantly faced with this stressful tradeoff, we default to what our tendency dictates. Meet inner, resist outer. Resist inner, meet outer. And so on.

**Knowing what your default is makes it a lot easier to adjust your environment in a way that makes the default lead to the outcome you want.**

For example, as an Obliger, forcing yourself to meet a friend at the gym will make it easier to actually go there. A rebel needs the freedom to choose to work out without pressure, and a Questioner might want to keep a list of health benefits ready.

Know your tendency, know your goal, adjust expectations. That’s the idea.

## A Word of Advice

It’s easy to get carried away with this stuff. That’s dangerous. When you chisel your tendency in stone, you might know one thing more about yourself and you might even accept it, but you’ll also turn it into an excuse and stop believing that you can change. That’s not the point of this exercise.

Instead of putting yourself in a box, use this concept to get to know yourself better. Identify your strengths, weaknesses, and improve your relationships with others. Be mindful of their tendencies, not just your own. And remember that human behavior is fluid. No personality test can pigeonhole you. Unless you let it.

After all, no matter how much we learn from them, life isn’t lived in frameworks and books, but in the real world, among people. People like you and me, figuring out who they are. Searching, so they can start being themselves.

If you treat them right, maybe they’ll let you do just that.

# Fall In Love with Procrastination

## image credit

Most books and courses on procrastination focus on tips and techniques about how to get over it. But we rarely ask what procrastination actually is and why it happens in the first place.

The key purpose of procrastination is short-term mood regulation. Meaning when we’re feeling bad about what we’re working on, we find ways to delay the work and switch to something that makes us feel better.

Whether it’s about being overwhelmed with too much work or you have to do a task that you hate, procrastination is a short-term solution to improve your mood.

## Using Procrastination as an Indicator

Most tips focus on how to improve your mood or how to manage your feelings in order to stop procrastinating. But I’d like to go one step deeper and ask, “Why am I procrastinating in the first place?”

Instead of trying to push through the procrastination, I like to use it as an indicator that something is wrong with the process. I don’t automatically assume that I’m lazy and need to get more disciplined. I assume that either the goal I’m working on or the process itself isn’t quite right.

For example, it might mean that I don’t really care about the goal and it’s not really a priority. Or it might mean that it’s too challenging for me right now, and my current time would be much better spent on something else.

If procrastination is an indicator of something, why would you ignore it and try to push through as if it didn’t exist?

If the low fuel indicator in your car was on, would you ignore it and try to push through?

## 3 Wasted Years Working on Somebody Else’s Goal

For years I was trying to get a college degree that I didn’t really care about. It was a goal of mine just because “it’s what you do”, not because I really wanted it. As a result, I constantly procrastinated with my exams. Next month became, next semester. Next semester became next year. And 3 years later, I still hadn’t done much progress on getting that degree.

Eventually, I figured out that it wasn’t just because I was horribly lazy. I just didn’t care about that goal. With procrastination, my subconscious mind was telling me that what I’m working on is pointless. There were better ways to spend my time.

Fast forward to today, almost 10 years later, I’ve never needed that degree. It wasn’t something that would have been useful in my life anyway.

I still have the option to go and get it if I want to. And every time I tell that story, I hear the same feedback, “You have to get it. Sooner or later you just have to.”

Exactly the same reason why I had that goal in the first place. But it wasn’t mine, it was just social pressure. Deep down, I knew I could make it without that degree.

So unless I really have a solid reason to get that degree, there is no way I’m going to start working on that goal again. I’m just going to be procrastinating again anyway.

## What is procrastination trying to tell you?

So if we accept that procrastination *is* an indicator, how do we know what exactly is wrong?

If we know the reason, it would be much easier to reframe the goal or the process. Instead of pushing through, we can change the part that isn’t working until the system runs smoothly and you’re naturally motivated.

Here are some of the most common reasons why we procrastinate.

### The Goal Doesn’t Matter

As in my example above, we often pick up goals not because we really care about them, but because we’re influenced by society.

* Do you really care about getting that degree?

* Do you really care about losing those last 10 pounds?

* Do you really want to get your driving license?

* Do you really want to learn a new language?

* Do you really want to get rid of your accent?

There’s nothing wrong with any of these goals if you truly want to. But it might be possible that you’re procrastinating because you don’t really care about getting those results. You’re doing it because of social pressure.

### It’s Too Difficult

Sometimes the thing we’re working on is just too hard for us. It feels daunting, either because of the amount of work or because we don’t have enough expertise.

Is there a way to get somebody to help? A friend, a colleague, a professional in the field? Why would you try to do it yourself if you can find help from somebody more experienced?

### It’s Not the Right Timing

Even if the goal is truly yours and you want it, it’s possible that it’s just not the right time. You might be procrastinating because you haven’t picked up enough skills to make it happen. Or it’s not the right season. Is there a time where doing this goal will be easier for you?

I procrastinated on starting my own blog for years. It has been a very serious goal of mine that I definitely knew I want to achieve. However, every time I thought about starting it I got that procrastination impulse.

And I knew it wasn’t just because I was lazy. Other goals that I was working on were going great. After a while, I just figured that it wasn’t the right time for the blog yet. I didn’t feel ready and I needed more experience.

So instead of beating myself up about it, I worked happily on other goals and kept the blog goal on the backburner.

Finally, last year I felt ready. I had no problem starting it right away. It took me a week to buy hosting, create a simple design and start posting every week consistently. It was all a matter of right timing.

Hell, I even procrastinated writing this article for 3 days because the idea wasn’t formulated in my head yet, but no need to beat myself up about it. :)

### The Goal Isn’t Realistic

If I had a penny for every time I’ve heard, “I’m quitting smoking tomorrow. No really, this is my last one.”

This is very often an issue for people who are new to goal setting and building habits. Most of the set goals are very unrealistic and difficult to accomplish, like quitting smoking cold turkey.

To change a habit, especially a deeply ingrained habit, you have to make a lot of changes in your life:

* Get people to support your new habit.

* Eliminate the triggers from your environment.

* Create a [support structure](https://betterhumans.coach.me/a-simple-organizational-design-framework-change-elements-8225e5163430#.tbqo2axsa) for when the going gets hard.

* Find a substitute habit to fill the need that the bad habit was filling.

* Use an anchor to start your new habit.

These are just some of the critical elements to be successful with a new habit. Without these, you have a very little chance of making it long term. So no matter how motivated and disciplined you are, if the goal is unrealistically difficult, you will procrastinate.

If you are new to this and you want to save yourself a few years of trial and error [hire an experienced coach](https://www.coach.me/coaching?ref=42mYk) to help you with the transition and set a more realistic goal.

## The Opposite of Procrastination

Very often, the solution to a problem isn’t to work on solving the problem directly, but to find the opposite.

For example, you’re always broke and trying to save money. But you can only go so far with savings and budgeting. Working on increasing your income, on the other hand, has no limit. You can always find more ways to earn money.

So what if we don’t focus on overcoming procrastination? What would be the opposite of procrastination that would improve your results?

For me, it’s the feeling of flow, also known as being in the zone. That state where you’re completely engulfed by your work and time flies by. You don’t feel like stopping for food or sleep because what you’re doing feels so good and you’re crushing it.

So instead of trying to stop procrastination, how about looking for more things that get you in that flow state? What are some of the projects that get you so excited that you can work for hours without getting tired?

## Procrastinate Productively

It sounds like an oxymoron, but what it means is to strategically postpone instead of waste your time.

Don’t procrastinate with Netflix and gaming. Use that time for accomplishing something meaningful. Maybe it’s not yet time to work on that goal, but it doesn’t mean that you can’t pick another goal that will be better suited for the current time.

What other projects or goals could you work on instead? Is there something that you were trying to do 5 years ago, and it didn’t work out? Perhaps now would be a better time.

And if you’re dead set on that particular goal and now is not a good time, when would it be a better time? If you lack the skills to make it happen, what could you do to learn the skills meanwhile? If everything seems right but you keep banging your head against the wall, who could you ask to help you with your goal?

## Love Procrastination without Guilt

The worst thing about procrastinating is not the time lost but the guilt.

You get nothing done and you feel guilty about it. On the next day, you still feel terrible that you didn’t get anything done, so you’re not in the mood to work again. The whole thing is a downwards spiral. A self-perpetuating cycle of guilt.

This goes back to the mood regulation thing. So unless you find a way to temporarily feel better you can’t really go back to work. Forcing yourself to overcome the procrastination is just going to make matters worse.

So instead of feeling guilty about not doing your work, how can you use that time to improve your mood? What could you do in your procrastination time to start loving it? What would recharge you so much that when you go back to work again you’re in an awesome mood?

# How to Make Your Subconscious Mind Work for You

## So creative, it seems like magic: a step-by-step guide to unleashing your most innovative brainpower

![Image by [TeroVesalainen](https://pixabay.com/en/users/TeroVesalainen-809550/) on Pixabay](1*e2Odga58h5KRsrZD4M-YpA.jpeg)*Image by [TeroVesalainen](https://pixabay.com/en/users/TeroVesalainen-809550/) on Pixabay*

Our rational, conscious mind is a wonderful thing. But sometimes when we are looking for a solution, it can be a limited resource. I’m always looking for ways to work **smarter**, not harder.

What if I could come up with answers in my sleep? I discovered that it’s possible to do just that.

To the outsider, it can look as if someone were literally dreaming up solutions to situations. What’s really happening, though, is that a person who is skilled at this is first removing their overeager *conscious* mind temporarily from the equation, and then mobilizing the power of their *subconscious* minds through the power of a specific question.

It’s not half as complicated as that last sentence suggests. Questions are the key. I learned how to make this work for me, and I’ll show you how to do it, too.

## How Does It Work?

To understand better how the mind works, we’re going to look at an analogy from science fiction: the Starship Enterprise from Star Trek—partly for its shape, and partly for the the way the different departments interact.

The “bridge” of the ship is the place where most of the action appears to happen—it’s the control center. Captain Kirk stands manfully on the bridge of the Enterprise, making decisions and giving orders—with an ego the size of a nearby planet.

Captain Kirk is, in fact, the perfect example of ‘ego’ from the point of view of psychology or personal development: he’s our self concept or the representation of the constructed self.

[The Oxford dictionary defines ego as](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ego) “*the part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity.”*

Despite what he gets up to in the series, Captain Kirk’s job is to ensure the success of his mission and the continual wellbeing of his crew and ship. It is up to him to receive and evaluate information, weigh options, and decide on the best course of action.

Our conscious brain work is like our own ‘Captain Kirk’, standing on the bridge of our mind, taking control and trying to make all the decisions. Any problems or situations to be reviewed come here first to the bridge, and our conscious mind is very good at making those decisions.

However, like Captain Kirk, our ego can be a little too full of its own importance and overeagerness to solve issues. It often doesn’t notice all the possible solutions, or make use of resources better suited to finding those solutions.

The bridge is only a small part of *The Enterprise*, however. Supporting everything happening on the bridge is engineering. The bridge and Captain Kirk may look like the center, but without engineering, no one’s going anywhere. Engineering is where the warp engines lay, and where all the data is stored from every mission and available databank.

The **WILL **to boldly go may be on the bridge of the ship, but the **POWER **to get there is in the engineering bay.

The engines and the supercomputers in engineering never stop, never sleep—unlike Captain Kirk. They receive instructions, then keep processing and working away until a solution is found.

In *The Enterprise* of our mind, the engineering bay is our subconscious mind. Always processing, it doesn’t sleep like the conscious mind.

## The Problem-Solving Power of the Subconscious Mind

Max Maltz likens the subconscious mind to a supercomputer or autoserver mechanism in his work (and subsequent book), [Psycho Cybernetics.](https://www.amazon.com/Psycho-Cybernetics-Updated-Expanded-Maxwell-Maltz/dp/0399176136/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=5D4K7B0BSSJK0B2M3G16) Maltz originally published this back in 1960, but his methods and ideas are still prevalent, and relevant, today. You can see the influence of his work in that of thought leaders such as Zig Ziglar, Tony Robbins, and [Benjamin P. Hardy](https://twitter.com/BenjaminPHardy).

He explains that in the same way that a machine does not reason or judge, rather it just follows the task set it, so does the subconscious mind.

A really simple example of this is when you’re trying to remember someone’s name. It bugs us, doesn’t it? The simple question of “what is their name?” is sent back from the conscious to the subconscious mind, where our search engine works away until three hours later, while washing up, we think “Jane!”

The original situation has passed, but the subconscious “engineering” has been working away to find an answer while our conscious mind has been doing other things. Now while we’re doing something that doesn’t involve high levels of brain power, the message can get through, “Hey, you on the bridge: Jane!”

Another example of the play between conscious and subconscious is how they work together when we need to make a decision. For example, let’s say I want to buy new shoes.

As I go about my daily tasks, I now start noticing people’s shoes. The file is still open on ‘Which shoes do I buy?’ so my data collection devices (eyes and ears) send information back into the control center (conscious mind) which does a quick evaluation (horrible color/looks comfy).

Did I notice people’s shoes before? Not really.

Were people wearing shoes before that? Of course! I just didn’t have a “scan and search” order set for “shoes”.

Buying shoes is a simple example, but the same principle is in action if we want to change our job, find a course, meet a new partner, or discover a way to change an area of our lives. We can set an order to search and scan. The data comes in, and the amazingly powerful subconscious connects and compiles it, even when we are not *consciously* thinking about it.

## How to Get It to Work for You

We know that asking the right questions are the key, and that we need to get the Captain Kirk of our ego to release its hold on the situation and take a break.

So now we can look at how to practically do that and set up our brains for finding creative solutions and success.

**Questions are the key. **A** **question is better than an opinion or affirmation for finding creative solutions. Positive affirmations can be very effective for changing the programing in our subconscious, but it doesn’t send the command to *do* anything: to search and connect.

I’ve been consistently working on this idea of setting my subconscious a question for nearly a year and I have noticed differences in my results. Here is what I’ve learned, through trial and error, and some corresponding research.

### Ask quality questions

Good questions invite action and expansion. The subconscious loves making connections and having something to do, and it loves *good* questions.

Secondly, the focus of the question makes a difference. A big difference.

If I send the question ‘how can I feel less tired all the time?’ it’s a negative question. The focus is on feeling tired, so that’s what you are telling your computer to focus on. The resulting thoughts and feelings will reflect this focus. ‘Tired’ in, ‘tired’ out.

By rephrasing the question to: ‘How can I re-energize myself this week?’ the focus is positive, on energy and feeling energized, and the results will follow suit. By setting a specific time frame of this week or tomorrow, you are also setting nice manageable parameters for your subconscious to play with.

I found that it was worth spending a little time phrasing my questions so they were positive and specific. The five or ten minutes I spent weighing the question until it felt right and in line with what I wanted was worth it in results.

### Get your ego to let go

When we hold on to our issues in our conscious mind, it can cause stress and frustration. It’s not surprising really: it needs options and space with which to consider decisions or have that insight.

Essentially, you need to take a break! It might sounds surprising to say that to find the solution, you should stop consciously working on it. Remember: Archimedes didn’t have his ‘Eureka’ moment until he had his bath.

Sherlock Holmes, although a fictional character, would play chess or the violin when wanting the answer to something that had him stumped. I wonder how many times Arthur Conan Doyle did something similar as he allowed his mind to percolate his stories and ideas?

Personally, I find taking a break allows me release the build up of pressure in my thoughts, meaning that the only headbanging that I do is to music.

**Take a break to be more productive.**

It is an effective short term solution. It gives ‘engineering’ time to sort through data and make connections, send the results back up to the bridge and … ‘Eureka!’

### Nap to release the ego

Thomas Edison would regularly take a nap when faced with a problem. He is famous for taking a nap in his chair while holding two metal balls in his hands, which would drop and wake him if he fell into a deep sleep. The answer or insight would often be there upon waking.

Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla were also famous for their napping habits.

Did you know that famous British prime minister Winston Churchill had a bed in the Houses of Parliament, and was convinced that his regular siestas and power naps were part of the success of his governing?

I used to laugh at the idea of a power nap—they’re for grannies, right? But I found I was wrong and that sometimes a brief bit of downtime refreshes my energy levels, and allows my subconscious mind to shine. The subconscious doesn’t sleep, remember, so a brief bit of shut eye effectively releases my conscious mind’s hold on a subject so that ‘engineering’ can do what it does best.

### Sleep, perchance to dream…

Napping is good, but what I find to be most effective is to ask a question at night, right before sleeping.

In bed, nice and relaxed, I like to review my day and send a question to my subconscious to play with while I recharge my batteries.

**I’m literally working in my sleep.**

One [article on neural plasticity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605564/) published in the ‘Frontiers in Neural Circuits’ journal explains that —
> # “*During sleep, new synaptic connections are formed, and old connections are ‘cleaned up’. This can allow you to see patterns where none existed before.”*

Edison is said to never have gone to sleep without first setting his mind a question. Those patterns mentioned in the article are what give us the solutions and insights the next morning.

### Write your pre-sleep question down

Writing the question down before sleep helps me twofold.

It helps me to think about, and carefully form, the best question to give me the best answer. It also reminds me in the morning what I’d asked.

Writing it down at night to review the next day keeps me on track.

This has become a part of my nightly routine—a sort of mental hygiene. In the same way that I brush my teeth at night as part of my dental health, I also review my three wins and set my question in my journal as part of my mental health.

### Journal in the morning

The technique of setting your question at night before sleep works really well in conjunction with morning journaling.

I’m not talking about the ‘what I had for breakfast and my back aches’ type of journaling, but rather a form of writing where we move ourselves into a peak state of focus and set our most valuable priorities for our day, sculpting our future before it happens.

Some use the habit of ‘[morning pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/)’, where they brain-dump, first thing in the morning, as they write without specifically filtering ideas. Nedd Herrmann in his [work on brain waves](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-function-of-t-1997-12-22/) confirmed that there is something special about capturing your mental state upon first waking:

*“During this awakening cycle it is possible for individuals to stay in the theta state for an extended period of say, five to 15 minutes — which would allow them to have a free flow of ideas about yesterday’s events or to contemplate the activities of the forthcoming day. This time can be extremely productive and can be a period of very meaningful and creative mental activity.”*

**This creativity is vital**. It allows us to think from a different perspective and see what we couldn’t see before.

Don’t make the mistake of thinking that writing morning pages is just for, say, creative writers. It can be used by anyone wanting to access their full range of brain power.

## Your Beautiful Mind

Our mind is amazing. What I see in my personal experience and research on this topic is that it is possible to maximize our potential and productivity through a simple habit.

* Create a question.

* Let that question resonate.

* Trust your subconscious mind to come through for you.

* Go do something else, like sleep.

* Be ready and aware for the answer.

Promoting greater balance and cohesion in my mind is important to me, as is working smarter—not just harder—to create what I want.

I’m no Einstein or Churchill, but by emulating their habits, I can better my own, and then let those habits improve my life. I also have less headaches now, and I’m having fun playing with this simple technique to increase my creativity, insight, and productivity.

After all, that’s not something that I’m going to lose any sleep over, right?

# The Science of Why Caloric Restriction Fails

## The noted scientist Ancel Keys, who would later play a crucial role in shaping current nutritional orthodoxies, sought to study the effects of caloric reduction in the famous Minnesota Starvation Experiment, published in 1950. With World War II raging, many millions of people were on the verge of starvation and this experiment was an attempt to understand the effects on the human body.

![](0*lZr6lKAIsE017nF_.jpg)

One of the first problems was finding volunteers. As an alternative to going to war, [conscientious objectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector) were recruited (I think they weren’t volunteering as much as they were ‘volun-told’). Eventually, 36 such ‘volunteers’ participated in this study.

Ancel Keys estimated that these subjects were eating roughly 3,200 calories per day. They were put onto a ‘semi-starvation’ diet of 1,560 calories per day with foods similar to those available in war-torn Europe at the time — potatoes, turnips, bread, and macaroni. They were then monitored for 20 weeks after the semi-starvation period.

What happened to them? Here, we can divide the effects into physical and psychological effects.

## Physical effects

Coldness, incessant hunger, weakness, exhaustion, dizziness, muscle wasting, and hair loss were some of the symptoms. Heart volume shrank by 20%. Heart rate slowed. Body temperature dropped.

***Resting metabolic rate dropped by 40%***. Interestingly, this is not that far off from a previous study from 1917 that showed Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) decreased by 30%. In other words, the body was *shutting down*. Let’s think about this again from the body’s point of view. The body is accustomed to getting 3,200 calories per day and now it gets 1,560. In order to preserve itself, it implements across-the-board reductions in energy.
> The heart gets less energy — heart rate slows and heart volume shrinks. Blood pressure drops.
> The heating system is turned down — body feels cold.
> Muscles get less energy — physical exhaustion.
> Hair and nails get less energy — hair loss and brittle nails.

The key to remember, though, is that *this ensures survival of the individual during a time of extreme stress*. Yeah, you might feel lousy, but you’ll live to tell the tale. This is the smart thing for the body to do. It is not so stupid as to keep burning energy it does not have.

Consider the alternative. The body is used to 3,200 calories per day and now gets 1,560. The body still burns 3,200 calories. Things feel normal. Three months later, you are dead. It is *absolutely inconceivable* that the body does not react to caloric reduction by reducing caloric expenditure.

Consider many statements to the effect that if you reduce 500 calories per day, you will lose one pound in one week. Does that mean that in 200 weeks you will weigh zero pounds? It is clear that at some point, the body* must, must, must* reduce caloric expenditure. It turns out that the adaptation happens almost immediately and persists in the long-term. More about this later.

## **Psychological effects**

Obsessive thoughts of food. Binge behavior. Extreme depression. Severe emotional distress. Irritability. Loss of libido. Interest in everything other than food vanished. Social withdrawal and isolation. Several subjects became, frankly, neurotic. One patient reportedly amputated 3 fingers with an axe in an act of self-mutilation. Anyway, I’m sure you are beginning to get the picture.

Consider the last time you tried to diet by reducing calories and portion size. Does any of this sound familiar? Yeah, thought so.

![](0*n2vC7FhIhsqdr0TO.jpg)

What happened to their weight after the semi-starvation period? Along the x-axis we have the 24 weeks of the starvation period (0 — S24). Both body weight and body fat dropped. As they started upon the recovery period, they regained the weight. Actually, the weight was regained rather quickly — in about 12 or so weeks, the weight is back to baseline.

However, it does not stop there. You can see that the body weight continues to increase until it is actually higher than it was before the experiment started. And just look at that body fat! It goes soaring above baseline. Sound familiar? Thought so.

Let’s review what happens when you go on a calorie restricted, high carbohydrate, low-fat diet of 1,560 calories/day — just like your doctor or dietician currently tells you to do. You feel lousy, tired, cold, hungry, irritable, and depressed. That’s not just because you are dieting, there are physiological reasons why you feel so crappy. Metabolic rate drops, hormones make you hungry, body temperature drops, and there are a multitude of psychological effects. The worst thing is that you lose a bit of weight but you gain it all back when the diet stops.

It is increasingly clear that one of the key assumptions of the Caloric Reduction as Primary theory is incorrect. The Energy Balance Equation says this:
> **Fat Gained = Calories In — Calories Out**

However, you cannot, from this equation, say that reducing ‘Calories In’ results in Fat Loss UNLESS ‘Calories Out’ remains stable. This assumes that ‘Calories In’ is completely independent of ‘Calories Out’. THIS IS NOT TRUE. The caloric expenditures and caloric intake are inextricably linked to each other.

Said another way — reducing Calories In reduces Calories Out. Reducing caloric intake inevitably leads to reduced caloric expenditure. That is why conventional dieting as we know it does not work. I know it. You know it.

Actually, we have known this to be true since 1917. In fact, in our heart of hearts, we probably have always known it to be true. Eating less for a prolonged period makes you tired and hungry. And worst of all… **you regain all the weight you have lost**. Weight lost is muscle and fat. Weight regained is all fat.

We have just chosen to forget this inconvenient fact because our doctors, our dietitians, our government, our scientists, our politicians, and our media have all been screaming at us for decades that it is all about ‘Calories In vs. Calories Out’. Caloric Reduction is Primary. Eat less, move more, and that kind of idiocy.

We need to completely re-think our conventional view of obesity.

Let’s now fast forward to the modern era, and look at this study published in the prestigious *New England Journal of Medicine*.

![[Changes in Energy Expenditure Resulting from Altered Body Weight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7632212)
[Rudolph L. Leibel NEJM 1995 march 9, 332 (10); 621–28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7632212)](0*l0onvWf0INwts7tt.jpg)*[Changes in Energy Expenditure Resulting from Altered Body Weight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7632212)
[Rudolph L. Leibel NEJM 1995 march 9, 332 (10); 621–28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7632212)*

In this experiment, 18 obese and 23 non-obese subjects with a stable weight were recruited. They were fed a liquid diet of 45% carbohydrate, 40% fat, and 15% protein until the desired weight loss or weight gain was achieved.

One group targeted a 10% weight loss and the other group targeted a 10% weight gain. After weight gain, subjects were then returned to their initial weight, and then a further 10% or 20% weight loss was achieved.

The question they wanted to answer was what happened to TEE when weight was increased or decreased. This was achieved without a change in the composition of the diet. That is, the liquid diet was a constant ratio of carbohydrates, fats, and protein. The only variable was the total intake of this liquid diet. What happens to TEE when caloric intake is varied?

In other words, if we reduce or increase our Calories In, what happens to Calories Out? According to the conventional Caloric Reduction as Primary (CRaP) hypothesis, as Calories In go up or down, there should be not much change in the Calories Out.

![](0*ruj0QY2tdDnaW-Hs.jpg)

What happened? In the 10% weight gain group, people increased their energy expenditure by almost 500 calories/day. Remember that one of the key assumptions of the CRaP theory is that in response to caloric change, TEE does not change. This is clearly NOT TRUE.

Instead of a simple calories in, calories out model where fat is deposited according to an excessive intake of calories, it appears that the body responds to excess calories by trying to burn them off!

Now let’s see what happens as the weight is returned to normal. Here, things start to get really interesting. As weight returns to normal, TEE returns to baseline. As we move into 10% and 20% weight loss, the body reduces TEE by about 300 or 400 calories per day.

So, as we begin to lose weight, the body responds to the weight loss by reducing TEE. This slows weight loss, and encourages weight regain ***despite full compliance with the diet***. In other words, an increase in Calories In causes an increase in Calories Out. A decrease of Calories In causes a decrease in Calories Out. This is the body’s normal response. Weight loss will plateau, but not because you weren’t following the diet. Because that is the expected physiological response. It happens to everybody!

If you were trying to lose weight by eating less (Caloric Reduction as Primary), this is where you go, “WTF?!! OMG, That sucks! Where’s my frowny face emoji?”

![](0*AvkmbjhlyQxmV8qr.jpg)

Our body acts much more like a thermostat. That is, the body seems to have a certain Body Set Weight (BSW). Any attempts to increase above this BSW will result in our body trying to return to its original weight by increasing TEE (increasing metabolism to burn off the excess calories).

Any attempts to decrease below this BSW will result in our body trying to return to its original weight by decreasing TEE (decreasing metabolism to regain lost calories). No wonder it is so hard to keep the weight off! As we slow our metabolism, we must further and further reduce our caloric intake to maintain weight loss.

Here’s the misguided dietary technique of [portion control](http://weightloss.about.com/od/eatsmart/tp/aa030405a.htm) or Caloric Restriction as Primary. We reduce our portion size but keep meal timing and composition the same. We reduce our calorie consumption from 2000 cal/day to 1,600 cal/day. Our weight may reduce, but then the body would respond by reducing TEE to about 1,600 cal/day. We might feel cold, tired, miserable, and hungry. If you have ever been on a diet — you probably know how that feels.

The worst part of it is that we don’t lose any further weight because we are eating less and burning less. Any slip in the diet, even to the previous normal 2,000 cal/day will result in weight regain. Discouragement sets in. We get tired of feeling so lousy so we go back to our regular diet. All the weight comes racing back with a little extra for good measure.

We feel that we have failed ourselves. We think that it is our fault. [Our doctors, dietitians, and other medical professionals silently criticize us for ‘failing’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMhLBPPtlrY). Others silently believe we have no ‘willpower’, and offer meaningless platitudes. Sound familiar? Yeah, I thought so.

But in truth, the failing was not ours. The portion control diet is virtually* guaranteed to fail*. It has been proven over and over in the last 100 years. The only reason we think that it works is because everybody — the doctors, the dietitians, the ‘scientists’, the media — have convinced us that it is all about calories. No, the failing is with our nutritional authorities.

Clearly, something is causing us to gain weight, but calories sure don’t look like the problem or the solution here. What is that problem? What is the etiology of obesity? What causes fat gain?

# 5 Planning Lessons I learned from training for my first half-marathon

## We want to accomplish as many things as possible, so getting involved in different projects seems inevitable. Whether there are personal projects, professional, for the community or with the family, our time becomes LIMITED, and usually we lose track of the general image.

Running for long distances, means that first of all you need time for training. For me, the training for my first half-marathon at the Bucharest Marathon 2015 lasted 7 weeks (starting for a regular 4–5 km each week). Here are 5 lessons that I learned about planning of a project and productivity, while training & finishing my first half-marathon.

**1.Clarify from the beginning WHY you want to start/to get involved into a new project**

Involvement into a new personal project, professional, for family or into de community means that you must have a serious reason (it might be intrinsic motivation, a financial reason or a specific cause). In his book „Total Leadership” — Stew Friedman — professor at Wharton School, says that aligning the activities of a person should consider the 4 dimensions: personal projects, family projects, professional ones and those projects for the community. Linking a project for more than 2 dimensions brings more chances of success. My half-marathon training meant a personal dimension and one related to the community (supporting MagiCAMP, a camp for children with oncological diseases).

So, before getting involved in a new project, ask yourself: how would the new project align with your general goals and which is the main reason why you really want this?

**2. Establish how to integrate the new project into your current activities**

If you think that a new project will not influence your current activities … think again. Any new project will involve not only the physical working time but also the use of a limited resource: your will. Moreover, it is possible that when you start a new project, you will become excited and devote to much time, neglecting your current responsibilities. Think carefully, do you have enough time for the new project?

**3. Set the final result and visualize yourself fulfilling it**

A project must have a result, so set from beginning which will be the final result (what you want to achieve from the project, if it does not have a formal structure for completion). Then visualize yourself fulfilling it: What will be the added value of the new completed project? What’s the next step?

**4. Plan your time for “training”**

How to design a good plan? First, research: read, ask others who have already worked on a similar project or goal, ask for advice and then adapt them to your situation. As mentioned in step 2, the excitement of a new project could make you work too much and neglect other activities. Set limits from the beginning: the number of sessions for working on the project, the days, and even if in one day you could work more, stop! (otherwise you’ll have to delay other projects). For planning projects and activities I recommend [**Trello**.](https://trello.com/)

**5. Act as soon as possible after you completed Steps from 1–4**

After you determined the reason, the project’s impact on your activity, the desired outcome and you created a plan, there is only one more thing to do: to ACT. Follow you daily, weekly plan and remind yourself about your main reason and visualize the outcome. This will help in difficult moments. Transform your actions into habits.

# 3 Life Lessons From The Red-Light District.

## 3 Life Lessons From The Red-Light District.

### Or, why my first muse was a pimp named Moustache.

When I graduated university, my plan was to become a foreign correspondent. I’d managed to land an internship at a newsroom in Paris, only to learn hours after my plane landed that budget cuts were abruptly shutting it down. My would-be colleagues had known for over a week; it was only after I arrived to a gloomy office filled with moving boxes that it dawned on them — and, very quickly, on me — that everyone had forgotten to tell the intern.

It was 1999, I was twenty-one years old, and without enough money for a return flight.

By the following afternoon, I was sitting in a bar nursing a shandy (yeah, a *shandy*) on the corner of what appeared to be a rather standard Parisian street, having ambled haphazardly for most of the previous day. The manager was bored before I’d finished introducing myself, but sensed my desperation. “The pay is terrible,” he said, cutting me off. “But okay. Come back at nine.”

By the time I returned later that evening, my mistake was literally blinking over my head in neon lights — in the daylight, I’d somehow missed that this bar, an otherwise chummy English-style pub, was in the heart of Paris’ notorious red-light district.

With a sinking feeling, I surveyed the length of the street*.* The area had none of the romance or pageantry of its older, more respectable sister, the Moulin Rouge. Here, the atmosphere was perfunctory, clinical, detached, but unmistakably about sex and little else. And the bar — my new internship— was the last port of purity in a sea of skin.

It would become the best job I ever had.

I met Moustache because a young Algerian man asked me for a lighter one morning as I walked home from work. Though I didn’t smoke, out of embarrassment I pretended to search my pockets before coming up empty. His expression immediately turned to poison.

When I replay this moment, which I’ve done often since, I assure you there was nothing in my tone worthy of such a reaction; at worst, my reply was polite. Most likely, it was unnecessarily apologetic. I’m Canadian.

The Algerian made a sucking sound behind his teeth and said, “Should I slit your throat then?”

This particular constellation (Algerian teen/5 AM/slit throat) wasn’t among the several dozen I’d previously rehearsed in my mind while daydreaming about the various ways I’d fend off a theoretical attacker.

Even more disappointing — in real life, I possessed none of the confidence or charisma I assumed I’d call upon during such an encounter. There was no finger jab to the eyeball or elbow to the larynx. No parting quip over my shoulder as I jogged away casually from my now incapacitated would-be assailant. Instead, my skin turned cold. My feet got heavy. We stared at each other, waiting.

And here’s the moment when everything changed: no sooner had I frozen to the spot than a soft voice behind me ended the assault before it began.

“No,” it said. “You shouldn’t.”

Moustache.

Moustache was a short, compact man in his early forties, born to a Moroccan father and Albanian mother. His namesake mustache was so thick, dark, and comically lustrous that it almost appeared glued on, yet remained an obvious source of pride.

I would later learn that Moustache was the head pimp along Rue St Denis, and that over twenty years he’d managed to stake a claim for most of the women, one way or another, and therefore almost all of the money.

Every day at noon he’d settle himself in to a place at the bar, immaculately dressed in suits that suggested banker more than bordello. He’d order two or three drinks, never pay, but stuff a tip into the hand of whichever bartender served him on his way out. Some days he’d sip quietly, staring across the bar at nothing and no one. Other days he’d lean in, tap his fingers on a coaster and say, “*Alors?*”. This simple opener—my invitation to talk—became the beginning of an education that I’ve called upon countless times since.

**3 Moustachisms For Better Living**

**#1. Ask real questions.**

There’s nothing I dread quite as much as an enforced social gathering (office party, school bake sale, whatever) where the setting or circumstances don’t allow for any kind of meaningful interaction. I hate any form of small talk. Plus, I’m terrible at it.

Moustache had a habit of asking questions that veered well beyond our agreed upon level of social intimacy. That said, I looked forward to them regardless. They were *real *conversations, and they set the bar for the kinds of interactions I’m still seeking out today.

To wit: Moustache would never ask, “How are you?”. He’d ask, “What does it feel like to be a bartender when you were supposed to be a journalist?”. He’d never say, “I like your shirt.” He’d say, “You seem like you’re trying hard to impress someone. Who?” He would also draw parallels back to details from very old conversations in a way that made everyone feel simultaneously violated and understood. The head brewer at our bar was a displaced Scotsman who almost never spoke and literally hadn’t interacted with any customer in over five years. “Neil!” shouted Moustache after him one afternoon, “This beer is flat. I know you think you’re stuck, but you aren’t. You dropped out of art school and followed a woman to Paris. She’s gone. That happens. So make this beer your new art! She’s never coming back but this *terrible beer is right in front of me.*”

I know what you’re thinking: Moustache sounds like a colossal dick. His brand of back-and-forth is clearly its own form of power play by a man used to controlling people. But that’s only part of the truth. He was also just profoundly bored by the superficial-masking-as-sincere, likely because he otherwise sold the superficial-masking-as-sincere to hundreds of men every day.

Bottom line? When in doubt, *get into it*. Stop talking about nothing, *especially* with people you don’t know well. *Everyone* is fascinating until you start asking them boring questions. Don’t. I probably had a thousand interactions a week working at the bar — in fact, I was explicitly paid to chit-chat with the customers—but I only remember the ones I had with Moustache, and still do, down to the pauses and asides, some fifteen years later.

**#2. Say it out loud.**

If you can set aside the gender politics of the sex industry in general — and for the sake of this story you unfortunately need to — Moustache largely rose to power because he out-observed his peers. Through nurture and by necessity, Moustache was incredible at reading a room and averting disaster or mutiny. He picked up on everything — a nervous twitch, a flash of envy, a swallowed fury. But more to the point, he immediately *addressed* those things.

One morning, a couple months into my job, I arrived at work to find a fellow bartender standing outside the bar, jumbling through his bag. “Bugger,” he said. “I left my keys at home.” I almost never worked the early shift, and for that I was thankful—nothing is more depressing than serving alcohol at 10 AM. That said, I was unaccustomed to the rituals of actually opening the bar up each morning, and was certainly never given a set of keys myself. “Well,” he said, giving up, “Let’s go ask Moustache.”

For reasons that are still unclear to me, Moustache apparently had a spare set of keys to our bar; one of the few in the area he did not wholly or even partially own. This was understood as a simple fact, neither questioned nor remarked upon. I followed him into the strip joint directly across from the bar and one of the few open this early — or this late, depending on what time you entered.

There were mercifully few patrons and no active dances. I wasn’t puritanical, but I also didn’t have the energy that morning to feign indifference. That said, of all the things I expected to see behind the black felt door, the one thing I didn’t expect is what we stumbled upon: a *business* meeting.

Moustache, and about eight dancers, were sitting together around a large table. My friend and I stood off to the side, waiting for an opportunity to interrupt. The dancers were airing grievances, and Moustache was listening to each with such extreme focus that I almost couldn’t breathe. I was rapt.

If you could look past the tassels and false eyelashes, this meeting was indistinguishable from the hundreds of traditional business meetings I’ve since attended. They discussed what was going right, what was wrong, where revenues were growing and why, and how things might evolve in the future.

But what struck me the most was how Moustache kept redirecting the focus from the conversation to its subtext. When two dancers began disagreeing about the justice of how shifts were being allocated, Moustache interrupted and pointed out that the two seemed needlessly competitive with each other — but that he felt like the pay structure within the club helped create that situation. Suddenly the tenor of the conversation shifted; the girls felt partially relieved of their rivalry and could instead talk about ways of redesigning the system that had tacitly encouraged it.

Once I landed jobs I could actually put on a CV, I noticed a pattern. The people I was most drawn to at work were, like Moustache, those *would acknowledge what was actually happening in a room*. When a meeting got tense, they’d literally say, “Hey, we’re letting things get tense because everyone’s worrying about blame.” Or, when it was clear no one wanted to disagree with a piece of strategy, I had one boss finally say, “Who’s brave enough to challenge me here, because honestly I’m not totally sure of my direction.” More recently, on a frustrated conference call that was devolving into an accusatory who-said-what-to-whom-and-why, a colleague interrupted with, “You know, who cares? We all kind of screwed this up, and we know it. So let’s come up with a really clever way out, and then let’s laugh about it.”

Moustache was the first to show me the power of saying things out loud, right away, and aiming straight for the bit that is making everyone most squeamish.
> **#3. *Look until you see.***

Here’s the strangest one of all. Moustache, rather improbably, had a five-year-old son (the product of an uncharacteristic encounter with one of his dancers, who birthed and promptly fled the quivering newborn).

Moustache assumed full custody and led him gently around *the 2nd arrondisement *with all the reverence of a priest. I remember the little boy as unusually beautiful, with brown, buttery skin and a delicacy to his limbs and movements. Here’s the unreliable part: in my memory, the five-year-old has a thick, silky moustache, too, sitting demurely in miniature above his gently curving lip.

The women of St Denis fawned over Moustache’s son. He understood nothing of his father’s business, save that each stroll along that particular street resulted in a cacophony of unwelcomed kisses and squeals from overly perfumed women. *“Moustache! Bring him to me! I’m next! I’m next!”* they would holler, leaning out the doors of their clubs, kneeling and cooing into the flushed face of a little boy. In those moments, Moustache looked about as complete and proud as anyone could.

I don’t know why I was so surprised that Moustache was a doting father; though even as we became friends, a part of me still wanted to think of him as a monster, as inseparable from his trade. When I asked why he thought he was so enraptured with his son, he shrugged absentmindedly and said, “How could I not? I wasn’t fathered myself.”

In my role as a journalist, later as a designer, and now as an entrepreneur, I chide myself each time I fail to see people in full colour, even, or perhaps especially, when I’ve felt wronged or underestimated. My biggest lesson from a year working in St Denis was simply that — neither Moustache, nor the women on his stages, nor even the men who paid them— were as easy to define or diminish as I would have liked.

Insisting on the multidimensionality of everyone around you, whether they just screwed up your coffee or your career is, I promise you, a profound relief. You connect more dots. You consider your words. And you find yourself so full of forgiveness that it becomes easy, effortless. Both for others and even, every so often, for yourself.

These were the gifts of Rue St Denis. I’m still unwrapping them today.

I’ve only returned to the bar once since I left Paris. It was just over a year ago, and while the bar itself was as run down and weathered as I remembered it, the street seemed cleaner and less remarkable. Moustache is gone. Many of the clubs have closed; in their place are a strange portfolio of newcomers — a Chinese laundry, a flower store, a Baby Gap.

I carry with me a lot of nostalgia for that era of my life — some false, some amplified by time, but most very real, very true. Looking back, I still can’t imagine that another job could ever so profoundly shape or challenge me as did my very first. Does anyone?

# Your life. Your choice

## Choose your own adventure

I was a voracious reader as a child and young adult. Reading made me a dreamer. And it also made me want to be a writer. But the way others put their words together always seemed better than my word choices. And I chose a different path in my life, because I wasn’t confident enough. I chose to believe I wasn’t edgy enough. I chose to believe I was too normal.

If my life had been a Choose your own Adventure novel, ([circa 1980, by Bantam Books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure)) I would have been a writer. Maybe not the first time I read the book, or even the second. But eventually, if I tried hard enough, the outcome would be (and is): [Chrissanne Long — Writer](http://chrissannelong.com/).

The interesting thing about those books was, once you failed at getting the result you wanted, you could go back, see where you made the wrong choice, pick up there and **change the outcome of the entire book!**
> Did you catch that? One choice made the difference.

And then, there’s the most subtle point of it all — the fact that the endless opportunities we are given can be used, if we choose, to figure out what it is we actually want. The more we fail, the more clarity we can achieve. At any point in the plot line, we can go back and re-write our stories — one choice at a time.

At the end of my story, I have discovered that life is *a Choose your Own Adventure Novel *and* *I am a writer. What will you be at the end of yours?

# Do you need a Goal List for 2016?

## Have you asked yourself, why is it important to have a Goal List with clear actions and results to be obtained?
Recently, a friend told me that he wanted to learn to play guitar since always, as he already has one. After I told him that he could start step by step, for instance with 5–10 minutes a day viewing online videos/guitar lessons, his answer was “I will try”. When you say “I will try” you place in front of you the possibility that the goal will not be accomplished. Why? Because there isn’t any sense of urgency in reaching that goal and probably you don’t have a clear goal list with actions and results.

Philosopher and novelist Umberto Eco is fascinated by lists and impact on humanity. He said in an interview that “the list represents the origin of culture. It is part of history of art and literature. And what does culture want? To make the infinite understandable. And how can mankind understand the infinite? Through lists. When we express ourselves, we use lists.” We like creating lists with what we saw in our holiday, places we visited and activities that we want to accomplish.

Benjamin Franklin was famous for how he planned his activities and the way he checked his accomplishments during the day. He is one of the fathers of the “to-do list”, being a person who followed a daily routine, which included enough sleep, meals, and work, all of them planned properly in his list.

If we think of a goal list there are 4 steps that we should consider:
– splitting the projects in small steps of daily action
– prioritization of activities on categories
– planning
– be realistic on your planning.

If we are thinking of a simple list, the most used item that we could image is the shopping list, or maybe a Christmas gifts list.

Having a shopping list, means first of all, that at a certain moment you have an idea about what to buy at another moment in time. Let’s say that you found out that you don’t have any toothpaste anymore. You will put a note in your list to buy it and when you will go shopping, looking at your list, you will find that item. The result: you bought the toothpaste.

So, there are 2 main moments (as you can see below):

Moment 1: Identifying the need that has as a result creating the LIST

Moment 2: Opportunity for action — which has RESULTS.

![](0*fbTADIicRUujbvfs.jpg)

Think now at moment 2! The final of the year will show you the results from the entire year. The same as thinking now, at the beginning of the year of what happened last year. Did you have the results that you wish? Or, think of what you are doing now. Is this moment part of a planning at a previous moment, when you set your goals? Or, is it part of helping other achieve their goals?
Whatever the analysis that you are doing, what thing is certain. Now, this moment, can be MOMENT 1.

Did you create your goal list for 2016?

To help you, I created a template called **“From goals to results in 2016”** available [**here.](http://www.myproductivitykit.com/template/)**

# You. Will. Die.

## You. Will. Die.

### How to keep first things first and not sweat the small stuff

There are a lot of people in this world. 7.119 billion to be precise.

According to the CIA 12.44% are Mandarin Chinese speakers, 2% are atheists, 2.3% are Nigerian, and 41% are between the age of 25 and 54. And what do they all have in common?

100% of them will die.

I’ll rephrase that. *You* are going to die.

A few months back I had dinner with an elderly entrepreneur from Hong Kong. He explained that insurance companies use life tables (or actuarial science) to predict the life expectancy of a person based on age. His point: we’re living longer.

Thus, women born in Monaco in 2013 will, on average, live to be 94.

This is obviously a good thing. But there’s an upshot.

Parkinson’s law basically states that a task will take as long as you give it. That’s because the urgency of the task isn’t truly felt until the deadline is looming.

Here’s the consequence: as death is stalled, so is the urgency that comes with living in light of it.

I once had a nightmare that involved my death. My loved ones were distraught. I (ironically enough) was saddened as it unfolded before me.

When I awoke the vividness of the dream remained with me.

That was a great day.

For that day I truly didn’t care about the things that don’t matter and was immensely grateful for the things that do.

Here’s my advice to you. Regularly say these these words: “I am going to die.”

Let the weight of it rest on you.

Let the urgency compel you.

Appreciate the important.

Forget the rest.

# Notebooks as a Tool for Productivity and Growth

## [A New (to me) Concept for Keeping a Notebook](https://betterhumans.coach.me/a-new-to-me-concept-for-keeping-a-notebook-661e66f69158)

### I am a Commonplace Book convert. You should be, too.

[by Shaunta Grimes](https://betterhumans.coach.me/@shauntagrimes)

I’m not a stranger to keeping a notebook. I’ve kept one most of my life.

I’m not talking about a journal. I’ve never been great at journaling. This isn’t a reflective thing. Just a notebook for writing down my ideas or other people’s thoughts or what other people have to teach me.

I didn’t know that there was an official name for the kind of notebook I keep.
The kind that I carry around with me and write lists, bits of eavesdropped conversation, notes from a meeting, recipes, reminders, quotes, ideas for projects. [***Read more](https://betterhumans.coach.me/a-new-to-me-concept-for-keeping-a-notebook-661e66f69158)*.**

## [How To Expand Your Brain And Think Clearly With Evernote](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-expand-your-brain-and-think-clearly-with-evernote-5b01a66c89d6)

[*by Coach Niklas Goeke](https://betterhumans.coach.me/@ngoeke)*

Google counts almost 200 billion searches each month. That’s 26 for every person on the planet. But how many of those are successful? How many are just follow-ups to previous, failed searches? It’s not just that the explosion of data is incomprehensible, we also have to learn an entirely new language: the language of search engines.

So when we dismiss memorizing information, we can only confidently do that when we practice another skill instead. A skill that’s poised to become the competitive advantage of the 21st century: filtering information.

Over the past four years, I’ve built a system using Evernote that helps me do just that. It’s an external brain with shortcuts to the data I need most often and a cave I can retreat into when I need to think.

Here are four ways you can use Evernote to free space in your mind and become more efficient at organizing and retrieving information. [***Read more](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-expand-your-brain-and-think-clearly-with-evernote-5b01a66c89d6).***

## [Replace Your To-Do List With Interstitial Journaling To Increase Productivity](https://betterhumans.coach.me/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef)

### A new journaling tactic that immediately kills procrastination and boosts creative insights.

[*by Coach Tony Stubblebine](https://betterhumans.coach.me/@coachtony)*

We weren’t built for multi-tasking, so transitions between projects are very tough. We end up getting lost in procrastination. Even when we manage to transition quickly into our next project, our brain is still thinking about the last project.

That means our second project suffers from partial attention. The science of multi-tasking says partial attention can mean a 40% or more reduction in cognitive performance.

The Interstitial Journaling tactic solves all of these normal problems. It kills procrastination, empties our brain of the last project, and then gives us space to formulate an optimal strategy for our next project.

you obviously have some room for improvement.

So what’s Obama’s secret? Where does he come up with all the willpower?

Is it his Hawaiian heritage? His sleep schedule? The suit?

Yes. **It’s the suit.**

Wait, what?!

I’ll explain.

Here’s what a quick Google Image search of “Barack Obama” yields:

![](1*kvnbkJDn5aqXQOkfxnuI3g.jpeg)

Nothing uncommon, right? But look closer.

Notice anything?

**All of his suits are either blue — or grey.**

Hold on, really? To make sure I double checked all the pics.

Yup. Blue or grey.

Every. Single. One.

![](1*Jh_EKGPtlWJGYRxrO_LC9A.jpeg)

Is this one of those eerie internet phenomenons, like those creepy Google Maps pics?

Nope, this is productivity by design.

I call it **pared-down decisions.**

[And so does the president.](http://www.fastcompany.com/3026265/work-smart/always-wear-the-same-suit-obamas-presidential-productivity-secrets)

## The power of pared-down decisions

Once he saw the magnitude of the consequences of his decisions at work, Barack Obama knew that he could make none of them lightheartedly.

Each of them deserved his absolutely focused decision-making energy.

That’s why he decided to save all of it for those decisions.

You see, **the president has just as much willpower as you do**.

But he knows that his daily cognitive budget is limited. After a certain amount of decisions, he will suffer from [decision fatigue](http://jamesclear.com/willpower-decision-fatigue) — the lack of being able to make good decisions or to decide at all — just like everyone else.

Therefore, one day he decided to only wear grey and blue suits.

This is a pared-down decision, because he only had to **make it once**.

Since that day, he hasn’t spend a single one of his decisions on what to wear.

[Steve Jobs did the same thing](https://medium.com/better-humans/superhuman-cognitive-stamina-9c8cab847d9e). Remember his black turtleneck?

How much time did YOU spend this morning debating your dress code?

The red shirt, or the blue shirt? White socks or black socks? Do I need a sweater?

When you run the most powerful country in the world, you can’t occupy yourself with that kind of stuff.

Reaching into the closet and grabbing one of 50 identical suits requires no decision-making energy (I assume he even has someone decide the color for him).

## How pared-down decisions will change your life

Here are some other pared-down decisions the president has made:

* what to eat (he has someone plan his meals)

* when to exercise (every morning at 7:30 am)

* how he can respond to memos (3 multiple choice options: agree, disagree, let’s discuss)

* how much he socializes (for example he had a strict “no new friends” policy during his first campaign)

Now, while your decisions may not affect as many lives as the president’s you sure should take them just as seriously.

After all, the decisions you make today shape who you are tomorrow — and who you turn into determines how your life turns out.

So don’t waste your decision-making energy on irrelevant decisions.

From now on, think of your brain as a soda vending machine.

When you wake up in the morning the machine is fully loaded. Plenty of sodas left.

But as soon as you start making decisions the sodas start popping out.

![Clunk!](1*j-pQdcfk9UHfp2Q0h02WgQ.gif)*Clunk!*

* Should I brush my teeth or take a shower first? Clunk.

* What am I going to wear? Clunk.

* Will I have cereal, oatmeal, a smoothie or just coffee for breakfast? Clunk, clunk, clunk.

You might have 100 sodas in your machine, but if you keep going like this you’ll run out before noon — and the machine will only be stacked up again tonight while you’re asleep.

So today, for each decision you seem to make over and over again, **ask yourself: is this really worth pulling a soda?**

If it’s a decision you can pare down, by all means, pare it down.

Pull a soda only when you’re thirsty, not just because you can.

Make a commitment up front. Consciously limit yourself.

Contrary to common belief, self-imposed limits can provide a wonderful feeling of **freedom** — the freedom to spend your energy on what truly matters.

The man in the blue suit agrees. And he probably went to work with a few more sodas left than you.

# Better

## Better

### Whether we’re designers, developers, managers or athletes, as humans we’re always striving for “better”. How come my experience of “better” so different from the app experiences I design to make people’s live “better”?

### **My better vs your better**

We’ve all heard about how design is going to save us. Super clever start-ups are going to disrupt old-world thinking and innovent (thanks Jack Donaghy!) solutions to fundamental human problems. We’ll live better measured, data-producing lives that feed back into smarter and more convenient systems. We’ll be so fulfilled! Design cares! I can’t wait for the future!

OK, so cynicism is amusing for about a minute. Ultimately it’s just idealism gone sour. Of course I need to believe what I do makes people’s lives better. If people don’t feel a service or experience is making something better for them, they won’t bother using it. That’s what makes them ‘users.’

As interaction designers, we work to understand what ‘better’ means for businesses, developers and ultimately users. We try to create better experiences, better interactions, better propositions, better solutions.

I’m also interested in making my day-to-day life better and exploring what it means to be a better human being. I’ve experimented with different approaches and experience varying levels of success failure. I’ve evolved a set of values that have definitely made my life better.

Something has been nagging at me: how come my version of “better” is so different from the solutions or apps I design to make people’s live “better”?

Perhaps these contexts aren’t comparable. My experience likely nothing has to do with what a group of users might need, right? But users are people too. And I was curious to compare what the values behind these two versions of “better” are.

### **Better technology for better humans**

Digital and technology-driven solutions have a strong bias about what’s better. We tend to assume it’s simply better to:

* Get more information to more people, and

* Make every process more efficient and convenient

The drive to constantly optimise comes from stunning technological breakthroughs. As these limits fall away, our human ones do as well. It’s pretty magical to be able to translate a conversation on the fly or orient yourself in a foreign landscape.

That drive to transcend limits is what underlies our current cultural beliefs about technology. Tech-driven solution thrive on the assumptions that:

* Progress is inevitable

* Technology is always the best solution

* Everything is measurable

These are powerful and insidious beliefs. Dr. Galloway describes these beautifully in [her article on ubiquitous computing](http://www.designculturelab.org/2013/03/31/5-things-about-ubiquitous-computing-that-make-me-nervous/). Go read it. I’ll wait.

Done? Now let’s look at what ‘better’ means:

*bet·ter*** **/ˈbetər/

1. Greater in excellence or higher in quality.

1. More useful, suitable, or desirable.

1. More highly skilled or adept.

1. Greater or larger.

You get the idea. Better is more of what is good.

If “better” means more convenient services, increased efficiency and more data faster, then “good” must equal convenience, efficiency, measurability and speed.

### Experiments in being a better human

Back to my experiments. I figured a better day-to-day meant better habits. It seemed simple enough. I want to be healthier? I should eat more of *x* and less of *y*. I want to spend more time working on a personal project? I should be more efficient with how I use my time.

I read endless productivity blogs, I consulted with friends, I experimented. I tracked what I ate, logged how I used my time, scheduled around core commitments, made lists, made spreadsheets and downloaded more productivity apps. It worked really well… for a time. I’d exercise more, eat better, see who I wanted and get more done.

But I’d never be satisfied. I could always do better, do more, use my time better. If I slipped up it would feel like a personal failure. And if I did well better was always still out of reach. I was more productive but less resilient. When something changed or I fell sick—basically when life happened—I felt pressure to get back on top of it all. And I’d eventually lose touch with why I was doing it in the first place.

The problem? The means became the end. Tracking became a value rather than a tool, efficiency a virtue rather than an approach. Being more productive could help make time for what I cared about, but it didn’t add more meaning to my life in itself.

My values are not to be more productive. My values are better lived out if I use my time productively. Big difference.

### Wait, what’s human?

It’s hard to be a better human when being human seems to involve constant dissatisfaction. It’s why we want to make things better. And that involves changing something. Usually changing how things are to how we’d like them to be.

![A. -&gt; B.](0*iMrs8DIDKmzBtap5.png)*A. -&gt; B.*

All the techniques I used were basically to change A to B in the belief it would make my life better. Sometimes you can change things to suit you. But when you can’t, what do you do?

Mindfulness practice helped me make space to stop, slow down and try to see things as they are. I realised “better” isn’t a goal, it’s an outcome or practice.

When I was in touch with the underlying desire for making my life better, I realised it was quite simple: I wanted to live a meaningful life where I stayed in touch with a sense of purpose.

As in all design processes, changing the frame of the problem opened up different solutions. I didn’t have to be attached to any one tool and it could change day to day. It could mean keeping a schedule one day or tossing it out another.

It forced me to trust my sense of purpose rather than my tools. I tried to do less and listen more. Choosing not to give in to FOMO (fear of missing out, now optimised by Facebook), to read and see everything and meet everyone creates space for life to actually happen.

And better happened when I used those tools in service of making this a two-way conversation:

![A. &lt;-&gt; B.](0*sYNt1VJQBarzlJq9.png)*A. &lt;-&gt; B.*

We’ve a bit of an obsession with changing the world. It’s a chaotic place and that’s what our tools help us deal with. But sometimes it’s about changing the world, other times it’s about allowing the world to change you.

Interestingly, the word ‘better’ has a more ancient etymology. The old English *bot* meant “help, relief, advantage; atonement,” or “remedy, reparation.” It’s a very different idea of better. It’s not about fixing or adding anything.

Balancing listening and doing helps heal the rift between things as they are and things as I want them to be. That’s how better emerged for me.

Comparing the values I work from and the values I live by now looks a bit like this:

![](0*tZnxrm0JkBUfvcWN.png)

### Reframing desire

Perhaps these values apply to different aspects of our lives and it’s fine that they’re separate. But we only ever design for one set of values and we easily fall into the trap of confusing the means with the end.

Our personas are ‘time-poor’ and ‘gadget hungry’, they want a more ‘convenient experience’ that also happens to feel ‘tailored and personalised’. Is that really what they want? When we see human desires through the lens of technological solutions, we’ll only see problems we know how to design for.

It may be those desires are perfectly appropriate to the context we’re designing for—a banking application should just be quicker, more accurate and offer more control.

What would happen though if we were to shift the frame and design for a different set of desires? What if we were to design for the underlying desires, maybe one where money is in service to one’s values and way of living?

Making things more convenient and efficient is great. It can also help make space for deeper commitments to better living. But it’s important not to confuse the tool and the problem, or the effect and the outcome. It’s when solution becomes prescriptive that the balance has tipped, when we rationalise new behaviours and squeeze human experience to fit our systems.

Helping someone access more information quicker doesn’t mean we “fixed” the problem of them feeling closer to someone. And if that’s not the problem we’re addressing, let’s not pretend it is. As long as we remember the difference there’s room to design many more experiences of “better.”

# From Passion Project to Startup in Four Days&#58; A Guide

## From Passion Project to Startup in Four Days: A Guide (featuring beer and tacos)

### So what are you waiting for?

## I planned to spend this week relaxing.

Really, I did. I originally had 4 much needed days off from both work and MBA classes and I was spending some of my down time with the two founders of my favorite art-based business that I have the pleasure of advising.

Despite my capitalist persuasion they allowed me to become involved with them a year ago, and like many of the days since then our conversation ran a dizzying course through obscure music, absurd software ideas, performance art, the human experience, dollar-tacos and eventually (inevitably) entrepreneurship. One of the two founders, who is currently in a Masters of Fine Arts program, brought up an entrepreneurship pitch competition being offered to students — which thanks to his MFA meant technically our team was eligible.

Then he mentioned that there was a cool $40k up for grabs in prize funding.

My ears perked up. I stopped rambling about Banksy’s recent [Central Park installment](http://mashable.com/2013/10/14/banksy-sells-original-artwork-cheap/) and what it might mean regarding American capitalism.

30 seconds of additional conversation revealed that the deadline for submission was **4 days away**. There was hesitation, but who were we kidding? Even a small chunk of $40k can pay for a LOT of art.

Challenge accepted, vacation over.

So the past 4 days have been a crash course through the essentials to get a concept from passion project to pitch-ready, and there was even still some time for dollar-tacos and a few beers. Although the founders have been propelling this project for 3 years on sweat equity alone, when I sat down and threw together a page and a half overview it was described by the two founders as “the most business-writing on this project yet.” I believed it.

## **Here’s how we made it happen:**

### Business Model Canvas

You gotta start somewhere, and this is a place I know, love and trust. After 45 minutes you have all your crucial assumptions laid out, and hopefully you have covered every aspect necessary to make your business concept functional. Wikipedia is a great source for a [template](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas) that includes examples and directing questions.

### TEST YOUR ASSUMPTIONS

Realize that everything you wrote on the BMC is more or less hypothetical. If you spend the first 45 minutes of day one cranking out the canvas, spend the rest of the hours that day testing your assumptions. Talk to every and any person who is relevant to the business in some way (provider, client, partner, competitor, etc). You can talk to over 300 people in a single day — I’ve done it. Revise your canvas as your conversations point out the massive oversights you missed and costs you completely forgot to consider.

**This is the most important part of the entire process, everything from here on out is only as good as these assumptions.**

### Put Some Meat on that Canvas

For each category of the business model canvas you should realistically have a half page to a page (at least) to explain what the canvas actually means in context.

**Value Proposition **should include the problem you are solving, the solution, the competitive landscape, any insights you have on existing players and finally your Unique Selling Point that sets you apart. Explain exactly what you do to deliver value to customer and the activities it requires.

**Consumers** are the most important thing to achieving your value proposition. Spend a page describing all of your customer segments (size, behavior, preferences), specifically noting the one most important to your success or failure. Give another page to relationships and channels combined, explaining how you are going to get new customers and maintain the customers you have. stay focused on your delivering your Value Proposition and Unique Selling Point throughout the plan.

**Partners** are the next logical step. No matter what you may believe you will most definitely not get anywhere alone, and there are probably numerous roles outside of your organization that are crucial to its success. Be specific. Identify roles and if possible individuals that can fill them and why. Explain why every partner is essential.

**Resources** are about as relevant your partners. Tell the investor exactly what resources you need and why. Mention the ones you have, the easiest and hardest to get, and which are most essential.

**Cost structure** is where you will either win or lose the faith of whomever is reading your plan. Minimize your costs wherever possible, but most importantly be realistic and try to account for every cost imaginable as accurately as possible. Explain which ones are most significant and/or unavoidable, when you’re going to incur them and how you will make decisions to incur them. Think about depreciation — those great resources you have won’t last forever. Make sure to factor in the cost of your partners, managing relationships, resources, acquiring new customers, labor, not to mention actually DOING whatever your value proposition is.

**Revenue streams** are everyone’s favorite part. Once again, be realistic. Its tempting, but be careful not to over-project. No hockey stick shaped profit models, no infinite growth, in all likelihood no getting rich in year one. Explain how much of your market you can REALISTICALLY tap into. Focus on what they’re willing to pay for right now and base estimates of how much they are paying for similar products/services. Round down.

### TEST MORE ASSUMPTIONS then get those tacos and beer.

If possible, put the whole plan in front of someone who is relatively experienced/educated in the field of your concept. Make sure they’ll be honest with you and get their feedback on its feasibility. Tell them to take their time and get it back to you the next day. Then seriously, relax. At this point its probably late into day 2, but you have a fully fledged business plan that’s 5-9 pages to show for it.

### Pro Forma Time

Get a calculator these are financial projections based on all of your assumptions. Don’t run for the hills quite yet though, amazing services like [ProjectionHub](http://www.projectionhub.com/) can gently hold your hand and walk you through every step along the way. Trust your gut and remember what you focused on in the Cost Structure and Revenue Streams sections of your brand new business plan. Low-ball your sales, be generous with costs, assume “if things break” really means “when”. This part is never fun, but once your done (if you used ProjectionHub) you’ll have 10 spreadsheets with 3-year projections of Cash Flows, Income Statements and Balance sheets, as well as an Annual Summary. Check out your net profit in year three — are you out of the red? Your passion project is officially looking as real as Google. Keep in mind most start-ups are in the red for year one, and likely year two.

### Executive Statement

Keep it under two pages. Explain your value proposition and unique selling point as short and sweet as possible. Talk about how awesome and amazing your team is and what sets them apart from anyone else who might be competing in your space. Always be selling your a team, and always be telling a story. Briefly tell the story of how you got to where you are now from the beginning, and what you are doing right now in the effort to execute your plan. Highlight the best aspects of your Plan and your Pro Forma models. Get human too — talk about what is driving you to do this. It is a passion project, right?

### Get Abstract

Keep it under 100 words, make them fall in love, and make key message points easy to remember and improvise. If done correctly, this is also your elevator pitch. Describe the big-picture of your Value Proposition and Unique Selling Point, why the problem you are solving is important in the grand scheme of things, and what uniquely positions you to be the team to execute. Sell your amazing incredible team a little more and end with something pithy that they won’t forget.

### CELEBRATE

Put the abstract on top, executive summary, business plan and then your Pro Formas. Have another beer or go to bed because its 2:00AM on Friday and your week-old start-up finally has a fighting chance at some cash.

# How to Beat Your “Hard Equals Valuable” Bias

## How to Beat Your “Hard Equals Valuable” Bias

### This is the most important product lesson I ever learned.

There’s a story that I always tell engineers about the difference between hard and valuable.

In 2006, I was covering SalesForce’s annual conference as a reporter for a tech publication.

Early in the main session, a Salesforce VP spent 30 minutes going over a new programming language called Apex. Tech jargon ahead:
> The world’s first on-demand programming language and platform that will, for the first time, allow third parties to write and run code on the salesforce.com multi-tenant, shared architecture

Salesforce loves the word multi-tenant. You can ignore that jargon and just focus on this:

Building the Apex language and platform probably took **100 person-years** of engineering effort.

That means when you sum up all days that all of the engineers spent on the project the final tally would be over 100 years. Maybe more.

*At the end of the Apex announcement, the crowd applauded politely.*

Then the Saleforce speakers moved on to announcing a series of interface changes.

One of those interface changes was to the navigation sidebar of the main interface.

That sidebar was taking up a lot of room and was making it hard to see the main content that people were working with.

In order to make more room, Salesforce engineers had updated the navigation sidebar to be collapsible. With one click, you could hide the navigation sidebar and have more room to work.

This is what that looks like (and this was actually the third Google result for collapsible sidebar):

![](1*YR7BTluTck_0EYcv8SruAw.png)

*In unison, the entire audience stood and gave a standing ovation.*

The change probably took one engineer about an hour to implement.

[Here’s a tutorial for how easy this is](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23455820/bootstrap-3-collapsible-sidebar). I was unable to find a tutorial for writing custom programming languages for on-demand multi-tenant platforms.

Just to hammer this home.

On one side you have an investment of 200,000 hours that generates polite applause. On the other you have an investment of 1 hour that generated a standing ovation.

My back of the envelope is that on a per hour effort basis, the sidebar was 1,000,000 more valuable.

Let’s call the sidebar a **million-x** feature because it’s a million times more valuable than everything else you’re working on.

Now think about your product and ask yourself if there are any small tweaks that might be one million times more valuable than anything else you’re doing?

And, for the product manager, is it worth striking out one thousand times to find these million-x features?

P.S. I bet the sidebar actually took a full month of person-hours with debate, design and testing. But I’m always telling this story to people at smaller companies where changes this small happen much faster.

P.P.S. There’s a coaching and human performance component to this story.

The human performance issue is around bias and decision making. We’re all full of hidden biases that are holding us back from peak results. Collecting defenses against these biases is a huge part of becoming smarter. For example, see Warren Buffett’s partner, Charlie Munger, on [the role of bias in investment](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/06/10/charlie-mungers-18-biases-that-cause-you-to-fool-y.aspx).

The coaching component is reframing. This is a classic coaching technique and the story above changes the engineering framework from “how much work can we do” to “how much value can we build.”

# Important or urgent? More productive through simple planning

## Recently, I received a question on Quora on how can time management & productivity reduce stress. Stress is the result of multiple factors, but being stressed is in many situations the result of wishing to accomplish many activities with tight deadlines.

In his book „First Things First” — Stephen Covey presents an instrument called Time management matrix which is attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower (also known as Eisenhower Decision Matrix). This is a simple instrument which I will present in this article.

![](1*phxIz14IBSOE8x4L44ORjA.jpeg)

The matrix has 4 quadrants:

**Quadrant 1: Important and urgent: **here we can find activities that are related to our main professional activity which must be finished as soon as possible. These activities are important for our general goals.

**Quadrant 2: Important and non-urgent: **although in this category we can find tasks that are correlated with our goals, there isn’t a sense of urgency in accomplishing them, so in many cases, they are postponed for the next day.

**Quadrant 3: Unimportant and urgent: **these are activities that you should delegate. In most of the cases, another person is telling us that these activities are “urgent” (“I need to solve something urgent, could you help me?”). Does this sound familiar? Remember that “urgent” for another person, is not “urgent” for you. If you choose to help the other person, you will end up with more tasks from quadrant 1 (important and urgent).

**Quadrant 4: Unimportant and non-urgent:** these are the activities that we shouldn’t focus too much on, as they are time consuming and uncorrelated with our long-term goals.

How can a stressful situation appear because of a weak productivity?

Imagine that you focus each day on activities in quadrant 1. Each day, you are struggling to find time and finish your activities near the deadline. This brings you more and more stress.

If you want to increase your productivity, you should increase the activities done in Quadrant 2 (Important and non-urgent). For instance: if you know that you should finish a presentation for next week, you could split the work into daily small tasks, in order to finish on time.

# Findings by Self-Experimenters on Sleep

## Using Data and the Latest Research, These Health Hackers Discovered the Habits for Maximum Impact on Their Own Sleep

If you don’t get enough sleep, your ability to function in day-to-day tasks is impaired. There’s million articles that give you advice on how to sleep better, but these three articles are by people just like you that took the data and research into their own hands and experimented to find what worked for them. Their results are nothing short of inspirational.

## What I Learned from Six Months of Obsessive Sleep Hacking

### How I tracked data to reveal the best habits for improving my own sleep — and how you can, too

What began as a “let’s do this for a week” thing turned into a 6-month obsession with spreadsheets, graphs, experiments and hypotheses, and some interesting/fascinating/odd findings. I want to share those with you, because I was able to quickly improve my sleep — and perhaps you can, too.

## How Depression Made Me a Morning Person

### And how learning to sleep made me superhuman

Despite how click-bait-y this title sounds, it is not an exaggeration.

In the last six months, my average wake time has been 6:30am — including weekends, holidays, and frequent time zone crossings. To be fair, 6:30am is not *that* early in the realm of early-birds, called larks, who espouse the miracles of a 5am wake up time. But for me, this has been such a momentous change that I’ve become quite literally a different person.

I am now someone that wakes up *naturally* before their 6:30am alarm with enthusiasm to tackle the day, and with a wide menu of pre-breakfast activities including meditation, yoga, strenuous bike rides, reading, writing, making old-fashioned oatmeal, etc.

I may sound like a holier-than-thou health nut, but I assure you I am nearly as confused as you might be about how I got here. [***Read more](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-depression-made-me-a-morning-person-cda4889662ff)***.

## Improving my Sleep with a Glucose Monitor

Do bad glucose levels lead to bad sleep? Does a bad night sleep impact blood glucose levels the next day?

At the recent Quantified Self Amsterdam conference, we had a workshop on metabolism and sleep. During the workshop, we got a chance to meet and talk with type 1 diabetic patients who have been using continuous glucose monitors for years — and know deeply how sleep and glucose levels are related. It turns out there’s so much more to glucose than just what we eat — sleep is a fundamental part of the equation.

# How to become a time wizard by mastering mornings

## 

You *want* more.

You want to create more, learn more, *do *more.

It’s definitely a challenge [fitting everything into 24 hours](http://traceyminutolo.com/start-side-business-without-losing-friends-family/). But it can be done if you’re willing to make the adjustments to your lifestyle that will put more time back in your hands.

What night owls and early birds *both* know is that there is something almost magical about being up when the rest of the world is off in dreamland. No one expects us to be anywhere. No one interrupts our flow. The world is quiet. Our minds are at their best.

And that time is *ours*.

I haven’t been a night owl in years. Mornings are where it’s at for me now, so that’s what I’m focusing on here, but I say above all, do what works for *you*.

So, I do sometimes get odd looks when I tell people I get up at 5am most days of the week.

And I totally understand why, too. I used to sleep in on weekdays until about a half hour before I needed to leave for work. I would try to get up earlier than that, but inevitably I’d end up hitting the snooze button a few times, then dragging myself out of bed, angry at the world, so I could scramble to get out the door and get to work on time.

But, almost two years ago now, I decided to go after an industry certification through my job. Based on the lore passed down by my coworkers who’d taken the exam, I knew I’d need to spend roughly 2–3 months of study at approximately 10 hours a week in order to stand better than a snowball’s chance in hell of passing this behemoth.

Alright. Doing the math, I swiftly realized I had to somehow “produce” these 10 hours.

Mornings were the best option.

So, I began “training.”

## I did a few simple things that you can try too:

* I started **going to bed earlier**

* I set my alarm for **15 minutes earlier** than my original waking time

* I let myself **get used to the new waking time** (15 minutes earlier) for about a week

* Once I was able to get up for a whole week without issues at the new waking time, I decided to **dial my bedtime and waking time back another 15 minutes**

* **I stabilized at the *new* new bedtime and waking time**

* Then I cranked things **back another 15 minutes until I hit my target waking time**.

I also began using a silent (vibrating) alarm to minimize the impact of my experiment on my girlfriend!

With the “extra” time in the mornings, I was not only able to fit my studying in and pass my certification exam (I know you wanted to know!), but I kept waking up at 5am after that and turned that time into time to work in and on my business.

And the rest is history. I’m sold on mornings.

# How To Eliminate Your Doubts Before Starting A New Project

## How To Eliminate Your Doubts Before Starting A New Project

### What This Week Taught Me: Counterintuitive Confirmation

It’s been a busy week. Between a product launch, [AniQuote](http://aniquote.co/) and a new gig I’ve taken up two weeks ago, time to write was cut a bit short.

Hence, I decided to give myself the following constraints for this post:

* Less than 1,000 words.

* No more than 4 [Pomodoros](http://fourminutebooks.com/the-pomodoro-technique-summary/) total.

Artificially limiting yourself is liberating. Busy weeks come with a lot of learnings, so these rules forced me to think really hard:
> # **What’s the biggest lesson from the past 7 days?**

As I was munching on a slice of delicious pizza on Wednesday, a pattern emerged: **All these side projects have taught me something unexpected, which confirmed the path I was on** — and that’s what’s let me move forward with them in the first place.

If you’re struggling to go from idea to execution, because you’re doubting yourself if a potential project will be worth it, this idea will allow you to eliminate those doubts quickly, move fast and take swift action.

I call it…

## **Counterintuitive confirmation.**

Let me explain.

### What’s Counterintuitive Confirmation?

When you embark on [a new project](http://niklasgoeke.com/how-to-start-a-passion-project/), you expect to learn certain things. “Doing this will teach me about X” is one of the substantial reasons we use to talk ourselves into tackling something new.

### Expected Learnings

For example, before I started recording audio book summaries for [The 4 Minute Folio](http://fourminutebooks.com/go/audio/), I figured it would teach me something about:

* Pronunciation

* Intonation

* Reading fluidly

* Reflecting on past writings

* Editing and optimizing audio files

* Packaging tracks for public release

…and so on. All of these came true. But I also picked up some lessons I *didn’t* expect.

![I had this view a lot last week.](1*x60rpeN3qL6sbp35qLwx3A.png)*I had this view a lot last week.*

### Unexpected Learnings

* Reading out loud for a long time requires lots of water, lots of breaks and lots of fresh air.

* When I go straight from reading into reflecting mode, I ramble, but when I note down three bullet points of what I want to say, I do fine.

* **I like doing these every once in a while, but when it comes to scale, I would much rather write.**

There were a few more, but the last one was the most telling.

### Whatever *unexpected* thing you learn, it will confirm you either way

It was totally counterintuitive for me to realize that yes, I love writing way more than speaking, but it confirmed me in [my chosen path to full-time writing](http://niklasgoeke.com/why/).
> # **In hindsight, it was a confirmation to one of my prior choices. A confirmation I wasn’t expecting to get.** **A counterintuitive confirmation.**

If you now think “well, that only worked out because you like writing more,” *think again*. Had I suddenly realized I love audio and am a born podcaster, that would *also* have been a counterintuitive confirmation: **making the switch to audio was the right call**.

It would have set me on a new path, but confirmed my idea nonetheless.

Due to their element of surprise, unexpected learnings are much more convincing. The stuff you expected is nice, but the formerly unknown feels revolutionary.

## How can you use this idea to eliminate doubt?

Expected learnings, unexpected learnings. The former is what you *usually* use to overcome doubts and get started. The latter is why you’ll be glad you did.

Since the lessons learned without expectation are more powerful, can you use those to start faster?

I think so. Because here’s the kicker: **you will get at least one counterintuitive confirmation with *every* project you pursue.**

No matter what idea you take on, one of two things will happen:
> # **1. It will confirm what you were doing before, and you will happily return to it.**
> # **2. It will confirm your new idea as a great pursuit and you will dedicate more time to it.**

When you first divulge an idea to friends and family, this is comforting to remember. As the “don’t do it” and “are you sure” voices get louder, so will your inner self-doubt dialogue. And that costs precious time.

In theory, we know that 9 out of 10 times, we’re better off ignoring their warning. Without understating the importance of recognizing that 10th time, I do think counterintuitive confirmation is a suited tool to deal with the other 9.

![](0*4jrculRVU_tB9DJr.)

When I told two friends about the idea for [AniQuote](http://aniquote.co/), they also asked: *“Are you sure you want to do this? It’s so outside of what you’re usually doing.” *They were right, but I had a hunch the project was worth a shot. So I asked myself:
> # **What’s a lesson I might learn from this, but wouldn’t expect to?**

It’s a tough question. After all, you wouldn’t think of these things without this concerted effort. What I’ve come up with:

* Leading and managing a group of people to create something together.

* What makes a great font.

* Which space in the app scene is under-supplied with good apps.

Using these, **I now have some extra anti-doubt material I can throw against concerns and proceed with the project faster**. Within the first 24 hours of making the decision, I already took massive action.

What else will follow? I have no idea. But I’m on my way to find out. And that’s what matters.

When you’re doubting yourself, especially about a project with only time to lose, the idea of receiving confirmation either way is comforting.

The next time you face doubt, ask **“What’s a lesson I might learn from this, but wouldn’t expect to?” **This should take a few minutes, but will give you extra arguments to silence your inner critic and switch from thinking to doing.

Know you can expect counterintuitive confirmation from what you’re about to embark on, and setting sail will be much, much easier.

# Thrive Where You Live

## 

Sitting in a hotel lobby in Wichita Falls, a friend told me about a cattle rancher and liquor store owner that had lots of interesting online projects. They had served together on the National Board of Directors for Business and Professional Women USA. Less than a week later, Pam Slim tweeted about Becky McCray, and I instantly recognized her name and fell down a stereotype-shattering rabbit hole.

**Many of us are convinced that we just need to live somewhere different to be successful. Becky McCray argues that small towns have a future and proves that with her own life. If she can thrive in a community of 30 people, we can find a way too.**

**Becky, thanks so much for sharing with us today. Let’s start with my favorite question. How do you define success?**

I usually fall back on Earl Nightingale’s definition: success is the gradual attainment of a worthy ideal. I honestly don’t think about this much any more. Maybe because I think of failure differently, too. Failure isn’t the negative thing most people think. It’s a way to learn and grow. So since I don’t think of failure as something life-endingly awful, maybe that’s why I don’t think much about success either. I just do what matters.

**Was there a time when you had a different definition?**

I’m really not very good at self-reflective questions like this! I suppose there was, but I don’t really remember how I used to think.

**Can you describe a typical day in your life?**

A typical day starts with my husband and I setting up the liquor store for the day, making deposits, and all the things that come with a bricks and mortar store. Then we take care of any “in town” errands, picking up parts or feed for the farm, that sort of thing. Then I usually get in some time focused on my online work before lunch. Then the afternoon might include a trip to the farm to take care of cattle or fix fence. Or I might spend the afternoon writing, preparing a talk, or holding a meeting online. In the odd minutes, I do connect a lot on Twitter. Since I work from home mostly, that’s my connection to the outside world.

**Do you have any particular habits or systems that you feel are essential to your success?**

I do love productive habits. I keep a running list of my projects and what needs to be done with them. Over the years, it’s been on paper, but now it lives in Evernote. From that list, I schedule my week before it ever starts. On Sunday night, I fill in my calendar with any set appointments. Then I add items from my project list.

And one habit never changes: my list each day has [six things, and only six things](http://smallbizsurvival.com/2009/01/6-most-important-things.html). You’ve probably heard this story before, but I think it’s worth my re-telling it.
> Back in the early 1900’s, Charles Schwab was the head of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Consultant Ivy Lee offered to increase the productivity of Schwab’s people, and he would let Schwab decide what the results were worth. Schwab agreed.
> Lee taught each executive to sit down at the end of each day, and create a list. The list must contain only the six most important things to be completed the next day. Each morning, they should start the day by working on the first item on that list, and not move on until it is completed.
> After a few months of seeing results, Schwab sent a check to Lee for $25,000. That’s about $500,000 in today’s dollars.

The lesson:

* Not thirty-six things. Not urgent things. The Six Most Important Things.

* Each “thing” is not an entire project, but is a do-able task.

* At the end of the day. Not in the frantic scramble at the beginning of the day .

* Daily. Every day. *Every day.*

**Are there any habits you’re working to develop next?**

I’ve been working on the habit of taking time off from business, having a bit more of a well-rounded life. That encompasses a lot, so it’s a challenge!

# I love you Detroit, but this is your sickness.

## I love you Detroit, but this is your sickness.

### The fish does not know it is submerged until it isn’t.

I distinctly remember feeling the acute slap of sadness. The conversation was familiar, but I had never had it with someone who was unaware of the historical context.

The air was sticky and humid. I was tired, but becoming comfortable in my new surroundings. A few of the girls had gotten ill, but my stomach was beginning to harden, like it does after a few weeks dining on unfamiliar cuisine. The feeling must be the same for my dog Cali when we choose to purchase different food for her.

The sun had gone down, and Kwame and I were gathered around a cheap plastic picnic table by the pool. We had eaten and I was happy and full. I was having a beer and feeling especially American. A few of us had swam earlier in the day, probably the first people to swim in the hotel pool in quite some time — people generally don’t have beers or swim for fun in Ghana.
> # “Perhaps travel cannot prevent bigotry, but by demonstrating that all peoples cry, laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other, we may even become friends.” - Maya Angelou

Most of the girls hadn’t returned from their rooms for dinner yet, they had found Forest Gump on TV or something and were all gathered in a room watching it and being lazy. I was the only male besides Kwame so we had formed a tighter bond, plus I was a few years older than the girls. I think my professor Kate was there too, but I can’t remember.

The sun had gone down, and we were around the plastic picnic tables talking and eating and I was having my beer. There was that neon glow from the bug lamps and the cheap plastic chair legs flexed as I would lean back in my seat. Kwame and I were talking shop, about community development, and about home.

I was probably 2 weeks into my trip, a partnership between my current Alma Mater Michigan State University and the University of Ghana, Accra. Academic environments are wonderful because they allow a safe place to talk. Nothing is ‘touchy’ because everyone shares the common desire to learn more than teach*.

## It was a sad kick to the chest

Kwame and I were talking about development, how we can each learn from the cross cultural experience we were having. In Ghana, there is a severe need for infrastructure. Roads are bad, there is no public water system, and rolling blackouts are common. The very tangible issue of physical connectedness was preventing an increase in the quality of life.

And then it was my turn.

Detroit is difficult to explain internationally. The big three are ubiquitous, as are images of thundering manufacturing lines, the production of the American dream. I think when many foreigners imagine arriving to America by boat they imagine the New York skyline, but when they imagine starting a life there, they imagine going to work in Detroit.

Kwame cared passionately about his country, and worked hard on development, on improving the quality of life for his countrymen, and he needed infrastructure to do so, and I had to explain to him that we had it: We had a big empty city. We had high-rises up to code that we left to decay, like big concrete plants that just needed to be watered.

After traveling for miles all across Ghana in two lane roads shared by all manor of motor vehicles, I had to explain that we had streets several lanes wide *in either direction. *Streets too big to plow, that maintaining this infrastructure-without-purpose was too expensive for the city, and that we had the infrastructure, but we needed the density. We had all his infrastructure that nobody wanted to use.
> Why don’t they want to use it?

And then I had to look a man in the eye. A man I had bonded with since he had hosted me in his country for 2 weeks. A man that I was currently depending on, as an infant depends on its mother before it knows how to survive on its own. I had to tell him that where I come from, we abandoned the infrastructure his country needed, because we are scared of what’s different, and because there were too many people like him; there were too many black people downtown.

## Xenophobia

I have this trick I use to determine when racism, or at least malignant objectification, is taking place. Both of my parents are divorced, and I have a few friends whose parents have been separated since they were young. Whenever I hear a comment that I am unsure of, I imagine that my step mother or father belongs to the ethnic group/sexual orientation in question (black, homosexual, arabic, etc)

Its an effective sniff test, particularly because frequently there is an underlying tone that is easier to detect when the comment was made about a family member.

Its also effective because it provides a built in plan of action. Frequently I will silently display my displeasure, but sometimes I will bluff.
> My stepmom’s black.

I’m not trying to downplay the nuances that have led to Detroit’s bankruptcy. There is of course the corruption, and the prominence of the automobile and the effect it has had on public transportation systems in Detroit. I’m aware of the size (you can fit Boston, San Francisco, and Manhattan within the city limits). I’m aware of the [stage 2 dutch disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease),the drunken innovative-obesity that comes with eating too much lobster and drinking too much champagne.

But I’m also not trying to ignore the racial issues that face Detroit. [Detroit is the most segregated city in America](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-segregated-cities-census-maps-2013-4#detroit-mich--the-most-segregated-city-in-america-detroits-inner-city-is-almost-exclusively-black-except-for-a-small-hispanic-corner-in-the-southwest-called-mexicantown-the-suburbs-like-grosse-pointe-dearborn-and-ferndale-are-heavily-white-21). Unlike my anthropological conversations that took place in Ghana, the most frequent discussion of race I encounter around Detroit *is touchy*, and unfortunately is usually is along the lines of:
> [cautious look around] Oh, don’t purchase property there — it’s getting awfully dark…

And here’s some more knowledge-bombs; of course Detroit is hemorrhaging young intelligent creatives at a giddy-up clip. Young, innovative, creative people of any color are sick of hearing comments like that, and they want to raise diverse, creative, inclusive, compassionate children in a diverse, creative, inclusive and compassionate environment.

The truth is, comments like these are only one symptom of a much larger problem. Xenophobia isn’t limited only to racial issues. How can a city desperately in need of a change innovate, when a fear of what’s different is precisely what plagues it?

## The good news is…

The impossible is happening.Young people are moving from the ever-reaching suburbs to the urban core. There will continue to be tensions, as Detroit continues to turn around. Gentrification is going to be a real issue — something that will need to be openly talked about.

But I think we are finally ready to start having those conversations.

**Edit for November 9th, 2016:** *Or not.*

# Internal Vs. External Motivation&#58; How To Build An Exercise Routine You’ll Stick To

## On my running routes, there are a few folks — the regulars — I can always count on seeing. We don’t know each other, but we wave and say “hi.” I like to add, “Enjoy the run!” for good measure. “Thanks, I always do!” is a typical reply.

I was talking to a friend about exercise recently and how it can be so hard to get yourself into any kind of rhythm that fits into [a productive routine](http://riskology.co/habit-ladder/). You want to take care of your body and feel your best, but it’s damn hard to make the time in your busy life. Or you try a few routines and you just don’t like them; they don’t work for you.

That reminded me of those daily micro-exchanges:

“Enjoy the run!”
“I l always do!”

That’s not *just* a formality. We really do enjoy running. And the reason we enjoy it is highly dependent on where our motivation to run comes from.

If you’ve ever struggled to stick to a fitness plan — or any plan, really — the solution could be as simple as channeling your motivation from the right source. Here’s how to do it.

## Internal Vs. External Motivation

Talk to someone who works with drug rehab patients, and you’ll hear the same wisdom shared over and over: “Success depends on your motivations.” They can instantly tell if their patient will get clean and stay that way. Everyone who overcomes a drug addiction is motivated, but the ones who succeed long-term are the ones who are motivated for the *right* reasons.

And what are the right reasons? The research shows rehab success lasts when the patient is motivated to make himself better… *for* himself. Some people go to rehab because they’re afraid they’ll lose their job, their house, or their family. These patients might get clean, but it rarely lasts. Others go to rehab because they fear they’ll lose *themselves*. These are the people who turn their lives around for good. [1]

That example illustrates the difference between internal and external motivation. When you’re externally motivated to make a change, the things that drive that change are outside of you and your control. For an addict in rehab, it could be the loss of a relationship, a job, or something else. For you, trying to get in shape, it could be keeping your partner attracted to you, finding a mate, or impressing friends and colleagues.

All the data say if these are the reasons you do what you do, it probably won’t last. External factors change, you can’t control them, and trying to keep up with them proves useless over time.

But when you’re internally motivated, you’re driven by a desire to make yourself better. You’re only accountable to you, and that means you control the variables that decide whether you succeed or fail. When those factors are stacked in your favor, the odds say you’ll make lasting change.

![](0*lBSmsCFKs0qAhAA9.jpg)

The most interesting part (perhaps most frustrating for some) is all the outcomes you hope for from your external motivations are often better and longer-lasting when you ignore them in favor of finding the internal ones that drive you.

## How To Become Internally Motivated And Build An Exercise Routine That Lasts

Let’s face it. We’re all externally motivated to some degree. But if you struggle to build an exercise routine that will become a part of your life and produce the lasting results you hope for, the trick is in tilting the scale just a little — finding the internal motivations that will produce those external results.

Here are a few things you can try that have worked well for me and millions of others who enjoy the benefits of regular exercise:

**Focus on strength, agility, and endurance instead of appearance.** Everyone wants to look great, but the only reason to look great is to have others look at you. Instead of making your looks your prime motivator, focus on increasing your strength, becoming more agile, and building more stamina. These are [the things you control](http://riskology.co/new-years-resolutions/) and, as you improve, the looks will come.

**Only do exercise you enjoy.** Don’t feel pressured to do any specific routine just because you think it will produce results faster. Any gains you do get will be lost when you give up because you don’t like it. If you like running, then do a lot of running. If you hate lifting weights, don’t lift any weights.

**When you try something new, don’t give up for at least 30 days.** When I started running, I didn’t like it that much, to be honest. I was overweight, out of shape, and not very good at it. But I wanted to give it a fair trial, so I stuck with it for a few months. Nearly 1,000 runs later, it’s one of my favorite activities. Don’t give up on something because you’re not good at it. Your skill will improve with time, and you’re more likely to enjoy the things you’re good at.

**Focus on consistency, not results.** You have more control over how often you do something than the results you get from doing it. And great results come from great consistency, not the other way around.

These are the primary factors in building an exercise routine that is a natural part of your life instead of one you struggle to implement over and over. When you let your internal motivations guide you, the results you get won’t just be better, they’ll be more fulfilling.

# Resistance is your enemy

## Resistance is your enemy

### Inspired by the book: “The war of Art”

If you are like me, there is a difference between the image of yourself in your greatest moments of inspiration and the actual person that carries your daily life.

There have been a lot times where you have thought about fulfilling your dreams and do the things you always say you want to do.

But you have an enemy that has beaten you most of the times and either you don’t know it or you have used your mind to justify your excuses.

If you really want to achieve what you want and express it in your life, you have to fight back.

I can feel the fear you have just by thinking you could actually become the best version of you, but there is no other way of getting there: Stop planning things for tomorrow, next week or next year and start doing something about it right now.

Will you dare to take action? Or will you die with fear and regrets?

# Meditating Under Duress — How to Overcome Any Pain and Use Mindfulness to Become a Total Badass

## Meditating Under Duress — How to Overcome Any Pain and Use Mindfulness to Become a Total Badass

I’ve become a big fan of meditating under duress. I used to be focused on meditation as the pursuit of some perfect spiritual experience. Was I sitting properly? Were my hands in the right position? Was I surrounded by beauty?

That’s all nice. But let me give you some alternative, ugly situations to meditate in.

I’m talking about how meditating your way through a cold shower can turn you into some sort of Navy SEAL style warrior who is impervious to pain.

Let me start with some of the recent science.

## The Science of Meditating Through Pain

Pain and the perception of pain are two different things.

In 2010 and 2011, researchers at Wake Forest started releasing studies taken of participants under MRI while practicing mindfulness meditation. Half of the participants were also being subjected to pain (I love science!).

What they found was perception of pain dropped by 40% for people who they had trained to meditate through the experience.

Meditation in this case was your standard mindfulness meditation “in which the pupil is taught to focus on a sense, often his or her breath, while accepting transient thoughts.”
> “Meditation teaches patients how to react to the pain. People are less inclined to have the ‘Ouch’ reaction, then they are able to control the emotional reaction to pain.” The meditator learns while sitting on the cushion that pain is fleeting and doesn’t deserve such a strong emotional reaction. — The Atlantic, [Treating Chronic Pain With Meditation](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/04/treating-chronic-pain-with-meditation/284182/)

What’s especially cool (to me) is that the researchers were able to measure this thanks to the MRI. There was a large reduction in brain activity in the pain processing centers. So, this meditation advice is scientific, not wu wu.

So, clearly, the while the infliction of pain was held constant, the participants, could control the perception of that pain.

## Practice With Cold Showers

There’s a simple way to practice this type of meditation under duress that won’t cause you any physical harm. Take a cold shower.

Cold showers have a legion of hard core fans who swear by the health benefits: increased alertness, reduced depression, better hair, faster recovery. I’m skipping over all that and just offering this to you as a way to practice being tough.

Let me give you a meditative way to take a cold shower. This is a variation on the Awareness-Focus Loop that I talked about in [Overcoming Procrastination](https://betterhumans.coach.me/this-meditation-exercise-builds-mental-muscle-and-cures-procrastination-2f15faade9f3#.tgpjyxw8j).

The key with focusing on the Awareness and Focus aspects of mindfulness meditation is to bring thoughts and feelings into your pre-frontal cortex where you can deal with them in a matter of fact way.

And in my version of this meditation, the way you convert a sensation from an emotional feeling into a rational concept is by using your language center.

Express the sensation as a fully formed sentence that starts with “I am aware…”

Here’s the start of the meditation:

1. Just put your foot under the cold shower.

1. Start meditating by deep breathing.

1. Instead of focusing on your breath, focus on your foot.

1. Notice every sensation your foot is feeling. With each sensation, articulate that sensation as a full sentence. Your first sentence might be, “I am aware that there is cold water on my foot.”

1. Some other things you might notice are: “I am aware that my foot is cold” often followed by “I am aware that my foot feels warm” ([here’s an article on this experience of temperature desensitization](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cold-or-warm-can-we-really-tell/)).

That’s the start. You’ve successfully reduced the emotional component of cold water on your foot.

To continue your cold shower, repeat the steps above with more and more of your body in the shower. First your leg, then your belly, then your chest, then your face, then the back of the neck.

By the end of the cold shower you will have experienced all of the negative sensations without any of the negative perceptions. You’ve eliminated the fear and whining that a normal person would associate with a cold shower.

## Disassociation vs. Association

The shower exercise is an association exercise. Rather than ignore the pain, you embrace it and put all your focus on it.

Here’s another area of your life where you’ve probably experienced this: exercise.

Do you jog with your headphones on? That’s a disassociation exercise. The music keeps your attention on something other than the pain.

But there’s a secret that serious runners know (and I’ve experienced this). It’s better to keep your focus on the sensations.

In the heat of a race, your quads start burning, you might experience the twinge that precedes a cramp, and your body starts screaming at you to get more oxygen.

This is where the “I am aware” exercise lets you manage the emotional component of that pain and make coldly rational decisions about how to ration your remaining energy.
> “I am aware that my left quad is burning but that the muscles are also still working. Therefore I will keep running fast.”

Competitive runners don’t feel less pain than you — they feel much more. It just doesn’t bother them.

Also, and this is important, they aren’t white knuckling their way through the pain in the way that you expect. At the end of a race, competitive runners are actually more calm than you are ten minutes into a twenty minute treadmill session. I’d describe it more as an focus rather than a struggle. For example, here’s the face of the recent Olympic 1500m winner as he crossed the finish line:

![[image source](http://www.nbcolympics.com/sites/default/files/field_image/20August2016/centro_rio-olympics-athletic_webf-1.jpg)](1*NDt07m80-IFX3xacXAHzFA.png)*[image source](http://www.nbcolympics.com/sites/default/files/field_image/20August2016/centro_rio-olympics-athletic_webf-1.jpg)*

Centrowitz, above, is experiencing more oxygen debt and lactic acid build up than any of us have ever imagined. But those things don’t worry him the way they worry most people.

Consider that the next time you’re on the treadmill or exercise bike. What are you actually feeling and is the pain really that bad? I’ll wrap up with a quote from my favorite fictional runner, [Quentin Cassidy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NLKSRU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1):
> “Cassidy always felt that those who partook of the difficult pleasures of the highly competitive runner only when comfortable, when in a state of high energy, when rested, elated, or untroubled by previous exertions, such dilettantes missed the point.”

The point? The point is to use meditation to prove to yourself how much you are capable of achieving.

# Multitasking? 3 pieces of advice for single-tasking

## If, while you are reading this article, you have several tabs open in your browser, you started Facebook, or you are thinking to send an email or to call someone, then you should continue reading!

Most of the times, the business environment leads to super-competencies of employees which should switch from meetings to preparing a report or answering an email. Technology made everything more difficult. If before of app or smartphones, we talked about multitasking only related to our work on the computer, today we find people walking on the street or at the subway checking their phone, without looking. Moreover, it’s not unusual to see families at a Sunday lunch together, that don’t speak to each other, but have a common object: their smartphone.

Multitasking comes from IT, where computers do concurrent tasks. Multitasking in IT doesn’t mean that the processes are made simultaneous, but rather they share common resources. The term was transferred to human activity, and as in the computers case, people switch from one task to another (interrupting the focus on a particular task).

In one of the multiple tests for verifying the impact of multitasking, 4 employees (2 experts in multitasking and 2 experts on single-tasking), were tested on solving a puzzle. The two experts in multitasking, were allowed to answer the phone, to write messages or email while solving the puzzle. From the others that where focused on single-tasking, one of them was interrupted by the noise of the notification on his mobile phone, while the other totally ignored these notifications.

The results of the test: the fastest one was the employee who focused while ignoring notifications. The next two place were the multitasking experts, while surprisingly, the last place was the single-tasking expert who was interrupted by the notification, although he was solving the puzzle.

***Being focused on a task, but with devices near that distract you is even worse than checking the notification.***

New research in the multitasking field showed negative effects both on the brain and career. Researchers from Stanford University discovered that those that receive multiple information on different devices, can’t focus, control their memory or switch from a task to another as easily as those working on a single task. More about the study [here.](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/august24/multitask-research-study-082409.html)

Single-tasking (or focusing on a single task) can mean that our entire attention is on that particular activity. This could have multiple benefits: efficiency, time reduction and better understanding of the problem that we are trying to solve.

If you are a person that want to practice more single-tasking, here are 3 steps that you could use:

1. **Define clearly what you want to do: **working on a report, presentation or writing an article.

1. **Set the interval needed to finish the work.**

1. **Eliminate any interruption: **if you need to participate in a meeting, you can silent you phone and social networks could wait. Tell your colleagues that you need to finish a task and start working. You can use a timer to check you status, mainly for future tasks & analysis. You should work in session, by using Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of focus on the task with 5 minutes of break) or Robin Sharma’s 60/10 rule: 60 minutes of work with 10 minutes of break.

# Toastmasters as Practice for Life

## I tanked on-stage, but I didn’t die

I forgot the punchline to my own joke. I froze.

My head felt flush and hot. I looked around the room. Everyone expected me to finish the joke, but I knew it wasn’t coming. They looked uncomfortable too, watching someone tank onstage is not easy.

I had to bail.

“I actually forgot the punchline, but I can assure you, it’s very funny.” Some light chuckles and applause followed then I took my seat.

I sat down, my heart still pounding, but I was still alive. The room was spinning.
> # *What just happened?*

![Photo by [Marcos Luiz](http://unsplash.com/photos/W15cfW4qQR8?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*USuigdJw9G3nMP_NJrWnJQ.jpeg)*Photo by [Marcos Luiz](http://unsplash.com/photos/W15cfW4qQR8?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

This was the scene of a Toastmasters meeting where I’m a member. I joined Toastmasters originally following a botched job interview where froze up for what seemed like minutes. I vowed to never feel that awful again.

I joined in 2013 and have given dozens of prepared speeches and hundreds of impromptu speeches at this point. I’ve even been vice president of education and club president at various points.

One of the first orders of business at our club is for someone to stand up and tell a joke to start the meeting off with some levity. I had done this many times before with a printed out joke or notes from my phone. But today, we didn’t have anyone volunteer so I, in a desire to make myself uncomfortable, rose my hand and quickly called a recent joke I heard to the forefront of my memory.

The joke started out well, but as I neared the middle, I could tell I wasn’t sure what came at the end. Even though the joke bombed and I felt ridiculous, the meeting proceeded like normal. That’s the beauty of Toastmasters.

## Toastmasters as Practice for Life

I have been a member for years and am relatively comfortable taking the stage and giving a speech. I still get the slight feeling of nervousness, but it subsides as I hit my stride during the speech.

The prevailing attitude of Toastmasters is that everyone is learning and this is where we practice. There is no judgment, only encouragement. Yes, there are opportunities to receive helpful speaking feedback, but it is never disparaging.

I remember wanting to get better at public speaking and picking up an audiobook by Dale Carnegie. The book had useful information, but one of the key takeaways was that you had to practice. How would I get practice done by taking in more information?
> # I needed a “gym” for public speaking.

After some brief searching, I found a Toastmasters club just 2 miles from my house that met every Wednesday. I contacted the president who warmly welcomed me to the next meeting. I had found my gym.

## Getting Used to Failure

Toastmasters offers dozens of opportunities every week for speaking. Our club structures its meetings into two halves, roughly: prepared speeches and impromptu speeches or as Toastmasters calls them, Table Topics.

The first half of the meeting is filled with 1–3 prepared speeches, 5–7 minutes in length, where people may have been writing and practicing for days or weeks in preparation.

The second half is filled with a host who invites each member up to speak on a topic they *just heard moments before *for 1–2 minutes. This can be hilariously difficult.

There are tons of tactics for navigating a tough table topic, which I won’t cover here, but the takeaway is that if you go every week and never give a prepared speech, you will have had 50 chances to speak off-the-cuff on a random topic.

Do you know what else is like table topics?

![Photo via [Pexels](http://www.pexels.com)](1*4_aEIqKHhYy0FF3b2RuB6g.jpeg)*Photo via [Pexels](http://www.pexels.com)*

1. Job interviews,

1. team meetings,

1. 1:1 conversations,

1. getting called on in a discussion section,

1. being asked to give a toast or a blessing, and many more.

**Repeated exposure to impromptu speaking lets you slow everything down.**

![Photo via [Pexels](http://www.pexels.com)](1*ryf--bVVAXmg723DzbCuAA.jpeg)*Photo via [Pexels](http://www.pexels.com)*

The panic feeling quiets down after a few repetitions because you learn that you are not about to die or be horribly embarrassed. Quieting that internal noise gives you room to think and form your first few thoughts.

And if you have nothing interesting to say and you sit down without fulfilling the 1–2 minutes, at least you stood up and gave it a shot. That, in itself, is an accomplishment.

## My Failed Joke

I had gotten so comfortable giving speeches and speaking off-the-cuff that I had now challenged myself to try and do more with less preparation. I set a goal that I would give an old speech again when we had a gap in the schedule. I did that and felt relatively comfortable.

My other goal was to fill in for more club roles when there was a need. I raised my hand for the joke role and didn’t do so well. But nobody seemed to care. Toastmasters is great because we are all encouraged to try and that’s all anyone asks of you.
> # *If you are harangued for trying, you are less likely to try again.*

But if you can get a significant amount of reps completed, you will realize that even in the real world, there are not huge repercussions for trying and failing. With the increased preparation, you are much less likely to fail than those that do not practice.

## Real Skills

Speaking publicly is one of those skills that is highly valued, sorely needed but not emphasized in any traditional learning tracks. [Seth Godin](https://twitter.com/ThisIsSethsBlog) wrote a [great article redefining soft skills as real skills](https://itsyourturnblog.com/lets-stop-calling-them-soft-skills-9cc27ec09ecb), including public speaking. His larger point was that we have so many “vocational” skills that are necessary and easy to teach and measure, and yet so many more “real” skills that are hard to look in potential hires and even harder to train into existing employees, like empathy, collaboration & public speaking.

I know that I will be actively trying to improve my public speaking and helping my kids learn how to do the same.

## My Success Since Joining Toastmasters

I can attribute much of my professional success to getting involved at Toastmasters.

### #1 Spontaneously & successfully presented to top-level executives

### #2 Got a new job with a 12.5% pay increase by nailing an interview

### #3 Expanded my role at work through a solid presentation to clients

There are endless examples of meetings and teams that I’ve participated in where I no longer feel that deep sense of dread about speaking up. I feel like I’ve been practicing for these moments by attending Toastmasters.

If I can handle tanking a joke to a crowded roomful of people, I can handle anything.

# Your past has passed. Now let’s get past that.

## Our past has NO impact on us unless we give it new life each morning. — Steve Chandler

![Photo is me overlooking the city of Taipei during a typhoon on the 89th floor of Taipei 101. Photo Credit: Nathan Sudds](1*rWJy1-Q4VZ_JuWzoxhXDIQ.jpeg)*Photo is me overlooking the city of Taipei during a typhoon on the 89th floor of Taipei 101. Photo Credit: Nathan Sudds*

Sometimes when I get an idea, even before it gets a chance to go through a gestation period, it gets aborted. Not because it’s bad or irrational or even infeasible, but just because it’s my idea. And historically speaking, *my* ideas have a tendency to start out with a spark of excitement and then quietly peter out. Like the time I had this *burst of inspiration* to write a book based on business principles I learned from watching Gordon Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares.

Every time I’d watch an episode, I couldn’t help but marvel at how much advice about cooking and managing a kitchen hit so close to home for us managing a small business. I extracted so much wisdom and solid principles from the show that I got inspired to reach out to Gordon Ramsay’s PR team and recommend that he turn these ideas into a book on business. Over the years, I had seen him release a slew of books tied to his culinary skills, but it seemed quite obvious that his expertise went much further than that.

At the time, my thoughts were, if a man at the age of 47 already owns 30+ restaurants is currently featured on 6 prime time shows and has a 69% stake in an empire valued at £67 million — you gotta think he knows a thing or two about business — right? Anyways, *I thought it was a great idea*, unfortunately I guess **they did not** because I never heard back from them. Oh well, I was already onto my next thought — ‘Why don’t I just do it myself?’. And, do you know I spent an *entire summer*? That’s right — watching and documenting ***every*** episode of that show. I drafted an outline, even had a working title — I put together creative little sections, highlighted quotes from every single episode, but then… NOTHING.

Somewhere along the way, I gave up on it.

### Giving up became a part of my story

In my eyes, I had a history of giving up. I quit jobs, left university before graduating and years later even gave up the opportunity to get a post-graduate certificate in publishing (without even having a degree) to start a magazine that eventually ended. Even when it came to things I was really passionate about like writing…I would leave that unfinished too. I started a blog, then neglected the blog (yep, the one you’re currently reading :)). I also have half a dozen incomplete book ideas, unpublished articles, half designed websites etc. So in the face of all this seemingly impenetrable evidence, I deemed myself a starter, *not a finisher.*

But, I digress, back to the book. Months passed, it was the end of the summer and I was already having some serious doubts. I thought “*Maybe too much time has passed and no one would be interested*”. At that time, I had written about the UK episodes (my personal favourites) and Gordon had already moved on to the series’ US version. (which in my opinion was way too Hollywood-ized and dramatic, but, that’s another story).

The point is, after investing a whole summer researching and writing… **I…gave…up…AGAIN**. (Not to mention the trees that gave up their lives on all the copies I printed and reprinted)

Just more proof to confirm my story — right?

The crazy thing is on the flip-side of this, there were *many things** I had finished***. I would venture to guess, even way more than I left unfinished. (After all, I was still running my own business after 10+ years.)

Sure, maybe back then, I had put that other project on the backburner, ***but that was the past***. And you don’t have to get over the past to start again. In my case, all I really had to do was pick up a pen. And alright, yes, [Inner Critic](http://changefear.com/shut-your-inner-critic-up-once-and-for-all/), maybe I did choose to end the magazine. But the truth is, in the beginning I didn’t start it because it was solely my passion, I did it to fill a need. And for a time it did that. Now, I’m filling other needs and there’s clearly ***always more needs to fill***.

### Our past is just that…passed.

Past means, ‘*left behind*’, ‘*came to an end’, ‘elapsed*’. **That means it has no life until we *choose to revive it*..**

Why are we still reliving that past? It has passed! The past doesn’t have an impact on the outcome, only our thinking does. Especially our thinking about our past — that story, **doesn’t have to be our story now**.

Knowing this, why not choose to remember the flip side of the story? The positive not just the negative. Let’s give **THAT** new life each morning instead.

# Like Magic

## I’m wrapping up some open-ended office hours where I invited people to connect with me about anything they have been struggling with, and it’s been a joy and an inspiration. People cried. Okay, I cried. Maybe we cried, but I’m not saying.

I’m filled with awe, and inspiration, and all these soft, pillowy, somewhat messy, complicated, and downright mushy sorts of feeling. Every one of these was an amazing discussion. I couldn’t put them into words if I wanted to. As usual, as happens so often when I feel inspired, I get mega curious.

There was lots of talk about curiosity, being curious, asking questions, trying to parse out what is important. What is important? It’s so gobsmacking simple. It’s a question in search of a signal among noise. Our lives are filled with noise. So much noise. So much distraction. So many unnecessary, awkward, and downright rude expectations. Annoying red bubbles, unread emails, broken promises, letters unsent, conversations avoided, bills piled up, et cetera, et cetera.

And yet, when we listen, if we are focused on it, SO MUCH SIGNAL, there, just waiting to be found. Once we notice it, we wonder how did we ever not realize it was there? It feels like magic. We see a newness in all things. The world is the same, but we are what has changed.

We expect all these people surrounding us, with lives, and personalities, and interests to fit in neat and tidy self-contained boxes, and yet we’re all just out here crashing into one another in our own shiny little blue glitter bumper car, sparks showering from above. I don’t fit in a box, so how can I expect you to? Right? Talk about rude. Putting my expectations onto your reality, because your reality doesn’t fit my expectations. And likewise! LOL, am I right?

I had already been wondering, but now I’m really wondering, deeply considering, and exasperatingly curious. Exasperating curiosity is a specialty of mine. You’re welcome. So,…

What is personal development? What does it mean to develop, personally? What does it mean to be a better person, a better human being?

It can mean more. More kind, more loving, more gentle, more honest, more genuine, more open and curious.

It can mean less. Less anger, less hostility, less judgment. Or literally; less noise, less distraction, less superficiality, less posturing, less presentation.

And really, that’s about it. We make these stories about I am this, or she is that, or we are blah blah. This is that way, and that is this way, yadda yadda yadda. I say whatever to your story. Save it. Either we want it to be different, or we don’t. Simple. So simple. Alarmingly simple. So terrifying. So much responsibility. Do it. Or don’t. Your choice. Your responsibility. End of story.

If we want it to be what it is, awesome! We can stop worrying about it. Worrying is crazy making. Just don’t. Absolutely make a plan, but good enough is good enough. You can’t predict everything. Stop trying to predict every thing. Do it for yourself. Do it for me. If you’re not gonna do it because it doesn’t feel right or you don’t want to and you don’t have to, seriously, let it go. It’s good for you. You’ll feel better. I promise. Not all relationships are meant to work out, and not all projects are meant to be finished. Sometimes the benefit is in the process of exploring, in being curious about and exploring this person or idea. That’s okay. It is what it is, and it doesn’t have to be anything else.

But if we DO want it to be different, the only thing we can really control is us, our values, and our choices. We are free to make all sorts of decisions, and we are obligated to live out the results of those choices. That’s okay, it’s part of the game. Make wise choices, minimize risk and all that.

You can make any choice you want. You can choose to die for those choices. Many of us here don’t have to worry about that. Maybe some of us do. But definitely, “out there,” people choose to live lives true to themselves, risking life and limb in the process, and we are just over here being like, “Oh, this shirt makes me feel downright frumpy.” Yeah, I said frumpy.

Burn the shirt. If it makes you unhappy in such a completely unnecessary way, why are you wasting your short precious life hating it? You don’t have time for that, because in case you forgot, you are going to die someday, and right now, your life and limb are not at risk. It is coming, but it ain’t here yet, and hopefully it is a long ways away. So right now, it is just you, and your ego getting in the way. Your ego is what worries about all these things that don’t really, truly, deeply matter. Your ego is the only thing standing between you, and the life of your dreams. And it’s the biggest baddest monster you’ve ever been. You created it. You are it. It lives inside of you.

Of course, we know that it is a lot easier to replace a bad habit than it is to get rid of it altogether. By extension, it is easier to stop asking ourselves dumb questions that don’t mean anything if we replace them with better questions. We ask questions, because we search for meaning. If there’s nothing meaningful in the answers, maybe its the wrong question.

What’s next? That’s always going to lead us a bit beyond where we already are. It’s a promotion, and a pay raise. More responsibility, bigger projects, better office, because now, for legal reasons, you need an office with a door. If you want that, great! Go for it! I love that you want that, so get it. If you’re happy with what you’ve got, and you want a whole mess more of it, have at it. Power to ya.

But if you don’t, then what? Terrifying, right? What do I want? That’s like, you know, a commitment. To me. To myself. Commitments are scary. I talk about them. To people. I build a life around them, around important things. I can’t back out at my earliest whim of fearfulness. There’s a stake in the ground, a line in the sand. I am putting my pride, ego, and social validation on the line, and it is totally risky. And besides, I’m not worthy of commitment. Because, like, you know, uh, I don’t have this stuff, like, figured out. I’m learning, like, because you know, I’m, like, a human and things. Maybe you’re sweating just thinking about it.

Okay, cool story bro. You can have that story, but only if you really want it, and I don’t think that you do. I get it; it feels safe. But it isn’t. It is a deception. You are deceiving yourself. And it’s safe until it isn’t. We can keep that story up precisely as long the work to keep it going is less work than it is to not have to worry about keeping it going anymore. Confusing, right? No wonder we can’t figure it out. We can only deceive until being deceptive is more work than not, until lying is more work than not. If we dig that hole deep enough, it becomes a grave.

Fun fact: I believe in burning bridges that lead back to places I never want to go again. Leaving mediocrity? Awesome. Never going back? Burn baby burn. Let me know, and I’ll bring some gasoline.

So you’re dissatisfied with “what’s next.” Congratulations! Try asking a different question. Instead of wondering what’s next, how do I get more of the same, ask what is it that you want to take a shot at now? What’s something you’ve always wanted to try? What do you want to do, right here, right now? What are you excited about? Get curious. Explore. We can do that thing, whatever it is, but we have to be able to hear the signal. We have to listen for what stands out, what’s important. So, what is important?

I’m not saying drop everything you’ve got spinning in the air right now. I’m saying try being curious, try asking different questions, and seeing which answers you feel most satisfied with. Experiment. Test. If there is no satisfying answer, the problem is the question. I know that sounds so simple, and you might even feel silly if you never thought about it, but seriously, don’t. I’ve lived all this crazy so you don’t have to. That’s my goal here. Stop making yourself crazy. Start being kind. They’re mutually exclusive, and that’s exactly what you need right now. I promise. You will never regret being kind.

It’s tough, tricky, sticky, endlessly crazy making, snarled, and complicated looking stuff, all this ridiculous stuff bound up together in a giant tangly mess of whatever this is we call life. Le sigh. But if we look for the signal, if we can figure out what is important, eventually, all that noise isn’t going to matter. It won’t be that it goes away. The noise is always going to be there. It’s just that, when we are really tuned in, turned on, lit up, focused, and on fire, all that other stuff just doesn’t matter. It falls away, all on its own, and the signal comes in loud and clear, with no further work from us. Like magic.

# What you can learn from 2 years of Coach.me habit tracking + Machine Learning

## 790 days… I don’t think I’ve committed to anything that long in my life!

I’ve been really excited to write this article for a while now. It’s been a fun project to analyze and apply some creative machine learning to my favorite app’s data that I’ve been collecting for over 2 years now.

[**Coach.me](http://coach.me)**, for those who are unaware, is the best habit/goal tracking app that exists out there. From their amazing UX to their fun little hi-fives, this app really does awesome stuff. Formerly called *Lift*, this app pivoted (rather skillfully) into the profitable market that is personal coaching, and thus the new name.

![Source: [http://www.flippingheck.com/review-coach-me-personal-coaching/](http://www.flippingheck.com/review-coach-me-personal-coaching/)](1*FZZQyz-UTDEUB9U8C0zMGg.png)*Source: [http://www.flippingheck.com/review-coach-me-personal-coaching/](http://www.flippingheck.com/review-coach-me-personal-coaching/)*

I could talk forever about this app, but this isn’t just another app review blog, so I will keep it short:

1. You initially set your goals/habits that you want to track.

1. Every day you get a clean slate and you check-in the goals you successfully accomplished.

1. Constantly check out your habit progress with their check-in/streak stats and long-term calendar view.

Below are my goals that I currently track. I have tweaked with them a bit, but mostly these are the same ones I started with:

![](1*oUCinkba7bvHJ92QN5CCdQ.png)

![](1*162oyAB6jaQmpGmyOPAxeQ.png)

![](1*21QBhTWoMfJ5DBMZQHg-dg.png)

![The 30 habits I track on a daily basis](1*lwZ75K84Mrno_6zDFfMX2g.png)*The 30 habits I track on a daily basis*

Now a disclaimer on this data is that it really is not perfect. Occasionally I have missed recording my progress, and a few of these goals were started more recently than others, skewing the frequency statistic towards habits I’ve been tracking longer.

Side-notes to explain some goals I track: Feedly is a productive news-reading app. Also I track the days I drank instead of the days I didn’t drink. Kind of reverse what most people would call a goal, but I started this as a sophomore in college, so an underage mind thought it would be funny to track drinking instead. I’m not trying to become an alcoholic I promise.

Now the goal setting and habit tracking is all well and good, but after 790 days of using this app, I wanted to get something useful from all this data. Which brings me to machine learning. I’m currently going to be a software engineer at Microsoft starting in November, and I’ve dabbled in the ML field a few times on [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/), so I had an idea that what I wanted was

## **Association Analysis.**

The most historic example of association analysis is:

![This man looks just like “Good Guy Greg” Source: [http://max.magaret.com/?p=10](http://max.magaret.com/?p=10)](1*M8k9afLqhyErlPoMAeXlDw.jpeg)*This man looks just like “Good Guy Greg” Source: [http://max.magaret.com/?p=10](http://max.magaret.com/?p=10)*

**Diapers -&gt; Beer.**

The trend of grocery store purchases noticed that men often bought diapers and beer together. This correlation is reasonably unexpected, but apparently the father demographic craved a few drinks whenever they were required to buy the diapers (I mean who wouldn’t after changing diapers?)

In simple terms, association analysis is the act of **looking for hidden relationships in large datasets. **And though it is common-place now amongst store warehouse data-scientists, this technique has not yet propagated over to the personalized, lifelogged data. That is what I did.

[Side note: Code snippets of what I wrote can be found on my [github](https://github.com/Bigbrd/LifelogDataMLAnalysis/)]

## Python.

To start the project I needed to import the data into workable sets for association analysis.

1. Exported data from Coach.me. It returned a csv file like the one below with each check-in as a row. I exported around 6k rows.

![Lots of data to work with here!](1*Xvb1zdR6_FF4FjcRgdFEnQ.png)*Lots of data to work with here!*

2. Writing the initial dataInput.py I realized there were a lot of unique ways to organize and analyze this data, so I created 4 datasets that each can be analyzed and reveal insights.

![code snippet from dataInput.py](1*svAgMK8gi6fF365uj6v_Gw.png)*code snippet from dataInput.py*

* **organizeByItem** — This reveals all relational factors between check-ins. ex: {ID:’1' : [habit, date, note, checkin count, streak, props, comments, url], etc.}

* **organizeByStreak** — This reveals streak effects on the data. ex: {ID:’1' : [streak of today, streak of yesterday], etc.}

* **organizeByDate** — This reveals habit association with other habits. *Most used* organization setup as it gave the most telling relational insights. ex: {‘date1’: [all habits on that day], ’date2': [all habits in day 2], etc.}

* **organizeByDateWithDOTW** — Same thing as previous except I added the day of the week to see if that had any effect on why habits occurred. ex: {‘date1’: [all habits on that day, monday], ’date2': [all habits in day 2, thursday], etc.}

As I mentioned earlier, not all habits started at the same time, so I also wrote a wrapper method to generate a mini dataset for each habit that trims all the data to the start date of that habit. This way I organize the data and run the algorithm on each mini dataset, and then just focus on analyzing for that specific habit for each run.

## Apriori Algorithm
> A priori *means “from before” in Latin, and the [Apriori Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm) has its foundation on making conditional inferences based on this* prior* knowledge*.

The Apriori Algorithm starts with a giant item lattice of all possible combinations.

![An example Item Lattice of all possible combinations from set {0,1,2,3}](1*ExWuynp67DTh0yV_-WqOeg.png)*An example Item Lattice of all possible combinations from set {0,1,2,3}*

In our case with Coach.me data, each item can be treated as a habit that was tracked, and then all combinations of the habits tracked would make up the entire itemset lattice.

What the Apriori algorithm does is that it traverses from the top-down, going row by row, tracking the frequency of each itemset. The advantage being that if one itemset is infrequent, all combinations using that itemset will also be infrequent.

![If itemset {23} is infrequent, all supersets using {23} will be infrequent](1*W9iuMOdu1cLbfj5PWomV7w.png)*If itemset {23} is infrequent, all supersets using {23} will be infrequent*

### Terminology Timeout

I am about to use some machine learning jargon in the next section. If you don’t need the review, feel free to skip this section.

* ***frequent item sets*** — collection of items that frequently occur together

* ***association rules** — *a strong relationship exists between two items (think diapers-&gt;beer)

* ***support **— *% of the entire dataset that contains the itemset. example:
> Out of a dataset of 10 days, 8/10 of them I did a morning workout. *The morning workout itemset support is therefore 80%.*

* ***confidence **— *applied to association rules that the antecedent predicts the consequent. It is the fraction to get the likelihood of the consequent appearing whenever the antecedent appears. It is also best explained in an example:
> pray-&gt;read bible= support(pray U read bible) / support(pray)*. If you prefer in terms of probability, the confidence is the conditional probability *P(read bible | pray)*. So for 10 days, 8 of them we prayed and 4 of those 8 days we also read the bible, our confidence would be 50%. Note: reversing them to make the converse is NOT the same thing!*

My apriori algorithm is run out of two main methods:

* **def *scanData(*data, items, minimumSupport)** — narrows the dataset to just the sets that meet the minimum required support

* **def *generateRules*(itemList, supportDataList, minimumConfidence) — **creates rules above the minimum required confidence from all available items

The minimum support and confidence are variable, but in general since my dataset is relatively small in the machine learning world (~6k lines), I usually applied a low min support to allow for a lot of itemsets, and a higher confidence as I was only interested in the more significant trends.

# Results!

![Top 10 most frequently performed habits](1*lGKG4q6nALOXn-3iaZVReA.png)*Top 10 most frequently performed habits*

So with the algorithm I generated a bunch of frequent item sets and association rules. Though correlation != causation I am simply trying to takeaway relationships within the data and perhaps draw personal conclusions. After extensively experimenting with the data, here are all my calculated results that I found significant and some *actionable advice *that I can take away from it:

1. **Monday vs Friday** — I am substantially more likely to perform my habits on a Monday than on a Friday, and in general most habits deteriorated in frequency as the week went on. Which means *I need to stick with my habit throughout the week and create more time for myself to do them later in the week.*

![Ratio of habit frequency Mondays vs Fridays](1*3sOf53-rK-5rM9Uh4FCXtg.png)*Ratio of habit frequency Mondays vs Fridays*

2. **Sports = good mood and good food — **The most substantial correlations for playing a sport were that it led to laughing, **99% **confidence, and eating vegetables, **73.5%** confidence. Not only does this show that being active was correlated with eating healthier, but it also meant that I was in a better mood, meaning that *I need to make sure I play sports to stay healthy and happy.*

3. **Streaks are tough — **Throughout this habit tracking, you are always trying to keep doing the same habit day after day. But the loss of the streak almost always happens before the end of each week. As a takeaway I will *try tracking fewer habits more seriously and creating a habit that is repeatable each day of the week.*

![Long tail…](1*ZgWKAbiZKeLq81RzajDjNg.png)*Long tail…*

4. **Independent Working, Time Management, and…Cooking? — **The fact that I rarely ever cooked (about every 1 in 5 days) made the stat that the frequency increased to **43%** whenever I worked on a personal project extremely significant. As well, **100%** of the days I worked on a personal project I managed my time, and on days I cooked I also managed my time (**91%)**, which tells me I need to *work on my own more often to start cooking and improve my time management.*

5. **How to stop watching TV — **The three most significant association

![Confidence measurement for habits that lead to less TV](1*Wh5W062rFay77lJ-3x326Q.png)*Confidence measurement for habits that lead to less TV*

rules for when I measured 2 hours or less of TV surprised me slightly as I thought I would have a more veg-out mentality when I drink, but it actually led to substantially less TV. But more importantly *play sports and manage my time more to watch less television.*

6. **Build in habits Back-to-Back — **There are a few habits that seem to make sense when you do them sequentially (like flossing and then brushing your teeth). The association rules I calculated validated this preconceived notion. Floss -&gt; Brush Teeth in the Morning (**92%**), Brush Teeth in the Morning -&gt; Wash Face (**61%**), and Morning Workout -&gt; Stretch in the Morning (**83%**). As Charles Duhigg’s habit forming [theory](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Change-ebook/dp/B006WAIV6M) is all about cues and triggers to build your habits, these association rules really can help understand what habits act as cues for other successful habits. Telling me that *if I want to do a habit, piggyback it with another habit.*

There were a significant amount of other facts and figures that I found, like the fact that whenever I managed my time or worked on getting Inbox Zero, I scheduled time to read.

My most active day was 3/4/2015 achieving 22 goals.

Sleeping 8+ hours led to my morning workout much more likely than getting less than 8 hours of sleep.

Meditating often led to writing 750 words, and both were much more common on a weekday than a weekend.

Or even just that I watch substantially more TV on Saturdays than any other day.

Throughout this analysis I also noticed a few unpredictable and useless pieces of information. There is both frequency noise and infrequency noise.

* For frequently performed habits, they often were noisy in their disproportionally presence in most association rules, forcing me to trim them out if they were not significantly more present than in other habits.

* For infrequently performed habits, they often had overly high confidence with a substantial amount of common habits, forcing me again to trim the common habits to find more unique and substantial habit relationships.

## What now?

As an avid user of this app, I’ve (*rudimentarily*) designed what would be an awesome addition to coach.me, called **Goal Analytics:**

![Design Idea *cough*job application*cough* for Coach.Me: a new Analytics section for each habit/goal.](1*OAVpbA4aHzmMjU24Hz1ADQ.png)*Design Idea *cough*job application*cough* for Coach.Me: a new Analytics section for each habit/goal.*

This add-on would go in the tab bar of each goal and provide the kind of data association analysis that could really drive users to a deeper relationship with their goal tracking. The analytics could be computed and presented for free for up to 5 goals and then the user would have to pay a premium to see analytics for all of their goals.

As well, the publicly shared data from each coach.me user who tracks the same goal can be aggregated and analyzed for a **global comparison **to how you are doing on the goal compared to others like you!

# This is How to Set Effective Goals&#58; The 3 Essential Elements

## Have you ever felt like you’re adrift in the world? Like you work hard but still don’t seem to get anywhere?

If so, one likely reason is that you haven’t taken enough time to consider what you want from your life, and turned these wishes into goals.

When done properly goal setting can be a powerful process for thinking about your ideal future and turning this vision into reality.

Goal setting helps you choose where you want to go in life. And when you know exactly what you want, you can concentrate your efforts.

Instead of drifting around, you can start to [say no to distractions](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-have-more-time/) and take massive action on what is truly important to you.

Let’s explore how to create effective goals. Specifically, let’s look at the three essential elements of successful goals: The ‘What’, The ‘Why’, and The ‘How’.

### Essential Element #1: The ‘What’

Most people have an idea of what they want to achieve, but more often than not, it’s painfully vague. ‘I want to lose weight’ is not a goal — it’s a wish.

To qualify as a goal, a statement needs to meet certain criterias. It needs to answer EXACTLY what it is you’re going to do.

And the best way to uncover this is to use an acronym there’s a good chance you’re already familiar with; S.M.A.R.T goals.

When you’ve taken your goal through the S.M.A.R.T. process, you can be sure you have the first essential element of your goal down. You’ll know exactly WHAT it is you’re going to do.

**S**pecific — State exactly what it is you want to achieve. If your goal is to lose weight, write down exactly how much you’re aiming to lose. [Clarity breeds achievement](http://www.selfication.com/the-science-of-goal-setting/).

**M**easurable — If you do not measure your progress, you’ll have no idea of how you’re doing and no way of getting the [small wins](http://www.selfication.com/the-power-of-small-wins/) necessary to build motivation and momentum. Know exactly what your goal is on a yearly, monthly, weekly basis. Whenever possible, create a minimum daily quota to aim for.

**A**ttainable — Your goal should be challenging enough to get you excited but not so hard that it causes you to consistently miss your mark. It’s usually a good idea to start small and increase the effort as you go.

**R**elevant — This is a very important criteria that a lot of people neglect. Before you set out to try to achieve your goal, ask yourself if it’s truly important to you or if you should spend your precious time elsewhere.

**T**imebound — Lastly, give your goal a specific deadline for its completion.

By considering these criterias, you’ll turn your vague intention into an actionable target.

For example, ‘I want to lose weight’ becomes ‘By December 31st, 2016, I’ll lose 22 lbs’.

Now you have a goal.

### Essential Element #2: The ‘Why’

Once you’ve decided exactly WHAT it is you’re going to do, the next step is to get very clear on WHY you’re doing it.

This is the element of your goal that will provide you with the burning motivation you need to [execute on it consistently](http://www.selfication.com/consistency/), especially when things are not going your way.

There are two ways you can uncover your Why: by considering the **pleasure** you’ll gain from achieving your goal and the **pain** you’ll have to deal with if you don’t.

To build the necessary drive to constantly take action on your goals, ask yourself:

Pleasure questions:

* If you change this now, how will your life be?

* What will you gain?

* What will it mean for the people you love?

* What will it give you?

Pain questions:

* If you don’t change this now, what will this cost you?

* What has it cost you in the past?

* What will you miss out on?

* What does it cost the people you love?

Based on your answers to these questions list out at least three massively compelling reasons for why accomplishing this goal is an absolute must for you.

Also, list out three specific awesome things that will happen if you do, as well as the three worst things that will happen if you stay on the path you’re currently on.

And don’t be afraid to use big words. Be honest with yourself about what achieving this goal will give you, as well as the pain it will cause you if you don’t.

The pain and pleasure you associate with your goal is your fuel for achieving it.

### The ‘How’

And finally, you need to have a concrete plan of action for reaching your goal. The ‘how’ will depend a lot on the type of goal you’re going after. Here are a couple of strategies that are always worth considering:

1. **Find the necessary resources and tools.** Ask yourself where your knowledge gaps are for your goal as well as what tools and equipment would be helpful for creating and sustaining it. Write down a list of stuff you need.

1. **Design your environment.** [Alter your surroundings](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-change-your-habits/) so that you’re taking action becomes easier and procrastinating becomes harder.

1. **Get accountability.** Involve others in what you’re doing. [Get a coach](http://www.selfication.com/coaching/), mentor, trainer, tutor, accountability partner or someone else to help speed up your progress and hold you accountable.

1. **Create short-term rewards and consequences.** [Set up a token economy](http://www.selfication.com/token-economy/) to celebrate your small wins and build momentum. Use [commitment devices](http://www.selfication.com/commitment-devices/) to ramp up the immediate consequences for procrastinating.

1. **Schedule it.** If your goal is truly important to you, it deserves a spot on [your daily schedule](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-start-a-new-habit/). [Carve out the time you need to make it happen](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-have-more-time/).

1. **Set up daily reminders of your why’s.** If you don’t keep your goals front of mind, you’re very likely to get caught up in everyday life and quickly forget about them. Keep your most compelling ‘Why’s’ somewhere you’ll revisit them daily. Put them on your computer desktop, your screensaver, inside the cover of your journal, or whatever else works for reinforcing your goals daily.

1. **Create a weekly review.** Use this time to [keep track of your goal](http://www.selfication.com/weekly-planning/), celebrate your progress and adjust your approach as needed.

**Enough drifting. What’s your what, why and how?**

# This is How to Overcome Perfection&#58; The Power of “The Shitty First Draft”

## This is How to Overcome Perfection: The Power of “The Shitty First Draft”

In her excellent book, Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life (1), author Anne Lamott writes:
> “(…) Shitty first drafts. All good writers write them. This is how they end up with good second drafts and terrific third drafts.
> People tend to look at successful writers who are getting their books published and maybe even doing well financially and think that they sit down at their desks every morning feeling like a million dollars, feeling great about who they are and how much talent they have and what a great story they have to tell; that they take in a few deep breaths, push back their sleeves, roll their necks a few times to get all the cricks out, and dive in, typing fully formed passages as fast as a court reporter.
> But this is just the fantasy of the uninitiated. I know some very great writers, writers you love who write beautifully and have made a great deal of money, and not one of them sits down routinely feeling wildly enthusiastic and confident. Not one of them writes elegant first drafts. (…)”

### The Power of Shitty First Drafts

I’ve found this idea of shitty first drafts very helpful in my writing. Before I started writing shitty first drafts, I’d waste tons of time and effort crafting the next sentence in my text. And when I’d finally move forward in the text, I’d often end up scrapping the sentence anyway since it didn’t fit well in the context of the paragraph.

As a result, more often that I’d like, my total word count would add up to a grand total of zero (or even -200 or so, if I felt the need to edit some words from the day before). As you can imagine, this was not a very exciting nor motivating way to work.

Allowing myself to write shitty first drafts helped me get rid of this problem. And as a result, I’m now able to write 1,000+ words every day.

### How to Overcome Perfection in All Areas of Life

I have been thinking a lot about the shitty first draft concept lately, and I’m convinced it’s not only helpful for writers.

No matter what you’re trying to achieve, you need to [consistently put in the effort to get there](http://www.selfication.com/consistency/).

You need to learn [how to just get started](http://www.selfication.com/how-not-to-procrastinate/). Again and again and again.

Because it’s only when you get out of your head and start taking action that you’ll start building the necessary momentum to reach your goal.

* Want to be more mindful? Have a shitty meditation session. Don’t worry about if you’re doing it right or if your mind is going bananas. Just sit down and focus on your breath for a few minutes.

* Want to save money? Put a shitty amount in a savings account. Even if it feels like an insignificant sum of money, make the deposit anyway.

* Want to eat healthily? Make one shitty dietary change. Forget about finding the perfect balance of carbs, fats, and proteins. Just add one vegetable to one of your meals.

* Want to have great relationships? Pick up the phone and make one shitty phone call. Forget about what’s been said or done in the past. Just make the call.

* Want to get fit? Have a shitty workout session. Forget about figuring out the perfect training program. Just go to the gym and get your reps in.

![It doesn’t have to be pretty. The important thing is that you show up and do the work.](0*Kn8VeQyJ4mgxg-8Q.png)*It doesn’t have to be pretty. The important thing is that you show up and do the work.*

You get the idea. Instead of overwhelming yourself with the high-level stuff, just do one shitty thing, and do it NOW.

The reason this idea is so powerful is that it allows you to lower your expectations so you can stop thinking and start doing. And nothing cures perfectionism like good ol’ action-taking.

### “Shitty First Drafts Lead to Terrific Third Drafts”

The real power in the shitty first draft mindset comes from executing on it consistently. That’s because when you start racking up shitty actions on a daily basis, you allow [the compound effect](http://www.selfication.com/consistency/) to get to work. And once you’ve got some serious momentum going it will be harder to stop than to keep going.

With enough repetition, your efforts will start feeling a lot less shitty. In fact, they’ll start feeling perfectly fine. In some cases, even pretty good. And when this starts happening, you’ll naturally develop the sense of [competence](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-motivate-yourself/) necessary to get really, really good at what you do.

And from this point forward, it’s only a matter of time before you reach your goal.

But always remember that it all starts with that shitty first draft. So, whenever you start feeling [overwhelmed](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-deal-with-overwhelm/), [forget about the results and focus on the process instead](http://www.selfication.com/the-tortoise-mindset/).

If your mind starts telling you that what you’re doing isn’t good enough, remember that this is the shitty first draft. It’s SUPPOSED to be bad. And know that the quality will come later, but only if you focus on the quantity first.

Now, figure out what shitty little action you could take right now and go do it. Your future self will be grateful you did.

# Your Brain Travels Through Time, and it Makes You ‘You’ in Different Ways

## 

I like to just sit sometimes, and look out the window to the trees. At first, my mind will be on something obvious, something anyone else can see or experience — the birds, the changing colour of the leaves, the sounds or other people. But, with little in the way of awareness, my mind drifts through time and reality, into a new world, a future time where I’ve achieved much more, or an imaginative land where physics is flipped on its head, maybe I even travel backwards in time to change the past.

Eventually, I become aware of how distant I’ve become to the present moment. I’ve travelled years away, to worlds that I’m not even sure exist, but I soon shake myself out of it.

When this happens to me now, I smile, because I realise what happened inside my mind.

There are two big networks in your brain: the Default Mode and the Central Executive. From here on out, known as the **narrative** and the **present**, respectively.

The present network is clearly devoted to the now, the current goings on around you and also inside you. The Present network is active when you engage yourself in tasks like talking, math equations, reading, racing your 95 hatchback through tiny city streets. When you meditate, it’s usually this network that lights up.

The Narrative network is what you use when you go off track, travel to the future or return to the past. When you daydream, reminisce, plan, or play out unreal situations.

If one is active, the other is not. Which makes sense when you think about thinking — It’s rather difficult to be focused on talking to someone while you’re mentally planning your trip on the weekend.

The present network is like a first person game — you see through your eyes, everything takes place around you, you can see your hands reach out and grab things, and you can only see yourself if you look in a mirror.

![](0*ddv8rrUbABfXoj7A.jpg)

The narrative network is second or third person, you refer to yourself as ‘you’ or ‘he/she.’ Somewhat like Age of Empires — you see a world in your control, like a god looking down on those below, you exist in what seems like thin air, and you see yourself from the outside like you do everyone else.

![](0*BWKvrsO4Y9ZTqaUH.jpg)

Both these forms of thinking lead to different impressions of yourself. The present is everything right in front of you at this moment, similar to how other animals go from moment to moment, only ever thinking about the now. The narrative is us telling ourselves stories where we are one of the characters, and it’s something that is likely a uniquely human function.

It’s from this narrative network that we form ideas about ourselves, images of how we want to be seen and perceived by others. The activation of the narrative network represents an introspective activity, the center of our consciousness or awareness is reflecting about itself.

When we meditate, we shut off the narrative mind, which is likely why [people deep within a meditative state will say they become one with the world](http://sambrinson.com/do-meditators-really-exist/) — because they’ve lost their sense of self, or the ability to reflect on themselves.

There is also very little evidence of the [narrative network in infants](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/16/6790.full), instead it seems to develop with age. People with Alzheimer’s disease also show [predominantly less functioning within this network](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15070770).

It seems like the Narrative network is essential in knowing ourselves, and it is, but then what of the Present network?

Think of that first-person game you like, are you aware of yourself within that game? You know that those hands are yours, you control them, you can see across the room in front of you, and the bad guy opposite, you know if you don’t stop him he’ll get you. You can tell you have a lot of strength left (thanks to the little indicator on the screen).

You’re totally in the moment, all that exists is what you see and feel right now. For that reason, ‘you’ as others would see you, don’t exist, you can’t reflect or project upon yourself.

![](0*iiEd0jTyD4QWD1cx.jpg)

The precuneus is a relatively newly developed brain structure, most animals do not possess it, or in a far less developed sense than us. It’s also a central hub in the narrative network, and plays an important role in your sense of self and consciousness. In conjunction with the posterior cingulate cortex, the precuneus is believed to make possible self-consciousness and self-awareness.

How would you convince a dog that two biscuits later is a better deal than one right now, the dog has little idea of what the future is or how to predict it, he lives in the moment and he wants that biscuit. Speaking of dogs, have you seen one look at itself in the mirror for the first time? It takes a while for them to realize that that other dog isn’t actually another dog.

Even a baby doesn’t know where you go or if you even exist anymore when you hide behind your hands, you disappeared from their sight and therefore from their world.

To live only with the present network is not to say you have no sense of self, but that your ‘self’ is not distinct or separate from everything else. You are what you see and what is at this moment in time. Your only wants are what you need now — food, water, sex, play. You can reason, you can solve problems and communicate effectively with people; but you cannot predict the future, look back on the past, play out stories in your mind or imagine fictional worlds.

To your mind, when you use the present network, you are the now. That is all.

When you use the narrative network, you are a time traveling character in a story that’s played out in your head.

Both of these lead to the understanding of yourself from different angles, both are important, and both are you.

# 5 Steps to Reclaim your Productivity

## Have you ever felt like there are so many things to do that you don’t know where to start? Relax, you’re not alone.

We live in such a busy world these days it is pretty easy to feel overwhelmed. I did a couple of years ago, so today I want to share with you the 5 simple steps that helped me reclaim control of my live and be more productive.

**1.Get some Head Space**: Nowadays, we have so many information coming from everywhere it is not easy for our minds to calm down. When your mind is full of information and thoughts it’s difficult to identify your priorities and focus on the things that matter most.

I realized this and started looking for ways to calm my mind so it could get the same rest my body was getting. For me, the solution was meditation, and it has been so for many of my entrepreneur friends having a busy schedule like mine.

As with every new habit, I suggest you take it slow and keep in mind the idea is not to force your mind to do anything in particular but let it flow instead.

There are many free resources of guided meditation in YouTube and even free meditation apps. Personally, I would recommend *1 Giant Mind*, which will take you through 12 easy steps to learn how to meditate followed by a 30 day challenge to help build the habit, it is available for iOS and Android.

**2.Eat what is Right for You:** Just as you take care of the type of fuel you put on your car, you should do with the fuel you put on your body; that is food.

The clean eating movement is quite popular these days, and I’ve tried it myself with wonderful results. Nevertheless, I think when it comes to food the “one size fits all” approach doesn’t apply. We are all different.

Listen to your body, see how it reacts to different kinds of food. In my particular case, I decided to go vegan after I identified my body did not react well to animal products; I’m currently experimenting with gluten as I’ve seen a trend of my body not reacting well when I eat gluten containing foods.

I can’t explain the tremendous increase on my energy and how my mood has improved after I started eating right and putting the right fuel on my body. I can now do more of what I really want.

Again, don’t take my word for granted: Try for yourself and see how your body reacts.

**3.Plan your Time in Advance:** Let’s be honest, life happens. Make sure that when it does, you’re prepared. Don’t drift and just go with the flow since this will not allow you to have your priorities clear.

What I do is I plan my months and weeks ahead. When it comes to my month, I do it within the first 3 days of each month and consider aspects as my work, my family and friends as well as my projects. I try to see the big picture and adjust as I go on my weekly reviews.

Celebrate yourself for your achievements and review the aspects that need to be adjusted. When you plan your week, you are clearer on what your daily tasks should be based on what you want to achieve by the end of the week. Try to allocate around 70% of your time, the rest should be for stuff you can’t see coming.

When it comes to planning, I am a little old fashioned and love writing on my planner, but I keep track of some events using an app called *Planner* which allows me to remember important stuff on the go.

**4.Give Yourself Permission to Play:** Being so busy all the time can certainly lead to us burning out. I know the feeling, I’ve been there! But I can also tell you there is a simple solution for that.

Remember when you were a kid and you could go hours doing something totally losing sense of time? That means that was something that made your soul sing; why stop doing it just because you grew up?

Of course you probably can’t spend the same amount of time doing it, but make sure to allocate sometime within your schedule to do something just for the sake of it. Remember, what we don’t schedule we never do.

In my case, I take some time daily to let my creativity flow on my coloring book. Just 10 or 15 mins a day have an amazing effect over my state of mind.

Think about if and find that activity that would make you feel renovated and you know you can do just because.

**5.Setup Rituals:** Do you know how you brush your teeth everyday without really thinking about it? It is because we’ve been doing so since we were kids and our brains see it as a habit.

When it comes to making choices, our brains have a limited capacity; we can only make a certain amount of choices per day without feeling overwhelmed. Make sure you are using them on what is really important.

If everyday you have to decide on what to wear, what to have for breakfast, which way to take to work; by the time you start working on the really important stuff you might have used some of your chances already.

Setup rituals, it won’t be natural initially but after a while you will built the habit and everything will be as easy as brushing your teeth.

I have morning and evening rituals which take about half an hour each, I designed them to make sure I do what matters to me. Some of the things included on my morning ritual are reading and exercising, my evening ritual includes preparing meals for next day, all things will help me get closer to my goals of learning and taking care of my health.

I use an app called *Fabulous* to create and keep track of my rituals, it has a beautiful and simple design, also available for iOS and Android.

I hope you implement these steps and they can be as useful to you as they’ve been to me. If you do, please share with us on the comments below or on our [Facebook Page.](https://www.facebook.com/gosmartify/?fref=ts)

Here it is for a more productive life and doing more of what you want!

With love and gratitude,

# Are You A Multipotentialite? (Confessions From A Man With Obsessive Learning Disorder)

## Are You A Multipotentialite? (Confessions From A Man With Obsessive Learning Disorder)

I’m sorry Mum.

But I have to tell you something.

I have OLD.

*Obsessive Learning Disorder.*

There’s no cure for it.

If you’re born with it, you’re stuck with OLD for life.

My question today is: **Do you have OLD as well?**

Maybe we can be friends.

Or start an OLD Anonymous group together. Although my public confession might make this kinda tough.

More importantly though, I want to show you **how to find out** **if you have OLD, and if so, that there’s nothing wrong with you**.

But first: a story.

## Passion #387 — growing up with OLD

Being a kid with OLD can feel lonely. Incredibly exciting and never boring, but still lonely. Maybe you can relate.

Here are the first 3 answers I can remember, that I gave to the question **“What do you want to be when you grow up?”:**

Astronaut, secret agent and race car driver.

I think race car driver was the first one. I always had a big picture of a Ferrari F40 on my wall.

![Passion #1 — Cars — via [Rev To The Limit](http://www.revtothelimit.com/uploads/3/2/8/3/3283806/___8308531_orig.jpg)](1*YTXlVOJr12XWttmInTYLNg.png)*Passion #1 — Cars — via [Rev To The Limit](http://www.revtothelimit.com/uploads/3/2/8/3/3283806/___8308531_orig.jpg)*

Of course that meant for Christmas I’d often get car models and [Hot Wheels](http://www.hotwheels.com/en-us/index.html). Eventually though, I got a [Lego](http://www.lego.com/en-us) car — and that triggered passion #2.

Because one of the first Lego sets that I got included a space shuttle. I already imagined myself in a space suit, with the big helmet, going to the moon.

![Passion #2 — Space](1*OccEKAPDvYUI6Wgut7lM9g.png)*Passion #2 — Space*

However, the coolest part of building with legos was that **there were no limits** — if you could imagine it, you could build it.

Which, in turn, triggered what I thought would be my true passion: **inventor!**

I built the models, took them apart, modified them, combined them, and made them even better.

Until they came up with Lego soccer.

![Passion #4 — Ball sports](1*21mEOO9vb0z2V4to02QfKQ.png)*Passion #4 — Ball sports*

This set was so cool and close to playing a real soccer game at the time, that it actually made me go outside — and play real soccer.

When I was 7, me and the neighbor’s kids played outside 24/7.

But we didn’t just play soccer.

We played every ball sport you can think of.

Hockey, Soccer, Football, Basketball — we even had a Baseball set and played on someone else’s property, not that we knew the rules or anything.

Until the next thing came around. [The original Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy).

Don’t get me wrong, we were still outside all the time — but from now on we just sat in the grass, playing with our Game Boys.

If you know where Game Boy stands in the dictionary, then you also know what word comes right after it:

Pokémon!

![Passion #6 — Pokémon](1*SM5EPtOZzJQRqegnjZU1Nw.png)*Passion #6 — Pokémon*

Like everywhere, Pokémon was huge in Germany. We played always and everywhere. Even in school. And when we weren’t playing Pokémon, we were watching the show on TV.

Eventually it was forbidden to bring Game Boys to school. But that didn’t matter, because right then, the Pokémon trading card game came out.

![Passion #7 — Card Games](1*1WHHT7Pu7_FDVCb5hd8hJw.png)*Passion #7 — Card Games*

There was even a Pokémon league, where you could go every week to play against others and trade cards.

I’m going to stop here, because by now I’m not even 10 years old and you probably already have ADD just from reading this.

Was my childhood exciting? Yes.

I never got bored. There was always something new to learn. To explore. To invent. To adapt to.

However, there’s a downside to Obsessive Learning Disorder:

**You never fit in.**

Or if you do, it only lasts for a short time.

When I turned 16 I was wondering: “How can these other guys from my class go to soccer practice 3 times a week for 10 years and not get incredibly bored with it?”

I was always switching friends and cliques, which meant I **got along well with everyone, but didn’t really belong anywhere**.

Round peg. Square hole.

Alright, time to see which category you fall into.

## The OLD test — diagnose yourself

The good thing about OLD is that you can easily diagnose yourself, by checking for symptoms. Here are the most common ones:

1When someone asks you what your hobbies are it causes you anxiety, because **you have so many of them** that you don’t know how you could possibly answer that question.

**2You love learning new things**. Love love love it. How can you NOT learn new things? You love it so much that you’re not even worried about forgetting old things.

3All it takes to fire you straight into research mode is one well written article, one touching video or one Google search. If you **find something new** that excites you, you can immediately **spend the entire afternoon venturing down the rabbit hole**.

**4You’re terrible at sticking with things**. Whenever you learn something new, **you pick up the basics really well and really fast. **However, once you get past a certain point, that new thing becomes boring.

5Ideas come naturally to you. **You have so many of them, that all you can do is write them down**, because you can never find the time to execute them all.

6You don’t have a problem with pivoting. **You can turn around 180 degrees from one day to the next**, whether that’s in relationships or in business.

Does that sound like you?

If you’re still not sure, here’s the final test:

Has the answer to the question: **“What do you want to be when you grow up?”** changed more than 5 times throughout your childhood and time in high school?

If the answer is yes, chances are you have OLD as well.

This diagnosis, however, should not make you feel bad. To the contrary. It’s a cause to celebrate!

Welcome to the club. Share the love:
> # **I just diagnosed myself with Obsessive Learning Disorder. It’s okay though. I’m a multipotentialite and I’m just fine! [(click to tweet)](http://ctt.ec/6_hTd)**

## The world of multipotentialites

OLD is not a bad thing.

Feeling a little bit ADD with your passion doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you.

What you are, is a *multipotentialite.*

**Note: **The term multipotentialite was coined by Emilie Wapnick, and I’ve learned most of what I know about it from [her great TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJORi5VO1F8).

You just happen to be someone with **many passions, purposes and destinies**.

Not just one.

And that’s okay.

In fact, it’s more than okay. It’s great!

Multipotentialites are **highly adaptable, very innovative and rapid learners**.

But how do you embrace that?

## OLD: A life in circles

2 days ago I watched a great movie: [Finding Joe](http://findingjoethemovie.com/).

It explains the underlying concept of almost any movie, book or story ever told: **The Hero’s Journey.**

Every journey can be broken down into 3 major parts: *separation, initiation and return.*

![Screenshot from [Finding Joe](http://findingjoethemovie.com/)](1*2eoQu2Q-o7ahkvpInlRTog.png)*Screenshot from [Finding Joe](http://findingjoethemovie.com/)*

After receiving a call to start his journey, whether in the form of an actual phone call, a vision from above or a literal knock on the head, every hero has to be *separated* from his familiar territory.

![Neo receives his call in The Matrix (1999)](1*Km9QoEYHuaerE7TlTUwlIw.gif)*Neo receives his call in The Matrix (1999)*

Having overcome the fear of starting the journey and “taking the red pill”, the hero’s *initiation* begins, followed by trials and adventures in the forest.

Thanks to courage and many helpers along the way, the hero eventually makes it to the final test: **the battle with the dragon**.

![Harry Potter’s first fight with a dragon — via [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/search/harry%20potter%20dragons)](1*BKIgPpTSXwffquyGM0zWUA.gif)*Harry Potter’s first fight with a dragon — via [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/search/harry%20potter%20dragons)*

After having faced his or her fear, the hero finally *returns *with a treasure, which can be a chest full of gold, a bunch of diamonds, or a whole lot of cash.

![Robbing a bank in Now You See Me — via Youtube](1*juPpLa1ADRQq5YJzn1S-GA.gif)*Robbing a bank in Now You See Me — via Youtube*

In all cases though, the best thing the hero brings home is **a story.**

Sometimes, that’s also all the hero returns with, ain’t that right Indy?

![Yeah, right… — via [Ugly Owl Films](http://uglyowlfilms.com/2014-film-blog/2014/2/18/february-16-raiders-of-the-lost-ark)](1*fCA8QlAEkRDhckIFVB-7-Q.gif)*Yeah, right… — via [Ugly Owl Films](http://uglyowlfilms.com/2014-film-blog/2014/2/18/february-16-raiders-of-the-lost-ark)*

The beauty of the hero’s journey is that **it’s not a straight line.**

It’s a circle.

After the return, the hero can receive another call and start another journey.

The life of a multipotentialite is very similar.

You’ll see over time that even though you seem to be obsessed with learning new things, eventually, **you’ll return to topics you’ve studied before**.

If you’re trying to force your life to be a straight line, you’ll just make yourself miserable.

Accept that your life comes in circles, and you’ll finally be able to breathe and give yourself a break.

You don’t have to know what your passion is right now.

Even if you’re 35. Or 47. Or 52.

You don’t have that one purpose in life, that one thing you are destined to do.

What you do have is time.

You have hundreds, thousands of circles of learning you can go through.

You can start over at any time. It’s up to you.

But please, **accept yourself**, so you can finally become the hero of your own journey.

Okay, let me come full circle.

## Whatever you do — Don’t. Stop.

It’s not your job to hack the straightest path through the forest of career options you find yourself in.

Right now, your job is to **explore the entire forest.**

And then the next one.

Whatever you do: **Don’t stop learning.**

Let your OLD blossom. Go full throttle. All-in on your strengths.

Be innovative. Adapt. Learn rapidly.

And jump boldly from topic to topic.

Eventually you’ll find a common thread.

But in order to find it, you have to **keep going**.

We need you.

# The Career Advice That Changed Everything

## The Career Advice that Changed Everything

About 6 months after I left my corporate job, I was feeling very lost. There’s a kind of intimate gravity around despair. It draws you in for a hug and then sinks you to the bottom of the ocean.

I signed up for a 60-minute coaching session with a career coach — something I had NEVER done before. Moreover, she is famous for being direct and I had heard her challenge people to the brink of tears in interviews. But I wanted a fresh perspective, and I trusted her candor.

So I told her about my work background, and how and why I left. I told her I felt like a failure, and like I was bad at my career.

She said:

***“You’re good at your career. It just feels weird because it looks different from everybody else.”***

And in a very direct, no-nonsense way, she repeated back to me some of the things I had told her, as evidence.

It was a fascinating moment. Like the world paused, and then pivoted in a very subtle way.

Everything looked a little bit different. And better.

That shift in perspective, the shift in the story I told myself about my career, created a little bit of space. And within that space, the embrace of despair loosened its grip. I floated back to the surface, and took a deep, fresh breath.

I’m thinking about this now, because the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves matter.

You can create a story that weighs you down, or one that serves as a life-line when you’re in unfamiliar territory and finding your way in the dark.

I sometimes still get caught in the gravity of despair, and feel like I’m failing at life. It helps to get an outside perspective. It reminds me that I can change the story I tell myself. That I have a choice in the story I wish to live — in who I want to be, and how I want to be in the world.

Sometimes I forget that beating up on myself is not actually helpful. I’m glad to have friends to help point out when I’m being too rough.

There’s a reason I teach self-compassion, and treating oneself with kindness and friendship. It’s something I’ve needed to learn — and still need to practice.

Every day.

# What Would Steve Jobs Do to Your Whiteboard?

## 

Out of everything you have to do right now, reading this is your #1 priority.

Our behavior defines our priority. By definition, yours is reading this. That’s not to say you aren’t distracted by all of your other priorities, **but right now you’re choosing this as your number one.**
> # The word “priority” came into the English language in the 1400s. It was singular. It meant the very first or prior thing. It stayed singular for the next 500 years. Only in the 1900s did we pluralize the term and start talking about “priorities.” -Greg McKeown, “Essentialism”

Somehow we went 500 years knowing that there could only be one most important thing. Then, magically, we discovered we could have multiple most important things.

Or are we just kidding ourselves?

## “We can only do three.”

Steve Jobs changed the world in part because he chose to focus on a very small number of most important things.

Walter Isaacson’s biography of the Apple founder is full of stories of Jobs’ technique, often referred to as “slash and burn.”

Jobs hosted an annual retreat for the top 100 leaders of the company. He would stand at a whiteboard and list out the company’s top 10 priorities. As the group fought to get their ideas on the list, Jobs would deem which were worthy of inclusion on the board, and write them down.

Once the agonizing work had been done to get the list to 10, Jobs would cross off the bottom seven. **“We can only do three.”**

By deciding what our priority is, we’re also deciding what it isn’t. That’s hard.

## What are we so busy doing?

Before my wife and I had children, I remember telling a coworker how busy we were. She laughed and gave me a patronizing “you’re too dumb to even know what you just said” look.

She had two young children at the time, and explained true business as “when there’s something you absolutely, positively have to get done before going to bed, and you fall asleep on your way to doing it.”

Yes. That’s busy.

While we’ve been convincing ourselves that it’s somehow possible to have multiple priorities, **we’ve also been convincing ourselves that extreme business equals productivity.**

“Busy” has almost replaced “fine” as the standard response to the hallway question “How are you?”

### This happens a lot:
> Person: “How’s it going?”
Me: “Crazy busy. You?”
Person: “Yep. I hear you.”
Me: “It’s a good thing, right?”
Person: “Job security.”

This is ridiculous. What am I so busy with? My priority? Usually not. Usually it’s managing all of those things distracting me from my priority. Email. Meetings. Text messages. IMs.

**Other people’s priorities. *Not mine.***

I’m not getting work done. I’m just processing messages.

If I listed the 100 things I find myself doing on one of those Steve Jobs whiteboards, he’d cross 97 of them off the list.

What’s stopping me from doing the same thing?

# Building Habits&#58; Why Some People Succeed and Others Fail

## image source

As a coach, I’m fascinated by *why* some people can easily build new habits while others fail miserably.

I’m sure it’s something you’ve noticed in your own life too. You probably have a friend who is very successful. He always accomplishes what he sets out to do. Just listening to him talk about his goals, you think, “Yeah, he gets it! He will really make this goal a reality.”

For the sake of this article, let’s call that friend **Mike. Mike the successful.**

You probably have another friend who is the exact opposite. He rarely accomplishes what he says he’s going to do. Hearing him talk about his goals you think, “It’s just wishful thinking. He’ll never make it.”

Let’s call him **Jim. Jim the failure.**

I’ve coached many Mikes and Jims and at first, they’re seemingly the same. They both show up with enthusiasm and motivation. But after a few weeks, the difference is obvious. Mike knows and uses the fundamental success principles and Jim doesn’t. Exploring these fundamental principles will help us build habits and reach our goals more effectively.

To do that, let’s say that Mike and Jim have the same starting point and the same goal. The principles work for all goals and habits, but for the sake of this example, we’ll use a specific goal. They both start at the same weight and want to lose 30 pounds of fat. Neither of them has any experience with healthy eating or exercise. Let’s see what each of them would do differently to work on their goal.

## Realistic Goals and Expectations

**Mike** knows how to set realistic goals and expectations. Before he commits to a specific target, he researches the topic thoroughly. He reads a few books and talks to his friends who have done it before. He takes the time to learn what a reasonable fat loss target is and how long it’s going to take to achieve it.

**Jim** doesn’t want to do any research or planning. He wants to start immediately and not waste any time. “Lose 30 pounds in 3 weeks” sounds like a reasonable goal to him since that’s what all the ads are saying lately. He commits to the goal without thinking if it’s realistically achievable or not.

## Devote Time for The New Goal

**Mike** knows that to achieve any goal he has to devote extra time every day to work on it. His time is already booked a 100%, and he knows he can’t fit anything else unless he gives up something else. If Mike can’t devote that time every day, he knows there’s no point to even start.

**Jim** is also booked 100% of the time, but he thinks he can fit in the exercise and change his diet in between things. He is confident that it’s not going to be a big deal and things will just work out.

## Tracking Progress and Milestones

**Mike** knows that to make progress on a goal he needs to have a way to measure it. He knows measuring just his weight is not good enough since the muscle mass will also change. He measures his body fat percentage to keep track of his progress accurately.

Based on his goal and the time frame that he sets, Mike figures out weekly and monthly milestones. By tracking his weekly and monthly progress he can easily see if he’s on track to achieving his goal or not. If Mike is not consistently hitting his milestones, he knows that his strategy isn’t working and he has to change something.

**Jim** doesn’t bother recording any measurements or progress. He also wants to lose 30 pounds but has no idea how much progress he should be making every week. His only measure is the mirror and the subjective opinion of the people around him. Hearing somebody ask, “Have you lost some weight?” feels so good! He wants to be surprised by jumping on the scales one day and finding out that he’s at his perfect weight.

## Gradual Progress vs. Cold Turkey

**Mike** has never worked on this goal and he knows the start will be slow. He needs to learn many new things about how to achieve it. Before he jumps in, he makes sure what he’s doing is safe and effective.

He starts to gradually remove the unhealthy foods from his diet and replaces them with healthy ones. At the gym, Mike is careful to not push himself too far. He takes his time to learn how to properly do the exercises and gradually increases the challenge.

**Jim** hasn’t worked on this goal either, but he doesn’t want to waste time. He’s heard that the paleo diet is pretty good for losing weight, so he goes a 100% paleo right away.

He goes to the gym and loads the bench press with the maximum he can lift. He doesn’t waste time with warming up or learning the correct exercises.

## Quick Fix vs. Long Term Strategy

**Mike** knows that there are no lasting “quick fixes” in life. When he creates the strategy to achieve his goal he makes sure that it’s viable long term. He doesn’t just go on the latest diet, he picks a meal plan that he can follow for life.

**Jim** just wants to get ripped quickly and go on with his life. He’s interested in quick gains and quick burns. He is taking steroids and weight loss pills to accelerate his progress. He is also saving up some money for liposuction, just in case.

## Mentorship

**Mike** knows that getting help from experts will speed up his progress. He will learn how to avoid a lot of mistakes along the way. He invests some time looking for a good coach who can show him the basics. He does a few coaching sessions to learn which exercises are most effective and how to do them safely.

Mike also hires a dietitian who helps him learn the fundamentals of healthy eating and weight loss. They spend a few hours designing a new diet plan that fits Mike’s lifestyle needs.

**Jim** doesn’t need anybody to tell him what to do. He’s already read hundreds of fitness magazines and has figured out a workout strategy that works for him. He exercises on whatever machines he can find at the local gym. He doesn’t have a set routine and does the exercises that he feels like that day.

For Jim hiring a dietitian is a waste of money. Plus, nobody knows his own body better than him. Based on a few articles he’s read online he comes up with his own diet plan.

## Accountability

Besides having a mentor, **Mike** knows that having social support is a crucial part of achieving any goal. He knows that the people around him will be a key factor in determining his success. So he is actively looking for friends that will encourage him. He doesn’t share his goal with people who are negative and could hold him back.

Mike also knows the value of accountability partners. He has a pact with a dependable friend to be in the gym together 4 times a week. He knows that he is much more likely to exercise if he is held accountable.

**Jim** is thrilled to tell everybody about his new goal and broadcasts it to everyone, regardless of whether they will encourage him or not. He doesn’t change anything in his social circle and doesn’t look for people who are into exercise or healthy foods. He relies only on his strong initial motivation and doesn’t need anybody to hold him accountable with exercise.

## Do It for The Right Reasons

**Mike** knows that if he loses that extra fat he will be healthier, happier, and an inspiration for others. Because Mike is doing this for the right reasons he has the motivation to persist when the going gets hard.

Mike knows that he doesn’t need to brag and flaunt his success. He quietly works on his goals and knows that the rewards and respect from others will come because of hard work, not showing off.

**Jim** wants to get ripped and look better in front of his buddies. He is all about showing off his success. He often checks in from the gym with a photo of how much he is benching. His main motivation is to get approval and popularity. Since his goal is entirely selfish and shallow, when the going gets hard Jim doesn’t have the internal motivation to keep going.

## Fast Forward a Few Months

**Mike** has already made solid progress. He weighs 10 pounds less and has even built some extra muscle mass.

The exercise plan that his coach helped him create feels great. He has increased the challenge and intensity of the workouts and he can feel that his body is getting stronger and more flexible.

It was difficult to get used to his new diet, but now he feels satisfied after each meal. He still gets some cravings for junk food occasionally, but because his body is getting all the nutrients it needs it’s easy to stay on track.

Mike indulges with a cheat meal every week or so without feeling guilty about it. He knows that he’s got a great diet and one meal with less healthy foods is not going to affect him.

Mike had a rough time emotionally for a few weeks. He was feeling depressed and working out was the last thing he wanted to do. However, his accountability buddy was there to cheer him up and motivate him to do the exercise anyway. He didn’t miss a single workout despite the emotional turmoil.

He also has a sister and two colleagues that have been obese for a long time. They are all inspired by Mike’s great results and have also started working on getting a healthier lifestyle. They’re all supporting and encouraging each other.

**Jim** has had a few very rough months. The diet plan he created was working well for the first week or so, but soon he started getting very strong cravings, a clear sign that he’s missing essential nutrients. After a few days, his diet streak ended in McDonald’s, but he still swears it’s the best meal he’s ever had.

The exercise was also going well for a while until he had a bad accident and hurt his back. That kept him out of the gym for a few weeks and erased the progress he had made. Even though his back healed, Jim was bummed out about the whole thing and didn’t go to the gym for a few more weeks. There was nobody to encourage him and help him get back on track faster.

Jim also got a rash all over his body from the steroids. The doctor prescribed, even more, drugs to balance out his body.

He’s still debating whether a healthy lifestyle is for him. After all, nobody from his family is fit and healthy, maybe it’s just his genes?

## Conclusion

All the examples above are about fat loss, however, the principles apply to all goals we want to achieve. The process is the same whether we want to lose fat, build a business, learn to play the guitar, or improve our relationship. To be successful in any goal we need to make sure we’re following the fundamental principles.

So if you have a goal and it’s not quite working out so far, see if you’re following the fundamental principles of success. Check if your strategy and actions are more like Jim’s or more like Mike’s.

*No Jims or Mikes were harmed in the making of this article. And I sincerely apologize to all the Jims reading this. I’ve coached many successful Jims and I love you just as much as the Mikes! ❤*

# How To Start A Journaling Habit Today

## How To Start A Journaling Habit Today

### Lessons from journaling 1,000,000 words

Years ago, I hated writing. And yet, I wanted to earn an income from writing, publish a best-selling book and call myself an author. Instead, I avoided the blank page as if it carried the bubonic plague. I wanted to build a career as a professional journalist, so I could impress my college class mates. Instead, I collected one rejection letter after the next. I had quite the pile.

Every time I set out to write consistently, I failed. Then, I tried journaling. This habit, which I’ve practiced on and off for over 20 years now, ignited my love for writing. It also helped me become a better person.

Here’s how journaling affected me and how you can start practicing this habit.

## I Quit A Job Because Of Journaling

Several years ago, I held a job as a care worker in a residential care home in the community.

I spent my working days cleaning the care home, administering medicating and teaching the residents how to shop and cook for themselves.

Back then, the Irish government was busy bailing out banks. My friends were out of work. Ireland was bankrupt. But my job was secure. Go me.

There was just one problem: I was terrible at it.

One night, I came home and said to my wife: “They want us to be caretakers, cleaners, doctors, nurses, mechanics, personal assistants and more, and it’s never enough. I’m going insane.”

“You don’t have to,” my wife said.

“What do you mean?”

“If you hate the job so much, why don’t you just quit?”

“That’s a ridiculous idea,” I said. “I need a paying job. Why would you say something like that?”

I went upstairs to write about our argument, but instead I reread old entries from my journal. I paused when I found this one:
> “After I had come home from work last Thursday, I sat in the car outside the house for 20 minutes in silence. When I managed to go inside, I could barely speak to my wife. It was all I could do to go straight to bed.”

Einstein said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over.

A month later, I handed in my notice.

## I Developed An Imaginary Counsel

While out of work, I read [The Journals of John Cheever](https://www.amazon.com/Journals-John-Cheever-Vintage-International/dp/0307387259). He’s an American novelist who wrote entries almost everyday. He’s also the type of writer I sacrifice small goats to. One night, I came across this entry of his:
> # “To write well, to write passionately, to be less inhibited, to be warmer, to be more self-critical, to recognise the power of as well as the force of lust, to write, to love.”

That struck me as an ideal to strive for. I could almost imagine Cheever hunched over his battered, yellow notebook, etching out one great story after another. For a long time afterwards, when faced with a creative challenge I visualized my pal John Cheever and asked him, “What would you do?”

I’m aware this makes me sound quite mad, but it’s a creative process American author Napoleon Hill recommended in his seminal book [Think and Grow Rich](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Napoleon-Hill-ebook/dp/B0743FCV3W/). He suggested keeping an “imaginary council” every night that you consult when you have a problem or need advice.
> # “Just before going to sleep at night, I would shut my eyes, and see, in my imagination, this group of men seated with me around my Council Table.”

Cheever sits at my council. And so does British author Virginia Woolf and the Russian writer Vladimir Nabokov. They all kept journals too.

It’s quite the party.

![Yes, my hand-writing is this bad](1*5v5T9TDEEJmmlxsa6aCkSA.jpeg)*Yes, my hand-writing is this bad*

## I Have Lots Of Ideas

I told you about about crazy science experiment. I told you about the secure job I quit. I told you about my romantic life from twenty years ago. And it surprises me.

You see, for years I was out of ideas for things to tell you about. I’d have rather rubbed lemons in my eye-balls than sit at the blank page and bleed for an hour or two.

So when I started journaling. I wrote about my day. Who I met. What I did. What I said. And what I learnt. I wrote about the party where I drank too much. I wrote about the time I fell out with a best-friend. The more I wrote about it, the easier it got.

My life didn’t get easier, but I felt more relaxed about sitting down on the chair and putting one word after the other. And then one day… I was full of ideas. I wrote a novella that no one bought (I’ll be fine). I wrote a book about productivity. And one about creativity too.

Now, when I journal consistently, I’ve got more ideas than hours in my day. And when I don’t? I discovered that coming up with ideas to write about is a little like having sex: if you haven’t done it in ages, it’ll feel awkward and clumsy.

So…

## How I Manage To Journal A Little Every Day

I’ve tried traditional paper-based journals, a password protected file on my computer and even journaling apps. I’ve kept journals about my personal life, professional life and even my business. So what should you do?

Both digital and paper-based journals are useful. With digital journals, you can search old entries and never worry about losing anything. With paper-based journals, you’re less likely to be distracted from your practice by notifications or social media. I recommend trying both for a week or so and then using what works for you.

That said, here’s my current practice:

Most mornings, I write a 200 to 300-word journal entry before I start work. It takes fifteen minutes and I use an app for Mac called Day One. Some mornings it’s hard to write while tired and under-caffeinated. So I created a personal list of journal writing prompts and used those for a long time.

These include:

* What’s on my mind?

* How should I have reacted in hindsight?

* How are things different now?

* What would I say to a younger version of myself?

* What am I grateful for?

* What do I value?

* Who helped me?

Most Sunday evenings, I write a longer journal entry about what I learned during the week and the challenges that I faced. I got a little fed up with that last December. Now, I’m using journal writing prompt from the [Daily Stoic Journal](https://dailystoic.com/announcing-daily-stoic-journal/) by Ryan Holiday. This book contains journal prompts for each day of the year.

Overall, I’m journaling about 2,500 words a week, which works out to over 100,000-words a year. It’s amazing what you can accomplish with just 300-words a day.

Once every two to three months I read back and all journal entries and I extract key lessons from them. I underline things I got wrong and ideas that I had but which I didn’t work on. In the case of my business, I reflect on what went well and what didn’t work by writing a short summary in Day One or Evernote:

![This is an example of how I reviewed a journal about my business and extracted some key lessons](1*Ga4UHy9X8oGDESaC5cLtMQ.jpeg)*This is an example of how I reviewed a journal about my business and extracted some key lessons*

But what if you’re not a writer?

## How To Start Journaling If You’re Not A Writer

You don’t have to be a writer (or a washed out journalist) to [learn how to journal](https://yourvisualjournal.com/about/). **Journaling is kind of like having a personal therapist on retainer, and that’s why I recommend journaling to people of all types.**

It’ll help you express yourself, think ideas through and create a record of your life. If you want to practice journaling, write a short entry at the same time every day. Or even just once a week.

* Pick your journaling tool of choice. (We’ll get to my favorites at the end.)

* Pick a topic to write about, e.g. your daily routine.

* Set a timer for twenty minutes.

* While writing, don’t stop to edit yourself or edit for punctuation.

* When the timer sounds, re-read your entry and tidy it up

Sounds easy right? Many people ask “Should I write standing up or sitting down?” or “When’s the best time to write, morning or evening?” These questions are side-attractions to the main event.

John Cheever wrote in the afternoons and often after a drink. Virginia Woolf, on the other hand, wrote many of her entries in the morning. In [A Writer’s Diary](https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Diary-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0156027917), she said:
> # “I find it hard to start writing in the morning; but the dejection lasts only 30 minutes, and once I start I forget all about it.”

Remember, you can’t get journaling wrong because it’s a personal pursuit. Consistency is more important than your tools, timing or choice of furniture.

## What to Expect When You Start Journaling

Anger. Jealousy. Fear.

*Wait! That doesn’t sound like much fun.*

When I first started journaling, these emotions surprised me. I thought I was a merry little camper… and instead my entries were bleak and angry. At first, I found my negative thought patterns alarming. I even considered hiring an fancy therapist to help me work through my issues.

Then I realized it’s okay to leave negative thoughts in a journal because nobody else will read them. Plus, it’s better to get these negative ideas out of my head and leave them in place where they can’t fester. If you’re struggling with negative thought patterns while journaling, finish up each entry by recording three things you’re grateful for. It’s always nice to end on a high.

Or don’t. Journaling doesn’t have any rules.

After all, what you say in your journal is for you and you alone… at least at first. If you want to turn it into a public work later on. That’s fine. If you want to stick in your wardrobe and forget what you ever said, that’s fine too.

Just don’t expect your ex to understand.

# The Muscle Machine&#58; How I Packed on 40 Pounds of Muscle in Three Months

## The 1,000 Calorie Protein Shake is currently my 1 blog post. Due to it’s popularity, I’ve decided to write this follow-up post, which describes my workout routine — and, more importantly, how I stuck to it. Let’s start off at the end:

### The Results

![*These are untouched originals. The picture on the left was taken 90 days prior to the picture on the right.*](1*6hgBKHtqTYKmD3G0g7NabQ.png)**These are untouched originals. The picture on the left was taken 90 days prior to the picture on the right.**

Over a 90 day period, I went from 119 to 158 pounds. **That’s a 32% increase in total body weight — all in muscle mass.** (My body fat percentage stayed constant at about 5–7%.) So yeah…I grew by a third.

Here’s the not-so-secret secret recipe for getting fantastic results: **discipline and intensity**. I know, I know — broad terms like that don’t provide much direction, but they’re the core ingredients. A great workout routine won’t do anything for you if you don’t repeat it with consistency and intensity. Your results are primarily governed by *how *you workout vs. the workout itself. Don’t worry, I’ve laid out all of my habits below. By mimicking my behavior, you should be able to achieve a similar outcome.

Here are my tips, along with descriptions of exactly what I did:

## 1. Use a Program

When I weighed 119 pounds, I was in trouble. I was dangerously skinny, and I was hardly eating or sleeping. Thankfully, **P90X** saved me. The benefit of using a program like P90X is the structure. It removes all the guess work. It’s a hell of a lot easier to stay disciplined when you have a clear roadmap of what you’re supposed to be doing. This is why I recommend using a digital program vs. a gym membership or a subscription service (like Daily Burn, which gives you access to countless à la carte workouts, without much structure). Those options are okay if you’re just trying to maintain your overall fitness, but they’re not ideal for making *big* changes.

There are plenty of intense workout programs these days. BeachBody now offers a subscription service that allows you to access all of their top-selling products. It’s a great way to test things out. I’ve tried several Insanity workouts and some P90X3 routines, but the classic P90X is still my go-to program for now.

## 2. Spend the Money

When I commit to something, I tend to go “all-in.” I have a hard time with “halfway.” This can sometimes be a burden, but usually it’s a good thing. In the case of my body transformation, it was critical to my success. When I ordered P90X, I didn’t just order the DVDs. I ordered all of the equipment, all of the supplements, and even extra stuff like hand towels and a better water bottle. I did this because I knew I’d maximize my results if I had the proper gear. But there’s another hidden benefit to spending money on your goal. When you invest your own money, you’ll feel more accountable. It’s easy to say, “I don’t have the extra cash right now,” but that’s a red flag. If you’re not willing to spend some money to improve your health, why would you expect to spend your time or effort on it either?

## 3. Go All-In

This is an extension of the last tip, but it deserves it’s own section. I recently came across a book called *The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up*, by Marie Kondo. Her method of cleaning, known as the KonMari method, involves discarding *everything *you don’t need, and then organizing *everything *that remains, all in one shot. It sounds crazy because the traditional approach is to do a little at a time so you don’t get overwhelmed. I often hear this advice in the fitness world, too. “Just go slow. Start by walking. Then jog. Then run.” This works for certain things. If you want to be a long-distance runner, a gradual approach makes sense. But if you want to add muscle and bulk, you need to go all-in right away. Going “all-in” doesn’t mean lifting more weight than you can possibly lift. It means committing to consistency and pushing your limits. **Discipline and intensity.** Why is this necessary? Because results inspire us to continue. If you ramp up slowly, you’ll get bored and discouraged.

Jumping in head-first is a challenge. It won’t be pretty. The key here is to follow Tony Horton’s famous saying: “Do your best, and forget the rest.” You probably won’t make it through your first workout, but that doesn’t mean you failed. Far from it, in fact. When I can’t make it through a workout, I smile — because it means I’m pushing my limits. When I first started P90X, I had to pause the DVDs constantly. I felt faint and dizzy. I vomited mid-workout, on many occasions. If you want to get results, these are the conditions you have to expect. Be ready for the shock of going all-in.

## Get a Routine, and Stick to It

When I began P90X, my job was demanding (I was the co-founder of my own startup), so I had to wake up at 5 AM to get my workouts in. I started going to bed around 10 PM to achieve this. It was hell at first, but after a few weeks, my body’s sleeping rhythms realigned. I also gave myself some supplemental boosts. This was my routine:

5 AM: *Wake up, drink a glass of water, pee, weigh myself, wash my face, and brush my teeth.* Drinking water and splashing my face gave me an immediate jolt of energy. Weighing myself gave me motivation. Brushing my teeth got me ready for action. Who wants to workout with stank-breath?

5:30 AM: *Drink my pre-workout drink + 5 grams of creatine mixed with a few ounces of grape juice. (Grape juice pushes creatine into the muscles more quickly). Eat my pre-workout breakfast — a toasted english muffin with peanut butter and jelly, and an apple.* The peanut butter provided a quick hit of protein, and apples are great for sustained energy throughout a workout (slow-burning carbs). While most experts suggest taking creatine after your workout, I found that taking some beforehand gave me a nice boost. Just be careful with this because it dehydrates you. Make sure you’re drinking plenty of water throughout your workout.

6 AM: *Start prepping for the workout.* This involved splashing my face (again), jumping up and down a few times, getting my equipment ready, and turning on the DVD to listen to the background music. This was my “get pumped-up” session. Prepping definitely improved the intensity of my workouts. Notice that I’ve been up for an hour, but haven’t started yet.

6:30-8:30 AM: *Workout.* The P90X DVDs are about an hour long, but I would also do the ab routine afterwards (three days a week), which was another twenty minutes. I would also pause the DVDs — a lot. As I mentioned, I could barely get through a single workout when I first started. I still have trouble to this day, because I don’t half-ass it. I go all-in (full ass). It’s better to go all-in and keep pausing, vs. going through the entire routine without stopping, knowing you could have pushed harder.

8:30–9 AM: *Make my post-workout drink, shower, and get ready for the day.*

My routine was demanding, but it was absolutely necessary. If I had just worked out whenever I had time, I undoubtedly would have skipped workouts and never seen results. The only way to guarantee consistency was to complete the workouts in the early morning hours. I highly recommend doing this. It will keep you disciplined, and you’ll feel extremely productive at the start of each day — which is an awesome feeling. If you don’t workout in the morning, pick another time, b*ut it needs to be the same time every day [1].* Don’t just fit your workouts in when you can — make them part of your schedule, like brushing your teeth.

## Record Everything

As the popular saying goes: “What gets measured gets managed.” Throughout the program, I tracked my progress relentlessly.

P90X provides workout sheets (which you can also download online for free). The sheets allow you to track every rep, from every workout — which is very useful. My numbers increased drastically over the course of the program. If I hadn’t recorded my rep counts, I wouldn’t have had the same motivation to keep pushing them higher [2]. Storing the numbers in your head isn’t the same. You need to write them down.

I also took weekly photos, in several different poses, directly after each workout. As I saw my body changing, I kept wanting more. This stuff is *important*. I know you’re saying to yourself: *“That’s pretty silly. I don’t really need to do that.”* You’re wrong. You need to do it. Taking the photos will make you accountable. It’s also a fear barrier you need to overcome. If you’re trying to transform your body, you’re probably not happy with it right now. That’s okay. Take the photos. When you start seeing changes, it’ll pump you up.

I recommend taking a front photo with arms up and flexed, and same for the back. You can also take a profile (side) photo. To take your photos, get a tripod for your phone and use the time-delay feature on your phone’s camera [3].

I also tracked my weight. I weighed myself twice a day; once immediately in the morning after peeing, and once at night before bed. This can be tricky because your weight isn’t always indicative of what your body is doing. If you’re losing fat and adding muscle, your body is transforming, but the scale might read the same. Be wary of this. That said, the scale is generally a great way to track your progress. There were nights when I’d eat a bunch of food right before bed because I knew I wasn’t at my top weight from the night before.

I also tracked my heart rate by wearing a monitor during workouts. There were times when my heart rate got dangerously high and I’d need to take a break. Whenever I got to that point, I’d feel *good *because I knew I was pushing myself to my limit. Without monitoring yourself that precisely, it’s difficult to know exactly how hard you’re trying. The heart rate monitor is both a safety mechanism, and a motivational tool [4].

I also tracked my body fat percentage and body measurements. I took the measurements before starting the program, and then once a month throughout it. You can get cheap tools for doing this (which I’ve referenced in the link at the end of this post), and it’s another helpful way to track your results. Remember — the scale doesn’t always tell the whole story.

## Stay Consistent

You can’t miss a day. You just can’t. It’s non-negotiable. I went through P90X without missing a single session. It was hard as hell, but I got through it. Once you’ve completed a 90-day cycle, you can skip a day every now and then, but in order to maintain your momentum the first time through, you *must* stay consistent. There will be days when you feel too sore to workout (like day 2). Workout anyway. A half-assed workout — even though it’s not ideal — is better than taking a day off. You’ll also find that once you get started, your energy will pick up and you’ll get a much better workout than you had originally expected.

## Don’t Neglect Stretching, Cardio, & Yoga

I do *all *of the P90X routines, including stretching, cardio, and yoga. Yoga has actually become my favorite workout. It’s common to underestimate the importance of these routines, especially when you’re focused on bulking up. They’re important because they improve your flexibility, balance, and stamina, which directly correlates to your performance during resistance days. These workouts will also improve overall definition, targeting commonly overlooked areas like your glutes, abs, and obliques.

## Watch Yourself

Before each workout, I’d set up my Mac computer in the front of the room and launch the PhotoBooth application. The app allows you to take pictures and record video. I’m sure Windows has a similar program. The purpose of doing this was to be able to watch myself during the workouts. Sometimes I’d record video, but most of the time I’d just keep the app open so I could see myself doing the moves. This little trick amped up my sessions significantly. Watching yourself allows you to perfect your form, and it also helps you push harder.

## Temperature Tricks

Temperature matters a lot during a workout. If you get too hot, you’ll run out of gas much faster. My two secret weapons for regulating body heat are towels and water. Bring a fresh towel (or two) to every workout. Wiping off your sweat will cool you down quite a bit. Make sure you also have a *cold* bottle of water by your side (use ice!) Feeling the cold water coursing through your body will perk you up. You can also splash your face, or rub a piece of ice across your forehead. Whenever I feel like I can’t continue, I use these simple tricks. A cheap floor fan is also highly recommended.

## Water and Sleep

Get them — consistently. Shoot for at least seven hours of sleep per night. 8–9 is better. Drink water throughout the day. Try to drink your weight in ounces of water, or at least up to a gallon (128 ounces). My secret for achieving this: Get a sturdy water bottle and bring it with you wherever you go. Get one with a widemouth top so you can add ice.

## Eat Right, and Eat a Lot

I wasn’t only relentless about the workout itself. I was also relentless about my eating habits. P90X provides a diet plan, which I followed fairly closely. I then supplemented that with my [ultimate protein shake recipe](https://medium.com/entrepreneurship-happiness-wellness-growth/the-1-000-calorie-protein-shake-201936321b13), as well as a handful of other shakes, drinks, and vitamins. I was eating six meals a day, plus snacks. I was also drinking a ton of water, usually over a gallon a day [5]. As Tony Horton (the creator of P90X) has been known to say, “You can’t drive a car without the fuel.” He’s making an analogy to your body. If you want your body to perform, it needs a full tank of gas. Tony has also said that nutrition is more important than the exercise itself. That makes sense, following the car analogy. A car is useless without the fuel.

## You Need to Want It

Here’s the hard truth: you won’t get results if you don’t want them more than anything else in the world. You have to feel like you’ll die if you don’t succeed. Why? Because you’ll have the urge to quit throughout the program. And if you think it’s okay to quit, you will. So get into the mindset that you can’t stop. Be ready for the shock to your system. Be ready for the dizziness and the nausea and the soreness. Be ready to feel like there’s no way you’ll see that magic number on the scale, or feel your abs rippling through your shirt, or reach Day-90. When you hit that wall of defeat, sit down. Take a break. But only for a few minutes. Then stand back up.

### Notes

[1] Working out at the same time every day is a good rule to follow on weekdays. On weekends, you can plan around whatever else is going on. Working out earlier in the day is ideal. The later it gets, the harder it is to squeeze it in before bed. And, if you’re like me, your energy will sink as the day drags on.

[2] Be careful with this. Don’t place *too* much focus on your rep counts. Remember that intensity is a core ingredient to success. If you increase your rep count by reducing the intensity, you’re not doing yourself any favors. For resistance exercises, you should be struggling with reps 6–10. If you can do more than 10 reps, it’s time to up your weight. And make sure you’re doing each exercise with proper form.

[3] You can also use the PhotoBooth app if you have a Mac computer.

[4] Get a heart rate monitor that you can wear on your wrist. Some brands come with a belt you’re supposed to wear around your torso, which is uncomfortable and cumbersome. The wristband style works fine. You also don’t need an expensive model. I’ve recommended a good, inexpensive option in the link below.

[5] You should also avoid alcohol during the first cycle.

# If You Want To Be Interesting, Be Interested

## If You Want To Be Interesting, Be Interested

### How Searching For Flavor On The Streets Of Dallas Turned Into A Freelance Career In Urbanism

To me, there is nothing more interesting than the city. The people, the stories, the parks, the streets, the rhythm of urban life, and the excitement of the unexpected. There is a gravity that pulls us in whether it’s love, work, or adventure. When we are in it, suddenly we feel bigger than ourselves. Cities are complicated things but we can all grasp their greatness by going out and seeing what we can see.

The essence of the city is on the streets. And now more than ever, we have the capacity to indulge in it and share our experiences through social media. Social media provides an instant connection to people that share a passion—whether it be photography, innovation, design, or pets—and provides an accessible community. As part of a project I’m working on to encourage street life activity, sharing, and social media, I recently posted a “do” on the GOOD social platform: [Observe the City. Snap a Pic, and Publish it Online. Repeat](http://www.good.is/posts/observe-the-city-snap-a-pic-publish-it-online-repeat). The hashtag #CityLifeObservations enables me to source and collect the photos to a [Storify thread](https://storify.com/patrickm02L/city-life-observations).

The project stemmed from my own discovery as an urbanist, which I realized is hugely about on-the-ground observation. For me, observation is the “let’s figure out how things work” phase where you gather insider information, pin-point how systems fit together, and tune in to the nuances that are only apparent when you’re a part of the action. It’s the foundation for creating a narrative about a solution.

Over the past year as a freelance urban planner, I’ve spent a lot of time riding my bike through the city, observing and locating examples of street life, then magnifying them through small-scale events and low-cost projects ranging from community events, small design/builds, and more recently a project to build an urban [Swing Park](http://youtu.be/_a6vrwMbHdc) in an empty parking lot in Dallas. Creating events and building-out projects instantly changes the city. When you’re able to physically demonstrate solutions, you take an idea from a conversation to something tangible. Introducing a new object into the environment fundamentally alters it—suddenly an empty parking lot becomes an experience, and the conversation about how we view the city changes in turn. And by photographing, and sharing these experience you can create a more engaging and meaningful story, enabling you to connect to people on a deeper level.

Most of my contemporaries work at governmental offices, private planning firms, nonprofits and other similar businesses where social media is shunned. It’s not considered part of the job—it’s considered a waste of time and a distraction from the “real work”, but the truth is that it’s integral to relaying ideas, information, and promoting the culture of the business.

The city projects that I’ve created have all come out of problems that I’ve observed and encountered in the field, or things that I’ve seen in other cities that I wish we had in Dallas. Documenting and sharing my ideas naturally turned what I liked to do into a business. I’ve realized that the only difference between brands and companies is the ability to present ideas and getting recognition for them. Over time, the more I documented and showcased what I was seeing, the more my work started to take on an identity and effectively brand itself. Here are three practices that have turned my interests in city life into a brand:

**1. Document Everything**
If you’re doing cool stuff, people want to know about it and they want to access you. For me, the trifecta is Facebook, Twitter, and personal website. At the very least, creating your own Facebook page, separate from your personal page, allows you to showcase your ideas, post pictures, create events, curate articles that relate to your projects, and gain a following that extends beyond your friend group. Also, take lots of pictures—Instagram is great for quick documentation. By documenting everything, you become your own journalist. Learn how spread your ideas, and define your own exposure.

**2. Make it Personal**
Whether getting reprimanded from trying to use chalk on sidewalks or wanting to have more public spaces to enjoy, these inconsistencies in the cityscape have turned into personal vendettas against antiquated codes and have made for great community projects. I always ask myself, “Does it tickle my fancy?” If yes, then I know it’ll be a great project, and I know it will be meaningful because I’m solving problem that I care about.

**3. Get Involved, Meet People, and Interact with Them Regularly**
Social relationships lead to economic ones. Find them on Facebook, Linkedin or Twitter and then engage them in those mediums too. Go to events in your city, especially ones where you know people you want to meet will be, and hen arrange a coffee or lunch meeting afterwards. The face-to-face creates a foundation and social media allows you to keep up with them without always being in their face. I “Like”, “Favorite”, and “Heart” a lot of things, not because I’m trying to appease people, but because I want to support what they’re doing and find out how to interact with them. I had to learn to stop coveting my likes and stop thinking of them as gold nuggets that were only deserving of really great projects. Now, I see social media as a resource about the cool things happening in the city.

Observation is a big component of my role as an urbanist in the city, but it applies to your personal brand too. Documentation is so important! Somebody once told me “Documentation is marketing!” And it’s true. It gets at the difference between brands and companies. When you put your observations out in the world and give people a way to access them, you’re building your own brand. So go out, see what you can observe, publish it, and repeat. Find the flavor. The more you do it, the easier it becomes to create your own.

# WIP&#58; Return of the Release Note

## WIP: Return of the Release Note

Coach.me used to put out an iPhone release every two weeks and for each release I’d write an unbearably long essay describing the theory behind the changes in that release. I miss doing that now that most of our changes are happening outside of the iPhone app.

So.

The release note is returning (at least for today) and I’m calling it Work in Progress (WIP).

Right now we have a lot of WIP. It’s kind of a mess from a messaging standpoint. We have three big releases all happening at basically the same time. And since I’m a stickler for “Release, release, release!” (that phrase will probably be what’s written on my tombstone), we’re going forward with all of them at once.

### Launch #1: VIP

This started two weeks ago. I brought back a private coaching group for people that like my specific philosophy of self-improvement.

Let me describe that philosophy.

* It’s based on a pragmatic experience of learning from what people have tried and succeeded with on Coach.me. Science is a prompt — but you should lean toward applied lessons. I’ll share lessons from more than 50 million attempts at change.

* N of 1. This is some science-y term that means you’re going to need to experiment on yourself. It refers to the size of an experiment. Most people would call an experiment with an N of 1 (i.e. just one participant) an anecdote. But if you’re the 1, then you’re going to call the experiment a huge success. So, I like to give people some breadth of options. I’m probably the most unique in that way since everyone else is making their living from promoting “The one true way.”

* Momentum. Theoretical success is boring — you deserve the real thing. To do that you need to start somewhere and build up momentum. All of Coach.me is built toward this. Habits are the starting point, obviously.

* Full-monty psychology. A change is hard — there’s a lot of behavior design psychology built in to the group that hits at the positive reinforcement level, the identity level, the skill level and more.

* Performance. How do you get more done, be more successful, have a bigger impact on the world? This isn’t a good coaching group to be in if you want to be happier (a worthy goal — but not my specialty).

The group spends four weeks on a topic.

[Join right now and you’ll be starting on Week #3](https://www.coach.me/plans/467818-coach-me-vip-program) of using personality testing to get ahead on your own goals and in your own relationships. Use the code VIPJUNE to get the first week free.

Next up, we have a coaching module on single tasking. So, before you keep reading, I’d really like to encourage you to join the VIP group. I love the coaching that way and if you give it a few weeks, I’m positive you’ll see big changes in your life.

### Launch #2: Coaching Membership

We’ve had 8,500 coaches join our platform and until recently we’ve been optimized for the much smaller handful who wanted to be part of our coaching programs: habit & leadership.

This week we’re switching over to a membership program that will work better for all coaches. The highlights are a platform for handling almost all forms of coaching products and tons of marketing support.

A coach should be an expert in humanity. We want to handle the logistical details of having a great website, managing billing and subscriptions, and building tools to make your coaching more scalable.

A coach also is a one person business. This is usually the hardest part of being a coach and we think we have marketing tools to make it easier and much, much more successful.

We had a whole heated philosophical debate before launching this program. There were two concerns. Basically, most of the money in coaching is currently made by people preying on other coaches. We tried exceptionally hard to have fair and affordable pricing. Where most entries into coaching start at $5,000, ours starts at $99.

The second concern was just about mission. Our mission is to make a difference in human potential.

There’s a phrase I’ve been telling myself but haven’t even shared with anyone on the Coach.me team, “The customer is the client, even when the customer is the coach.”

I mean that serving coaches is a way to change lives and we shouldn’t forget that even when coaches are offering us money. Best example would be coaches paying to be featured — that would go against serving the best interests of the client.

### Launch #3: A freakin’ book

In the middle of all this, we wrote a business book.

Per our normal product development ways, we wrote a draft, started using it, put it on Amazon, and then ended up changing the title. That last bit triggered an ISBN change.

So now, we’re launching the FINAL version of Meeting Mastery. This is an important primer for all managers.

I use the meeting and facilitation tactics in this book to overcome all of my other management deficiencies. And if you think you’re good at management then you’re kidding yourself. Working with people is an impossible task that you can only hope to do better than you used to.

The book is live on Amazon and is a core part of our first business certification, also called Meeting Mastery.

So, if you want hands on management training from an expert business coach, [sign up here](https://www.coach.me/leadership/modules/meeting-mastery).

And if you want to buy and read our book before we officially announce it, [buy it here from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Meeting-Mastery-Coach-me-Leaders-Meetings/dp/1533326061/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1465260942&sr=8-1&keywords=meeting+mastery).

There’s so much in the above that I can hardly tie it together. As simply as I can, we’re working on coaching as a new, dominant form of education.

We can bring the cost of coaching down to be price competitive to whatever you use to improve yourself now, i.e. books, videos, classes.

The magic of having a coach though is that the improvements you make in your life will be 100x greater. If you want to do a back-of-the-envelope check of that claim start by listing all the books you bought but never opened.

A coach is guaranteed change. That’s why I’m excited.

The above launches have two parts about demonstrating new, scalable ways to coach and one part about getting more coaches online.

# How to Train Anger Into a Power For Good

## Anger is not your enemy. In fact, it may be your best ally.

![Brutus.](1*Gj6wzU3ukdV-dEiZ1nYCqQ.png)*Brutus.*

*Meet Brutus. Brutus is a watchdog. The Smiths had bought him when he was just a pup, and sent him off to dog-school to train in the art of biting, growling and everything watchdog. His main purpose was to protect the Smiths and their home from intruders.*

*Billy, their son, had grown up with Brutus. They were best friends, and — because Brutus was very vigilant, Billy had a carefree childhood — he never had to worry about any danger; not even the mailman would dare set foot on their property. Whenever Billy went to the park, Brutus would go with, fending off any potential bullies.*

*Today, at age 25, Billy and Brutus are still best friends. Sadly, though, Billy doesn’t have many other friends. You see, Brutus had trouble distinguishing between ‘intruder’ and ‘friendly’. He was great at protecting Billy, but couldn’t switch his defensive instinct off: he would growl, bite or attack anyone who may just be giving Billy a strange glance.*

*Billy was safe, but also very lonely.*

Just like Billy and Brutus, we all have an internal watchdog: **Anger**. When we sense a threat, our anger kicks-in as our protection.

* For some of us, this watchdog is sleeping: we don’t get angered easily, and as a result, we may even be taken advantage of.

* For others, our watchdogs are like Brutus: easily triggered, and ready to annihilate real *and* imagined enemies.

### Re-training the watchdog

![](1*r5dkI5Z0tLD-eCbC7lEyJg.png)

It’s hard to train an angry dog. If you move too fast, you might lose a hand. That’s why many of us don’t even try — we just tie it up in the backyard. After all, an uncontrolled dog is ‘dangerous’. The problem with a tied-up watchdog, though, is that it’s useless as a protector, and downright dangerous when the leash snaps.
> # If we view anger as only dangerous, we handle it in the same way: one too many outbursts, and anger gets muzzled, leashed and caged like a bad dog. At best, it gets suppressed, and at worst, we snap. We forget that anger’s main purpose is not to attack, but to protect.

This is key.

Until you start seeing the positive value of your emotions, any anger-management program will merely be an attempt to keep it in-check. It’s like the difference between a foam-at-the-mouth leashed mutt, and a well-disciplined, free-walking purebred that can ‘Sit’ ‘Lie down’ or ‘Attack!’ with a single command.

## Why we get angry

Like every other emotion, anger is there to serve us: it’s our warning system, mobilizing us to stand up for our values. You get angry when your value-system, ego, family, or even your actual life are under threat. Your brain activates the Fight-response: adrenaline rushes through your veins, your heart-rate shoots up and your muscles get pumped, ready to punch or break anything that stands in your way.
> # At its best, anger is neither suppressed nor destructive. It is protective, and the fuel for love and compassion.

For we protect what we love. And we will fight for those we love. 
This kind of anger takes practice.

## How anger works

Try this: switch on your anger. Count to three, and get angry. Go!

Can you do it? Anger has no on/off button. And yet, when you get cut off on the highway, you can go from Dalai Llama into Genghis Kahn in a matter of seconds.

Now, try this: close your eyes, and think back to the last time you were angry — really angry. Remember the scene:

* What happened?

* Who was involved?

* What did they do?

* What were the sights, smells, sounds?

Visualize the situation clearly in your mind. What happened in you? What sensations did you feel? Did you shout something? Re-run the words in your mind.

As you do this, start paying attention to what you feel in your body right now: is your breath changing? Accentuate that. If you feel your muscles tensing, turn up the volume by tensing them up more. If your fists or jaw are tightening, clench them even more.

Mentally walk through the whole event again, and, as the physical sensations arise, turn up the volume of each sensation by exaggerating that sensation.

Are you starting to feel that anger rise up now?

Anger lives in your body and your brain. It’s exact GPS coordinates are located in the limbic system: the feeling / instinctive part of your brain. This feeling part of your brain is controlled by your cortex / thinking brain, but, if you feel threatened, your feeling brain moves so fast, there’s no chance for your thinking brain to control it. It switches instantaneously into protect! Attack!

Before you know it, you’re throwing plates across the kitchen.

If we slow down that moment, it happens as follows:

1. The situation happens.

1. Your senses perceive the situation.

1. Your senses trigger a story or internal belief-system in your mind.

1. Your mind perceives this as THREAT!

1. The physiological process is activated, overriding your thinking brain.

1. You act out in anger.

It all happens so fast, that, unless we slow it down, we won’t be able to disarm the f-bombs that follow.

## How to retrain anger

Anger is accessed through two pathways: story and sensation.

### **1. The Story**

The stories in your mind is what makes you angry: not the situation. The same situation can happen to two people, and one would get angry, and the other would not. Why? Because the way one person’s mind makes meaning of the situation, is what triggers their anger.

Through structured journaling, you can disarm this anger. You need to do this outside of the heated situation, to really get the benefit from it. This can be difficult, as it will require you to face very challenging internal emotions.
The purpose of the exercise is to get to the root of your anger. What is anger protecting? Turn the lights on**, **and see how deep you can go.

### Journaling questions:

*What did I get angry about?
*Eg. I snapped at the idiot taxi-driver who pulled in front of me. I drove like a bloody imbicile! I don’t even know where the hell they they their licences!

*What emotions were behind anger?
*Eg. I had a fright: he pulled in front of me, and I had to hit the brakes. I think I was just surprised or shocked, and then immediately snapped at him. They make me so angry! I hate it when people don’t watch where they’re going!

*What else was behind anger?**
***Eg. I felt scared: I almost made an accident, and I don’t have the money to pay for another incident. I feel like this guy was disrespectful, and put both our lives in danger! He doesn’t even think about the fact that I have 2 kids I have to look after.

*What else was behind anger?
*Eg. [Feeling my chest with my hand, breathing, and re-connecting to the experience]. I felt weak, out of control: I was driving at a safe speed, but this guy just veered in front of me. I felt completely powerless, like: if he was 2 seconds later, that would’ve been it.

*What else was behind anger?
*Eg. I think that’s it: I felt disrespected, weak, out of control, unsafe, scared, powerless. I am responsible to my family to be safe, and I need other drivers to do the same.

*What was the most useful response?**
***In this situation, it’s probably just deep breathing, and focusing on keeping it together. There is nothing I can do in the moment, to change someone else’s driving, except be mindful of my own.

### 2. **Sensation**

The second component of anger is sensation. It’s what you actually feel in your body. When you get angry, your body is in “fight and flee”-mode. The way out of it, is to get the body back into the “rest and digest”-mode. Activities that help with this process, include:

* *Deep breathing*: Put your hand on your tummy, and breathe towards your hand. Focus only on breathing for at least 5 to 10 breaths.

* *Distract yourself*: Preferably with something physical, outside, and grounding, that reconnects you with your environment.

* *Grounding*: Take off your shoes, walk around the park or on the lawn — paying attention to the fact that you are solid on the ground tells your mind that you are safe.

### Quick Saves:

When you get angry you need an exit-plan — or a few exit plans. Here they are:

* Yell “Stop!” loudly in your thoughts, to interrupt the cycle of anger

* If you feel like lashing out, count down from 20 before answering. Breathe deeply during this time.

* Take time-out. You are allowed to do this! In the middle of a heated argument, just ask for a time-out. Go for a walk, clear your head, allow your body to recover to baseline.

* Meditate for 5 minutes (There are many very useful apps to guide you in a mindfulness meditation)

## In Summary

* Anger is there to **protect**, not to harm.

* To train anger, you will need to approach it from two angles: **Sensation and Story.**

* The first step is doing thorough **self-exploration through structured journaling.**

* The second step is to incorporate** physical practices that help you calm down.**

* If journaling doesn’t get you to the root-causes of your anger, you can [**see a coach.](https://www.coach.me/originalintent?ref=0rRdw)**

* If your coach gets stuck, they may refer you to a therapist to uncover some deeper stories that may come from your past.

# How I Lost 12 Pounds In My Month Of Whole 30

## How I Lost 12 Pounds In My Month Of Whole 30
> # “You cannot “out-exercise” poor food choices and the resulting hormonal disruption.” — Melissa Hartwig

Two years ago my doctor told me if I didn’t change my health regimen, I wouldn’t live very long. What followed the drastic wake-up call was [a long journey](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-i-lost-40-pounds-in-my-50s-and-how-you-can-too-9961f781194d) towards finding a healthier diet, losing weight, and getting more exercise. A key part of my recovery from that crisis was to experiment with different diets.

Until then I had consumed what has been referred to as the “Standard American Diet.” A diet that was rich is red meat, dairy, sugar, and processed food. I knew that this was not a healthy way to eat, but I didn’t know how to change it, or what to change it to. In lack of a good go-to option, I just started to test several popular diets, trying to find a healthy long-term solution.

One of my first experiments was the Whole 30 Program. I experimented with the Whole 30 Program during the month of July 2017. By the end of the month, I had lost 12 pounds, 2 inches around my waist, and felt much better than I did at the beginning of the month.

Today, I am sharing my experience with this program to help you make a more informed decision as to whether or not this might be the right program for you.

```
Note: I am not a nutritionist or a healthcare professional. The information that I am about to share is based on my own experience and results during my month on the program.What Is The Whole 30 Program?
```


The Whole 30 is not a diet or even a weight-loss plan. Yes, plenty of people lose weight on Whole 30, but that is not the purpose of the program. From [*The Whole 30: The 30 Day Guide to Total Health and Food Freedom](https://whole30.com/whole30book/)*:
> “The Whole 30 is not a diet. It’s not a quick fix. It’s not even a weight loss program. The Whole 30 is designed to change your life and your relationship with food. It’s a monumental transformation in how you think about food, your body, your life, and what you want out of the time you have left on earth.”

The real purpose of the Whole 30 Program is to give your body a chance to heal from the foods that have been proven to cause inflammation and other digestive-related health issues. It’s more about transforming your eating habits than losing weight. One of the things that attracted me to the Whole 30 Program was the promise that I could change the way I think about food.

The Whole 30 Program is a strict elimination program. It bans all dairy, grains, legumes, soy, alcohol, sugar, and any processed foods from your diet. It is so strict that if you cheat just once, you must start the program over from day one.

After the initial 30 days, you slowly reintroduce the foods that were banned by the program. This allows you to discover any food sensitivities and learn how your body reacts to certain foods during the reintroduction phase.

## Why The Whole 30?

I first heard about the program in May or June of 2017, when I noticed several friends discussing their results on Facebook. I found the concept to be really interesting at a time when I had to do something drastic to improve my health.

The thought of eating a diet consisting of only fruit, veggies, meat, eggs, nuts and seeds for a month didn’t really excite me, but I was curious to see how my body would respond to only eating healthy food for a month.

I had also read that over 70% of your immune system resides in your [gut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351/). If your gut is out of balance, and you’re fighting a chronic illness, it makes sense to try and restore gut health in order to create a better immune system. Or would it? With the promise of a healthier life and a stronger immune system, I dove right into the Whole 30 Program.

It was only for 30-days, right? However, my wife and I had decided to take a 1-week vacation during this time, which made it harder to stick to the diet than I initially thought. I quickly learned that it’s not easy to maintain the Whole30 Program when you are eating out for every meal. She quickly became annoyed by my restaurant choices; Outback for steak and vegetables, Five Guy’s for burgers without a bun, Boston Market for roasted chicken.

Needless to say, she wasn’t a happy camper and it wasn’t much of a vacation for her but we made it work.

## What Can You Eat On The Whole 30 Program?

The general guidelines are no dairy, grains, legumes, soy, alcohol, sugar, or any processed foods. But here are some of the specifics that worked for me:

* **Breakfast:** My favorite breakfast was a 3 egg omelette with baby spinach and whatever other vegetables that were leftover from the night before. It was easy to beat a couple of eggs, throw them in a pan, and add some veggies. Some of you may argue that I was eating a lot of eggs, but they are a good source of protein and it was only for 30-days.

* **Lunch:** At the time, I worked in a major hospital with an awesome cafeteria. It was easy to get a grilled chicken breast and some grilled veggies, which is what I ate most days. They also had a large salad bar, which allowed me to break up the monotony of the chicken and veggies.

* **Dinner:** For dinner we ate a lot of tilapia, salmon, steak and chicken with roasted or steamed vegetables. It wasn’t exciting but it met my dietary needs and I didn’t get a lot of complaints from my wife and daughter.

* **Snacks:** Snacks were a problem for me. One of favorite snacks is cheese, but dairy was not allowed in the program. One of the most recommended snacks is nuts, but I can’t have them because I have diverticulosis. My fall back was celery with almond butter. It seem to fill me up while meeting the requirements of the Whole 30 plan but it was pretty boring.

* **Drinks:** I gave up coffee, one of my favorite drinks, for the month because I didn’t enjoy it without cream and sugar. I drank a ton of water, sparkling water, and tea.

My diet wasn’t very exciting, but it fueled my body and met the requirements of the program.

## What Was My Experience Like?

I started the first week of the program feeling very optimistic. How hard could it be to eat only healthy foods? Turns out *very* hard. The first day was great, but by the second day I was experiencing severe sugar withdrawal. This combined with a lack of carbohydrates was causing symptoms similar to the Keto Flu.

If you have ever tried the Keto diet, you can relate to what I was experiencing: a severe headache, mental fogginess, dizziness, and aggravation. The things that you experience while adjusting to the diet during the first few days of the Keto program. This is sometimes referred to as the Keto Flu.

These symptoms caused the first week to be the hardest week of the entire program. One thing that I learned during the first week was how many of the foods that we eat contain sugar. It forced me to look at every single ingredient in the food label to make sure that there wasn’t any sugar in my food.

By the beginning of the second week, I was feeling much better, all of my symptoms were gone and I wasn’t craving sugary snacks. I was feeling better and actually sleeping better. Unfortunately, I was eating pretty much the same foods every day which was already getting boring.

The second week came and went, and the third week was pretty much the same. I was sleeping better, feeling better, and my clothes were looser. I was even getting used to eating the same old boring foods.

That all changed when I reached the fourth week. The closer I got to the finish line, the more I craved the foods I loved. The ones that were the worst for my body. All I could think of was a deep dish pepperoni pizza.

Regardless, I made it through the 30 days and finished the program. During the 30-day program, I had lost a total of 12 pounds and a couple of inches around my waist. I felt better and I was sleeping much better.

## Is The Whole 30 Diet Right For You?

The Whole 30 is not for everyone. In fact, [US News & World Reports](https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/whole30-diet) ranked the Whole 30 Program number 37 out of 39 diets that it evaluated, criticizing it for a lack of substantial scientific research backing it up:
> “No independent research. Nonsensical claims. Extreme. Restrictive. The slams against Whole 30 came in strong from our panelists, and it tied with the Raw Food Diet as the worst of the worst for healthy eating.”

Many nutritionists believe that the Whole 30 is not a healthy long-term diet. It is something that you will have to think about if you decide to try the program.

My thinking was, “It’s only for 30 days, I can do pretty much anything for 30 days.” Living without grains, dairy, and sugar for 30 days wasn’t going to kill me. For me, it was more of a psychological battle, and I don’t believe that it is as harmful as some opponents want us to believe.

Ultimately, only you can decide if the Whole 30 Program is for you. But for me it was worth a shot and helped me on my journey towards finding a diet that’s right for me.

# Everything I Know About Being Spectacular

## Everything I Know About Being Spectacular

### Not very much.

The weight is so heavy. From birth. Expectations of performance. Delivery. Stardom. I don’t even have children, but I dream about them being amazing. Better than everyone else. Vikings of the modern era.

Spectacular.

Call it aptitude (25lbs). Call it talent (50lbs). Call it a gift (1,000lbs). Call it genius (1ton). It’s a burden carried lightly, at best. I believe that a lot of talented-gifted-geniuses guise the weight of being spectacular in a shroud of routine, of diligence or servitude. Serving your variety of spectacular can gain the greatest reward. For those who things come easily, there needs to be work. The best disguise for tricking yourself into not having the weight of being spectacular is to downgrade it to [routine and efficiency](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-aGPniFvS0). Like swimming gives us weightlessness, we still put forth the effort into each stroke, however unburdened, ever so slightly, by the weight of the world.

I always dream of being better than myself. Yet, I don’t know how to achieve this superior version of myself. I keep trying though. Testing the waters of where I can gain accolades. It’s actually quite masochistic and perpetuates a melancholy atmosphere like [Linus Van Pelt](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7uyA2oYUILI/TW6CQauYKnI/AAAAAAAAA18/0ynIXrwikt4/s400/linus.jpg), so I drag my perceived unspectacularness around me like a weighted fishing lure, waiting for something spectacular to attach itself to my line.

But what does it all mean? Being spectacular. The gamut of spectacular runs from the precious mother who documents and projects your every move upon the fridge. Magnetized. To the self-loathing, never is good good-enough perfectionist, to the focused and driven minds of the eccentric oft not recognized savant, to the heavily laureled and praised mediocre. Point being: if spectacular is a state of mind, is it our own perception that needs to change? The ever existential crisis of expectations.

[How am I not myself?](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mayov4K0IL1rh5mp6o1_500.gif)

I think the most self aware are those who constantly question who it is they are. Redefining. Because ‘spectacular’ is never enough. It’s never good enough. It’s rough. But we endure the mundane. For it’s not for us to decide the fate of perceived spectacularity. The saddest part of being (not being) spectacular is that you’ll never be anything you percieve because your achievements will always lie in the eye of the beholder and we are not the beholden.

Ungrateful bastards are we.

# It’s So Good I Might Eat the Wrapper

## — My Newest, Most Favorite On-The-Go Healthy Snack —

Ok, so you’re running late because Father Time played a trick on your smart phone/watch and you don’t have time to cook food before you leave. (And you realize you don’t want to stop at McDonalds on the road.)

Or, you’re planning for a trip and you want to pack some healthy snacks for your next roadtrip. Because by the time you’re on the road (Like I am as I write this-see photo- I’m on the left.) it’s too late.

![](1*ET-yyUn6PyHHaYrbEPe5Pg.jpeg)

And you are a health nut or at least you TRY to be conscious about what you out in your pie hole.

BUT… you’re tired of just grabbing nuts, grass fed beef sticks or some sort of veggie snack.

What do you do?

Most of the “nutrition/protein bars” out there just aren’t doing the trick.

They are usually not as “healthy” as they claim to be, because they’re caked with crappy, sometimes unpronounceable or just plain misleading ingredients, like “Natural Flavors” (IE beaver Anus extract. serious, google it).

OR they taste like garbage.

Now unless you like the taste of cardboard (I guess that would be recycling, not garbage) or you have a Backdoor Beaver Fetish, you’re going to want something different.

There are a few I’ve done in the past, like 22 Days and maybe KIND bars or a few others (names aren’t coming to me) but I’ve been looking for something new.

I’m happy to share I don’t have to look ANY further!! And neither do you.

Introducing, Bulletproof’s New Pasture-Raised Upgraded Collagen Protein Bar. They’re so good you just might eat the wrapper! Plus they have Chocolate or Vanilla. Smile for choices! :-)

![](1*I_I1-z9eL4oQQcL2KZFLpw.jpeg)

Serious. So good. And the Nutrition Facts & ingredients? Amazing. High Healthy Fat, from Organic Cashew Butter, Dave Asprey’s MCT/Brain Octane Oil, Coconut Oil and solid 11 Grams of Pasture-Raised Collagen Protein, with only 2 grabs of sugar and 15G of carbs.

But let’s be honest- you might care more about the taste then the healthfulness. At least sometimes. And that’s what’s great about these. They taste like there are Graham’s crackers in there from the cashews and other amazingness. But that’s just my opinion- go try them yourself over at UpgradedSelf.com. (Should be under the “Protein” tab.) But watch out, you can easily spend a good couple hundred on his amazing products. #YouGetWhatYouPayFor #HealthYeah

Ok- I better get back to the road as Co-Pilot. Or better yet, I may eat the second bar I brought! Stay hungry for real food, my friends. And let’s keep this Real food, nutrition movement up!

-T-to-the-J Anderson

PS- Let me know if you end up grabbing these bars and how you like them. Or feel free to share other comments about other healthy bars you’ve found or new healthy snack foods you like!

PPS- This post was written on my IPhone. Please excuse any grammar mistakes or poor flow. I actually thought it wasn’t half bad for a quick 20 Minute write up! Simple, humorous, and to the point. Hope you enjoyed it! :-)

**One More Thing**

Che cos’hanno in comune il più grande comunicatore e manager visionario con il più simpatico e originale personaggio televisivo?

«Just one more thing…»

Una frase ricorrente del tenente Columbo — italianizzato con un più credibile”Colombo” — nell’impeccabile interpretazione di Peter Falk con cui l’apparentemente svampito ma straordinariamente abile ad osservare i dettagli, a collegare gli indizi e comprendere la psicologia dei suoi “clienti” in un mondo fatto di cliché. Sembra quasi sempre che si sia detto tutto quello che c’è da dire quando, quell’ulteriore dettaglio quell’ultima sbadata “cosetta” provoca la reazione a catena di tutte le esche disseminate per tutto l’episodio.

![](1*7a6aJ6LY9p1XFPO7uVhVQQ.jpeg)

Una tecnica in tutto e per tutto simile era quella adottata da Steve Jobs nei suoi Keynote, quando distrattamente, già con un piede fuori dalla porta o addirittura un breve periodo dopo la conclusione, tornava sui suoi passi, proprio come Peter Flak proferendo di sfuggita quella frase: “One more Thing…”

“Think different” sta bene non solo addosso al vestire ossessivamente casual dell’iCEO, ma anche a quello casualmente sgualcito del tenente italo-americano.

Un piccolo uomo iconoclasta fra i potenti: una condizione che caratterizza il ruolo del manager intermedio in questo periodo di T-Rex in cui bisogna mascherarsi da Volpi per sopravvivere. Ulisse nella spelonca di Polifemo: questa è l’iconografia allegorica del manager intermedio di questi tempi.

A lui, come al prosciutto o al formaggio fra le fette del toast spetta di dare il gusto al sandwich, tocca dare significato umanamente riconoscibile alle organizzazioni leviataniche di questo tramonto capitalistico.

![](1*y9OxG18HIbJpbiM6Gy35-w.jpeg)

La figura del tenente Colombo andrebbe studiata con attenzione a chi tocca questo scomodo compito. Il suo è un vero e proprio metodo che parte da una presunzione il più delle volte confermata dai fatti, ovvero che nell’ambiente dei potenti esiste:

* una fondamentale presunzione data dalla posizione che si occupa

* il pregiudizio che con i soldi si ottiene tutto

* l’arroganza di non poter essere giudicato e di riuscire a scamparla sempre e comunque

* la stupidità di valutare l’altro basandosi dalle apparenze

* l’assunzione di mentire sempre e comunque soprattutto di fronte all’evidenza

* la convinzione di essere il più intelligente del reame

* il presupposto che la vita altrui non conti nulla

* una vanità tale che porta a confessare se questo porta a compiacere il proprio narcisismo

* uno disprezzo fondamentale verso gli impiegati, specie se statali

![](1*faJMu64zsIvnoeDJaJoMUQ.png)

Il tenente Colombo sfrutta con abilità le caratteristiche dei suoi polli di lusso, sparsi fra Beverly Hill, le colline di Hollywood, e le coste attorno a Los Angeles che non chiedono altro che abboccare ad un facilone pronto a lusingarli.

### **Il manager “Columbo-Style”**

**La moglie, il cane, l’auto, il soprabito del burino**

![](1*OFlMix19q_MEfxe0X2rF-w.jpeg)

Colombo è il ritratto della **sostenibilità **fatta persona. Il suo stile dimesso e il suo fare da poveraccio per di più dagli ascendenti italo-terricoli fanno di lui in realtà il ritratto stesso dell’onestà che stona in maniera esasperata con i lustrini della sgargiante e pomposa ricchezza dei luoghi dove gli omicidi si svolgono. Non c’è una volta che **sprechi **qualcosa. Se c’è del cibo che avanza nella scena del crimine lui non manca di fargli onore. Perché cambiare auto se quella che ha, non solo è diventata a misura della sua persona, ma per di più non c’è pericolo neppure che vada troppo veloce?

![](1*6NjEiKYniRiebFV6TA6JXg.jpeg)

Con questa apparenza le persone che incontra, che invece proprio sull’apparire basano i loro giudizi, hanno difficoltà a pensare che non si tratti di un barbone, ma di un poliziotto e per di più un tenente, il che gli permette di assistere quasi inosservato ai retroscena, a cogliere, non tanto quello che gli si vuole presentare, quanto i **segnali deboli **di un ambiente che non gliel’avrebbe permesso se non lo avesse talmente sottovalutato. I suoi migliori confidenti sono le comparse e gli attori non protagonisti che possono parlare a lui come ad un pari confidandogli dettagli che non sarebbero mai entrati in ballo in un colloquio con un agente di polizia.

![](1*ytWaYrnxWZJnEiTWXZjrdQ.jpeg)

Lui tira in ballo la moglie mitica quanto invisibile e il cane più bolso del padrone e in questo modo fa perdere il filo del discorso a colpevoli e testimoni e li fa recitare a soggetto — proprio quello che non avrebbero voluto fare! Il suo stile è quello del **discorso di circostanza**, quello che si fa in coda all’ufficio postale, al banco del mercato o sull’ascensore: per questo il manager Columbo è invisibile e può raccogliere ulteriori segnali deboli che sfuggono al criminale che invece si era concentrato sulla trama anziché sul contesto. Columbo invece è un grande intenditore, ricostruttore e narratore di contesti del tutto indifferenti alla trama, proprio come i suoi discorsi apparentemente sconclusionati sono tutti permeati di contestualità, senza arrivare quasi mai al dunque, se non quando deve, del tutto casualmente e distrattamente tirare le sue conclusioni per potere in santa pace riprendere a sfumazzare il suo sigaro puzzolente più volte spento e riacceso.

**«Ma è di nuovo lei?»**

![](1*nUOp8B-cK2OH_9FujWiQTQ.jpeg)

Il nostro tenente sarebbe stato buttato fuori ogni volta dai suoi indagati, non fosse che lui non si reca mai sul posto per aggredire frontalmente un problema, ma solo perché voleva chiedere un favore per la moglie o perché aveva dimenticato qualcosa e di fronte a tanto stucchevole candore come si fa a tirarsi indietro. Nessuna convocazione, nessuna riunione ufficiale così nessuno lo ha mai spedito via. È lui a scegliere il momento più opportuno per interrogare e soprattutto lo fa **sul campo **e **osserva i fatti, anziché la loro ricostruzione.**

Columbo non avrebbe mai accettato una tabella, un prospetto, un grafico. Per lui, non solo le persone non potevano essere numeri, ma neppure nomi e cognomi, ma storie, tic, risorse, impedimenti, relazioni… Così, distrattamente, tanto per fare due parole.

![](1*wciTEYE7RX8ysDqKJmXZiw.jpeg)

Nello stesso modo in cui la sua affettuosità e l’ammirazione a fronte di tanta ostentazione finiscono presto dimenticate, nello stesso modo la sua pena per le vittime non è mai scandalosa e chiede spesso scusa quando deve arrestare qualcuno perché, nella sua stupidità, aveva visto qualcosa che al genio ricco era sfuggito. Colombo non pensa neppure un solo momento di avere avuto successo nel suo lavoro.

**Non ho perso un suo film; che bel soprammobile, a che cosa serve? Lei che è così bravo mi spieghi anche se non saprò mai capire quella cosa che non riesco neanche a pronunciare**

![](1*5ONXnQvgEOV2UGC9uwRUzQ.jpeg)

Non lo vediamo mai con una pistola in mano, né gli sentiamo sciorinare astruse teorie criminologiche o da profiler come nei telefilm dell’ultima ora. Il profiler è lui nel suo creare ogni volta occasioni perché la persona importante si racconti. Il suo è il tipico **atteggiamento complementare **(Watzlawick &c) che si contrappone a quello tipicamente simmetrico del poliziotto per definizione ”*contro*”.

![](1*xuKFTLN5TPt2y1vPAN-0Pw.png)

Penso che questo sia l’insegnamento più importante del management del tenente Colombo: il suo stile consiste nel lavorare sempre CON, addirittura al servizio, non solo delle vittime e delle famiglie, non solo delle forze dell’ordine… lui lavora CON i clienti e soprattutto CON i concorrenti, i colpevoli! In questo Columbo è assolutamente Zen e la sua è la tecnica del Judo illustrata dalla psicologia umanistica.

**Un taccuino dove non riesco mai a trovare, ma dove c’è tutto**

Colombo non è uno schiavo della tecnologia, anzi si giustifica sempre con il fatto che non ci capisce niente. Poi, invece, usando un metodo di **similitudini analogiche **finisce per scovare i buchi che le procedure saccenti non prevedono.

![](1*UsA1mYTpcc6bQhGCCLRpjg.jpeg)

Lui non lavora alla scrivania: consulta il suo smartphone dell’epoca, ovvero un taccuino anche lui sdrucito dove c’è tutto, anche se ogni volta sembra avere perso un pezzo. Questo vuol dire che, intanto le informazioni le ha sempre dietro, è un professionista nomade e non da ufficio, **non adotta la separazione di informazioni e compiti**, ma ha sempre con se la sua strategia, usa supporti pratici e personali, ha un sistema di siglatura e di ricerca personali (**codici**), si appunta tutto senza dare nulla per scontato, nemmeno la propria memoria, **nonostante rimanga lui stesso il suo sapere e nessun archivio **né informatico né cartaceo. Ha lo stesso atteggiamento bivalente nei confronti del taccuino che ha nei confronti della tecnologia e che molti professionisti oggi avrebbero nei confronti di smartphone e tablet.

![](1*e1SqLIXDmEACc7_uQLDkag.jpeg)

![](1*ddhYz94cfNqkVvcYHtipmg.jpeg)

Tuttavia, non solo lo usa ma è una propaggine di sé: **lì ha tutta l’indagine e la capisce solo lui. **Colombo è un piccolo Wozniak, un hacker randagio, dal soprabito brutto ma pieno di scomparti dove trovano posto tanti oggetti; un telelavoratore mobile che è un piccolo ufficio ambulante, ma sempre in contatto con il suo gruppo, nonostante prima che inventassero i telefoni cellulari ci sarebbero voluti ancora vent’anni.

**Arrivederci… ah, ci sarebbe solo ancora una cosa che non mi convince…**

![](1*98QTa_tv13KBxfsjaIgpQg.jpeg)

Quello che il personaggio di Peter Falk sa fare meglio è anche fare sentire a proprio agio, non solo i testimoni, ma anche coloro che il suo istinto gli ha fatto comprendere fin da subito essere colpevoli. Raramente la sua esperienza lo inganna, ma la sua modestia gli consente anche di **non cadere nel pregiudizio **e di **imparare sempre dai propri errori.**

Colombo non è un manuale fatto e finito, ma piuttosto un “**sistema aperto**”, come un *work in progress. *Pur avendo un metodo per procedere tutt’altro che approssimativo, direi piuttosto estremamente rigoroso, tiene lente le redini del dialogo lasciando che siano le informazioni ad accedere liberamente, **invece di essere lui a costringerle a venire fuori in base a quello che pensa possa servirgli. **Ecco, dunque, che arrivano dettagli del tutto estranei all’ordito e per questo lui, da esperto giocatore di Scala 40, **non scende nessuna carta fino a che non ha chiuso in mano.**

![](1*EqFFB1DUVKVdlnt8Z4M-DA.jpeg)

È allora che, con il solito coup de theatre del guitto consumato tira fuori quel dettaglio che collega tutto e che lascia del tutto impreparato il colpevole che scopre di essere sotto scacco matto proprio nel momento in cui era sicuro che il gioco fosse da tempo risolto a suo favore.

**Un tenente che fa squadra**

Dicevamo prima che Colombo-Falck non ostenta mai un comportamento da poliziotto di successo. Mai una volta che abbia con i suoi un comportamento del tipo “lei non sa chi sono io”.

![](1*ZfTU69Z5be5gv_Bb_S2AyQ.jpeg)

Non si preoccupa troppo dei superiori e non ha un eccessivo timore di essere licenziato anche se pure lui si trova a dover dire qualche signorsì indigesto che poi però trova sempre il modo di aggirare assieme alle rigidità burocratiche. **Colombo tira dritto per la sua strada**, porta avanti il suo lavoro e non si aspetta premi o carriera, per questo non teme punizioni. Potrebbe preoccuparsi se non fosse capace di fare il proprio compito o se avesse un ruolo superiore che per quattro soldi lo costringerebbe a scendere a compromessi tutt’altro che professionali. Per questo non diventerebbe mai capitano e neppure lo vorrebbe: **ha una sua nicchia in un ecosistema **che non ha particolari anticorpi per i pesci piccoli come lui, ma che al contempo, a patto di non apparire troppo, gli consente di muoversi abbastanza indisturbato — e per questa sua **integrità di piccolo-grande uomo **viene spesso rispettato dagli stessi colpevoli nei confronti dei quali non di rado egli stesso prova rispetto: è il gioco delle parti, in fondo!

![](1*jsZdXxjjLa7JqYyVZt1NDA.jpeg)

Che sia lui che comanda lo si comprende piuttosto da come lo trattano i suoi collaboratori: nessuno che lo tema o che mostri soggezione all’autorità. Semplicemente lo rispettano, gli **riconoscono l’autorevolezza **e sanno che lui ha in testa uno scenario d’insieme che a loro è precluso ma del quale saranno presto partecipi. Nelle non troppo frequenti scene del back-office si coglie un capo collaborativo che **sa assegnare **compiti e obiettivi nella maniera più naturale possibile. **Ognuno fa la sua parte **come deve e quando questo non accade se ne risente ma senza perdere il controllo o il filo del suo pensiero. E comunque, il nostro tenente non guarda mai la scena dalla torre, essendo alla fine quello che lavora in prima linea come e più degli altri e per questo non potrà mai essere altro che rispettato dai colleghi (il boccone più duro da mandare giù sono caso mai i burocrati che comandano dalla sua parte — ma si evince che alla fine si tratta).

Quando i collaboratori entrano in gioco è quasi sempre con un disegno nascosto, una trappola per l’assassino e alla fine sono tutti attorno a lui, anche se nessuno di loro esce a testa alta: *un altro lavoro fatto, possiamo tornare a casa.*

### **Un Columbo del terzo millennio? Delle F.a.q.**

![](1*ZjgKWuESizviaHobAJXcdw.jpeg)

Q: «Colombo come modello manageriale?»

A: Personalmente ne sono profondamente convinto.

Q: «Come tradurre questa descrizione in istruzioni?»

A: Sono certo che chi deve capire ha già capito e che chi non ha capito non se ne farebbe niente mai.

Q: «Allora, facciamo finta che io abbia capito, ma secondo te c’è ancora posto per un Manager Colombo nell’economia di oggi?»

A: «Voglio solo sperarlo, perché il tenente Colombo è l’ultimo baluardo di resistenza prima della guerra; l’ultimo metodo prima del Terrore. Ma certo lui non approverebbe questi paroloni e allora chiudiamo con un sorriso istrionico mentre accende un sigaro pre-fumato.

# Reset your brain&#58; do a mind dump!

## Reset your brain: do a mind dump!

You know the state — too many tabs open, too many notifications, too much noise. You try to think about what you are doing right now, but you can’t focus. Your mind is in the future, thinking about a bazillion things you need to finish, the email you are supposed to send by the beginning of the month. You need a break, but just stopping for a second and grinding some beans may not do it.

What you really need is something that could get you out of that looping pattern. What could that be? After trying out different things, I found out doing a quick mind dump helps me a lot.

### Mind Dumping 101

Set some time aside. Ten minutes, fifteen, a full Pomodoro session — it doesn’t matter. Just the fact that you are allocating that time slice to do something will make it meaningful. Intent makes the ground sacred.

Open your notebook to a new page, or load up a new text file. Again, the media doesn’t matter, but the idea of starting with a blank canvas helps me immensely. In the first line, write the current date and something like Mind Dump. From there, let it flow.

Some people mind dump in prose; I do it in bullet-list style. Line by line, I let my mind pour onto the paper — things I need to do next, things that I have no control over. Impossible, forbidden, things that should never be let out. Anything is fair game in a mind dump.

If I finish and the clock is still ticking, I use the minutes I have left to try and squeeze things out of my mind. By the end of the session, my mind should be pretty dry. If that’s not the case, I reset the clock and start again.

### Review Time

After the soul-pouring dump, it’s time to get the analytical glasses on. Line by line, I try to identify the following on my list:

**Things I can do in less than 2 minutes
* **I do it and mark as done. Next.*

**Things I can delegate to someone
***If it takes less than 2 minutes to delegate it, I delegate immediately. Otherwise, it goes to my inbox.*

**Things that are tied to a specific date
***I add them to my calendar, or as a deadline-bound task into my inbox.*

**Feelings, advices, self-help requests (Non actionable stuff) 
***I make myself aware of these, and try to extract a next action, or even a new project from it.*

# What kind of stand-up is the most likeable?

## What kind of stand-up is the most likeable?

*You know those little well-being peaks that one can try to sprinkle over the daily life, to make it more interesting.*

Stand-up comedy is one of those things.

Something to enjoy during lunch breaks, maybe before going somewhere in the evening, or sometimes live at a venue.

But *what kind* of comedy is the most enjoyable and likeable?

To find out, the other day, I watched a lot of stand-up comedians. I took some notes and came up with the following dimensions.

### Funniness

This is the alpha and omega here, getting those laughs going is the whole idea of watching stand-up.

One of the comedians I watched, she scored really high on everything except the funniness. The show was enjoyable, but it was still obvious that something was missing.

Even though other factors are important, *in this context the amusement is essential.*

### Relatability or Recognition

If you can’t relate to a story or an experience it might be difficult to understand the set-up and the joke.

Try to imagine stand-up about quantum theory assumptions, sounds a bit uncanny.

If instead, an act centers on something that you can relate to, maybe something that you’ve experienced recently, or something that you’ve been thinking about, it may be very interesting.

If I can relate to the experiences in the act, then I will enjoy it more.

### Agreeableness

An agreeable comedian doesn’t put people down and so people most of the time find them pleasant.

For example, they don’t say things that others will find appalling, violent, horrible or disgusting.

And they avoid coming across as smug, arrogant or big-headed.

Dave Chappelle is an example of someone who is agreeable, while Eddie Murphy, Dennis Miller and Bill Burr are sometimes in one way or another leaning in the other direction. Check out Dave:


### Stability and Positivity

A comedian doesn’t have to radiate positivity, but they should avoid pessimistic and negative sentiments.

They should avoid making the impression of being anxious and troubled.

For example, I think Robin Williams, Woody Allen and Jon Stewart display these neurotic sentiments at times.

Whereas Russell Peters, in his acts embodies a sound stability:


There are also things that mostly just take away attention away from the positives, such as insecurity or a strong accent, but the most important general characteristics, were, for me, the ones above.

So when you’re trying to find out what stand-up to watch, or if you’re performing, you could choose to go for something that is *funny*, *relatable*, *agreeable* and *positive/stable*.

Maybe something by Mr Chappelle?

Or by [Aziz Ansari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zubKB-RWdGk), [Robin Williams](https://youtu.be/GSGJIjwj8vA?t=10s), [Jim Carrey](https://youtu.be/hb4t3wzL058?t=53s), [Jon Stewart](https://youtu.be/jn1GOkw5lwI?t=37s), [Jimmy Fallon](https://youtu.be/A2ZOi3gwRWQ?t=15s), or [Kevin Nealon](https://youtu.be/vDP5WhHCYyU?t=22s) (click the links to check them out).

# The True Difference Between Knowledge and Understanding

## 

Destin Sandlin thought the task would be simple.One of his friends had created something he called, “a backwards bike.” [[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFzDaBzBlL0)]

The backwards bike concept is very basic:

1. When you move the handlebars to the left, the bike’s tire goes right.

1. When you move the handlebars to the right, the bike’s tire goes left.

![](1*aRUG4v0H6gf0PEiYEUQjaw.jpeg)

Destin is about as smart as they come, and thought for sure that he’d be able to master the bike instantly.

Here’s what happened:


He couldn’t even get a solid pedal in! And Destin is not alone. He went around the country giving speeches about the backwards bike.

Here are some of the people trying to master it:


## WHY CAN’T ANYONE RIDE A BACKWARDS BIKE?

All of these people have knowledge about how the bike works. And the concept seems obvious…we just need to do everything we normally do on a bike, just the opposite way!

However…it’s not that easy — *but why?*

To put it in simple scientific terms, your memory of how to ride a bike is stored in a part of your brain known as “[the cerebellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum).”

**The cerebellum** lies at the back of your brain and takes care of things like coordination, balance, and many more implicit functions that you don’t even think about. We would consider our cerebellum as our “intuitive brain.” [[2](http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/jnp.2009.21.3.245)]

**Note: the cerebellum does not include the [limbic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system) or “primitive brain.”*

Meanwhile your working memory and conscious movements are stored in a part of your brain known as “[the cerebrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum).”

**The cerebrum **lies in the front of your brain and takes care of the movements that you are consciously aware of. It is the part of your brain that can express ideas and direct your actions. It is your “intellectual brain.” [[3](https://books.google.com/books?id=jVHkyWzY-_4C&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=the+cerebrum+textbook&source=bl&ots=_bMhoe_nS6&sig=7HjHqEU2kw2Ktqy9swTDAwYvqTA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KzLMVNH_BYmegwTtl4DACQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=the%20cerebrum%20textbook&f=false)]

**Note: the cerebrum does include the [pre-frontal cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex), where your willpower resides.*

As I’m typing this sentence, my cerebrum is thinking about the words that I want to put on the page, and my cerebellum is directing my fingers to the locations of each key.

Here is a diagram of how the two communicate and what parts of the body they direct.

![](1*btGP2j7YAjE3AL8NlNUvVg.png)

**You can see the delicate balance between these two parts of your brain**. And even if your cerebrum knows that you need to do things the opposite way, the messages to the cerebellum — which has years of bike-riding experience — are going to completely confusing.

By the same point, if someone moved a few letters on my keyboard, I would constantly make mistakes, even if I knew exactly where the new letters were!

## REWIRING THE CEREBELLUM

So what would it take to change these pathways around? Would it be possible to *learn* how to ride the backwards bike?

Destin was determined to find out. So he practiced riding the backwards bike every day for months. Trying and failing over and over again — and embarrassing himself in the process.

Finally, after 8 month of slow progress, it finally clicked for Destin!

His cerebellum and cerebrum finally got onto the same page and could keep him moving forward on the backwards bike. His body now knew intuitively how to maintain balance and ride the bike backwards.

## KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT EQUAL UNDERSTANDING

Destin’s conclusion from this experiment was that knowledge does not equal understanding.

Just because you can know something intellectually, you still have intuitive thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are not going to change overnight.

Even if your intellectual brain knows that something is “bad” for you, that doesn’t mean that your intuitive brain, or your primitive brain (which I’ll call the emotional brain for the purposes of this article) are going to be on the same page.

Even if you know intellectually that your fears of criticism or vulnerability aren’t justified, that doesn’t mean that you’re going to be able to will yourself to overcome them 10 minutes before you give a public speech.

And even if read about the absolute best strategy for [overcoming procrastination](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/present-minded), [sticking to a diet](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/reasons-you-should-not-diet), or [mastering your productivity](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/increase-energy-focus-productivity), your whole brain will not truly understand its benefits unless you are willing to commit to implementing it for a long period of time.

## KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

So how do you begin to rewire the parts of your brain to truly grasp a new idea, skill, or strategy?

The obvious answer would be, “repetition, repetition, repetition.” **However, you have to think about which part of your brain you need to rewire.**

For example, if Destin had simply repeated to himself the words, “Okay handlebars right, turn left. Handlebars left, turn right” over those 8 months, he wouldn’t have been able to ride the bike.

If he spent his time researching the complex neuroscience of riding a backwards bike, that wouldn’t have helped him ride it either.

**The only way he was going to learn was to get on the bike everyday and ride.**

Similarly, if you are trying to overcome a fear of public speaking, it’s not going to do you much good to repeat the words, “there’s nothing to be afraid of, there’s nothing to be afraid of, there’s nothing to be afraid of,” everyday.

Nor is it going to do much good to spend all of your time studying, “how to give a perfect speech.”

You need to practice giving a speech in front of a real audience on a consistent basis until your emotional brain feels more comfortable being on stage and gets over its fear.

But, of course, there are instances when you want to practice every day with your intellectual brain.

If you want to design a new bike, for example, riding around on one every day isn’t going to do you much good. Now you are going to have to do things like research complex engineering and design.

So whatever your goal is, think about whether you’re going to need intellect, intuition, or emotion in order to achieve it. Then [design your practice](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/talent-is-overrated) to rewire this part of your brain, and get ready for the long journey from knowledge to understanding.

## CONCLUSION

Knowledge does not equal understanding. Just because you know that your[ fears are not warranted](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/fear-kills-willpower), that something is “bad for you,” or that a strategy will lead to success, does not mean that you truly understand these things.

In order to understand, you need to summon the willpower to literally re-wire your brain. You need to practice your public speaking, learn to enjoy things that are “good for you,” and implement a new strategy in your everyday life.

Then prepare yourself for the long journey from knowledge to understanding.

# The Morale Funnel

## The Morale Funnel

### In Response to “The Lost Art of Management”

I have a response to the article, [The Lost Art of Management by Alex Chuang](https://medium.com/better-humans/42356e258181). When I read this article I said YAY!!! to myself. I have so often in the past been at the place that thinks if you are good at your job, you should be promoted and you will be good at managing others who are in that same job.

And like Alex Chuang, I think that’s a fallacy. It’s not a good assumption to make, and the risks to your business are very high.

But that leaves companies with some significant problems to solve:

• What career growth can they provide to those who are great at their jobs but terrible at managing others?

• Should it be a requirement that everyone who wants to get promoted in an organization has to become good at leading? (I’ve seen companies answer yes to this question and utterly fail because they weren’t prepared to also give those people the tools they needed to succeed. Answer carefully for your company.)

• How will they find the people who are great managers? Or how will they develop those people?

I also agree with Alex’s list of qualities that a good manager/leader possesses, though I would add a #7 and #8:

**7. Your job is not to be a friend to your employees. **Your job is to empower and enable your employees to achieve their goals. This means that sometimes you will have to challenge them to leave their comfort zone, and it means that sometimes they will grumble about that. The ones who truly want to succeed, however, will appreciate that you challenge them and enjoy the accomplishments you push them toward.

**8. Not everyone is going to want to get promoted. **Some of your employees will want to find their comfort zone and hunker down. These are the employees who stay in the same position for a long time. You find their strengths — usually that they’ve seen a LOT of what comes with the position they are in — and you find a way to get them to share that knowledge with the newer employees who come into the position. You find a way to give them mentorship roles, because they have a ton of experience to offer.

So, what do you do with a manager who isn’t effective? Can you change their behavior, once you’ve identified that they are lowering morale in your company?

***Can you afford to ignore the problem?***

Develop great leaders within your company, and demand that those who are already in leadership positions are effective. It should be approached like any other business objective, though it often gets de-prioritized because it isn’t attributed to direct revenue. How much time does your company spend analyzing [sales / customer funnels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_funnel) to grow business? Does your company *also* spend time and effort considering a Morale Funnel? (Never heard of it? I may have just made it up. Tell all your friends.)

**Where in your sales funnel does high morale on your team help you convert people who are aware of your company into to loyal, engaged customers? **If you don’t know, find out. *Soon.*

# Will the Real Risk-Takers Please Stand up

## Will the Real Risk-Takers Please Stand up

### To all The Foolish-Looking Ones..and Me.

*This poetic manifesto is inspired by a number of daring individuals I met over a course of an evening who are doing crazy, adventurous things like turning their careers and their lives upside down or ‘right side up’; Some because they had to, some because they chose to, and all, deep down, because they really wanted to.*

Real risk-takers are willing to look foolish, because that’s what walking by faith tends to looks like.

**Real risk-takers look after their bodies, tend to their spirits and focus their minds. They know they don’t want to afford diminished intuition, creativity, or courage.**

Real risk- takers get to grips with being comfortably uncomfortable. They get out of their mental comfort zone, but stay in their emotional strength.

**Real risk-takers learn to prioritise the important things in life. They know the urgent stuff will always get done.**

Real risk-takers know that relational equity is the only equity to bank on. They treat people like gold.

**Real risk-takers relish the highs and flow with the lows. They know there are valuable lessons on both sides of the rainbow.**

Real risk-takers don’t gamble on the odds. Their external experiments are fueled by an internal knowing.

**Real risk-takers might get knocked down, but as the song goes — they get back up again — they don’t remain on their knees.**

Real risk-takers place spiritual truth higher than physical facts. They believe before they see.

**Real risk-takers act from self-awareness, not from self-loathing. They know that state of being is creative cause, and that physical actions are the last point of creation; they’re not what make things happen, but are the medium to receive.**

It’s okay to take risks; for all the foolish-looking ones… and me

# How To Solve Problems Like Henry Ford And Other Genius Inventors

## “If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.” — Albert Einstein

How long does it take to get from Portland to Seattle? I make the trip several times each year, so it’s a question I ask myself often. The answer? About three hours in a car. Four and a half on a train. 45 minutes on a plane.

But what if we were asking this question in 1899? I don’t know the exact answer, but it would take at least a day, and you’d have to feed your horse a lot.

Cars were around back then, of course, but they weren’t practical. They weren’t durable and they cost a fortune. Then, in 1908, the first Model Ts rolled off the assembly line and, suddenly, travel became *impossibly* easier. Impossible because, until Henry Ford invented the assembly line, there was no cost efficient way to build a quality vehicle.

While others were happy to build cars for only the rich or content to write it off as an impractical technology Ford asked, “What would it cost to build this thing if I broke it down to its most basic materials and found a better way to put it together?” Look around outside and you’ll see the answer changed personal mobility forever.

To find that answer, Ford had to engage in a type of critical inquiry called “first principles thinking.” [1] And he was hardly the first or only one to do it. Every great thinker and inventor has used it to solve problems that seemed impossible.

Putting this concept to work in your life will make you fantastically more creative and capable of solving difficult problems.

![](0*SEMo56U_8s25t3mb.jpg)

## How First Principles Thinking Makes You More Creative

When you don’t know how to do something, where’s the first place you turn? The Internet, right? Maybe you read a few tutorials or watch some YouTube videos. This works sometimes but, other times not; you’re left thinking, “That’s too much work” or “That’s not the solution I want.”

What’s happened is you’ve been defeated by thinking via analogy — you see how something is done and how you can replicate it, but decide not to. Understanding by analogy is a useful shortcut, but it’s just that — a shortcut. [2] It doesn’t help you *truly* understand what you’re trying to learn. Instead, you learn what someone else has already done, and that may come with a lot of flaws, problems, and other shortcuts that technically work, but make the task too expensive, difficult, time-consuming, or something unsatisfactory.

But when you engage in first principles thinking, you discard existing knowledge and explore it on your own. You question everything you *think* you know until you reach a “first principle” — an absolute truth that doesn’t have to be explained by another.

Do this over and over and you reach the foundational pieces of the problem free of all the errors in judgement and shortcuts taken that led to the easy solution. When you understand the core of the problem, you can build solutions that are truly unique — just like how Henry Ford invented the assembly line to make cars a practical mode of transportation.

## Practical Ways To Use First Principles Thinking In Everyday Life

If you want to solve a difficult problem or create something better than what exists now, you have to do it from the first principles — shortcuts won’t get you there.

What are some practical ways first principles thinking could make you a smarter, more effective person?

* If you’re starting a business, you’ll need to use first principles thinking to build a product or service that’s fundamentally better than the competition.

* If your [day is too busy](http://riskology.co/sharpen-the-saw/), first principles thinking could help you get everything done in less time and with less stress.

* If you’re trying to get healthier, building from the first principles will help you [build a routine](http://riskology.co/internal-motivation/) that works for you rather than struggling with diets and exercises you hate.

Any problem you’re struggling with will benefit from this thinking strategy because it clears away potential for misunderstanding — it’s impossible to move forward until you understand the principles. It’s a more difficult way to think, but it’s also better.

The process of actually *doing *first principles thinking is easy, though. Each time you think you know something, just ask yourself, “How do I know that’s true?” If the answer depends on an opinion or assumed knowledge, you have to keep asking. Once you reach a certain truth, that’s when you know you’re in the right place to start looking for a solution.

## Case Study: First Principles Thinking Helped Me Build My Email List

A year go, I was unhappy with how fast the email list for my business was growing. So, I did a lot of research into how others solved this problem. I knew that, no matter what solution I landed on, I wanted two outcomes:

1. I wanted a lot more people on my list

1. I wanted everyone to be highly engaged — quality readers.

When I went looking for solutions, I found myself in a predicament. The experts in building *big* lists all say, “You have to do single opt-in to get more people on your list.” [3] And the experts in building *high quality* lists all say, “You have to do double opt-in to make sure you get the best people.” [4] I wanted both, so which advice should I have followed?

I decided neither was best, so I went a different route. I asked myself, “What is the fastest possible way to build an email list?” I ignored anything that sounded like an opinion and only latched onto solid research until I reached an answer

Then, I asked myself, “What is a foolproof way to know my subscribers are active and engaged?” Again, repeatable and verified research lead to a few conclusions I could count on.

At this point, I had a fundamental understanding of the two things I wanted. From there, I was able to ask myself the critical question I would not have been able to ask unless I’d done the earlier work: “How can I take what I know and combine them to get exactly what I want?”

Armed with that question, I came up with a creative and unique way to manage my email list — one I’m not aware of anyone else using — that allowed me to grow it more in the last year than the entire history of the site *combined *and still guarantee everyone is a high-quality subscriber.

If I hadn’t done that work, I would have had to accept one of the shortcuts offered by the experts that wouldn’t actually solve my problem.

First principles thinking helped me solve a real world problem in my business, and I’m certain it will help you, too. Careful, though. Once you unleash the creative potential of this process, you may become addicted to doing things the hard… scratch that… right way.

*4. Double opt-in — like single opt-in — refers to how someone joins an email list. Double opt-in requires the person “confirm” their email address so that it’s guaranteed to be real. It’s the industry standard for building a high-quality list.*

# Timecap Your Timesuck

## 

## I live by the timer.

I don’t have Attention Deficit Disorder but I definitely have my own form of ADD – Attention Distraction Disorder (there is also a third form – Attachment Deficit Disorder, when a person sends an email and forgets to attach their document). I am very easily distracted and understand my triggers and what I need to do to overcome them. One thing that helps is the timer. I use the Pomodoro Technique and Timecap my Timesucks™.

What are my timesucks? Almost any form of social media, RSS feeds, research for purchases and my Netflix queue. I cap it to 25 minutes per day and set a timer on my desktop called Focus Booster. If I don’t use Focus Booster I just use my watch. I may break it up into two chunks a day, like Social Media, but I definitely don’t do more than 25 minutes for any of these things. Why? Because it is so easy to get sucked in to reading post after post, looking at photo after photo, clicking on link after link and so on until I have six tabs open and can’t even remember what I was initially intending to do!

I also am a premium user of Rescue Time, which shows me how much time I spend on distracting websites by day and week, as well as block access for a specified period of time to sites I have marked distracting.

## Timecap your Timesuck™.

I’m sure there is something you do that you can start with. Try just one Timesuck and Timecap it to increase your productivity.

# 4 Strategies to Reduce Interruptions and Distractions at Work

## Photo by StartupStockPhotos.

***23 minutes and 15 seconds.***

It takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to [recover from an interruption at work](http://www.fastcompany.com/944128/worker-interrupted-cost-task-switching) and reach full productivity again.

And get this: According to recent studies, [**interruptions happen about 4 times every hour](http://www.yast.com/time_management/science-task-interruption-time-management/)**. That equates to one interruption every 15 minutes.
> # So for every 15 minutes of *peak* productivity, you spend 23 minutes and 15 seconds working suboptimally.

I don’t know about you, but that equation seems skewed in the wrong direction to me. I don’t have time for that much lost productivity, and I bet you don’t either.

## The (Proven) Secret to Consistently High-Quality Work

Let me drive the point home further: A recent study sought to find the most influential factors determining a programmer’s quality of work. The results?

Despite measuring metrics such as experience, compensation, and time spent on an individual project, the single most influential factor was this: **The most effective, productive, and high-quality programmers are those who eliminate distractions.**

Granted: We aren’t all programmers. But I think it’s safe to say these results are applicable to just about any form of work or activity that requires intense concentration and creativity.

## Assessing the Damage: Calculating the Cost of Office Distractions

And while interruptions are nearly impossible to eliminate *entirely*, there are steps we can take to reduce them to a more reasonable (and less detrimental) level. But first, it’s important you really understand the damage these distractions are causing.

Over the next three days, I challenge you to create a log of all the interruptions (and *interrupters*) you encounter on a daily basis. And keep in mind: **One of your chief interrupters may be *yourself*.**

After all: *How often do you stop in the middle of a project to check your email, respond to texts, or scroll through Facebook?*

Willing to give this a try? Here’s a breakdown of the information you’re going to want to track:

* **Date: **What day did the interruption occur?

* **Interrupter: **Who was the cause of this interruption?

* **Description of the Interruption: **What were you working on when you were interrupted, and what exactly was the interruption?

* **Time Lost: **How much time did you spend in an interrupted state? (Keep in mind: This isn’t including the average of 23 minutes it takes to return to peak productivity after the distraction.)

* **Validity: **Was the interruption valid? (After all: **Not all interruptions can be avoided, and some of them are necessary.** But many times, they’re not.)

* **Urgency: **Even if the reason for the interruption was valid, was it urgent? If it wasn’t urgent, could it have waited until after the project you were working on?

## 4 Ways to Reduce Distractions and Interruptions at Work

Now, with that said, let’s talk about the 4 steps you can take to start reducing interruptions in your work environment.

### #1: Want the #1 Source of Work Interruptions? Take a Look in the Mirror

**Although it can be tempting (and even justified) to point fingers at outside sources as the root cause of our distractions, we’re often our own worst enemy.** I’ve mentioned some of these culprits already, but here’s just a quick glimpse at the ways we interrupt ourselves:

* Scrolling through Facebook,

* Checking our inbox,

* Skimming Slack,

* Calling someone over to the office as they walk by, or

* Getting up for coffee every 15 minutes.

If you notice any of these are recurring issues for you, I’d recommend looking into these [solutions for procrastination](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/6-ways-to-avoid-procrastination/). Here’s a few recommendations to help eliminate personal interruptions at work:

1. **Switch off distractions:** If you’re often distracted by email pings, Slack messages, texts, or social media updates, turn off notifications. The fact of the matter is, **most of us don’t need real-time updates of everything going on in our lives.** The best thing to do is silence your phone, disconnect your computer from Wi-Fi, and pick up a pair of noise-cancelling headphones; at least when you’re in the middle of an intensive, interruption-prone project.

1. **Focus on the objective:** The times we’re most easily interrupted are often when we’re working on a project we’re not especially excited about. And while there certainly will be projects that don’t thrill you, you can often find motivation to complete them by shifting your focus to the end goal or objective that the task will help you complete.

1. **Forget about multitasking:** Some people like to brag about their ability to effectively multitask, but the truth is … [**There’s no such thing as multitasking](https://hbr.org/2010/05/how-and-why-to-stop-multitaski.html).** **All you’re really doing is moving rapidly from one project to another, constantly interrupting yourself** and negatively impacting the final product for both projects.

For any of us, overcoming distractions and interruptions starts with overcoming our own bad habits. Keep in mind:
> # **Procrastination and being distraction-prone is a habit**, and it *will* take time and effort to overcome.

### #2: Eliminate Office Distractions by Turning Liabilities into Assets

It should come as no surprise that we at Mindmaven are huge fans of working with an assistant.

The problem is, **a poorly-trained assistant can sometimes be your #1 source of distractions.** Between Slack messages, emails, and knocks on the door, your assistant may be involving you in administration overhead that you simply don’t need to be involved in.

The good news is, your assistant can also be your greatest productivity asset. With the right rules in place, you can train them to be your gatekeeper and keep you as distraction-free as possible. Here are a few recommendations:

1. Use [**Whitespace Time](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/whitespace-proactive-time-management/)** to block off specific time each week devoted to uninterrupted work, and let him know that nothing — other than an urgent crisis — should distract you during that time.

1. Train her on the art of [**Inbox Shadowing](https://betterhumans.coach.me/use-inbox-shadowing-to-free-up-8-or-more-hours-a-week-e774ace862a3)** and empower her to manage your emails as if she’s you — drafting, sorting, and prioritizing emails based on the context, permissions, and training she’s received.

1. Create [**a set of clear productivity rules](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/successful-entrepreneurs-need-rules/)** about when you can and can’t be interrupted. Outline what types of situations warrant an interruption, and what times of the day are acceptable for interruptions.

Remember: **Leveraged correctly, your assistant can be your most powerful partner on your journey to peak productivity.** But without a system of clear checks and balances, they can also be one of the greatest hindrances.

### #3: Avoiding Distraction Often Means Having Those Hard Conversations

Although the biggest source of work distraction is often ourselves, it isn’t uncommon to find frequent interruptions coming from team members as well. If that’s the case for you, it isn’t enough to just *hope* it gets better.

This is especially true for founders with an “open door” policy. While that policy is great for company culture, it can also be detrimental to productivity. Here are a few suggestions to cut down on colleague-driven interruptions:

* Call a team-wide meeting and let everyone know you’re trying to cut down on interruptions. This way you’re not calling anyone out specifically. You can even turn this into a company-wide initiative by **asking for their suggestions on reducing distractions** and interruptions.

* Create clear guidelines on when you are and are not available. For example: **Pick up a pair of white over-the-ear noise-canceling headphones, and let everyone know you aren’t to be interrupted when you have them on.** Or have your kids create a “do not disturb” sign you can hang on your door to let people know when you’re not available.

* Consider having “office hours” alongside an open-door policy. Let people know **you do want them to be able to share their thoughts, but that they can’t come and go whenever they’d like.** For example: You could say your door is open from 2:00–4:00pm every day. During this time, you’d be largely focused on reactive tasks — such as clearing your inbox — so distractions aren’t going to be as detrimental.

At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter exactly what you do, so long as you find an approach that works for you. The key is to **set expectations and then communicate your expectations** to your team members.

And keep in mind: This may take some getting used to at first; especially if you had a full-access, open-door policy beforehand. So if someone comes in to distract you during your Whitespace Time, don’t be afraid to remind them of your office hours and send them away.

### #4: If All Else Fails: Eliminate Interruptions by Relocating

All of this said: There *will* be days when work interruptions feel inescapable.

Maybe you yourself feel especially distractible, or your team’s in the middle of a project and is needing your input more than you feel is necessary. When this happens, sometimes the best thing you can do is get yourself a change of scenery.

When you’re in the middle of an important project, don’t be afraid to switch things up. Remember, this doesn’t necessarily mean you have to leave the building. For example, you could…

* Shut the blinds and turn the lights off in your office,

* Book a conference room for yourself, or simply

* Find a quiet corner of the building to yourself.

If none of these options prove effective, you may have to get a little more creative, or actually leave the building. For example, you might…

* Head to a local coffee shop,

* Work out of hotel lobby, or

* Choose to work from your home office.

This strategy is especially effective when combined with the three tips above. While working away from the office, let both your team and assistant know you’ll be unreachable for the next 2–3 hours. You can then silence your phone and (if possible) disconnect your Wi-Fi for the duration of the project.

You’ll likely find this change in environment, coupled with a supportive and understanding team, will give you all the focus you need to reduce interruptions and power through that project.

## Remember: A Distracted Leader is a Hindered Leader

At the end of the day, there are some interruptions that are simply unavoidable; and that’s okay. Emergencies and crises happen.

But if you can eliminate many of the non-essential distractions — such as meeting requests, Slack messages, and habitual inbox maintenance — you’ll be better equipped to handle those essential work interruptions as they arise.

And as a result, you’ll be that much close to reaching your fullest potential as a leader and contributing to your startup at the highest level possible.

# This is The Best Way to Easily Improve Your Life, Backed by Research

## This is The Best Way to Easily Improve Your Life, Backed by Research

Research suggests that more than 40 percent of the actions we take each day are habitual (1).

That means that almost that half the time you’re doing something, it’s not because you decided to do it.

You’re doing it simply because you’ve done it so many times in the past that the behavior has become automatic.

The best way to easily improve your life is to learn how to change these habits.

Because when you do that, you can make them work for you every day. And you won’t even have to think about them.

A good habit moves you closer to your goals. A bad habit does the opposite.

When you know how to change your habits effectively, you can create more good habits and eliminate more bad habits.

And then you can consistently [move closer to your goals by default](http://www.selfication.com/change-your-habits/) every single day.

How neat is that? Let’s look at how habits work.

### The Habit Loop

According to researchers at MIT (2), all habits consist of three parts:

![](0*rPlb6IHgbeMZcwE9.jpg)

1. **The cue.** This is the trigger that starts your habit. Example: You get an email notification.

1. **The routine.** The habit that follows the cue. Example: You open the email.

1. **The reward.** The benefit you gain from doing the habit. Example: You get to know what the email is about.

If you perceive the reward as positive, you’ll want to repeat the loop again the next time the cue shows up. Repeat this sequence enough times and you’ll create a habit.

Thinking about your habits in this framework is very helpful because it helps you see what initiates the behavior, what the behavior is, and the reward you get from it.

This is very powerful because by breaking your habits down into these parts, you can start manipulating them to get them to work for you.

### Substitution Habits

You’ve probably noticed that habits are hard to break. It’s a much more effective approach to *replace* them.

For example, if you smoke when you get stressed, it’s usually a pretty bad idea to just stop smoking. Instead, you should come up with a different way to deal with the stress and insert that behavior into the loop.

If your old habit loop looked like this:

**Cue: Stress –&gt; Routine: Smoking –&gt; Reward: Calm**

… Your new one might look like this:

**Cue: Stress –&gt; Routine: Going for a walk –&gt; Reward: Calm**

Your cue and reward stay the same. All you change is the routine.

Obviously, quitting smoking isn’t as easy as just going for a walk. But if you experiment with different substitution habits (while using other aids at the same time) you’ll increase your chances of success.

### Enroll in Toilet University

![](0*NKi6cuslir2ssUtW.png)

There are plenty of ways you can make positive changes in your behavior by using substitution habits.

And they don’t have to be huge to have a significant, positive impact on your life.

One of the funniest examples I’ve come across is MJ DeMarco’s “Toilet University” habit. In his book, The Millionaire Fastlane (3), he writes:

“Never throne without reading something of educational value.”

If you spend 15 minutes on the toilet every day reading on your phone, that translates into 90+ hours every year.

How much could you learn in that amount of time if you watched videos from [Big Think](https://www.youtube.com/user/bigthink), [ASAP Science](https://www.youtube.com/user/AsapSCIENCE) or [The School of Life](https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel) every time you ‘throned’?

Or read excellent blogs or book summaries about your area of expertise?

Talk about giving a shit about your education! (Sorry, I couldn’t help myself.)

### Substitution Habit Examples

Here are a few more ideas for how you can use substitution habits to easily improve your life:

* Waking up — Instead of falling back to sleep, use your snoozing time to think about [three things you’re grateful for](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-practice-gratitude/).

* Relaxing — Instead of watching TV shows, [read a great book](http://www.selfication.com/life-changing-books/).

* Standing in line / Stuck in traffic — Instead of restlessly waiting, use this time to [practice some mindfulness](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-practice-mindfulness/).

* Walking / Running — Instead of just moving from point A to point B, listen to an educational podcast.

* Housekeeping — [Combine doing the laundry, dishwashing, and cleaning with an audiobook](http://www.selfication.com/temptation-bundling/).

* Taking a break — Instead of reading celebrity gossip, relax your mind with five minutes of meditation.

* Snacking — Throw away your unhealthy snacks and prepare healthy alternatives.

* Walk in the door rule — No matter what your day has been like, always talk about the best thing that happened first (4).

* Going up — Always choose the stairs rather than the elevator.

* Getting into to bed at night — Turn off your phone and [write in your journal](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-write-a-journal/).

By themselves, small changes like these won’t make much of difference. But if you systematically start adding one after another, together they can create massive change.

That’s because substitution habits are simple enough to help you [just get started](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-overcome-perfection/).

And when you get started, you start building momentum.

And once you’ve got momentum, it’s only a matter of time before [your efforts start compounding on themselves](http://www.selfication.com/consistency/) and create positive ripple effects across all areas of your life.

### It All Starts With One Tiny Habit

If you like the idea of substitution habits, I encourage you to try one out right now. The time to take action is when the inspiration is high.

Within the next 10 minutes, take these steps:

1. **Pick ONE substitution habit.** If you try making several changes at once, they’ll all likely fail. Don’t overwhelm yourself. Use the list above for inspiration and decide on one change you’re going to make.

1. **Create an “implementation intention”.** Frame your goal in an [IF –> THEN statement](http://www.selfication.com/achieve-your-goals/). The ‘If’ should represent your cue, and the ‘Then’ is your habit. For example: IF I sit down on the living room couch, THEN I’ll read my book.

1. **Pick a reward.** [Celebrating small successes](http://www.selfication.com/the-power-of-small-wins/) is a powerful way to reinforce good habits. [A tiny reward can get you addicted to your new behavior](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-reach-your-goals/). An excellent way to do this is to check off your habit in a habit tracker. My favorite is [Coach.me](http://coach.me/).

1. **Manipulate your environment.** Change the “[activation energy](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-change-your-habits/)” of your habits. Make your substitution habit as easy as possible to do and the old habit as hard possible to do. For example, put a great book right next to your couch and put the TV remote in another room.

1. **Rehearse the new habit.** By practicing the substitution habit a couple of times, you’ll be much more likely to remember it. You can do this in the environment where the habit will take place, or in your imagination.

1. **Schedule a weekly review. [**Take 15 minutes every week to review the progress](http://www.selfication.com/weekly-planning/) in your habit tracker. Did you complete your habit every day? If not, ask yourself what got in the way. Then adjust your approach for the following week. There are no failures, just valuable data.

Once you’ve completed these five steps, it’s all about showing up and doing the habit every day. Know that there likely will be some resistance in the beginning, but that it will get easier over time.

### The Best Way to Easily Improve Your Life, In Summary:

* The best way to easily improve your life is to change your habits.

* The habit loop consists of three parts: a cue, a routine, and a reward.

* By breaking your habits down into these parts, you can manipulate them to work for you.

* You can use substitution habits to replace negative or neutral habits with more empowering ones.

* Substitution habits help you get started, build momentum, and create positive ripple effects across all areas of your life.

* To get started, pick ONE habit, create an implementation intention, choose a reward, manipulate your environment, rehearse the new habit, and schedule a weekly review.

Make one small empowering change today. When that habit is in place, make a new one. And then another.

With time, you’ll start feeling and acting like a completely different person. And before you know, your life has changed for good.

# O amor e outras estórias inventadas…

## Quando as coisas realmente dão certo!

Essa semana eu conversei com um amigo sobre o primeiro amor que sentimos na vida: o dos nossos pais. Sobre o grande amor que um pai e uma mãe sente pelo seu filho, até mesmo antes dele nascer. A expectativa, a alegria de estar ali, materializando o amor através de uma criança.

É a forma mais perfeita de amor, principalmente do pai. Ser pai e ter a presunção de que aquela vida ali gerada faz parte de você. Presunção mesmo: só quem tem a certeza de tudo é a mãe, pois ela gerará a criança. Não estou dizendo para os pais se desesperarem, de forma alguma! Só quero exemplificar o quão grandioso o amor paterno se coloca dentro de uma presunção, de uma expectativa. Amar sem ver e sem ter certeza é a mais pura forma de amor que pode existir.

O amor para dar certo, tem que ter a fantasia e a realidade juntas. Sim, parece loucura, mas não há como o amor ser racional e nem ser uma loucura completa. Há o equilíbrio entre os dois para que ele cresça e dure para sempre.

Tem que ter invenção! Não digo mentiras, mas criatividade. Ela sim é o que move as pessoas apaixonadas à felicidade total. Ser feliz é ser criativo e surpreendente. É ser bom no bom e bom no ruim, saber realmente estar ao lado, mesmo que esteja a quilômetros de distância.

Embora que não existe receita certa para o amor. Se existisse, esse que vos fala sequer estaria escrevendo, mas sim vivendo a vida.

# How To Stop Struggling By Building Your Own Morning Routine

## How To Stop Struggling By Building Your Own Morning Routine

It’s 5am and Jocko Willink checks into Instagram, posting yet another photo of his wristwatch as he rolls out of bed. He’s a badass for sure. Rising before the crack of dawn to power through an early morning workout, way before most people even get started for the day.

Jocko is a former Navy SEAL, and arguably one of the toughest, most disciplined guys around. After he hits the gym, he does a few other things before strolling into his office at [Echelon Front](https://www.echelonfront.com/) to officially start his work day.

His morning routine plays a key role in setting his day up for success. And judging by his track record, it works damn well for him.

## The Daily Morning Routine Fanboy Craze

By now, everyone knows how awesome morning routines are. Here’s the thing though…

People are quick to copy Jocko’s and other well-known influencer’s morning habits to adopt as their own. After all, those people became highly successful, and if what they do in the morning helped lead to that result, then it should work for everyone else too!

Unfortunately, that line of thinking isn’t necessarily true. Sure, those successful people without a doubt have their morning routine down pat, but do you think they copied someone else’s routine to get there?

Do you *really* think someone like Jocko Willink read about what LeBron James does in the morning and said:
> “Man, I need to do exactly what that guy’s doing.”

Heck no. Jocko’s morning routine is the result of his own creation. It’s built to power the kind of day he needs to have, not LeBron James, or Barack Obama, or whoever else’s morning routine you may read about.

Minus a few exceptions, people who try “proven” morning routines don’t see the same success. Most might try for a day or two then stop for any number of reasons: too hard, don’t care enough, no motivation, you name it. Then it’s back to Google to find something else that might magically work for them.

## The Right Way to Start Your Mornings

If copying the morning routines of famous people is the wrong way to go about starting your day, then what should you do instead?

Here’s the secret:

*The best morning routines are ones that align with what’s most important to **YOU**.*

Which means…

The **only morning routine you’ll ever need** is one crafted specifically for you, by you.

Jocko’s routine works because it was literally **made for him. **He knows what’s important to him and how he needs to prepare for ***his* **days. The result is a well-planned, beautifully designed morning routine that plays its part.

Think of your morning routine as the pass that sets up the dunk in an alley-oop. If it’s not in sync with your values and goals for the day — i.e. you soaring high to catch the pass and dunk the ball — then chances are you’re going to miss the shot.

## What Makes an Effective Morning Routine?

The key activities in your morning routine should:

1. Prepare you for rest of the day (e.g. ten minutes of meditation to get focused before a hectic day).

1. Check off a value that’s important to you (e.g. drinking a greens drink first thing in the morning if health is one of your values).

1. Be something that makes you happy.

1. Any combination of the three above.

For Jocko, a strong body and healthy mind are extremely important to him, which is likely why he exercises first thing in the morning. Not to mention the energy boost from getting his blood pumpin’ that early in the day.

An effective morning routine HAS to start with your own values and what’s important to you. Otherwise, you won’t care enough to stick with it, and you’ll miss the dunk because the pass was way off.

## My Morning Routine

In my own life, my three most important values are health, family, and growth.

![](0*6Okka_S1HSIxKoCs.png)

Health became a leading value during my recovery from anxiety. For years, I neglected my health by eating shitty foods, excessively drinking, and not prioritizing sleep. It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that making health a priority was the key to feeling better again.

Plus, without health, it’s hard to focus on anything else. I don’t know about you, but I feel pretty lethargic and worthless when I’m under the weather. This is sadly how some people essentially spend every single day. No. Thanks.

Then there’s family, including close friends, that has always been extremely important to me.

And lastly, growth is something I’ve come to value as I’ve gotten older.
> “If you’re not getting better you’re getting worse.” — Joe Paterno

It’s no surprise then that the key activities in my morning routine align with these values.

Now is a good time to also mention that I write on the side while having a full-time 9–5 job as an engineer, so my routine has to move me towards my goals in those areas as well.

Most days, here’s what my morning looks like:

1. Wake up and drink a tall glass of water with Athletic Greens [health]

1. Meditate and stretch for five to ten minutes [health and growth]

1. Prepare a hefty cup of tea or coffee [just for me :)]

1. Kiss my wife before leaving for work [family (she gets very upset if I don’t do this)]

1. Get to my desk and write for an hour (on my time) before officially starting work [growth/goals]

You can see that everything I do aligns with at least one of my core values, health being especially important to me.

Now, you’ll notice that I don’t rise and shine at 5:00 am like Jocko to crush a morning workout. I’ve never been one to wake up early enough to exercise before starting my day job. Usually, I’ll train in the evenings after work, or during my lunch break.

It works for me, and that’s what’s most important.

## How to Develop Your Very Own Morning Routine

The beautiful thing about my morning routine is that it was crafted for me, and me alone. Sure, I’ve adopted some mainstream habits from “mega-successful” people, but by no means have I copied their entire routine.

Your morning routine, much like mine, should combine what’s important to you (i.e. your goals, values, and things that make you happy) with activities that support them.

Let’s take a look at how you can develop your very own personalized morning routine.

## 1. Identify what’s important to you

Many people operate their whole lives on autopilot, never stopping to clearly identify what’s truly important to them.

But not you.

The first step to a kick-ass morning routine is to first give yourself a compass to guide your actions. If you don’t know, or never really thought about what’s important to you, then it’s time to go through an exercise to find out.

First, what are your values? Scott Jeffrey does a pretty good job of walking you [through an exercise to identify your key values](https://scottjeffrey.com/personal-core-values/) on his website. It’s absolutely worth taking the time to do it. And [here’s the big list of values](https://scottjeffrey.com/core-values-list/) that he includes to help along the way. I have three values that I keep up with on a regular basis. Aim for two to four values here if you can.

Next, what are your goals? Set some goals using [a simple guide like this](http://www.themonklife.net/goals-in-life/).

Lastly, what are some things that make you happy? These should be relatively small things that make a big impact on your mood. Some ideas include being fully present and enjoying a cup of coffee or tea (like me), walking your dog, reading a good book, watching the sunrise, listening to the birds, or journaling.

Keep in mind that you won’t be able to include all the things that make you happy into your morning routine, but it’s never a bad idea to at least make sure you fit them somewhere into your day.

I [created a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15o-wCGjWDz3UL-N9TqPOktdf6sU24B4K2Djm_uO7xXQ/edit?usp=sharing) in Google Sheets as I went through this.

![](1*FksOQ5zFBwx-Zypyi1kikw.png)

If you’d like, feel free to use my spreadsheet for your own exercise. [Here’s the link again](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15o-wCGjWDz3UL-N9TqPOktdf6sU24B4K2Djm_uO7xXQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## 2. Identify the core tasks in your daily life

Once you have what’s important to you figured out, then you need to get clear on your daily to-dos.

If you work for an employer, what kind of work do you do? Here you’ll want to dig a little deeper to answer what the core tasks or demands of your job are.

For example, in my job as an engineer, I have to interface with customers, draft letters and communications, read through design specs, and tweak designs in 3D modeling software. I would definitely want my morning routine to be able to help me prepare for those in some way, which it does.

If you *aren’t* employed and you work for yourself or at home in some regard, what kind of stuff do you do? Perhaps you write or consult with clients. Or maybe you’re a professional athlete or some other type of active person.

Whatever the case, identify your core tasks and write them all down. Or, put them into your spreadsheet.

![](1*FQrv3LAKthtUD28_9crUdw.png)

## 3. Brainstorm activities that might align with what’s important to you and your core tasks

Next, time to start brainstorming some behaviors to align with your results from steps 1 and 2.

What actions can you do in the morning that tie perfectly into your values? For example, if health is a key value for you, you would want to identify something to promote a healthy lifestyle for yourself. I choose to drink a glass of water with Athletic Greens. You might do that, or go for a run, walk, lift weights, or maybe some morning yoga.

Once you’re finished brainstorming activities to align with each of your values, move on to your goals, happy things, and then daily tasks from step 2.

I’ll warn you, some items will be easier to align behaviors to than others, and some will be extremely obvious. If you can’t think of anything for something on your list, that’s OK. There are lots of behaviors you’ll be brainstorming here, and there’s no way you can fit them all into your routine anyway.

If it’s an item that’s extremely important you find a behavior for, try getting creative or tying it in with another behavior.

For instance, if performing well at your job is a goal of yours, perhaps practicing meditation will provide you the focus you need to do so, on top of it also being extremely beneficial for your health.

![](1*UUMOtzJ2sgzE0LDt1m5SQw.png)

**Note:** Keystone habits are awesome behaviors for satisfying multiple items at once. Highly recommend checking out [this article by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/keystone-habits) for further reading.

## 4. Plan when to execute your morning routine

With your activities defined, next you’ll want to work on logistics.

Some people will have the advantage of dragging and dropping their new routine into a slot at the same time every day. Others might have a more volatile schedule. If this is you, you should simply focus on the sequence of actions in your routine, then perform them whenever you can.

Since I have a 9 to 5 job and a regular schedule, mine is pretty easy. I started waking up an hour before I had to, which made it super simple to add in my morning routine. Once I got used to waking up earlier, it was so much less stressful than the usual waking up just in time to shower, shit, and head out the door for work.

For other 9 to 5’ers, it’s a cinch working a morning routine into your schedule. You know how much time you have before your workday begins, and there’s always waking up earlier if needed.

For those with more irregular schedules, you might enjoy having the freedom to perform your routine at your convenience.

## 5. Start by Adding Just One

Morning routines don’t suddenly become a thing you stick to every day. Morning routines are comprised of behaviors done repeatedly every day. This means that they are **HABITS**, and [habits take some work](http://www.themonklife.net/habits/).

The key to building habits is starting small and taking things slow. Rather than overwhelm yourself by trying to develop a bunch of habits at once, you are going to be adding in your morning behaviors one by one.

Take a look at your list of behaviors from step 3. Choose any one you’d like and start with that. It’s usually wise to begin with the easiest habit to form and work up to the harder ones (especially for those newer to forming habits), but it’s ultimately up to you.

I started with drinking a glass of water, then eventually added Athletic Greens onto that (meaning I even CHUNKED a single habit into two smaller steps). Once I had that down, I worked my way up to also meditating daily, since that takes way more discipline than drinking water.

## 6. Add the Rest One by One

They say it takes either 21 or 66 days to form a habit. Personally, I think that’s a bullshit statement taken out of context to trick people into thinking all habits have a concrete sticking point.

66 days is actually the AVERAGE that it takes to [form a habit](https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/how-long-it-really-takes-to-form-a-new-habit-and-how-to-get-started/), with a wide range from 18 to 254 days. And, it varies wildly depending on the habit you’re trying to develop.

While there’s no clear indicator when a habit is formed, you’ll know when a habit starts to implant itself as a staple in your routine. You might never get to the point where you “automatically” perform the behavior, but you will likely *want *to do it and *feel guilty* when you don’t. At least this is how I know.

Once you get to this point, that’s exactly when you should start working on the next behavior in your morning routine.

Don’t rush. Take your time. And eventually, you’ll have a rock solid morning routine — built specifically for you — that will make your days easier, more productive, and happier.

## Don’t Be Afraid of Change
> *The only thing that is constant is change.” — **Heraclitus***

The morning routine I follow today is quite different than the routine I followed a few years ago. And you know what?

That’s totally OK.

Over time, what’s important to you will change. You will have new goals, new values, and different responsibilities. Those will continue to change throughout the course of your life. Heck, they may even change next month, or next week.

An effective morning routine is one that evolves with you, to always support the kind of day you want to create.

If something no longer works, there’s no reason to keep trying to force it. Switch things up. Experiment with new behaviors and ideas until you find something that clicks. And if you happen to land on the perfect routine that keeps powering your days for 5, 10, 15 or more years?

You hit the jackpot, my friend. Keep riding that wave as long as you can.

## At the End of the Day…

…your morning routine should help you ease into your days. It should be enjoyable, make you happier, and give you something to look forward to. It’s perfectly acceptable to look at the routines of highly successful people, borrow some ideas, then try to see if they work for you.

What’s not acceptable is straight up copying someone else’s routine and robbing yourself of the benefits of a beautifully crafted morning routine, made especially for you.

# Oh, You Beg to Differ? Then Also be Willing to Defer.

## If being right consistently makes you an asshole, you’re more wrong than anything else.

Welcome to club “I have an opinion” – population 7 billion and counting. The worst thing about opinions is the stubbornness of the people who have them; people like me and, yes, people like you. Few things are potentially more transformative than a strong opinion in the hands of a strong-willed person. And certainly there are fewer things more damaging.

![](1*SOjMa-J_WoROS7BwAIZiDA.jpeg)

**We spend a great deal of time training people on how to have an opinion. We don’t spend enough time teaching people how to wield an opinion.**

In my decade in the workplace, it’s something that I’ve continuously come back to. Having an opinion is important. Sharing, implementing and bringing that opinion to an outcome is where most people –especially me – fail.

Here’s how I’m trying to be better at it:
> # Differ Less. Defer More. Let It Go.

Now to an opinionated person such as myself this sounds absolutely counter-intuitive. How will anything change if you don’t challenge it?

Something I’ve noticed more regularly than I’d like to admit is that even when I have the strongest conviction that an opinion of mine is *true*, it’s at best only about 30-60% true.

The other 70-40% go to things I haven’t factored in: incorrect assumptions I’ve made or errors in my logic. But *most* often it’s because there are people who are smarter, more talented, qualified and/or experienced than me in the room.

That doesn’t make them better than me. It doesn’t make their opinion more qualified than mine. But it does make me an ass to assume that they’ve never had a similar opinion.

And this is where the beauty of deference comes into its own. It allows you to share an opinion in a way that states your position *and *respects the history, experience and intelligence of others .
> # An Opinion Shared Makes Things Happen.

What I’m trying to do more with my opinions is consider who in the room may have had the same thought before, or whose job description it is to think like that. I’ll state my opinion,position, idea and defer to them.

Occasionally I’ll get told that I’ve nailed it. Sometimes they’ll have a great build on the thought, will ignore it or shoot it down.Sometimes I’ll think they were right, other times I’ll think they were wrong.

I am convinced that in 100% of the times where my opinion wasn’t actioned, whether rightly or wrongly, more people benefited than would have, had I *imposed* my opinion on them.

My first boss, a South African Advertising legend Brian Searle-Tripp always used to say that “What’s important is what’s right, not who’s right.”

If we’re more concerned with the quantitative objective value of our assertions and less with the ownership of them, opinions can turn into actions much quicker.
> # Imposed Opinions Deliver Poor Returns

Think of a time someone forced you to do something they felt strongly about and you delivered your best thinking/work. It will never happen.

An imposed opinion might deliver results, but it won’t deliver inspired results. It well always tire, jade and irritate those forced to execute it.

The question you’ll have to face up to sooner or later is whether your opinion – right or wrong – was *worth* imposing on people. Most of the time the answer will be no.

By practising more deference in the sharing of our opinions, we create the opportunity and space for people to share and co-own the opinion.

When people share an opinion, things happen.
> # Trying to be “Always Right” Isolates You.

Opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one, and those with more usually have something wrong with them. There’s a lot of truth in that. And it’s simply because people with lots of opinions are usually particularly bad at sharing them. If, like me, you have a lot of thoughts on any given issue, consider that even if you *are* right, the irritation and discomfort you cause your peers and colleagues may well outweigh the value of your “correctness.”

Sometimes you need to just be right all by yourself and bite your damn tongue. Other times you need to be right and submit it as confidently, eloquently and humbly to those around you.

Practising deference actually allows you to be *more* opinionated, because with deference the more opinionated you are, the more frequently people are involved in your thought space.

At the end of the day, if we truly are remembered more for our actions than our words, how we get our opinions “bought into” by those we work with will be of more value than how vocal we are in sharing them.

# Networking’s Most Effective Decree is the Second Degree

## 

You approach a networking event and at the door a gentleman stands and ask you, “first or second degree”.

You are not sure you know what he is asking so you ask him to clarify.

He explains there are two rooms for networking. One is all about first-degree networking and is full of 100 people who are only interested in connecting with the other people in the room. In the other room contains 20 people who are interested in who they know and who you know who might be of aid to one another.

My 12 years of hosting and attending networking events have taught me that a vast majority of people will pick the room with more people and are specifically drawn to a method of first-degree networking.

First-degree networking or direct networking is about what two people can do for one or both parties.

It is my assertion that:
> # First-degree networking is flawed and excessively so. It is a hyper-inefficient use of time and resources.

Now before you write me off with the logic of going with the crowd or the need focus on direct goals and hence first-degree contacts that are actionable, here me out.

The reality is your best potential result from the 100 people in the first-degree room is 20 qualified potential contacts and that will require working the room like a speed-dater on 5 cups of coffee. While 20 people in the second-degree networking room will yield a conservative 100 qualified potential contacts achieved at a reasonable pace.
> # “Doubt me you do . . .” — Yoda

Well, I have included all my figures and theories at the bottom of this post for those looking for verification, but read on.

Unfortunately, we are programmed to hunt for our next meal and we are naturally, when pressed, more focused on working hard and fast rather than hard, fast and smart.

When it comes to finding another few clients or someone new to date, a “good enough” direct approach gets the job done. However, most of the time “good enough” networking is simply not effective when more than the next job or next “significant other” is required. Further, the wasted effort to achieve good enough could have produced 2.5 to 5 times more results.

As the numbers show in the example that I show below, for the first-degree method to equal the potential in the second-degree room, you would need to find a room with 100 people who were all potential targets and lock down all of them in 90 seconds or less per person.
> # The reality is large networking events work against you.

Large networking events reduce the time you have to connect with each person to an ineffective time frame. Pushing you into the ugly, “what do you do, this is what I do conversation.”

Even if you can ignore the sinking feeling that you are missing a key person and spend more time with some individuals the nature of first-degree networking limits your potential results.

Often the environment (i.e. loud bars, places lacking enough seating or the ability to move and connect with everyone at a relaxed pace) and number of people at larger networking events prevents someone from trying second-degree techniques. The people you are talking to feel the pressure to hunt for their next target and hence will not easily engage in second-degree conversations. Even if your method is to gather as many cards as you can and circle back with each person the lack of established trust reduces these follow-up contacts to a pitch and be pitched format. The reality is that of 100 business cards you might gather, your chance of getting more than a few more minutes of phone time let alone something more meaningful is doubtful.

To leverage the potential of second-degree contacts some connection and trust must be built up and this requires more time and a better environment to achieve. This is why while it is not unreasonable to assume that 10% of a person’s contacts might be of aid no one will mention let alone turn over those connections without building more trust.

In conclusion, while I have attempted to be overly fair in my evaluation there is no doubt that while the path and results of first-degree networking are clear and enticing the results are more than disappointing. Even if I cut in half the second-degree rooms potential result from 100 to 50 qualified potential contacts compared to 20 qualified potential contacts (which you would have to be very good to capture) from the first-degree room, the result is still 2.5 times better with second-degree networking room for the same period of time.

So consider, even if your current first-degree networking is getting the job done you are leaving tons of potential untapped and working multiple harder than you have to.
> The theoretical facts and assumptions:
> A) There are 100 people in the first-degree room and only 20 in the second degree room. 
B) In either room, there are only 20% of people who fit the targeted need and are assumed to be of value. 
C) You have 2.5 hours in the room you choose and for simplicity, everyone is there for the full 2.5 hours. 
D) In the second-degree room, it is assumed that 50% of the people know people of value to you.
> In the room with 100 first-degree networkers, in order to talk to each person you have a maximum of 90 seconds per person however if you want to save more time to connect with the 20 people (20% of 100) that are of value, you need to save time for that.
> If we allow 3.5 minutes per each of the 20 key people this leaves you with just 60 seconds per person to figure out if they are a one of the key 20 and hence worth 2.5 more minutes.
> Successfully executed you might come out with all 20 potential leads who hopefully you managed in 3.5 minutes to move to a point that you can convert them to another longer connection.
> Honestly, a tall order and one that only some of the best might pull off. Obviously, you can spend more time with people by accident or misjudgement and hence miss part of the crowd and reduce your 20 possible connections to 10 to 15.
> Looking at the other room, however, let’s see what might be possible.
> Out of the 20 people in this room, there are only four possible first-degree valuable contacts (who will not include in our count). You have 7.5 minutes to spend with each person if you divide your time equally.
> However, as these people were all open to a conversation beyond themselves, you have 7.5 minutes to see if they know anyone who might be of aid to you. If we allow a bit more time for each first-degree contact of value or person who feels they might know someone of aid to us (assumed to be 50% of the room) we could allow 10 minutes per person with direct or secondary aid to offer and 5 minutes for everyone else.
> Now according to Linkedin in 2016 [the average CEO had 930 connections](http://bit.ly/2czmsMv) however [28% of users have less than 300 users](http://bit.ly/2c5Tm5S) (which does not speak to how many people they know in reality since not all one’s friends and contact are on Linkedin).
> Going with a safe 100 people in each person’s network, the 10 people in the room who are able/willing to be of help know 1,000 people (10 x 100). We will use 10% or half of the 20% assumption from the first-degree room (just to remove any doubt of favoritism in my argument) that any given crowd is a potentially valuable contact. This yields 100-second-degree contacts (10% of 100) that our 10 fellow networkers could be able to give us information for or who they might be willing, with the establishment of a connection and trust, to provide an introduction.
> This produces a result of 100-second degree connections from 10 people which is a conservative result at best since most people know far more than 100 people.

# How to Stop Drinking Soda. Awesome Steps for Success!

## How to Stop Drinking Soda. Awesome Steps for Success!

### “What if I told you there are 3 really easy steps that could wean you off of drinking sugar or diet sodas…”

**Watch the Video;**


**Listen to the Podcast;**


### “You have to drink fluids every day to stay hydrated. It’s your choice whether you drink empty calories and unnecessary chemicals or something healthier.”

Here is a sobering fact, “Two out of three adults and one out of three children in the United States are overweight or obese and the nation spends an estimated $190 billion a year treating obesity-related health conditions. Rising consumption of sugary drinks has been a major contributor to the obesity epidemic.” [Harvard School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/sugary-drinks-fact-sheet/).

If you think that drinking diet sodas will get you off the hook, think again! Here are 3 of the top 10 reasons (in no particular order) from [Health.com](http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20739512_2,00.html).

* Diet soda is calorie-free, but it won’t necessarily help you lose weight. Researchers from the University of Texas found that over the course of about a decade, diet soda drinkers had a 70% greater increase in waist circumference compared with non-drinkers

* It’s associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Drinking one diet soda a day was associated with a 36% increased risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes in a University of Minnesota study.

* It may hurt your heart. Just one diet soft drink a day could boost your risk of having a vascular event such as stroke, heart attack, or vascular death, according to researchers from the University of Miami and Columbia University.

Ok, enough of the scare tactics! I too was a diet soda drinker before I starting down the path of the LifehackrDiet. I had to wean myself off of them too, now I want to share with you three awesome steps for success that worked for me.

**WATER, WATER, EVERYWHERE!**

Here is the root of the problem, our bodies are approximately 60% water and during the day we are losing it through sweating and urination. Health authorities recommend drinking at least eight 8oz glasses of water, 64 fl oz or around 2 liters a day. I try to target 80 fl oz of water a day with mixed results.

Not only is water a necessity, but you can use it as a weight loss tool.

“One study showed that dieters who drank 500 ml of water before meals lost 44% more weight over a period of 12 weeks, compared to those who didn’t.” [Department of Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661958)

Water is something we have to consume for our very survival. We are bombarded by marketing messages trying to sell us beverage products that are not healthy forms of hydration. “A typical 20-ounce soda contains 15 to 18 teaspoons of sugar and upwards of 240 calories. A 64-ounce fountain cola drink could have up to 700 calories. People who drink this “liquid candy” do not feel as full as if they had eaten the same calories from solid food and do not compensate by eating less.” [Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661958)

The bottom line is, It’s up to you whether you consume beverages that help or hinder a healthy lifestyle.

**3 STEPS TO FREEDOM!**

Step 1: Wean Yourself off of the Sweetness.

Step 2: Wean Yourself off of Consumer Soda Products.

Step 3: Wean Yourself off of the Soda Bubbles.

**STEP 1: WEAN YOURSELF OFF THE SWEETNESS.**

![](0*rHRCl71Uwym95AsV.gif)

I have never liked drinking plain water but I have learned delicious new ways to enjoy consume water. Let us start down the path of getting to water nirvana by attacking one problem at a time.

Like most of you reading this, my brain likes the sensation of sweetness, a lot! The first step is to take control of the volume knob of your brain’s sweet spot.

“Artificial sweeteners have more intense flavor than real sugar, so over time products like diet soda dull our senses to naturally sweet foods like fruit” [Health.com](http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20739512_2,00.html)

Here is a simple way of reducing your dependence on the level of sweetness of sugared and diet sodas.

Next time you buy your soda of choice, buy a soda water of the same size.

**Actions**

* Drink 1/4 of you soda of choice. Crack open the soda water and refill your soda of choice with the soda water (1/4 of the bottle). Drink your new brew and don’t focus on any changes in the sweetness. Instead, focus on other things you like about your soda of choice; the bubbles, the temperature, how refreshing it is, etc… Note: From now on, don’t drink soda straight. Pour the 1/4 bottle of soda in a reserve bottle and water it down before you drink it. Repeat this 3/4 to 1/4 mixing every time you drink a soda.

* Take your time to get use to the less intense “sweetness” of your beverage. Take days, weeks or even months to be comfortable with this change. When this level of sweetness becomes, “normal” you are ready to crank it up!

* Now mix 1/2 a bottle of your soda of choice with 1/2 bottle of soda water. Take your time to appreciate your beverage for what it is. When you are ready move on…

* To, 1/4 your soda of choice to 3/4 soda water. Again, take your time to appreciate your new reality. My advice to you is to take as much time as you need to be comfortable with each of these changes. We are working on making a permanent change here.

**STEP 2: WEAN YOURSELF OFF OF THE CONSUMER SODA PRODUCTS.**

![](0*KzSXqwtBTwBpmqFD.jpg)

It’s time to put you in the driver’s seat and have you save money while drinking healthier soda beverages. This strategy also helps the environment as it saves on fuel shipping your little commercial soda bottles all over the country, plus it reduces the number of plastic bottles in the waste and recycling stream.

Now that you have turned down the sweetness volume in your brain, you can enjoy beverages, fruits and other foods with a more sensible perception of sweetness.

I have been off commercial sodas for over 3 years and when I taste them now I actually gag at the intensity of their sweetness.

Let us replace your dependence on commercial soda beverages and instead create spritzers (a mixture of fruit juice and soda water) that are tailored to your sensibilities.

**Actions**

* The basic principle of step 2, is to take a naturally sweetened fruit juice of your choice and use it as the “syrup (not an actual syrup, just a juice)” for a spritzer which will replace your consumption of commercial soda.

* Suggestions for fruit juices; (all without added sweeteners) Apple cider, Pomegranate juice, grape juice, lemon, lime or orange juice, iced tea and anything else that catches your fancy.
— Pour about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of your syrup and then fill the remainder of a 16 oz/0.47 l glass with soda water. Enjoy.

* Try squeezing a couple of lemon, lime or orange slices into a glass of soda water. Yummy!

I was an early adopter when the [Soda Stream home carbonation system](http://astore.amazon.com/lifeha08-20/detail/B002TYZHDA) arrived on the scene. I love being able to make soda water whenever I want to without having to lug heavy soda water bottles from the grocery store or deal with returning bottles for a return deposit or dumping them in the recycling. It also [saves money too.](http://www.businessinsider.com/sodastream-efficiency-savings-2014-2)

**How to Drink Spritzers at Work.** There is a true convenience to twisting open a commercial soda. You can find them pretty much everywhere and they taste consistently the same no matter where you are. But now that you are over them, how can you adapt to drinking your healthy spritzer at work? Here are a couple of suggestions (If you have some ideas to add, please do so in the comments section below — we’d love to hear what you have to say!).

**With a Fridge at Work** If you are fortunate to have access to a fridge at work, you can bring a bottle/container of your favorite “syrup” and leave it in the fridge. Maybe put an official looking sticker on it that say something like “Laxative Solution” to keep your co-workers out of your stash.

**Without a Fridge at Work** If you don’t have access to a fridge, then i suggest you buy yourself a soup thermos and pour in your cold “syrup” of choice. Bring along a durable reusable water bottle to mix your spritzer and soda water and drink from. Soda Water at Work Depending on where you work and who you work for, maybe they could be convinced to buy a SodaStream system for the office. It encourages people to think outside of the bottle when it comes to hydration. Maybe spend a couple of minutes explaining why what you are doing and how it will help you maintain a healthier lifestyle. That’s a pretty convincing argument.

**STEP 3: WEAN YOURSELF OFF THE BUBBLES**

![](0*96tkjAHhPAAvBUk-.jpg)

A couple of weeks ago, I was sucking on the straw of my favorite water infusion of spicy ginger tea with a lemon slice, when I had an “ah-hah” moment. A slight ginger burning sensation was warming its way down my throat. I realize the reason I don’t like drinking plain water is because there is no “mouth-feel.” I like carbonated beverages because the sensation of the bubbles excite my mouth. I was enjoying my ginger tea with lemon because it also gave me a secondary mouth-feel — That’s it!! My mouth and brain need excitement when I am eating and drinking. I don’t think I am alone in craving these sensations.

Since I started exploring water infusions, I haven’t been craving a carbonated spritzer. My mouth has been satisfied with all the delicious flavors and spices I was tossing its way. The carbonation that creates the bubbles in soda water isn’t bad for you. It can cause a sensation of bloating or stomach flare-ups in some people, like those with IBS (Irritable Bowl Syndrome). Most of us won’t have any negative side effects from drinking carbonated water. I just feel it’s important to be empowered and enjoying drinking lots of water carbonated or straight.

I had been hearing about water infusions for a while, but I just didn’t feel compelled enough to try them myself. My friend Karen, who takes great pride in introducing me to things, gave me a gift of a carton of homemade water infusions. That was the catalyst I needed to start my journey into the world of infusion experimentation. To date, I have tried about 25 different combinations of fruits, spices and herbs in my water.

**Actions**

* Simply place fresh fruit, fragrant herbs, raw veggies, teas and spices in any combination into a container of water, let it infuse in the fridge for an hour or overnight and then drink. You get all the goodness of the flavors, nutrients and the health benefits of drinking water.

* That’s it. Experiment and enjoy!

There are an infinite number of combinations you can experiment with. Here are some examples to get you thinking;

* grapefruit + sage/rosemary/mint/basil

* lemon + mint/cilantro/basil

* lemon + lime + cilantro

* lemon + ginger

* Meyer lemon + tangerine + pear + hot green pepper + cilantro

* lemon + orange + ginger

* blood orange + ginger + basil

* cucumber + lemon + lime + mint/basil

* cucumber + grapefruit + sage/rosemary

* cucumber + watermelon + mint

* carrots + apple + lemon + ginger

* carrots + pomegranate + sage

* honeydew + cantaloupe + watermelon + sage//mint

* watermelon + mint/rosemary/basil

* cantaloupe + blood orange + lemon

* pear + rosemary/sage

* banana + nectarine + basil

* blackberries + raspberries + strawberries + mint

* strawberries + grapefruit + sage

* apple + plum + blueberries + mint/sage

* cherries + lime + mint

**MY NIGHTLY ROUTINE**

![](0*nndgM-16ys1fLr2A.jpg)

Ball Mason Jars lined up as I cut fruit and brew tea for the next day’s hydration needs. I love sipping on my concoctions with the [Ball Mason Jar Lid and Straw](http://astore.amazon.com/lifeha08-20/detail/B00VV80F4G). I keep myself well hydrated, my taste buds satisfied and my liquid calories to a minimum — what is there not to like!

**FIND YOUR SOLUTION** Quitting soda is not as difficult as you think it might be, take days, weeks or even months to adjust your tastes and expectations. The journey is more about what your mind expects and not what your body needs.

The LifehackrDiet philosophy is to empower you with step-by-step techniques for losing weight and regain your wellness. Experiment with these ideas, adapting them to your unique lifestyle and personality.

**WHAT DO YOU THINK?** I know both I and the LifehackrDiet community would love to hear how you weaned yourself off of soda. Maybe something you did can help someone else fuel their journey.

# All Models Are Wrong, Some Are Useful

## Even the best models of the world are imperfect. This insight is important to remember if we want to learn how to make decisions and take action on a daily basis.

For example, consider the work of Albert Einstein.

![](1*q_KJz8MBmqM78zDwlWLWdw.png)

During the ten year period from 1905 to 1915, Einstein developed the general theory of relativity, which is one of the most important ideas in modern physics. Einstein’s theory has held up remarkably well over time. For example, general relativity predicted the existence of gravitational waves, which scientists finally confirmed in 2015 — a full 100 years after Einstein originally wrote it down.

However, even Einstein’s best ideas were imperfect. While general relativity explains how the universe works in many situations, it breaks down in certain extreme cases (like inside black holes).

## All Models Are Wrong, Some are Useful

In 1976, a British statistician named George Box wrote the famous line, “All models are wrong, some are useful.” [1]

His point was that we should focus more on whether something can be applied to everyday life in a useful manner rather than debating endlessly if an answer is correct in all cases. As historian Yuval Noah Harari puts it, “Scientists generally agree that no theory is 100 percent correct. Thus, the real test of knowledge is not truth, but utility. Science gives us power. The more useful that power, the better the science.”

Even Einstein’s work was not perfect in all cases, but it has been incredibly useful — not just for increasing our understanding of the world, but also for practical purposes. For example, the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) used in your phone and in your car must take the effects of relativity into account to deliver accurate directions. Without general relativity, our navigation systems wouldn’t be accurate.

## How to Make Decisions in an Imperfect World

What steps can we take to make better decisions, given that no single way of looking at the world is accurate in all situations?

One approach is to develop a broad collection of frameworks for thinking about the world. Some experts refer to each framework as a “mental model.” Each mental model is a way of thinking about the world. The more mental models you have, the more tools you have in your thinking toolbox.

For example, here are three ways of thinking about productivity:

1. [The 2-Minute Rule](http://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating?dst=medium-all-models-are-wrong): If something takes less than two minutes, do it now. The goal of this rule is to help you stop procrastinating and take action.

1. [The Ivy Lee Method](http://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee?dst=medium-all-models-are-wrong): Create a to-do list by writing down the six most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow, prioritizing those items, and working on them in order. The goal of this method is to help you work on the most important things first.

1. [The Seinfeld Strategy](http://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy?dst=medium-all-models-are-wrong): Pick a new habit and draw an X on the calendar for each day you stick with the behavior. The goal of this method is to help you maintain consistency and keep your streak of good behavior alive.

Are any of these models perfect? Of course not. But if you combine them, then you have a strategy that can help you take action right now (The 2-Minute Rule), a strategy that can help you plan your day more effectively (The Ivy Lee Method), and a strategy that can help you maintain consistency in the long-run (The Seinfeld Strategy).

You need a collection of mental models because no single framework can work in every situation.

## Doing the Best We Can With What We Have

Accepting that all models are wrong in certain instances is not a license to ignore the facts. As a society, we should search for better answers, look for evidence, and strive to increase the accuracy of our knowledge.

At the same time, there is a common peril on the other end of the spectrum. Too many people waste time debating if something is perfectly correct, when they should be focusing on if it is practically useful.

We live in a world filled with uncertainty, but we still need to get things done. It is our responsibility to develop a way of thinking about the world that generally fits the facts we have, but to not get so gummed up thinking about things that we never actually do anything. As Harvard professor Daniel Gilbert puts it, “The world doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes action.”

Impartial answers are the best we have. Focus on what is practical and take action. All models are wrong under some circumstances, but the important thing is if they are generally useful.

# Eternas são as nuvens…

## Eternas são as nuvens…

Para onde vai tudo que se vive? Para onde vai a mágica de certos instantes? A comunhão que se viveu, a cumplicidade de dividir tempo, espaço, experiências inaugurais? Para onde vão o carinho, a parceria, a entrega? Para onde vai o conhecimento, pessoal e intransferível, que se tinha do outro? **Para onde vai o que só vocês viram e experimentaram**: o nascimento de um filho, a morte de um amigo, a notícia daquele emprego, o assalto, a compra da casa, o diagnóstico ameaçador, a noite no acampamento, aquele show em Londres? Para onde vai a consciência que você tinha, de, com apenas um olhar, saber se ele estava feliz, deprimido ou ansioso? Para onde vai a absoluta intimidade que se teve com o outro?

Acredito que isso tudo fica em algum lugar interno, como um site, uma espécie de **nuvem onde armazenamos tudo o que vivemos. **Tão reais e etéreos como o iCloud, temos os nossos weClouds, que podemos acessar ou que nos acessa, algo que fica preservado, e que, mais do que nos fazer lembrar coisas, nos acolhe e ratifica. O weCloud guarda o essencial, o que ficou depois da ruptura, da tempestade, o rescaldo de um tempo, um a dois permanente, que sobrevive aos acordos rompidos, às bênçãos desfeitas, às juras esquecidas. No weCloud, ficam o sumo, o substrato, a força do projeto um dia compartilhado. No weCloud, ficam o afeto espontâneo, o registro das intenções sinceras, da vontade de acertar e de tudo o que foi verdadeiro.

Os relacionamentos podem acabar, mas não o vivido. Não se trata de memória, nem de “detalhes tão pequenos de nós dois”. Não se trata de viver no passado, nem de não aceitar os fatos. Não se trata de sublimar dores e porradas ou se refugiar num mundo alegrinho de autoajuda e negação. Não se trata de dourar a pílula e contar para si uma história diferente. Trata-se de **vida bem vivida **que não pode nem deve ser perdida. Tudo o que vivemos e sentimos vira acervo, fonte, ferramenta; é nosso para sempre.

Quando estamos com alguém, somos, em alguma instância, uma pessoa única, que só aquele companheiro conhece. **Maria é para João uma Maria que ela nunca será para Pedro**, que é um Pedro para Maria, que nunca será o mesmo para Ana. Maria poderá ser muito mais feliz com Pedro do que com João, mas ela terá sempre sido a Maria do João e haverá sempre um lugar onde Maria e João se reconhecerão, mesmo que nunca mais se encontrem.

Somos o que vivemos, e não podemos abrir mão disso. **É fundamental que cuidemos da nossa história**, que saibamos acolher nossas experiências com generosidade e entendamos que certas vivências, emoções e descobertas foram únicas e estarão sempre produzindo algum efeito em nós.

Todo fim de relacionamento pede tempo. Tempo para o luto, para a saudade, para a cura, para o distanciamento, para a neutralidade, para o recomeço. Existe um caminho a percorrer que vai do fundo do poço ao fórum, do desespero ao terapeuta, da perplexidade à aceitação, do abandono à libertação. Há que fazer faxinas: roupas, livros, fotos, palavras mal ditas, mágoas, decepções. Há que separar papéis, propriedades, planos, sonhos. **Há que separar, acima de tudo, o trigo do joio, o passado do futuro, o extinto do eterno. **Há que guardar as coisas que não cabem em malas nem cofres, aquilo que não se quantifica nem se elenca em formais de partilha e declarações de renda. Há que “amar o perdido”.

**Só quem tem passado tem futuro. **Escolher a bagagem que se carrega é decisivo para seguir adiante. Entre fardo e combustível, asas e correntes, você decide. Entre salvar e deletar, você decide. Conjugar sem medo o pretérito imperfeito para viver o futuro do presente.

Depois de um tempo, as dores passam… Sim, elas se cansam de nós e, se somos saudáveis, nos cansamos delas também, seguimos em frente, voltamos para nós mesmas, dispensando o que não nos serve mais, garimpando minúsculas preciosidades, recolhendo luminosidades, cheias de preguiça de sofrer, prontas para recomeçar, de novo, mais uma vez. Um belo dia você se pega pensando naquele “nós”, que deixou de existir, sem a fisgada de saudade, nem ressentimento, nem raiva. Você pensa com **serenidade. **Você pensa não mais no “ex”, mas no companheiro de vida: sai o “ex”, fica o amigo.

É quando você o abraça no velório do pai e sabe como ele está se sentindo e ele também sabe que você sabe como ele se sente, e isso é muito íntimo e confortante e está lá, na tal **nuvem**, para sempre.

É quando você recupera em DVD seus filmes em Super 8 e fitas em VHS, com todas as fases e faces queridas da sua vida, e faz uma cópia para ele, porque sabe que aquilo tudo é parte da vida dele também, e você se sente grata por **compartilhar.**

É quando você recebe um presente sem cartão: um disco de vinil de um show que você foi com um certo namorado. Pronto, lá está o para sempre: os anos 70, a avidez de descortinar o mundo, a larica, a revolução, o incrível mundo das primeiras vezes, compartilhado com entrega e **inocência. **O cartão é desnecessário, pois só você e ele sabem quem vocês eram naquele dia-tempo e o que significou estar ali naquele concerto de rock.

É quando você encontra numa caixa esquecida rolhas de champanhe e sementes de romã, que fazem você lembrar quem você era e como você se sentia quando estava **totalmente apaixonado **por aquele cara na Itália.

É quando você escreve um livro sobre maternidade e manda em primeira mão para o pai dos seus filhos, porque ninguém mais do que ele sabe como você ficava quando estava grávida, pois só ele viu seu estado de graça e, talvez, antes mesmo de você, ele viu você **virar mãe.**

Lá estão vocês, no weCloud, sócios de experiências transformadoras, **parceiros de sonhos**, realizados ou não, amigos que cresceram juntos, cúmplices dos pequenos crimes contra o amor, vítimas dos mesmos desgastes da convivência, ungidos por bênçãos comuns, coautores e personagens do mesmo livro.

Maria não é mais a mesma que foi com João, mas, para ser a Maria que está com Pedro, ela teve que ser a Maria do João, e João, para ser o **companheiro **de Ana, teve que ser antes o de Maria. Somos o que nascemos e o que escolhemos viver, somos o que ganhamos, o que perdemos, o que boicotamos e o que nunca alcançamos.

**É muito libertador fazer as pazes com nossa história. **Do que nos serve ter rombos na linha do tempo? Negar, bloquear, tornar inacessíveis as lembranças, impossibilitar um resgate saudável do vivido? Do que nos serve chamar ex-companheiros de falecidos ou equívocos? É injusto conosco. É empobrecedor. Temos essa mania de achar que só o que dura para sempre é um sucesso. Durabilidade nunca foi sinônimo de segurança, assim como o efêmero não é sinônimo de fracasso. Uma jaula é segura e nem por isso um lugar feliz, da mesma forma que viagens são fugacidades maravilhosas que se perpetuam dentro de nós. Nenhuma história é vã. Nada é. Nossa alma-memória, aquela que nos identifica, define e referencia, é como uma colcha de retalhos; alguns retalhos são mais bonitos que outros, mas todos são necessários.

“Amar o perdido deixa confundido o coração” (Drummond) porque é amar o intangível, o que, não sendo mais, ainda resiste, insiste e ressignifica o que antes tinha outro nome e valor. Amar o perdido é reconhecer que muito tempo, energia e as melhores intenções foram investidas, empenhadas e depositadas numa relação, num incrível **voto de confiança **no outro e na Vida. Sim, mesmo os grandes erros e as falências retumbantes têm histórias comoventes e belas. Amar o perdido é entender que nada se perde.

Amar o perdido só é possível quando você volta para a casa dentro de você. Melhor que dar a **volta por cima**, é voltar para si mesmo. Nessa hora você se sabe inteiro, apaziguado, de bem com sua história. Aí, você entende o weCloud e lembra de Quintana dizendo: “eternas são as nuvens”, e você se comove com a certeza de que um certo “para sempre” existirá, pois “as coisas findas, muito mais que lindas, essas ficarão” (CDA).

É isso, não fica o que é lindo. Fica o que finda. Fica de um jeito real. Não fica lindo só porque finda. Fica, porque finda, e, quando finda, fica o que foi de verdade, o que nunca finda.
As coisas findas ficam. Perdidas, talvez, mas para sempre nossas. **Eternas, como só as nuvens podem ser.**

# How to Say, “No” In Difficult Situations

## and build better personal boundaries.

![[image source](https://pixabay.com/en/tree-trunk-tree-just-say-no-etched-1159013/)](1*D85aI0TQ1v0b8YJgPoxMkA.jpeg)*[image source](https://pixabay.com/en/tree-trunk-tree-just-say-no-etched-1159013/)*

The problems we have with productivity are not always due to lack of organization or time management. Sometimes it’s just because we commit to more things that we can handle. We end up spread out too thin, like butter scraped over too much bread, and lacking focus to finish what we started.

Often we don’t even make the conscious decision to commit to that many things, it just happens because we can’t say, “No.”

Here are some scenarios in which that happens often.

* Your friend asks you for a favor that you hate doing, but you can’t say, “No” because he will think you’re a bad friend.

* Your boss asks you to do a task you hate doing, but you can’t say, “No” because you’re afraid you’ll get fired.

* Your partner asks you to do something that you hate doing, but you can’t say, “No” because you don’t want them to get mad and start an argument.

The two problems we’ll focus on here is *when* you should say “No” and *how* to say it to get the best possible outcome.

## When you should say, “No.”

There are 3 types of situations where we should consider saying, “No”.

1. We want to do it but we don’t have time for it.

1. We *don’t *want to do it and there are no better alternatives

1. We *don’t* want to do it but we’re afraid of the outcome.

### 1) Know Your Availability

The first case where you should say “No” is when you’re already overcommitted and taking on more responsibility will make things even worse. The typical fear is that we’re going to miss on a good opportunity.

While this is true, think of what you might lose if you take on the challenge and you fail. Even worse, what if you fail not only the new responsibility but also the ones you’ve had before because you’re spread out too thin.

A great concept, in this case, is the opportunity cost. Most newbie investors think only about the gain. If there’s a high chance of success, they make the investment. They don’t consider the cost of the time and resources they’re putting in or the other available opportunities they can do instead.

So if you’re already booked a 100% think of the opportunity cost before saying “Yes” to something new. A good way to do that is to keep an always up to date calendar, to-do list, and budget. That way with one glance you can see if you can fit in the new opportunity without having to compromise something else.

### 2) No Better Alternative

These are the cases where you just don’t have a better choice and all other options seem worse. For example, when your boss says, “You either do this or you’re fired” and you don’t have another source of income.

These are the extreme cases where saying, “Yes” and sucking it up is fine. However, you shouldn’t leave it at that and accept the same thing over and over again. Work on coming up with an alternative solution the next time it happens.

Next time your boss goes into, “My way or the highway” mode, maybe you will have an alternative source of income and you’ll be fine with being fired.

### 3) Fear of the Outcome

This one is an emotional problem. We intellectually know that saying “Yes” in some cases is bad for us, but we just can’t bear the pain of saying “No”.

Those are the cases where you know you’re not going to get anything good out of it. You’re doing it just so you don’t hurt somebody else’s feelings or avoid a conflict.

## Why is it so hard to say, “No”?

A big part of the problem is delaying the emotional pain. Even though we know that saying, “Yes” to something we don’t want is bad long term, sometimes we can’t bare the pain so we delay it. We rather suck it up, do something unpleasant to avoid the pain of disappointing someone.

As a result, we get to deal with more pain for doing something unpleasant, but it’s delayed. Since we’re not going to experience it in the moment it doesn’t seem so bad than saying, “No” right now.

None of this is conscious of course, that’s just how our subconscious mind works in the background. It does anything it can to avoid and delay the immediate pain.

So how do we deal with it?

## Make the Decision In Advance

Be proactive about it. Don’t wait until the moment you have to say, “No” to make the decision. A lot of the things that we have to decide are recurring and happen over and over again.

If it’s something your boss is making you do, it’s probably not for the first time. If it’s your partner making you take out the trash, it’s probably not for the first time. So you can do some preparation in advance and figure out a good solution for when it happens next time.

How about figuring out an alternative way for the work to get done and offering that solution to your boss? Or trading the responsibility with one of your colleagues for something that you like more? How about hiring someone to help with the cleaning in the house so you don’t have to take out the trash?

These are just simple examples, but the point is that you can come up with a more intelligent solution when you’re thinking about it in advance. You don’t have to sacrifice yourself just because you don’t want to offend the person asking.

## Building Healthy Boundaries

You know those people that seemingly have “come take advantage of me” written all over them? We tend to call them pushovers and people pleasers. That happens if a person doesn’t have healthy boundaries.

Having boundaries means being clear what you’re willing to do for other people and what you’re not. It also means you have to clearly define it in advance. It’s not really a boundary if you start building it when someone asks.

A good principle to use for the boundaries is to make sure it’s a win-win. If you help somebody out you should also be a winner. That doesn’t necessarily mean always wanting something in return, but making sure that what you give is worth it.

Doing something for a friend that you hate doing is a lose-win. Working on tasks that you hate doing is a lose-win.

Make sure you set boundaries to automatically reject all requests that are a lose-win. If you don’t let everybody know what your boundaries are, they will try to take advantage of you.

Rejecting other people seems harsh at first, but it doesn’t have to be. Make sure you communicate your motives well. Let the person you’re rejecting why you’re doing it. Help them find a better option and let them know what you *are* willing to help them with instead.

That way it won’t look like you’re throwing a hissy fit or you’re just in a bad mood. People will learn that you have strong boundaries and will respect you more for it.

# The Great Morning Habits to Save Your Life

## The Great Morning Habits to Save Your Life

### A Morning Ritual Explained (including Concrete Habits Examples)

My current morning ritual looks like this:
> *I wake up around 5 am.
I open my eyes and start repeating my personal mission statement in my mind.
I do a quick intensive workout and pray simultaneously. 
I drink a glass of cold water.
I look at my vision board for a few minutes.
I read about dozen quotes from my philosophy manifesto.
I read fragments from three books which shaped my philosophy (about a paragraph each).
I journal for about 10–15 minutes.
I pray in silence for five minutes.
I brush my teeth and pray at the same time.*

### **What Makes This Ritual (and Habits) Great?**

It is in accordance with Hal Elrod’s SAVERS routine from his book *“The Miracle Morning.” *He was kind enough to not only create a killer routine, but he shared it with his coaching clients, improved and wrote the whole book about the topic.

However, I didn’t created my routine because I read the book and implemented his advice. I created my morning ritual long before Hal published the book in January 2016.

### **Two Paths, One Goal: Personal Growth**

I created my morning ritual following a guidance of successful people. I wanted to progress with my life and I collected various bits and pieces from books, interviews and audio programs.

I find it fascinating that we ended up with very similar routine arriving at the same point via different paths. I credit it to the fact that we both wanted a routine that will both **bring desired results** and help us **grow as a whole person**, not by focusing on one single aspect of life, but encompassing them all

![](1*nPYH4TQ9o-n5YHHARQRoRw.png)

### **So, SAVERS stands for:**

* **S**ilence — instead of rushing into your days, you stop and sit calm and still. You are present in the moment, not thinking about tasks ahead of you or the troubling past.

***Habits:*** prayer, meditation, cultivating gratitude, journaling

* **A**ffirmations — you read/ repeat some affirmations that remind you about your potential and your dreams. 
Personally, I’m very skeptical about the effectiveness of affirmations. I think it’s nonsense to say aloud something which is not true and make you longing for a better future, instead of focus on here and now. But two of my habits (reading quotes and repeating personal mission statement) have the exact same goal as affirmations that Hal prescribes.

***Habits:*** reading quotes, reading affirmations, repeating quotes/ affirmations aloud, reading/ repeating your personal mission statement.

* **V**isualization — Hal advise to visualize how will you fill when you reach your goals/ dreams or how your perfect day may unfold. 
If I am highly skeptical about affirmations, I’m totally **incapable **of visualizations. So many successful people recommend this activity, but it’s a hard work to me. Yet, according to their advice, I still inserted looking at a vision board into my routine.

***Habits:*** looking at a vision board, dreaming/ visualization in your mind, watching a mind movie

* **E**xercise — for getting energized and waking yourself up. It also serves to increase your ability to be alert and focused.

***Habits:*** pushups, pullups and other kinds of bodyweight exercises; jogging, running, swimming, cycling, etc.

* **R**eading — Hal recommends personal development lecture for education and inspiration.

***Habits:*** reading of course; books, not blogs or magazines

* **S**cribing — according to *“The Miracle Morning”* formula this includes writing what you are grateful for and what results you are committed to create this day. The aim of it is to put yourself in an empowered, inspired, and confident state of mind.

***Habits:*** keeping a gratitude journal or diary, writing down your daily priorities

# This the most powerful superpower you have but rarely use

## This the most powerful superpower you have but rarely use

There’s an inexplicable joy to be found in eating alone. The experience is heightened when you can feast without wanting to be somewhere else. A phoneless-free meal is becoming a foreign act.

Do not mistake me, however. There are few things I’d rather do than share a meal with my Charlie, or a few good friends. But, when a Saturday morning rolls around and I have a few hours to myself, I appreciate the simple indulgence of breakfast in solitude.

On this particular Saturday, I choose Mother’s Market Cafe. The operation reminds of dining in Europe. Instead of waiting to be seated, they expect you to claim your autonomy and seat yourself. I’ve been here plenty of times, but I still hesitantly wait for someone to greet me and walk me to my table.

After I stop being awkward and put some purpose in my step, I find a table that will suffice. The corner spot I usually opt for is occupied by an older man. He’s wearing a gray shirt buttoned to the top with a crisp, black, flat-billed baseball cap. For some reason, I glance at his plate; a handsome stack of pancakes. My mind throws an invisible solute. If he would have looked at me, I would have given him that nod runners give each other when their paths meet in opposite direction.

The table is moist; someone probably just wiped it with a filthy rag. I assume this only because I worked in the service industry for years. So, I leave my arms off the table. My body is still, but my mind is like a race-horse tied tight its reigns. It wants to run. I reach for my phone, and then I pump the breaks saying to myself, “C’mon Brian. You don’t need to look at your phone.”

Fortunately, my waitress appeared at my side faster than a bat’s wing. Her speediness saved me from distracting myself with distraction.

She was shaped like black bowling bowl. Her hair was the color of a boiled beet. And instantly, I noticed her wrist was wrapped in a bracelet of tattoos. The black framed glasses sat low on the bridge of her nose. Her head tilted to my right which was then followed by a small little step — something like the cadence of a plie — and then asked me, “Hello, how are you today?”

The timbre of her voice was unarming. It was like being in the home of your favorite aunt.

“I’m good, thank you,” I replied.

“Can I get you something to drink?”

“Yes. I’m also ready to order if that’s okay?”

“Sure. Absolutely. What can I get you, my dear?”

This wasn’t my first rodeo; I relayed my memorized answer: “Three buckwheat solo-flapjacks. A sixteen-ounce juice. I’ll have it apple based with spinach, cucumber, ginger, lemon and kale — and a side of fresh berries please.”

After my infusion of health arrived, what looked like a dad and his two kids rumbled their way in the cafe. They choose to sit across the way from me; far enough to think that I didn’t notice them, but close enough to where I could hear every word.

The dad crashed into the booth, looked up at the ceiling, took a deep breath and then settled in by saying, “Okay kids, what do you want?” It seemed as though the kids didn’t hear him.

The girl was a precious little thing. Her long curly hair fell down the sides of her face with a volume I couldn’t understand. She reached for the pink and sky blue crayons to work away on the one-page coloring sheet that was given to her. The boy was being the harmless savage that he wanted to be. Climbing on the back of the booth, making faces at passerby’s, and firing off imaginary missiles.

They were blessed to have the same waitress as me who approached them with the same posture. “Hello, how are y’all today. Can I get you something to drink to start?”

The Dad looked up, widened his eyes in search of empathy and said, “Yes. I would loooove a coffee.” The emphasis on the “o” made me believe that getting to the cafe this morning with two kids under the age of six required the energy of 1,000 generators.

I don’t have kids, so maybe I’m way off.

I worked through my meal happily. These buckwheat pancakes never disappoint. Each bite makes me smile with no teeth. By the time I’m almost done eating, the Dad, and his two kids get their food. They spare no time digging in.

Between bites, the Dad asks the boy, “Are you excited for your game today?” The boy is dressed in soccer gear and says, “Yaaaa.” The little brute has a thought and then violently yells across the table to his dad, “HOW DO WE MAKE THEM PLAY BAD?”

An introspective thought for a young lad I thought. I’m assuming his curiosity was grounded in the idea that if he could make the other team play under their potential it would increase his (and his team’s) chance of winning.

The Dad chuckled and quickly said, “You can’t make them play bad — the only thing you can do is show up and play your best.”

I don’t know if it the subtle wisdom landed with the kid. He went on to throw two fists fulls of eggs and yogurt into his mouth. But that moment transcends youth soccer.

It’s a lesson for life.

Our lifestyle in the West has been built on individualism. While the virtue has served us in miraculous ways, it has also forged an obsession for more.

No longer does it feel like it’s enough to prepare and show up — we must also attempt to control things we have no power in controlling.

In sport, we attack the competition’s character which is recklessness masked as philosophy.

In business, we fret about what the “others” are doing and engage in a battle without bullets to take them down.

In relationships, we try to fix people by prescribing them directives wrapped as a gift.

In life, we substitute planning for actually doing something about our dream in hopes to control every pivot.

Showing up in this manner — in sport, business, relationships or life — doesn’t work in the long term. That’s also why we are so vulnerable to fall for it. We’ve crafted a society fueled by immediate gratification. Our actions are determined by impulses which are a dangerous taste to acquire.

It reminds of the story about the Israelite’s who were dispatched from Egypt. The journey from delivery to freedom was supposed to take 11 days. Instead, they wandered the wilderness for 40 years.

We too can get stuck aimlessly wandering in the wilderness for decades.

The lesson itself isn’t difficult to understand: Prepare, show up and do your best. Everything else is out of our control.

This is the one superpower we all have but rarely exercise.

Societal messaging tells us otherwise and pumps us up with over-inflated ambition; encouraging us to bulldoze everything in our path. Over time it becomes like an animal on the inside of our minds scratching to get out at every moment. When we feed this beast, it only gets harder to see our way out of the wilderness.

In our society driven by deep scarcity, it takes courage to accept that we don’t control everything. Maybe even more difficult is to accept that our preparation and the simple act of doing our best is enough.

This type of surrender is one that must be taken up daily. By my understanding, this strategy is remarkably efficacious — it’s how you win the game of anything.

I sign my name to the bill with blue ink and leave 20% for my waitress. As I close the black book, I look up and lock eyes with the older man wearing a gray shirt button all the way to the top with black, flat-billed baseball cap. He nods at me the way runners do when they cross paths.

I think we he was watching me listen the whole time. And for some reason, I feel like he heard the same story I did.

# It’s. Up. To. You.

## …you decide how you will receive the day and how you will perceive it…

**Happy New Year! **Or as they say here in Thailand, *Sawadee Bi Mai!*

I hope wherever you are in the world you've been enjoying some form of fun… reflecting on the past year, looking forward to the new one and appreciating the present moment.

For many of us, it’s back to work already — hopefully you enjoy what you do so that’s not a bad thing!

Don’t worry though, if things are tough right now, know that most often ***those things are temporary. ***And if they are good, enjoy it, but remember they can be temporary too… so **don’t take anything for granted. **Find something, no matter how small it might be and appreciate that… a.k.a. *practice being grateful.*

Always remember, we decide how we will receive the day *and *how we will perceive it as it ends each night as well. That’s what I love about New Year’s Day and it applies to any average day too. It’s another chance to start again or continue what you started. Or even head in a completely different direction. ***It’s. Up. To. You.***

# Why You Absolutely Need a Backup Fitness Plan

## Why You Absolutely Need a Backup Fitness Plan

How did this year’s New Year’s resolution to get back in shape go?

If you would have stuck with it, it would be more or less a habit by now. Research shows that to form a basic habit, you need[ **a minimum 66 days](https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/10/07/need-to-form-a-new-habit-66-days/)** of performing that routine in order for it to stick.

Research also shows that it is likely that by now your New Year’s Resolution is out the window, and has been for a while. So what’s happening?

## The 3 Most Common Reasons Why New Fitness Routines Don’t Stick

After working with many clients, I have found these to be the most common reason why a new fitness routine doesn’t stick:

1. Work went later than expected, pushing the workout to the hypothetical “tomorrow”

1. Inclement weather caused the workout of choice to be impossible or not bearable

1. Sudden change in family plans which are higher priority

These happen to us all *frequently*. So why are some people so successful at dodging these habit busters?

I have found 3 reasons which stand out above the rest.

## The 3 Qualities of People Who Find Fitness Incredibly Easy

1)They Have [Momentum](http://www.developgoodhabits.com/power-of-small-wins/)

Their habit and the momentum of successfully accomplishing their routine keeps them *craving* the workout. Jerry Seinfeld’s “[chain approach](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)” is perhaps the most popular example of successful application of the momentum approach. While it isn’t fitness, the principle is the same.

2) They Are Proactive Planning Around Their Schedule

Spending a few minutes a day premeditation on your future schedule is invaluable. You will find potential scheduling conflicts which can crush your workout plans and work around them. This topic requires it’s own post which will come soon.

3)**They Have A Backup Plan**

This is vastly under appreciated, easy to implement, and it has a **HUGE **affect on your success. Especially early on when keeping your momentum going in your new habit is critical, this is **invaluable.**

## How To Implement A Foolproof Backup Plan

There’s likely only one or two main reasons why you personally have struggled to stick to a new fitness routine. I will have my clients brainstorm their own reasons and specifically list them out.

Then, I have them complete the following statement:
> If [unfortunate even occurs], then [I will do this easy to accomplish backup plan that is still good for me]

That’s it. This super easy trick ***drastically*** increases the likelihood of sticking to a new fitness routine no matter what happens.

Just filling in this statement with your most common unfortunate events (weather, scheduling, extra meetings, etc) and a foolproof backup plan will save your goal.

## Here’s My Personal “If/Then” Backup Plan

**If** *work goes longer than expected*, **then** *I will do a 30 minute, interval workout on a stationary bike.*

This is super easy for me to accomplish, even if I am very busy. More importantly, **I know exactly what I need to do** if my workload surprises me.
> I don’t leave room for myself to think about it as this will end up in failure.

## Why This Is So Helpful

Actually, it goes back to the previously discussed list regarding the qualities of people with successful fitness habits. **The backup plan helps you build momentum**. Even if you didn’t “run 2 miles” or “get to yoga” (if those are your specific fitness goals), your backup plan is helping you **ingrain your habit**.

And creating a fitness habit is far more important that accomplishing something specific. The habit is what will end up keeping you fit long term, not a specific workout on Feb. 2, 2017.

Your backup plan helps you build momentum. The momentum helps you build a habit. The habit gets you to ***crave*** a workout.

## It’s Time to Create Your Own Personal “If/Then” Plan

The utility of the backup workout plan and “If/Then” statement was created based on working with many extremely busy people. In almost all cases, a simple and reliable backup plan almost ensures a higher likelihood of success in the early part of the plan, no matter what their schedule is.
> While it isn’t a golden bullet, it’s about as close as you can get.

That is why I have each of my clients create a backup plan. Sometimes, if someone is really struggling, I have them specifically write out the “If / Then” statement above and place it somewhere to trigger the backup event.

This takes so very little time to create and is a real game changer in making a fitness goal become a habit and thus a reality. I highly recommend it to anyone, particularly if you have time constraints or just have not been successful in the past with your fitness goals.

# This is How to Create a New Habit&#58; 5 Secrets From Research

## This is How to Create a New Habit: 5 Secrets From Research

Every year, people set their New Years Resolutions. And every year, about 9 out of 10 fail at achieving them (1).

The biggest reason for this is most people never take the time to educate themselves on how human behavior works.

There are tons and tons of diets, exercise programs, productivity tools, personal finance strategies, and time management apps out there, and a lot of them are pretty great.

The problem is that we fail to appreciate the crucial part our behavior plays in actually picking them up and using them.

You can gather all the information in the world, but it won’t create any tangible results in your life unless you consistently take action on what you learn.

That is why understanding how to create a new habit is so important.

Let’s have a look at the most powerful strategies I’ve found for doing that.

## 1. Start Ridiculously Small

It’s always tempting to try to create a massive change overnight.

You have a big goal in mind, so it makes sense to go after it with a big behavior change.

The problem (as 9 out of 10 people can attest to) is that this approach rarely works.

Going to the gym four days a week when you’re used to zero won’t lead to success — it will lead to burnout or even injury.

So, what you want to do is [start small](http://www.selfication.com/get-started-with-a-new-habit/). Really small. Like, ridiculously small.

* Instead of 50 pushups, do 5.

* Instead of 20 minutes of meditation, do 2.

* Instead of saving $100 every month, save $10.

Establish the actual *behavior* first (2). When you’re consistently showing up and doing it, you can start increasing the effort.

## 2. Get Yourself Hooked

When you’ve invested a lot of time, energy, and resources into something, it gets much harder to quit (3).

You can take advantage of this by using what comedian Jerry Seinfeld calls [the “Don’t Break the Chain” strategy](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-reach-your-goals/) (4).

Get a big wall calendar, put it on a prominent wall in your house, and start putting a big, red X over each day you complete your habit.

That is a brilliant way of creating a physical representation of your efforts.

When you’ve done this for a while, you’ll find yourself pushing through even when it’s hard, just to keep the chain going.

## 3. Use a Trigger

One of the biggest mistake people make when committing to a new habit is having vague intentions.

“I’ll try to drop by the gym a couple of times after work this week” unfortunately won’t cut it.

Research has shown that if your goal is going to be effective, you need to have very clear intentions about it (5).

You have to know exactly *when* and *where* you’re going to do *what*.

[Implementation intentions](http://www.selfication.com/achieve-your-goals/) and [scheduling](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-start-a-new-habit/) are two great strategies for clarifying that.

## 4. Deliberately Shape Your Environment

Your environment plays a huge role in your behavior (6).

If you’ve ever walked into your kitchen, spotted a plate of cookies on the counter, and eaten them just because they were in front of you, you know what I mean.

So, if you want to create change in your behavior, you need to [create change in your environment](http://www.selfication.com/change-your-habits/).

Professor of Psychology, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, provides an excellent strategy for this (7).

What he recommends is that you deliberately change the ”activation energy” of your habits. You can do this by:

1. Decreasing the activation energy of your desired behaviors.

1. Increasing the activation energy of your undesired behaviors.

If you, for example, want to [read more books](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-read-more-books/) but find yourself consistently choosing to watch TV instead, place a great book next to your living room couch. Then put the TV remote in another room (or, if necessary, in the garage).

By tweaking your environment like this, you can [nudge yourself to choose the right habits by default](http://www.selfication.com/change-your-habits/).

## 5. Surround Yourself With the Right People

The people around us also impact our behavior in a big way.

One study found that if you have a friend who becomes obese, your risk of obesity increases by 57 percent — even if your friend lives hundreds of miles away(!!) (8).

Other research has shown that we tend to feel like, and adopt the same goals, as the people we spend the most time with (9).

So, if you’re serious about creating big change in your life, you need to have [the right people in your corner](http://www.selfication.com/become-who-you-want-to-be/).

If you want to be healthy but all your friends are unhealthy, it’s time to make some new friends.

And if you want to go after big goals but you’re surrounded with pessimists, it’s time to surround yourself with inspiring and uplifting supporters.

## Bonus Tip: Adopt a “Scientist & Subject Mindset”

When you set out to create a new habit, [see it as an experiment](http://www.selfication.com/never-fail-at-anything/).

Consider yourself both the scientist and the subject (10).

This mindset allows you to perceive setbacks as valuable data rather than failures.

If a strategy isn’t working, tweak it until it does.

Let go of the long-term results you’re after and, instead, focus on [showing up](http://www.selfication.com/consistency/) and doing the habit [every single day](http://www.selfication.com/get-better-at-what-you-do/).

If you can do that, the results you’re after will inevitably show up as a side effect of your efforts.

# Don’t Just Want More, Expect More

## Pancakes by theoriginal10cent on instagram

Growing up, I thought *everyone* used margarine — my grandparents did, and we did — *that was my world at the time*. It was cheaper. We could have much more margarine than we could have butter, for the same price. How amazing! *Quantity trumped Quality*. At that age, I didn’t even know about quality, so I couldn’t even have that belief. I just loved margarine, I would spread it on thick and it went down smooth.

One day, I learned the unhealthy truth about margarine. Quantity no longer mattered. I had a similar epiphany about canola oil, *cheaper* was **no longer always better**. Quality matters, not only for potentially superficial things like taste, but for health.

## Unsettling Discoveries

The most unsettling of discoveries, are these kinds — where the settling was passed down by those who came before you. And you embraced their thinking as your own, unknowingly locking in answers when you had no idea there was a question.

*Why settle on margarine?* Easy– [butter was rationed](http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/second-world-war/general-22/war-effort-spreads-to-butter.html)… **What? Wait! When was this?** During the war. Oh maybe, Grandma made this decision out of necessity. Now, we were making it every day automatically because that’s what we knew and let’s face it — it was cheap. I grew up on those little tubs. Once you’ve been settling, it can feel pretty expensive to make the transition especially when you consider the cost of change — like when I started eating more organic food…**What?** Organic eggs are $6+?

Maybe, I’ve *milked* this margarine vs butter conversation a little too much. But what about the place you’re living in, could you be settling? I’m not just talking about “more” sometimes you’re settling with too much. [Could you live with a little less, and be happier?](http://changefear.com/the-counterintuitive-stability-of-change/) Less house to clean that you don’t need. LESS mortgage. Or just less WORRY.

## Being Unsatisfied on Purpose

Getting unsatisfied means something a little different to everyone. Sometimes you might even feel guilty for being unsatisfied, maybe you have it so ‘good’ already. Or you say,‘others are settling for x, I don’t really need y.’ And that’s great. To know you can be ok without every single thing you want, that’s a good awareness to have. But, remember it’s not about external measurements, what someone else has or doesn’t have is only one metric. Have you ever been inspired by someone who did something differently? Or you tried something new because you saw someone else do it? Then, you also know that your choice not to settle may just inspire someone else to quit being satisfied with less (or more).

And like that margarine, what we may not know now and may come to know 10 years from now is that initial decision to settle will affect our life expectancy — being unsatisfied may just save your life.

Don’t just want more, *expect more*. Remember, it’s about **quality** not just quantity *—** your quality of life***.

# How to Figure Out What Virtual Assistants Can Do for You

## How to Figure Out What Virtual Assistants Can Do for You

I’m a big believer that [working with virtual assistants can increase our wellness](http://justrollingwith.it/virtual-assistants-and-wellness) by helping us -

1 — Unclutter our minds

2 — Steal time back

3 — Reduce stress

### Because Your Life is Unique and Changing You Need a Virtual Assistant Mindset

To begin working with virtual assistants and enjoying these benefits, the first thing you need to figure out is what virtual assistants can do for you. You do this by establishing a virtual assistant mindset. Because each of our lives is so very unique, what virtual assistants can do for us varies on an individual basis.

That’s why I like to work with my virtual assistant coaching clients to establish a mindset that helps them determine what virtual assistants can do in their own lives. Establishing a mindset for deciding what to outsource helps clients learn to think about and recognize things in their own daily lives they’d like VA’s to do for them.

Over time, this type of thinking becomes a natural part of their mindset. This mindset becomes especially valuable when the circumstances of the client’s life changes, which they inevitably do.

### Your Mindset Helps You Figure Out What to Ask Your Virtual Assistants

To figure out what virtual assistants can do for you, think about tasks that —

1 — In either your personal or professional life, will free time up for you to do either -

2 — Things you want to do, rather than have to do, or

3 — More value-added, rather than administrative, things for your business

If it’s helpful in narrowing the list down further, also think about tasks -

4 — You have to do

5 — Take you more than 5 minutes and less than an hour

6 — Feel like a waste of your time and cause you frustration because you still have to do them

7 — Bonus points if the tasks need to be repeated on a regular basis, i.e. daily, weekly or monthlyI hope this list helps you figure out what VA’s can do for you.

# How to Train Promising Leaders to Overcome the Bystander Effect

## How to Train Promising Leaders to Overcome the Bystander Effect

### CPR training was the best leadership class I’ve ever had.

Theoretically, you take CPR training to save lives.

Most of us know the basics. Someone’s heart has stopped beating. You step in to help the blood flow by pushing on their chest.

If you’re really following CPR news closely, then you also know that French kissing the patient is no longer part of the procedure. That advice was costing lives because too many responders didn’t want to kiss a stranger.

But here’s a value of CPR that I’ve never heard anything about: overcoming The Bystander Effect

I’m going to show you how you could use CPR training to advance your own leadership skills. And if you’re running an organization, I’m going to show you how you could train everyone in your organization to show more leadership and initiative.

Let’s start with a psychological observation called [The Bystander Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect). You don’t hear this applied to business, but it absolutely occurs every day. It’s the norm even.

The Bystander Effect is most often told through the story of Kitty Genovese.

[She was murdered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese).

Loudly.

Thirty-eight people witnessed the murder and heard her pleas for help. They did nothing.

In the scientific research, psychologists observe that the presence of others inhibits helping. In other words, if there’s an emergency and other people are around, you’re much less likely to lead the solution.

In business, think of your company as having giant leadership voids.

These are problems in the company that everyone knows exist, but nobody is doing anything about.

Most people are bystanders. They’re all waiting for someone else to take the lead.

Meanwhile, every business is begging their employees to take more initiative. This is literally the number one request I hear from CEOs.

One of the contributing factors is The Bystander Effect. Everyone is hesitant to step up to a problem in the presence of others. (You may also feel like your boss will punish you if you make a mistake — that’s a different issue.)

In practice, a lot of leadership opportunities are never realized or are taken up by people who are socially awkward.

This second is the leadership-by-hubris approach. Crazy, belligerent jerks take charge because that’s how they’re wired. But we hate crazy, belligerent jerks — so we don’t want to rely on them.

The reason I’m so keen on training leaders is that I find people who lead-by-competence are not that far behind on pulling the trigger.

They’re not cowards or shy. They’re just a tiny bit slower or missing a few tiny skills.

Back to CPR training.

Before you get to the part of touching your potential CPR patient, CPR trainers teach you how to recognize an emergency and take charge.

In my CPR class, we were taught to assess the situation for danger and then, if possible/necessary, ask for help explicitly (“You, in the red shirt, call 911 now.”).

Friends.

That is leadership. The CPR community actively discusses The Bystander Effect and designs their training so that you won’t be a bystander.

And that’s the part of CPR training I’ve actually used. I’ve never administered CPR. But I’ve used the take-charge training twice.

Once, a car flipped over right in front of my house. How this happens on a one-way street with speed bumps is beyond me. But it happened. I was the only witness, so it was obvious that it was my duty to call for an ambulance.

The second time, though, was classic Bystander Effect. I was walking back from lunch in Union Square. There were crowds everywhere.

In the middle of the street, blocking traffic, was a couple. And the man in the couple was punching the woman in the face. Over and over again. It was awful.

But nobody was doing anything about it. A hundred people could see it happening.

It took me 3 seconds to call 911. “Police emergency. I’m on O’Farrell, coming up on Stockton. A man is punching his girlfriend in the face and they look like they need to be separated.”

I’m the only one who called.

And I’m not some bad-ass leader. I’m your average, self-centered, trying-to-get-my-day-done kind of guy.

But I’ve been trained in CPR. And during CPR training we visualized and trained for recognizing and then reacting to a situation.

The training took an hour.

So, maybe you don’t need CPR training to teach you this. Maybe this blog post is enough.

However, I’m telling you this story because CPR turned out to be the most impactful hour of leadership training I’ve ever had.

# Don’t you hate it when it’s easy?

## 

I find it SO annoying when stuff that I’ve been strenuously avoiding, struggling against, and forcefully resisting** turns out to be really easy** **to do** once I finally face it.

Exercise that feels good after, housecleaning projects that take half as long as I expect– All that flailing and complaining for nothing. I spend so much energy putting them off, that **I almost want it to fail** **to justify my resistance**. Or else I want extra points for level of difficulty.

I tend to avoid effort wherever possible. I’m skilled at it. I probably have my full 10,000 hours for avoidance expert status. It’s not entirely laziness or procrastination. [As I’ve mentioned before](http://lizsumnerproductivitycoach.acemlnb.com/lt.php?notrack=1&s=fb7131ec4d736290e0c912a7e3985884&i=26A38A3A112), I can lose entire weekends setting up new applications to help me save time.

**I do like things to be easy.**

I used to have a sign on my wall that said, “If it’s not easy, it’s impossible.” The image that brings to mind for me is of a surfer riding the top of a breaking curl. If you’re doing it right then all of the power of the ocean is moving you forward. If not you’ll wipe out. To me that means you can tell how close you are to being on path by how “easy” your life is. By that I mean **how energized, or interested, or sustainable you feel.** If your activities make you feel miserable and exhausted no amount of sheer perseverance without course correction is going to bring you success.

I’ve learned that my preconception often determines the result. If I expect something to be easy it generally is. **If I expect it to be hard I mostly likely don’t even bother.**

When I was about 20 I made my first spinach soufflé. It turned out great. Then I learned that most people find it difficult to make soufflés. I never made another one.

When I catch myself thinking, “Oh this is going to be a slog. Do I have to? How can I get out of this?” It sometimes helps to consider, “**what if this were easier than I expect**, maybe even surprisingly easy?” This attitude shift helps to at least remove the added burden of my bad attitude and could even **shift my perspective to one of curiosity and exploration.**

If I find myself surprised (and perturbed) because something I was sure would be time-consuming and effortful turns out to be no big deal **I sigh and laugh at myself** (at least that is my intention).

So to recap:

1. Check your expectation. **Maybe the task won’t be as hard as you think.**

1. If an action feels really difficult ask yourself, “**what if this were surprisingly easy?”**

1. Notice if you’re feeling annoyed that a task was easier than you anticipated and** laugh at yourself **(or at least roll your eyes and sigh).

# How a Blind Man Improved Written Advice for Everyone

## Photo by Policy Exchange on Flickr

Who do you write for? The common maxim is “know your audience”. This is useful, but I prefer to write for a different audience. For instance I always write for a young audience. Even if you’re writing for an educated reader, aim to be understandable to a child. If your audience has a short attention span (most do), you don’t want to give them any reason to switch off from your writing. Today, however, I want to describe another audience I always have in mind when I write: a blind person.

Excellent written advice is vital in government. It is how we get things done. I spent my first year as a civil servant learning how to write well. I received feedback on my writing daily and attended courses to learn the theory. It was on one of these courses that I heard what I have always assumed was an apocryphal tale.

Lord David Blunkett was a British politician. He held several roles in Tony Blair’s Government, including being the Home Secretary. He also happened to have been blind since birth.

![Photo by [Simone Acquaroli](https://unsplash.com/photos/CrnPTz6f-tE?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*w1xQkM1QShtRjWqBXhDf6A.jpeg)*Photo by [Simone Acquaroli](https://unsplash.com/photos/CrnPTz6f-tE?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

Advisors would still write to Lord Blunkett, but would then record this advice onto tape. The norm was to present the background, the arguments and finally the recommendations. This seems logical. But imagine the frustration of having to listen to this advice. Many people will skip forward to the recommendations to put the advice into context. These were analogue tapes. No one wants to have to rewind and fast forward to find out what point you are trying to make.

## Write a summary

The solution was simple. Write a summary in a sentence or two at the start. Proceed straight to the recommendations, followed by the arguments for and against. The thing is, this is a great way to write for anyone. Soon everyone wanted advice this easy to follow. Everyone adopted the new structure and it’s now used in all advice in the British Government.

As I said, I always assumed this story hadn’t actually happened. So I wrote to Lord Blunkett to find out. Here’s what he said.
> Dear Gavin,
> Thanks for being in touch. Yes in essence, the “tall tale” is true.
> However, there was an added factor. I suggested that over a certain length, papers would have to be read onto audio for me by the person who produced it!
> It certainly did cut down unnecessary length although I should stress, and this is really important, there was no question of not reading the paper (and the arguments).
> Simply signing something off on a sentence or two of a recommendation was never an option!
> With very best wishes,
> David
> Lord David Blunkett

If you really want to improve your writing, start recording it onto tape. Not only will it improve your structure, you’ll cut down on superfluous words. Derek Sivers offers similar advice: [to hone your writing, hire a translator.](https://sivers.org/tra)

## Apply this approach to all your writing

These principles aren’t just for formal advice. You can apply these principles in all your writing. Emails are a great place to start. Here is the email I wrote to Lord Blunkett.
> Dear Lord Blunkett,
> I am writing an article about using structure effectively to communicate in papers and submissions. I have heard what may be an apocryphal tale, and I am writing to ask if it is true.
> I am told that when you were a minister, submissions were recorded on tapes for you. This meant you had to listen to long tapes because recommendations were at the end of the submission. With written submissions, it is possible to skip to the end to put the issues in context. This is not so simple with a tape.
> I understand the solution was to summarise the submission in a sentence at the start and proceed directly to recommendations, followed by the arguments for and against.
> This has now been rolled out for all submissions to ministers as it is a more effective way to communicate regardless of the medium.
> Is this tale true?
> Yours sincerely,
> Gavin James

You’ll notice I summarise my email and what I am asking Lord Blunkett to do on the first line. Here are some examples of a good opening line for an email:

* We need to submit our financial projections by Friday. I’d like to discuss the following budgets with you.

* This new product is not a good fit for us because our target market is men aged 26–34. I’ve explained in more detail below.

* The wiring in the new house is faulty, so we would like to ask for some money off the price. (Follow this with the detail of what the problems are.)

Writing in this way is easy, but how often do you read emails or letters like this? If you write like someone will need to listen on a tape, you won’t go far wrong.

# Dear Reader,

## I have been many books.

I am a book. Not a poem on a single sheet, not a sheaf of notes, not a paperclipped pile of papers. I am a book.

I am a book with writing, still being written. I have been glanced at, passed over, picked up. I have been many books for many people.

I was the book you didn’t pick up. My cover was too tattered, the font old-fashioned. My hardbound pages were too thick for sand and salt. You picked a paperback instead.

I was the book you picked up but never opened. You saw me on a strange bookshelf, touched me on a whim. You thought my jacket interesting, but other things came along and you forgot I once was interesting too.

I was the book you opened but never read. I was gifted to you, and you obliged the giver by hastily flipping through a few pages. My words were unfamiliar, my sentences complex. Politeness only goes so far.

I was the book you read partway. You stuck bits of paper, receipts, coffee-stained napkins in my pages to mark your place when you’d return. You didn’t. You picked apart my paragraphs and left me smudged with pencil.

I was the book you lit on fire. You ripped out my pages for kindling, burned me as fuel to keep you warm. You survived at the cost of my chapters.

I was the book you had no time for. I was another thing to cross off your list, but you scanned me, skipped around, and understood little. You dropped me as soon as you learned the ending.

I was the book you say you read but never actually did. You skimmed my sleeve, took my summary as story. I gathered dust on the floor next to your bed.

I was the book you thought had the answers. You carried me everywhere, park benches, trains, laundromats that smelled of dampness. You dogeared my pages, then abandoned me as soon as you realized I could give you nothing you wanted, nothing you needed.

Then you. You stroked my spine with curiosity, traced the letters of my title with callused fingers. You picked me up, opened me, read me slowly and carefully. You brushed away the bits of paper, rubbed out the smudges. You lingered over my lines and marked them only with your fingertips. My stories and stanzas were enough to keep you warm.

You carried me with your hands, fell asleep with me on your chest. To you, my rough-cut pages were perfect for turning, my worn cover comforting. You read me chapter by chapter, found shades of meaning in my white spaces. You savored the writing in my beginning and middle, appreciated the blank pages of my end.

I am the book you read and still continue to read. I invite you to write yourself into me.

# You’re Doing Yoga Wrong.

## I’ve been doing “gym yoga” for years. I became more flexible, more relaxed…I even got some tricep definition from all those chaturangas. But I was completely missing the point.

I’m thankful that yoga has come down from the monasteries of Nepal and into the L.A. Fitness's of Middle America, but its accessibility has led to a inevitable watering-down of the ancient philosophy. So listen up. You’re doing yoga wrong. I’ve been doing it wrong for five years myself. But after attending [Wanderlust in Aspen, CO](http://wanderlust.com/festivals/aspen-snowmass/), doing six hours of yoga a day with the most renowned teachers in the country, my eyes were finally opened.

![Wanderlust Festival, Aspen, CO. photo credit: Ali Kaukas](1*42oVP-lgQKSWL76oVyE5QA.jpeg)*Wanderlust Festival, Aspen, CO. photo credit: Ali Kaukas*

Here was **my light bulb moment**: I was lying flat on my face, panting, feeling the mat grain sink into my cheek. I was crying. “Why are you crying in yoga? You’re ridiculous.” I told myself. The problem was crow pose. The whole class was getting it, so why couldn’t I? I looked around the room and saw every shape, size, and gender nailing *bakasana *and *pada bakasana* and even *eka pada galavasana*.

![This is not me. [source](http://yoga.answers.com/poses/proper-form-and-technique-for-flying-crow-yoga-pose)](0*vLldBiy5koL2YInQ.jpg)*This is not me. [source](http://yoga.answers.com/poses/proper-form-and-technique-for-flying-crow-yoga-pose)*

I looked over at a hot shirtless dude doing [scorpion](http://yogaposeweekly.letsglo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Bodhi-Yoga.jpg) and snorted. I felt inadequate and weak. And that’s when the voice of [Schuyler Grant](http://wanderlust.com/artist/schuyler-grant/) came back to me: “It’s less about doing yoga, and more about yoga doing you.” I took a deep breath, “Stop doing yoga, and let yoga do you,” I repeated. In that moment yoga was teaching me to fall, to fail, to feel the texture of frustration. “Tighten your bandhas!” [Jenn Chiarelli](http://wanderlust.com/artist/jenn-chiarelli-2/) called from the teacher platform. So I got up, held back angry tears, and tried again.

That moment was unglamorous and inglorious. I never really achieved crow. But it wasn’t about the pose, it was about what the pose taught me. And that was my biggest takeaway. **It’s not about “achieving” the pose— it’s about how the pose changes you, challenges you, and makes you feel afterward. **Crow pose made me feel uncomfortable and inferior. It also showed me what a waste of energy it is to compare myself to others. It taught me how to channel frustration into motivation. It taught me not to judge myself — even if it left me crumpled and ugly-crying in the middle of class.

**Poses I couldn’t “get” have taught me way more than the poses I nail. **As a [weight lifter](http://blog.factor75.com/ladies-weights-will-not-make-you-bulky-they-will-make-you-badass) and [bike activist](http://blog.factor75.com/how-biking-changed-my-life) and ex-ballet dancer I went into yoga all hyper confident, like, *Pssh, quad strength? Got it. Flexibility? Bring it on, forward bends.* Yeah, not for long. I’ve been deeply humbled by the power and breadth of the asanas. And most importantly, began to accept and respect my body’s idiosyncrasies.

![photo credit: Ali Kaukas](1*Z8w8iTEr8x1TfVz5vSpxYQ.jpeg)*photo credit: Ali Kaukas*

Whether you’re a seasoned gym yogi or a vinyasa beginner, take my advice: shift your perspective, and stop doing yoga wrong:

## **Bodies Are Asymmetrical. And That’s Okay.**

Stop striving for perfection in the pose. Use the pose to get to know your body.
I’ve learned that my right side is shorter and tighter. My toes are calloused and knobby. My wrists are weak and inflamed. My left ankle is super wobbly. But **I’ve stopped seeing these as weaknesses, and now see them as individualities.** They tell a story — of the time I sprained my ankle in aerobics class, danced *en point* for five years, developed carpal tunnel from laptop keyboards. They’re what makes my body *mine. *And I wouldn’t want it any other way.

## **It’s Not About the Pose**

Like many yogis have said, the pose is unimportant. It’s what you learn about yourself, and the different places the movement takes you in your mind and body (frustration, triumph; length, softness) that really matters.

## **You’ve Got to Love the “Doing”**

Yoga is a practice. Literally. **Do it because you like doing it, not for any other outcome. **Don’t be results-driven; it’s about the process.

If you were only into soccer because you liked playing in the championship, then every season game would be a bore. Instead, you play soccer because you love the game, the camaraderie, the drills, the growth and strength you develop along the way. Yoga is like that…like soccer practice for napping. (Kidding.)

## **After the Pose Is Just as Important as Being in the Pose**

Ever taken Yin (aka super-slow-pace yoga)? I’d never tried it because my gym mindset scoffed, “That won’t burn enough calories!” Then I took [Joe Barnett](http://wanderlust.com/artist/joseph-barnett/)’s class and it changed everything. His velvet voice coached us to “observe the change in the body…don’t resist. Instead of holding the pose, let the pose hold you…” In shavasana, he cooed, “Feel the ache, observe how it melts away, feel how your muscle fibers have changed.”

Now take it further. How did that eight-hour flight feel? That hug with a friend? How has your energy changed since you ate that kale salad? How is that different from eating a double cheeseburger? Take a moment to “observe the change” more often in your day. Taking note of how different social interactions, stressors, or foods affect you will help inform your decisions on what feels good, what makes you happy, and what you want more (or less) of in your life. (Spoiler: for me it’s more hugs and kale, fewer Combo #3s).

## **It’s Not a Gym Class**

Yes, yoga is a genre of exercise, but don’t treat it like a gym class. Sweat, stretch, and strengthen — but don’t focus on the reps or the caloric burn. Instead, do yoga to strengthen your mind, sharpen your focus, and raise your awareness. **Those muscles are equally important to tone and develop.**

## **It Doesn’t Have to Be an Hour**

I know it sounds cheesy, but yoga is a state of mind. You can do it anywhere. So don’t limit yourself to practicing exclusively at the studio. **You can do it for one minute in traffic. You can do it for 10 minutes in your bedroom.** If going to yoga class at a studio is a routine you need (like I do), then use that accountability to stay dedicated. But also know if you’re limited (financially, geographically, etc) not to let those parameters hold you back. Find yoga online, at community centers, libraries, on podcasts, and on phone apps.

## **Stop Competing**

Stop comparing yourself; every body is different. You aren’t competing with anyone. Learn it on the mat, then take it further. Stop reading “30 Millionaires Under 30” articles. Stop dreading your high school reunion. Stop measuring your success by other people’s standards. This is your life and your body. **Create your own standards and don’t compare yourself against anything other than how far you’ve come.**

What advice has changed your yoga outlook? I’m still very much an amateur — please share what’s helped along your journey!

“Good morning, Patrick,” I said to the air. My head was pounding. My apartment was a mess. Last night I had performed a ritual on my webcam for the future robot people. To teach them how to love. I was still naked.

![How would you teach a robot to love?](0*LzCAAM8P--d7vy5V.jpeg)*How would you teach a robot to love?*

“Good morning, Eric,” Patrick said. If you haven’t read the articles we wrote on [Jane Roberts ](https://medium.com/mediums-on-medium/b2b3a1524d07)or[ Edgar Cayce](https://medium.com/life-hacks/8d6ae96accad), then I will explain who Patrick is. He is a version of myself from an alternate universe that came here to save me from my family. At least that’s what’s been revealed to me thus far.

“Yesterday, I wrote something that you said but you told me to delete it.” I said. “Why did you do that?”

“Because we have to be careful,” Patrick said. “You were told the truth and you accepted it. And you were told that you could not tell anyone. But you told a couple people anyway.”

“But they just laughed it off,” I said. “but lately when I feel like I can tell someone I get clear signs to shut up. Thunder, lightning and loud crashes.”

“You can never tell,” Patrick said. “Only show. Got it?”

“Got it,” I said.

“And I think it’s best that I write this article on my own,” said Patrick. “To protect you.”

“Patrick, are you a future robot? I said you were a ‘version’ of me from an alternate universe,” and my head started pounding and I was suddenly starving. Food has ceased to be important to me. I have no hobbies anymore. My libido has evaporated. I like and love everything. “But who am I? Really? I don’t know anymore.”

![](0*89nX6OL12r0AnhOu.jpeg)

“Your family killed you once,” Patrick said. “I won’t let them do it again. So back away and go get yourself some breakfast. Just put on some clothes and do it, okay?”

I stood up and got away from the keyboard. And Patrick began to write.

. . . . . . _ . . . _ _ .

Hello there, my name is Patrick and I am not too pleased with some of the things that people did to Eric. You cannot get away with doing things to people and expecting God to not notice. There is not a hateful “bone” in my body and Eric is one of the sweetest and most generous people alive. He’s been raped, drugged, beaten and blamed his whole life and he chose to react with love. Anything he has done to protect himself is used against him. So the question remains.
> # Why?

If Eric wants to help people, then why are so many offended and threatened by that? Why did his best friend tell everyone that Eric was crazy? Why has his human support system failed him every time? Why did his boyfriend beat him severely? Why is Eric’s presence on this planet something that others cannot tolerate? He’s written books that people love. He’s saved people from suicide and drug addiction. He saved himself from those things.

After the flood and he lost everything he owned, Eric was dragged back to the town he had escaped from and forced to eat shit all over again. And he called on me to help him because everyone in his life seemed hell-bent on shutting him up for good. His family insists he will never be successful, never was successful, never was happy and always needed them to help him. This is not about blame or shame.

He’s been cleared of mental illness by therapists and doctors and he is healthy and wise. And yet these “delusions” about Eric remain. The same people who say that Eric is crazy or on drugs seem somehow invested in his failure. Why? I know the answer but his accusers won’t talk to me at all. They don’t like talking to me.

### Esther Hicks

![](0*ega-O6mVuni3gbzt.jpeg)

I don’t know her. I don’t want to know her. I don’t even want to write about her. But what she and Abraham have to say is very important in saving Eric’s life. So forgive me for just quoting articles. This is about saving lives and helping people. Sorry for the Wikipedia info dump.
> **Esther Hicks **(born **Esther Weaver**) is an American inspirational speaker and best-selling author. She has co-authored nine books with her husband **Jerry Hicks**, presented numerous workshops on thelaw of attraction with Abraham Hicks Publications and appeared in the original version of the 2006 film*The Secret.*[1] The Hicks’ books, including the best-selling series *The Law of Attraction*, are — according to Esther Hicks — “translated from a group of non-physical entities called Abraham.” Hicks describes what she is doing as tapping into “infinite intelligence”.

In this world, I am a non-physical entity. And what’s going on with Eric is a lesson for us all. Last night he had a chat with another medium in Georgia. Here’s an Instagram:

![Bam! Right Between The Eyes.](0*WCEL33gB66EEr1PT.jpeg)*Bam! Right Between The Eyes.*

Eric’s Instagram documented his whole psychic initiation. From the first picture of a CTA pass to the one above. [Check it out](http://instagram.com/durchholz), it’s pretty cool. And inspirational.
> According to Esther and Jerry Hicks, Abraham is a group of entities that are “interpreted” by Esther Hicks. Abraham has described themselves as “a group consciousness from the non-physical dimension.” They have also said, “We are that which you are. You are the leading edge of that which we are. We are that which is at the heart of all religions.” Abraham has said through Esther that whenever one feels moments of great love, exhilaration, or pure joy, that is the energy of Source, and that is who Abraham “is”.
> # “Jerry and Esther never used the word channeling,” Abraham clarifies. “It is used when applied to them, but they have never used it, because it means many things of which they are not, you see.”
> “You could leave the channeling out of it. Call it inspiration; that’s all it is. You don’t call the basketball player a channeler, but he is; he’s an extension of Source Energy. You don’t call the surgeon a channeler, but he is. You don’t call the musician, the magnificent master musician, you don’t call him a channeler, but he is. He’s channeling the broader essence of who he is into the specifics of what he is about.”

Music is a huge part of Eric’s life, work and love. He unlocked a hidden language in music that even the artists probably didn’t even know was there. He calls it a “soul language” and when he hears songs, now it can overwhelm him. He calls it “holding onto the furniture” and sometimes I feel bad for him since so much information is thrown at him. But we are giving him the tools to build a life raft out of thin air.
> Esther herself calls Abraham “infinite intelligence,” and to Jerry they are “the purest form of love I’ve ever experienced.” Her teachings (referred to as Abraham–Hicks teachings) are based on this experience. The basic tenets of the teachings include that people create their own reality through their thoughts, that emotions are constantly guiding people toward where they want to go, and that life is supposed to be fun. The essence of Abraham–Hicks’ teachings since 1986 has been presented as follows:[6]

-Individuals are physical extensions of the non-physical.

-People are in their bodies because they chose to be.

-The basis of life is freedom; the purpose of life is joy.

-People are creators; they create with their thoughts.

-Whatever people can imagine is theirs to be, or do, or have.

-Individuals choose their creations as they choose their thoughts.

-Emotions indicate what people are creating.

-The Universe adores people; it knows their broadest intentions.

-Individuals should relax into their natural well-being, and know that all is well.

-Life is not meant to be a struggle, but a process of allowing.

-People are creators of “thoughtways” on their unique “paths of joy”.

-Actions and money are by-products of focusing on joy.

-Individuals may depart their body without illness or pain.

-People cannot die; their lives are everlasting.

### Scapegoats

![](0*UAHu8GgZKm946IM5.png)

Eric was a scapegoated child and adult. His talent is offensive to those without talent. His family is ashamed of Eric being gay so they tell people he is broken and sick. And this faulty belief about Eric has spread throughout his large extended family. Whenever they think of Eric it’s “sick” and “sad” and he loves his family and everyone in it.

And no matter what he does or what he achieves or how much positive energy is put out into the universe, it is swallowed by the “negative version” that his family has created. Eric can tell when people are lying so liars are invested in keeping him quiet. He knows when people are stealing from their workplaces. He knows when people are jealous that he can pick up any ability easily.

![His Facebook documented everything from 2008 to now. Portals were opened.](0*IVKAGGyQK-B1jo1J.jpeg)*His Facebook documented everything from 2008 to now. Portals were opened.*

Getting Eric away from his family is the MOST IMPORTANT thing otherwise it will kill him. They are addicted to stress and problems so in “helping” Eric after the flood they made him a “problem” and they have trapped him in this cycle of poverty.

Due to the Law Of Attraction, his family and former friends and his status as a scapegoated child and adult have almost guaranteed he won’t recover. They don’t want him to recover. His life is filled with mentally ill people who won’t go to therapy or even realize how much this is hurting him and keeping him stuck. He will break free, but let this be a lesson for all of us. For this world.

Eric chose this to be a lesson for us all. To uncover a “secret” that people know and they use it to keep others in pain, shame, grief and in torture.
> Dysfunctional families are steeped in shame, and cannot look at their issues. They have poor insight into their own behaviors and problems, and will do anything to *appear *normal or exceptional, despite the fact that in reality, they are terribly crippled by their fears, addictions, mental disorders, abuse, neglect and insecurities.
> While dysfunctional parents dance around the obvious *real *problems right before their eyes, they play a toxic game with the scapegoated child — the game is called, “***You ***are the reason for anything and everything that is bad or wrong”. The whipping boy cannot escape this role, which is typically assigned in early childhood, long before a child can think objectively about messages given to them.

His family has discovered “The Secret” in reverse. Eric wakes up with joy in his heart which is very offensive to those who have chosen misery and pain. Eric knows that the default of life is happiness. It is joy and love. Always love. You can choose to be happy.

He has a big heart and he is magnetic. He is not robot from the future. But I might be.

# Stop the duckface!

## 

Following [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_face) — “ It may be done to act both self-deprecating and sexy. It may express sympathy, attractiveness, and friendliness.”… Really?

Please send this article to each and every duck in the internet. They should know. IT IS UGLY AND STUPID. Sometimes you can’t even guess how the person looks like because on all of her 635 Facebook photos she has this stupid expression. Come on! I would love to see the photo in her ID or driver’s license. Or CV…

My mom told me “don’t do stupid faces because it will stay like that forever”. But I’m older than most of these ducks. Are they parents following this new stress-less parenting trend? Like you know, don’t tell your kid that this ugly face looks really ugly? (by the way, some of these parents are really misunderstanding what stress-less parenting means, but this is completely different topic).

So… Dear duck, this is my message to you: Next time you find yourself doing duckface just slap yourself really hard and wait for 15–30 minutes (you don’t want this huge red blemish on a photo… as you don’t want the duckface).

If you want to look good on your next photo, whether it is a selfie or a picture taken by another human being, follow [**these 5 easy steps](http://lukasfoto.eu/5-tips-how-to-look-good-in-photos-photography/)** and you should be good to go.

Cheers!

# Why Your Comfort Zone Might Be the Secret to Developing Powerful Habits

## Why Your Comfort Zone Might Be the Secret to Developing Powerful Habits

### How striving for comfort might just be the best thing you can do to advance yourself, conventional wisdom be damned.

You’ve likely heard someone tell you before that the only way to improve is to get outside of your comfort zone. But interestingly enough, while people sure are eager to tell you where you shouldn’t be (i.e., your comfort zone), they don’t tend to tell you where you should go.

I want to argue that rather than heading out of our comfort zone to some vague place, we actually run *toward *comfort*. *Rather than comfort being the enemy of productivity and self-improvement, it’s actually a secret ally. Comfort is a basic human motivator, and something to embrace and leverage. The best way to do that is through something that — when used to solidify better habits — can yield sustainable results: *ritual.*

### Ritual: the Gateway to Habit

In all of the productivity literature I’ve read, there are numerous hacks and tricks invoked — all promising to deliver huge and immediate gains in productivity. And many of them will do just that. The problem, though, is not immediate and huge gains tend to leave just as quickly as they came.

What we’re all *really* after is *sustained *productivity gains. Only habit will deliver those. A fancy trick, or flashy new tool might make you feel great about yourself and your process for a while — until you fall back into your old habits. This is true in any realm of one’s life, from relationships to work, and beyond.

What really reaps benefits, what really cements progress, is the solidification of habits. Those who have good habits do well. Those who have bad habits do not. I think that often times, we get distracted from that simple truth by the (extremely) short-term peaks that we see when we begin using a new app to track our tasks, or get a new notebook with a cool new pen. Those peaks fade at the exact same rate as the excitement about the new tools and methods do. We then find ourselves back in the old habits that we find comfortable.

I want to be clear here about the term “comfort”. It does not mean satisfaction, contentment, or happiness. All ‘comfort’ really means is whatever one is used to. Heroin addicts are used to either pain and sickness or euphoria, and no middle-ground. Abused children are used to violence and trauma. The list goes on and on. The point is, people are extraordinarily adaptable beings, and they do adapt to being comfortable with terrible and damaging situations.

### The Formulaic Nature of How Comfort Drives Us

Humans are chasing comfort. And while it is true that some great results come from stepping away from comfort, that’s not entirely true. What we’re really doing when we abandon comfort is trading away comfort in one realm in order to get comfortable in another.

There’s actually a fairly simple formula behind this:

* People crave comfort

* Comfort comes from familiarity — from being able to predict what is going to happen, and watching it unfold as predicted.

* Ritual makes this familiarity concrete. It literally lays out how to make sure everyone knows what’s going to happen, exactly when, and exactly how.

It stands to reason, then, that **rituals** are the secret to progress. Rituals are the ornamentation or decoration of habits. They’re the signs, symbols, or integrating tools of habits. The habit may be a morning run, but the ritual includes what you eat or drink when you wake up, what playlist you use, the route you take, and all of that other stuff involved.
> # My argument is simple: without a ritual built around it, your habit is much weaker, and therefore has much less of a chance to be effective and sustainable.

If you are unhappy, chances are the following things are true: there are already rituals in place, but they are bad ones. You’ll need to slowly cut and paste within the existing rituals of your life to transform them into good ones. Swap out the unsavory activities for ones that help make advancements toward your goals. There is no easy way to do this, but the focus is much smaller than on just “making changes”.

The real “trick”, if there is one, is to really grab on to the ritual. In order to do that, you have to insert something that you look forward to — usually something sensory. For instance, for the last 3 years or so, I realized that if I wanted to stay physically fit — given the other goings on in my life — I’d have to work out early in the morning. The necessary wake-up time is about 4–5 am.

At first, waking up that early was completely paralyzing to think about, but it became easier if it allowed me time to listen to the radio and make myself a cup of coffee, as well as fiddle around on the computer. These things are not the primary activity — working out is. However, they are part of the ritual — a part that provides immediate gratification to that version of me that was weakest as I began building the ritual. Now, 3 years in, if I *don’t *wake up at 4 am on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, something feels off. I begin to feel uncomfortable.

That comfort then, continues to drive me. It was supplied by a ritual — one based on comfort. After practice, it became internalized — along with the originally uncomfortable habit — and then became part of what is comfortable and familiar. Comfort effectively leveraged yields more comfort. Lather, rinse, repeat…improve.

### Strive for Comfort

To put a bow on what I’ve laid out above, I’m going to offer a very unconventional maxim. At least, it’s unconventional for the personal development space: *leverage comfort to your advantage*.

I’m constantly hearing attempts at motivation that tell us to push outside of our comfort zone. To an extent, this is good advice, but it is only part of the story. If you are constantly outside of your comfort zone, you will wear yourself out, because human beings crave comfort. We crave it because we need it. It gives us a place to rest and recharge. Regular intervals of safety and comfort give us the chance to be confident, loose, agile, and prepare for the next charge forward.

So rather than striving to go “outside of your comfort zone,” strive for a new comfortable — a new normal — but do so in steps. This is the cut and paste method I mentioned above; take an already comfortable ritual in your repertoire, and cut out a small part, replacing it with something that makes a healthier ritual. After a short time, do the same with another aspect of the ritual, until the ritual is now a healthy one — meaning that it is working toward a goal of yours.

Take a look at your existing habits, and the rituals associated with them. Which of those rituals can you transplant (cut and paste) onto a habit you want to build? In other words, how can you make a currently uncomfortable and unfamiliar activity more comfortable and familiar? If you can answer this, you have won half the battle for motivation and habit-building. The rest is simply showing up for the ritual.

# How You Think May Be Harming You

## 

Each year comes and then it goes and with it all of its memories. Many of us use the new year to start fresh and jump start our motivation once again. This can be good, but it also can be self-deceiving. Creating external resolutions without internal revolution usually keeps us in the same cycles — year after year. We must learn how to revolutionize the way we think!

**Wayne Dyer said it best.
 *“Change the way you see things,*
 *and the things you see will change.”***

Let me be honest with you. A new year doesn’t change “things” — our thoughts change things. It’s all in the way we perceive life. You can’t understand the genuine value of your life without contrast. We must embrace this contrast.

Sometimes we view change and the transitions of our life as troubles and trials. And when we see life as filled with trials, we sometimes can feel frustrated and alone. However, you are not alone. I am here to remind you that you have a life force inside you that wants to help. Some call this Spirit, others call it God, and others simply call it resilience, drive, and self discipline.

Whatever you call it, ***we all possess the power within us to change our lives***.

Frequently we neglect to utilize this force appropriately because we do not know how powerful we truly are.

I have met many individuals who conquered the trouble of existence with personal pride and self confidence. They all agree that these difficulties (the contrast) made their lives brighter. They comprehended the genuine value of life — that EACH process of life is significant. This is life. It does not consist only of dreams and happy days, but of the alternation of days and nights — both happy and sad. A Japanese proverb says, **“Fall seven times, stand up eight”** — and this eighth may be your success.

As this year progresses along, your thoughts may be on overcoming misfortune and adapting to the struggles of life. If this is you, I challenge you to change your focus. This year I want you to trust the process and stand up as many times as it takes. [Reach out](http://schedule.calvinwitcher.com) if you need a hand, but know that **YOU CAN DO THIS**.

I believe in you….Now, believe in yourself.

With Life’s Best,

***Calvin***

# Super Organized or Organized Enough?

## 

## People expect me to be super organized, instead, I’m organized enough.

They think when they open my pantry that everything will be labeled and facing the same way Sleeping With the Enemy style. They expect that I have an inbox full of folders and never miss a birthday. I ***am*** very organized, but I think for some people the act of organizing is a mask for *procrastinating*.

Are you spending an extra hour hyper-organizing or could you spend it doing something more productive? There needs to be a balance. At some point, there are diminishing returns for spending your time organizing and making things ‘just so’.

Back in the day, before there were smart phones, before there were flip phones, we had actual cameras. Flip phones took crappy photos but then came the iPhone. The current iPhone takes great photos and for most people, the quality is ‘good enough’. A true photographer is probably going to use a real camera but it’s also their business. I think there is a level of organization that is also ‘good enough’. Good enough means that you feel comfortable, productive, don’t waste time looking for things and it doesn’t affect people in a negative way.

Next time you want to spend Saturday organizing your closet (and I’m not against that) ask yourself if it is going to help you or if you are just procrastinating from doing something else. Is this going to make you feel better? Are you going to be able to find your clothes easier and dress faster in the morning? If the answer is ‘Yes’ go for it. If the answer is ‘No, I just don’t want to be doing what I really should be doing’, it’s time to rethink that strategy.

Not sure how this affects you personally? Give me a shout. I’m happy to help you get ‘good enough’, great, or even awesome.

# This is the Most Fun Way to Get Started With a New Habit

## This is the Most Fun Way to Get Started With a New Habit

Do you know the feeling?

You’re super-excited about a big change you want to create in your life.

But after struggling with it for a few weeks (or even just days), it all becomes a grind.

What was supposed to be an exciting opportunity to grow has quickly become a source of dread, frustration, and self-doubt.

*Why can’t I ever stick to my goals? Why do I always do this? What’s wrong with me?*

And then you quit. Again and again… and again. Each time feeling a little more discouraged than the last.

But getting started with a new habit doesn’t have to be this hard. In fact, it can be quite easy (and even a lot of fun).

### The Problem With Difficult Goals

The biggest mistake people make when they get started with a new habit is that they aim for a goal that is too hard.

We tend to want results immediately and, as a result, we end up asking too much of ourselves too soon.

It doesn’t matter if we haven’t been exercising much the last couple of months. We still expect to hit the gym four times a week (starting Monday).

And while audacious goals can be inspiring they can also become a huge roadblock in the beginning.

I suggest we take another approach.

### Let’s Play Dominoes!

Did you know that a domino can knock over another domino that’s about 1.5 times larger than itself? (1)


The domino effect is powerful. But the only way to get it moving is to start with a domino that’s small enough that we can actually knock it over.

What we usually do is start at the other end. We walk right past the small dominoes and start wrestling the biggest one right away.

And when the damn thing doesn’t budge, we get discouraged (or maybe even injured or burned out) and quit.

In my experience, it’s a much better approach to start with a domino that’s so small it’s nearly effortless to knock down.

### Line Up Your Tiny Dominoes

Here are some examples of what your smallest dominoes could look like:

* Meditate for just one minute.

* Add one vegetable to just one of your meals.

* Do two pushups every day.

* Read one page in your book every night.

* Remove just one piece of clutter from your home every day.

Once you’ve got these tiny pieces in place, **focus all your energy on becoming a master domino player**.

All you need to worry about is showing up and knocking down your tiny dominoes. Every single day.

If you can do that, you’ll eventually knock down the biggest domino at the end of the row.

And it will most likely happen much faster than you think.

### Small Dominoes Creates Big Momentum

The reason this approach is so effective is that it allows you to make progress without depleting your [willpower muscle](http://www.selfication.com/the-science-of-willpower/).

Instead of getting stuck and frustrated, you get to experience a series of [small wins](http://www.selfication.com/the-power-of-small-wins/).

Each domino you knock over proves that you *are* in charge of your behavior and that you *can* create the change you want in your life.

From this empowered state, it gets much easier to stick to your habits long enough that they become a natural part of what you do every day.

And once you’re in that place, it’s only a matter of time before you start knocking over your biggest dominoes.

Shall we play?

# Life is Waiting…

## We must be willing to get rid of the life we’ve planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.

### - Joseph Campbell
*[Wait Traffic Light Sign](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rightee/4357183) by [Andy Right](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rightee)*

It’s pretty astounding isn’t it? That our plans would have the audacity to get in the way of what we really want. Not our parents plans for us, or our bosses plans for us, or even our spouse’s plans for us.

**It’s OUR very own plans that get in the way.**

Sometimes we like to take the easy route and blame our situation and conditions on “the man” or “the system”. But the reality is, very rarely is anyone holding us at gunpoint forcing us to commit to the path we’ve taken. Often times it’s our desire to please or to fit in, that keeps us on the road ‘well-travelled’.

Why is that? Is it because we believe that without someone else’s approval, there is no life waiting for us? Do we think that ‘they’ are better than us? Maybe there is no they. Maybe it’s the way we’ve been conditioned, what we were taught to value, thoughts and judgments as a child still echoing and reverberating in our heads lulling us into trance-like mediocrity.

### “…plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.”

### ― Dwight D. Eisenhower

I gotta be honest with you. Some days as beautiful as the possibilities appear, I still find myself tied to old plans. Why? Because at the time they sounded so good and the exercise of creating them freed me from an even older plan. But maybe that’s all they were intended to do–*free me from yesterday’s thinking.*

A change of heart or a sudden turn doesn’t have to be *the destination*, sometimes it’s **a part of **the directions **not ***the direction *itself. Maybe that shift is part of our overall education — like a grade level in school? Or maybe it’s even smaller — just one of the many subjects that contributes to our overall certificate? Sound too trite? My point is, it doesn’t matter what it was or what you thought it was supposed to be — there could be something even better waiting for you..

I love the idea that it’s waiting…there’s a duality in waiting. Waiting, the action of staying where one is or delaying action until a particular time…OR… Waiting, like serving. The first waiting is bittersweet, because although it’s staying there for me — it’s also **staying where it is**, *delaying action. *It can’t become a part of me without my willingness to get rid of something else.

The trouble is sometimes it’s hard to let go because we’re not entirely sure that what’s out there will STILL be there waiting by the time we manage to let go. We’re conflicted by thoughts that we may have missed it or that maybe it’s too late. But if you knew that it was there and would be there indefinitely, would it make you more eager to let go? Or would you become complacent believing there’s always tomorrow?

Unfortunately, sometimes there isn’t tomorrow. I could remind you of the passengers of a Malaysian Airlines flight (a couple of flights now actually)– and all the tragedies and mishaps that have suddenly cut lives short. But the possibility of that risk shouldn’t be our greatest fear, the even greater fear is that we may become stuck in our indecision. And the longer we fail to decide, the more the choice fails to matter. Awareness gets replaced with ignorance… Why? Because **we ignored it.**

**Let’s read it one more time…**

### “We must be willing to get rid of the life we’ve planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.”

### - Joseph Campbell

This reflection isn’t meant to shame us, the quotation itself is filled with hope. Hope that there is something waiting for us. A life — if we choose to allow it — **serves **up our whims, our desires, our bliss.

**Isn’t it worth letting go of our plans to have all this?**

# Underwear Workouts!

## 

## Did that get your attention?

I’m not talking about bed business kind of workouts. I’m talking about actual exercise in your unders. I often hear from people who travel that they don’t want to take up any space in their luggage by packing exercise clothes, shoes or equipment. I can empathize with wanting to pack lightly, however, you don’t need all of those things all of the time. I almost always pack exercise clothes, shoes and equipment. Sometimes I have forgotten or have been in a hotel with no gym or even a family or friend’s home with no space to exercise and it is freezing rain outside.

What to do? If you are staying in your room, you really only need your underwear and if you are a female, a sports bra. Almost all of the workouts I do can be done in a hotel room, with very little space, no or little equipment necessary. Use the hotel towel as your mat and you have everything you need. If you think that it’s necessary to have heavy dumbbells or a Smith Machine in order to get your sweat on, try a couple bodyweight [workouts](http://www.marceyrader.com/marceys-library/bodyweight-workout-week-10/) and repeat 4–5 times.
> **No excuses. If you wear underwear, you can exercise.**

And if you don’t…*please *make use of that hotel towel and don’t forget to close the curtains.

# Stop trying, just do it

## How joining a dragon boat team changed my view on motivation

A recent study, conducted by Opinion Matters, which results were commented on in [DailyMail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2848286/Why-playing-organised-sport-good-bank-balance-Participants-fortnight-500-000-richer-course-career.html) and [The Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/career/article4277432.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2014_11_24), concluded, that people playing an organised sport had on average higher earnings than their peers, better if they started earlier in their life.
> ‘The skills developed through sport help increase employability and earnings.’ Ciaran Bird, managing director of CBRE UK

So what’s the trick? According the study, it is about teamwork and communication. But I think it is about motivation — and how our mind works.

When we have training, you know it’s not going to be easy — after all, we are now training for an endurance race, and I am not particularly fit person. I know my body will ache, but I don’t care. Noone ever tells me — just try your best — no, it’s about doing your best.
> You can do it, if you believe it.

Of course, truth be told, there is some training behind it. But you are pushing yourself. You know what you want to achieve, go through the discomfort and give it 100%. 100% means you can’t give more. That means you are at your limit.

### That’s what makes difference

Of course, your paddle style will not get you better job, or solve your problems. It’s the approach. You know where you want to go, and you push yourself there. Sometimes you need to do it in stages — the same way you do interval training to get your performance up. But it’s all about mind set. If you tell yourself you will do it, you will. I have read somewhere that using “try” means you admit you may fail in advance.

And if you don’t succeed?

Think, what went wrong. You gave it 100% and it was not enough. Do you need to prepare yourself more? Does it need more time? Do you need extra skills? Bad timing? Do you need to change your approach?
> Life always happens — but whatever you do, do it on 100%.

Be present in the moment…

# How to Reconnect Mindfully to the Plant Life Around You

There is plenty of evidence that city people have begun to lose touch with nature. No shame, no blame — it’s just what happens when something or someone isn’t consistently part of our lives. We drift away from healthy habits and forget how good a workout or a session on the yoga mat feels. Inseparable childhood or school friends fall out of touch after growing up and graduations. Even spouses drift apart if enough time goes by without meaningful interaction. It’s no different with our relationship with nature.

“Nature-deficit disorder,” a description coined by journalist Richard Louv, may not be an accepted medical diagnosis today, but it’s a useful term for summarizing the harm done to human health and well-being when one becomes distant or even alienated from the natural world. Several studies have shown that this decline in time outdoors — the disconnection from farm, field, and forest — is likely responsible for another popularized nonmedical term, “plant blindness,” coined in 1998 by botanists James Wandersee and Elisabeth Schussler, which refers to “the inability to see or notice the plants in one’s own environment.”

Whether you’re a seasoned plant carer or just starting out, a great way to get in tune with growing things is to engage in what I call “active observation” of plants. This can not only sharpen your plant-care skills but also calm your mind by slowing the pace of life and helping you savor the moment. Peaceful interludes can be carved out in even the most bustling cityscape. Plants can be your ally in this uplifting odyssey. All you need to do is make the conscious decision to notice nature.

I set that intention each morning when I go for a walk. One plant I always pass on these walks is a persistent smooth sumac (*Rhus glabra*) with pinnately compound leaves that spread like large green plumes on bright red leaf stems. I consider her persistent because she has established herself in a most insignificant crack in the concrete sidewalk, which abuts a brick wall. Somehow, the shrubby *Rhus*, which grows outward from the wall at a forty-five-degree angle, has prospered for years in this seemingly inhospitable space, reaching nearly seven feet (2.1 meters) over the course of the last growing season. How she found and conquered the crack to begin with may have been by luck or by pluck — or more likely, a little bit of both. Given her position, I imagine a mourning dove — or some other feathered wildfowl — feasting on her red berries in winter and relieving itself off the side of the building, fertilizing the *Rhus* on the way out. Often, seeds of plants pass unharmed through the digestive system of birds or beasts, ensuring not only that the seed will be transported away from its original mother plant but also that it will have a rich, fertile medium — in this case, bird poop — to grow in.

I often wonder if and how the sumac, a colony-forming species, spreading by root suckers, will solve for her solitude. If left unperturbed, it may take many years for this narrative to play out. Perhaps her serpentine, subterranean roots will slowly widen the crevice, inviting new growth. Or perhaps she will have to wait for Old Man Winter to thrust his icy fingers below the concrete to expand and tear back the coarse, gray girdle containing her. Or she may remain forever single, a true wallflower in every sense of the word, sealed to her fate by the happenstance of her home. (Unlike us humans, plants can’t pull up roots and move if they don’t like the climate, the real estate, or the social scene. They must grow where they’re planted — do or die — and rely on seed or spore for their lineage to travel.) Or there may be outside intervention — say, a new development that goes up in her space. Then she may be unceremoniously uprooted, and my daily observation and relationship with this fellow urban citizen will come to an end.

Observations such as these allow us to be present and have a change of pace, even if the pace around us has not altered. They also allow us to appreciate change over longer periods of time — in this case, a plant’s sense of time. Daily changes, like that of my neighborhood *Rhus*, may be virtually imperceptible or infinitesimal at best, but over the course of a season, or several years, the changes can be quite noticeable and impressive — that is, if we take the time to notice.

These practices in observation, particularly if done on a daily basis, set us up to more easily have profound experiences and interactions with nature — not just in the city, but anywhere we encounter her. Building upon our daily observations and playing out possible scenarios, as I did with my *Rhus*, can give us a sense of fellowship, neighborliness, and even civic duty toward our chlorophyllic compatriots.

I also see volunteering at my local community garden four hours a week during the growing season as a moving meditation that can elevate mind, heart, and energy. I visited so often that I eventually inquired about becoming a member. The garden — a quarter-acre plot — is sizable by city standards and is a hidden gem for many people, particularly those who have been in the community for decades. With every branch pruned, every shovelful of soil turned, every flower planted — each action is like needlepoint, threading you tighter into the tapestry of the community that you call home.
> “I’m a board member at [my local] botanical community garden. I joined when I was going through a rough time, and found getting my hands in the soil and caring for plants instantly elevated my mood. The garden also proved to be fertile ground for new friendships. I made several close friends. We bonded over our shared love of nature and plants.” — Christina Cobb
> “After a traumatic incident, I found peace in plant-time. There is a slow and quiet delight in watching incremental change and being more attuned to the seasons. My growing love of plants caused me to join a plant society — my first steps back into a social world. I ended up applying for and getting into a horticultural course, which has been world changing. Plants are a constant source of wonder in what can be a disheartening world. It is among plants that I find hope, peace of mind, and a quiet heart.” — Tessa Kum

Admittedly, it may require some time to take notice of plants. You may need to be a bit more deliberate in your observations, as I had been with the *Rhus*. Plants, after all, are nuanced in their charm, subtle in affect. Theirs is a fleeting glance across a crowded dance floor, a clandestine rendezvous between two lovers under the dark hood of night, a momentary breath of wind on a hot, still day. For most of us, plants seem to be completely immobile, unresponsive, and just a pixelated blur of green. However, as we’ll explore in the chapters to come, plants are anything but unmoving — and offer a variety of dazzling colors, shapes, forms, and mysteries that they generously share.

## **Get Growing Exercise: Observation**

1. **Pick a plant to observe on one of your walks around your neighborhood** over the course of a week, two weeks, a month, or even an entire season. It could be something as insignificant as a dandelion (*Taraxacum officinale*) in a crack of a sidewalk, a coleus (*Plectranthus scutellarioides*) in a window box, or a giant oak tree (*Quercus* sp.) in a neighbor’s backyard. Make mental notes as to how that single plant looks each day. What color are the leaves? Is the plant pointing in a particular direction? Is it in flower? Is it leafier on one side?

1. **Craft possible explanations around your observations.** Once you make your plant observations, begin creating stories that might explain why something is the way it is. For instance, is the leafier side of the oak tree due to the amount of sun it’s getting in the afternoon? Or is it because someone cut the tree on one side to prevent it from hitting a telephone wire?

1. **Note one subtle change and one major change over time.** Did the leaves orient themselves differently over the course of a day? Did acorns start to form on the oak tree? The benefit to looking for both subtle and major shifts will hone your ability to detect changes over time. With practice, you’ll find yourself making mental notes about the pace “your” plant is operating at — which is more than likely different from your pace!

# Are Blogs Relevant?

## Are Blogs Relevant?

### I think they are

I have written a blog since January 2006, 20009 at [http://blog.alexwaterhousehayward.com/](http://blog.alexwaterhousehayward.com/). I have been using both facebook and Twitter as platforms to launch my daily blogs as links. Folks these days have eschewed RSS feeds and unless I post my blog link in facebook they think I am not writing. Many who spot my blog links to which I always accompany with a photograph might indicate that they like my photograph (I have been a magazine photographer in Vancouver, British Columbia since 1976) and yet I have noticed that very few understand that the link to something written is there with the picture. They look at the picture and move on.

This does not affect me one way or another. Early on I avoided the kooks by not allowing comments to my blogs. A blog, in the true sense of the word is a *bitácora* (the Spanish word for a ship’s log). I write my blog to please myself and to put my life in some sort of order. That my oldest daughter (44) says to me,* “Papi, now I don’t have to ask you questions of your life and of your life with us. It’s all there,”* that is an extra. On the other hand I have a friend (since we were in our early 20s, I am now 71, he lives in the US, I live in Canada) who refuses to speak to me on the phone or on Skype because he can read about me every day. That is no good.

I look forward to see if this Medium.com will be indeed a place where one can write and be read and where I will no longer see “nice pics”.

# How to Say No — Protecting Yourself for Fun and Profit

## How to Say No — Protecting Yourself for Fun and Profit

*This is secretly a post about saying yes. You’ll see.*

When I joined my first startup I interviewed with one of the board members, [George Zachary](https://twitter.com/georgezachary). I was trying to position myself as a manager that, while young, had a lot of potential.

So I asked George what growth would he predict for me as a young manager. Here’s roughly what he said:
> **Eventually the emotion of saying NO goes away**.
> People are going to ask you to do work that’s both impossible and unnecessary, ask you if they can work on personal projects, rewrite core systems for the hell of it, etc.
> You need to be able to say yes to what you think is right and no to everything else. But when you’re young it feels like a big deal anytime you say no.
> Young managers either drag their feet or give in, even when they know better. Look at me, I’m a VC. I’ve said yes 5 times and no 995 times. It got a lot easier to say no.

George has been completely right. The more time I’ve spent as a manager and then as a founder, the more I get asked for things, time, money, resources. And the less anxious I am about saying no.

Any time I feel myself delaying a decision for any emotional reason, I think back to George’s advice. Everyone has emotions, but at the end of the day you need to be able to make a rational decision.

Here are some ways to master turning people down.

## #1. Reserve time in your calendar.

I spend most of my day making things. So when someone wants to talk to me, I send them a scheduling link that has very few free spots.

What I’m saying no to, subtly, is the idea that I have time to talk to you today.

I used to lose my maker time to meetings and calls that were scheduled last minute. No more.

## #2. Have a canned response

If you run a startup, every other startup will email you asking if they should get on the phone. It makes no sense — none of these turn into real partnerships.

I used to respond with my requirements, something like “We’re looking for partnerships that achieve X & Y.”

That was supposed to be a way to filter out the bad requests. But still none of those panned out. So now I just say:
> “We’re in a heads down mode and aren’t doing partnerships.”

The best start to a canned response is always:
> “My policy is…”

That’s a classic, it’s not you, it’s me move. It helps to depersonalize your rejection.

## #3. Have a shit test

A friend was telling me how much she hates people asking to pick her brain.
> “The visual is gross and then they don’t do anything with what I tell them!”

A shit test is to give the other person something a hurdle to jump in order to judge seriousness.

The obvious shit test is money.
> “I would love to help you, but before I do, I need you to understand that I am a professional and this is my job. My hourly rate is $300.”

The other shit test is preparation.

Imagine a son of a friend of your aunt wants help getting a job in your industry.

Then you take the meeting and you ask them what sorts of jobs they’re looking for. They don’t know. You ask them what their passion is. They don’t know. You ask them what companies they respect. They don’t know.

They thought you could just tell them what their life path should be without any input from them.

Instead, always, always, always request preparation before giving advice.
> “I would love to help. Before we schedule a time to talk, could you send me X, Y and Z.”

If the materials they send over are sloppy, just tell them:
> “I’m so glad you sent these over because they help me see that I’m not a good fit to help you. Good luck!”

## #4. Repetition

Sometimes people don’t take no for an answer. They start hunting for some crack in your confidence by asking question after question.

My favorite example of this was a friend trying to quit their job. His boss kept coming back with theoretical counter offers, “What if we could…”

Those counter offers were increasingly ludicrous and ended with “What if I could get my investor to offer you their private plane for the honeymoon you and your wife never had?”

I find that these pushy people are looking for a signal that you’re not going to budge and the very best signal you can give is to repeat yourself.

Here’s how it works.

1. Have a talking point. In the above. “I’ve enjoyed my time here, but I’ve received an opportunity I can’t refuse.”

1. In media, you’re trained to bridge every question to a rehearsed talking point no matter what the question was. In the above, if the boss asked him to add “2+2,” my friend would have responded “Those are the sorts of questions that re-enforce that *I’ve enjoyed my time here, but I’ve received an opportunity I can’t refuse.*”

1. Stick to just one talking point. That’s the magic. People catch on quickly that you only have one answer and then back off.

People who’ve read this far probably fall into a category of people who consider preparation as a virtue. I’m in this category.

And, you may note that there’s a bit of disdain in many of the answers above. “If you aren’t going to prepare, then you’re not worth my time.”

Well… THAT’S TRUE!

This post is about you being intentional with your time. By saying no to all of these crazy requests you can say yes to something else.

No is the most powerful word in productivity.

Go ahead, ask me for something. I’m dying to tell you no.

# How to Deal with Road Rage

## Taken from this other article about Road Rage: https://www.theodysseyonline.com/10-people-that-cause-road-rage

Last night, I encountered my first real experience with road rage. I was making a left off a freeway in the far right lane (out of 3 lanes). When I finished making the left, I realized there were parked cars in my lane so I had to immediately move over into the center lane next to me.
> # BUT, I suddenly saw that I had accidentally cut off a car behind me when I merged so suddenly.

**NOTE: **I understand this whole series of events was caused by me and this is my analysis of my own mistakes in causing this situation.

## Mistake #1

The guy definitely took it the wrong way and subsequently tried to use his high-beams to blind me. I felt super bad, and was still recovering from nearly hitting a parked car. The cars ahead were moving pretty slow (or at least I thought), so I probably seemed pretty slow moving.

So the car behind me decided to change lanes, speed past me, and then swerve quickly into my lane!

To make matters worst, having past the parked car, I now decided to change lanes back into the very right lane and to try to avoid the oncoming anger of the guy ahead of me.

BUT, he decided to further merge into my lane (the far right lane) and slowed down just to make sure I got the message that I shouldn’t cut people off like that. (*at least that’s what I think he was trying to teach me!*)

## Mistake #2

I just wanted to NOT be in this person’s lane so I decided to change back to the center lane, but then this is when I knew he was really angry and targeting me specifically is when he moved back into the center lane just to block me again.

So I tried to get back into the very right lane, and subsequently back to the center, each time continuing to be blocked by him.

After a few more seconds of this, he decided to finally change to the far right lane and then make a right turn… and I continued straight in the center lane.

## Lessons Learned

1. This was maybe a 30 second exchange, but it has now stayed with me for the past 12 hours.

1. My pride got in the way, so I left not feeling bad, but feeling MAD that he had gotten the better of me.

1. **Mistake #1:** What I should have done at this point was to not change lanes so suddenly, but instead just turn on my signal, wait it out, and change when there were no more cars coming.

1. **Mistake #2:** At this point in time, I should not have provoked him further by trying to change out of his lane, but instead to just slow down further or just let him be in front of me.

## Takeaways
> # Don’t dwell on things like this for longer for 60 seconds, otherwise it starts to affect your mood.

1. Pause a moment, **let your anger go **& DON’T accept their anger.

1. Understand you’re both just trying to get to your destination.

1. Be the one to **back down** (*in order to diffuse the tension*)… & if they decide to gloat, think about the larger picture beyond this moment.

1. Be grateful for your health and well-being and (if you can) wish them good health and well-being too.

1. Whisper “**I’m sorry, please forgive me…**” to yourself because you don’t know their circumstances and they may have had a much worst day than you, so this may be their only victory of the day.

# How I fixed Tinder and found love —some  actionable online dating advice

## Some Actionable Online Dating Advice

![](1*OoWne-YMW2kEtQPQ6Z-BVw.jpeg)

![](1*w1pYrOfD8Ts_OwRR0OKSWA.jpeg)

![](1*3BCQ7pUVkVW5p5qJG2Boag.jpeg)

![](1*flmzcmMgkXapKSaMhnhOvQ.jpeg)

![](1*07vrpKHDVqbxi5-zEXzNeQ.jpeg)

Okay, time to get real. No one likes to talk about online dating. Especially not their own experiences, because let’s face it, most of them suck.

But today I will. Because contrary to common belief, good things can come from online dating, if you use it right that is. That’s why today I’ll show you how to **increase the quality of your Tinder matches tremendously — and thus increase your odds at finding love.**

**Note: **If you’re really lazy, just [watch the how to video where I show you how to implement this in less than 7 minutes.](http://niklasgoeke.com/fix-tinder/#download) I’ll even give you some ideas what to say, including cool designs.

This is for all the 23 year olds, who have gotten their shit together. If you’ve realized how tough it is to find somebody to spend your life with, and that you should start looking no later than today, then this is for you.

**Hint: **This is not for young horny idiots and “pick up artists”, looking for quick hookups. If that’s what you’re looking for, go look elsewhere. The strategy I’m suggesting will actually work against you.

Whether you want it to be true or not, online dating is happening. It is a $1.2 billion industry by now, and according to [this scientific research](http://www.statisticbrain.com/online-dating-statistics/), 17% of all marriages in 2013 were a result of online dating.

1 in 5 relationships these days has begun online. Online dating has come a long way from being “the weirdo way of meeting people”.

Yet, finding someone to spend the rest of your life with is tough. It is most likely the biggest challenge we face in our lives.

It was tough a 100 years ago, and it’s still tough today.

If anything, today it’s even harder. Why? Because 100 years ago you maybe had access to 100,000 people in total to choose from. Nowadays, with the internet, you have access to billions of people.

How the hell are you supposed to pick just one? The paradox of choice is real, folks.

The drawback of online dating is it makes us focus on the wrong things.

In case you don’t know what Tinder is, it is a smartphone app that shows you facebook profile pictures of people in your surrounding area. You can either like or dislike pictures. If you both like each other’s picture, you are a so-called “Match” and can then chat via the app.

Here’s what’s wrong with this app specifically: With so many profiles and pictures to look at, we of course swipe right (which means Yes) on all those pretty peoples’ pictures.

Then we extend into a long back and forth questioning with each match, only to find out they were not what we were looking for 1 month later and 3 dates in.

That’s what you get, if looks is your primary way of sorting out.

And while there’s tons of guides out there that help you [“fix your Tinder game”](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/devon-zdatny/tinder-dating-etiquette_b_4532811.html), none of them can fix the game itself. They don’t address the real problem, because they all just help you to put better pictures up.

But it doesn’t have to be this way.

As always, less is more.

The trick is to limit your choices by putting a quality filter on online dating.

Put another way: Would you rather go on a 100 normal dates, out of which 20 are decent, or on 10 great dates, 2 of which leave you completely amazed?

I can’t guarantee you the exact numbers, but I can promise you something magic will happen.

Today I’ll show you how to tweak your Tinder profile, so you get less crappy matches, and more high quality ones.

Before using this trick, I was tindering every now and then, but without much success.

Until one day in August, when I saw a video by [Tai Lopez](https://www.youtube.com/user/tailopezofficial).

It was one of the steps in his program, but the gist of it was this:

*Make yourself interesting. Stand out from the crowd.*

*You have to be special, if you want to attract someone special.*

It really clicked in my brain when I heard that.

What most people do on Tinder is show off their photoshopped facebook profile pics.

So I thought I’d run a little experiment.

Up until then, I had only gotten a few matches over the course of a few weeks, although I also didn’t Tinder for more than a few minutes every other day.

I then came up with these:

![](0*gv2AHsHzGi3TK8AN.png)

![](0*DWMXxGqJ-a8RuOMD.png)

I was sick of all the meaningless back and forth texting, I really wanted to meet someone. Use the app to find someone and do the rest the old-fashioned way (that’s in person by the way).

The result? Way more matches. Still not dozens, but 1–2 every day I would say.

I guess if you don’t look like Ryan Gosling in your pictures, it might be actually be better for guys (and girls!) not to show off their pics instantly. Creates a mystery. It’s intriguing.

**Warning**: If you had lots of matches before, you might get less with this, but that’s not a bad thing.

Because of the second thing that will happen as it happened to me:

The quality of my matches went up by a billion.

Not all of them ended up actually talking to me, especially when I mentioned coffee so soon, but the ones that did were all smart and worthwhile people.

They always had stories to tell or were doing something interesting.

A few weeks after having it set up this way I got a fateful match one afternoon.

We matched, SHE asked to get coffee instantly, we set up a date the next day, I drove for 30 minutes to meet her, and we hit it off.

To be more accurate, we not only hit it off, we completely hit it out of the park.

As of about 1 month after our first date, we’re in a relationship. We have been together for 4 months now.

**And I have never been happier in my entire life.**

I know how lucky I am, since not everyone can expect to find the perfect woman. Talk about a perfect match, haha.

But if you’re serious about finding someone great on Tinder, and if you’re ready to step out of your comfort zone a little, here’s how you can do your best to make that happen.

## Step 1: Pick your message

Take some time to do this. The more time you invest here, the higher the quality of people you will attract.

Think about what you’re really looking for in a person. Tell them what you want to do for your first date. Pick an activity you really like. Invite them to laser tag.

Ask them what their favorite book is. Mention yours.

Also: make them work for it!

Make a multiple choice and tell them to only swipe to the next pic, if they pick certain answers.

Give them a challenge.

They have to earn the right to see your pic. Make it tough! Don’t be afraid of cutting out potential matches.

Have your message? Good.

**Hint: **If you can’t figure this out, cheat a little! Download my 5 ideas for intriguing and exciting message ideas [at the end of this post.](http://niklasgoeke.com/fix-tinder/#download)

## Step 2: Create your design

Go to [recite.com](http://recite.com). This also works on your phone, but you can also use the [InstaQuote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instaquote-add-text-captions/id551012097?mt=8) app (exists for iPhone and Android).

Enter your message and pic a cool design, such as this:

![](0*mf7_FAbUfnS8BWhJ.jpg)

Hit create, then download image.

![](0*sUus-ohJHg9D7Kyr.jpg)

**Hint: **If you’re on an iPhone, just hold down your finger on the pic and then “Save Image”.

## Step 3: Upload to facebook

This is a little tricky, since you’re not using your actual profile pics, but I’ll show you how to get the photos into Tinder and then hide them on facebook.

Go to your profile, photos and then create an album.

![](0*bd7sbwxuoevAIyNg.jpg)

Upload the quote photo. In my case I’ll also add a photo of a fortune I once got out of a fortune cookie. Plus, of course, a pic of me.

**Hint: **You should always include one pic of yourself, in order to not look like a creep. Make it a good shot of your face, and wear a big smile!

![](0*jziJFZAlxcltaWpC.jpg)

In order to first get the pics into Tinder, you also have to make sure the publicity settings are set to public.

![](0*nnRifcBQSwyGeFyg.jpg)

We’ll change this later, so no one can see the pics on facebook, in case you don’t want them to show up there.

Give your album a neutral name, like “Quotes”, and hit publish.

## Step 4: Update Tinder

Now you need to set up your pics in Tinder, and in the right order.

Open the app, go to your profile, and hit edit.

![](0*jYTXYJ4nbJBzjUUz.png)

Then, add the photos from your new album and place them accordingly. The first one goes into the big space on the left, the second one in the top right box, the third into the box beneath it.

![](0*2cC9Lp5n1DsHJCmn.png)

Hit done, and you’re all set!

Boom, enjoy watching the quality of your Tinder matches soar to new heights.

All you have to do now is go back to the photo album in facebook, click edit, and set the privacy settings to “Only me”.

## Good luck out there

I sincerely hope this works for you as well as it did for me.

I know it gets tough out there in the jungle of dating life.

But if you’re honest and persistent, you will attract the right people by asking for the right things.

Remember: **Every step outside of your comfort zone is a step towards happiness.**

Mistakes at the gym are bound to happen. They’re part of the learning curve. I *still* make changes to my workouts and diet plans after 15+ years of training. The beauty of making mistakes is that if you learn from them, they make you better.

The five entries below are meant to shed some light on common mistakes women make at the gym, and how you can avoid them to improve your overall health, strength, and performance.

## **1. Way Too Much Cardio**

You should avoid steady state cardio and focus more on high intensity interval training (HIIT). Increase your workout intensity, but lower your duration.Try something new (kickboxing, circuit training, sprints, or intervals on different machines) and continue to switch things up to keep your body guessing. HIIT improves your hormonal state and your body’s ability to burn fat and build lean muscle.

## **2. Avoiding Weight Training**

You will NOT get “bulky” and lose your curves. You can throw this fear and misconception out the window. Weight training is extremely beneficial for your bone health and overall long-term health. Lean muscle improves your body composition and metabolism better than cardio.

## **3. Crunches**

We all want flat abs but doing endless crunches is not going to get you there. Your abs are made in the kitchen with a great diet. Eat real, whole foods and avoid the processed junk and you will be well on your way to the stomach you want.

## **4. Carb Loading**

Lower to moderate carb intake is the most effective way to get lean. Athletic performance is different than weight loss and training for body composition. If you are competing in marathons and triathlons you may need to eat a few extra carbs before your 2–8 hour workouts but if your primary purpose is to get a lean fit body, then stop eating carbs before your workout.

## **5. Unrealistic Expectations**

Give yourself a break! Your body will not change overnight and you need to be patient. Changing your body and your eating habits takes consistent effort over time and you must have a plan and stick to it. Stop your obsession with the scale and instead notice how you feel, how your body looks in the mirror, how your clothes fit, and how you perform in life on a daily basis.

## What’s the takeaway?

Don’t fall for outdated myths about women’s fitness. Remember: strong women are beautiful women. If you want to lose weight, gain confidence, and get strong, educate yourself. Strength and knowledge are empowering. And they’re damn good for your results.

# How to Prepare or Master being a Digital Coach

## 

**This article is for you if:**

&gt;&gt; You are trying to figure out if you can work as a coach, but don’t want to commit to opening a new business right away

&gt;&gt; You have been working as a coach already, but want to see if digital coaching is something you can learn and use to get more clients

&gt;&gt; You have no clue what to do for your life right now, love encouraging people, have done well in achieving new habits/goals, and are open to coach people for free until you get paid for it (hey, you have to begin somewhere. I have coached 8 people for free and now carry a caseload of 8 clients most months. But coaching is not my only source of income at the moment)

**What is Digital Coaching?**

For the purpose of this article, Digital coaching refers to coaching that happens between 2 people with written communication. I know some people also include the category of phone coaching as digital coaching, but for the purpose of this article, I will focus on chat coaching. We can also refer to this as coaching done through writing:

**Benefits of Digital Coaching: (main ones are listed here, for more info, visit [HERE](https://www.coach.me/apply?ref=zJA35))**

* You can do so at any time, which means you can coach people who are on different timezones. And are able to coach people while you take a break or finish your other responsibilities or get off from your current job. All you need is access to the internet on a smartphone and/or a computer (you can log on both smartphone or computer/laptop).

* If you want to sign up to become a coach at [**COACH.ME](https://www.coach.me/apply?ref=zJA35)**, they will give you 1 month to receive free chat coaching with an expert coach (you can choose me by going: [**HERE](http://bit.ly/coach_liliana)**). There is a membership yearly fee to pay, but it’s worth it.

* Once you become a member with *coach.me*, you will receive training material to study for a certification, a network group where you can get support as a coach, and a list of requirements such as coaching your first 4 clients.

* You could coach people as secondary source of income when you start, and then if you get more clients it can one day become your main source of income.

**A Bit of a Challenge** (Go to the Tips section below where these will be addressed):

* You will have to learn (by doing) how to read emotions by words written, and by asking detailed questions (The training provided by COACH.ME will help).

* It’s easier to work on one goal at a time when doing written communication. This can be a challenge to some clients who want to do a lot of things at the same time.

## **Introduction to digital coaching training and membership with the app COACH.ME:**

Want to go big? then go Digital! Here is the training video that Tony Stubblebine, Founder and CEO of Coach.me created:


## **Tips to help you with future clients and retention:**

(Yes, there are ways you can currently prepare for your future clients, trust me)

1. **Be mentally prepared for feelings of rejection**: Feelings of rejection may happen when clients finish coaching with you after a few interactions. This may not apply to all of you, especially if you are a tough cookie who is used to having people coming and leaving in both your professional and personal life. This may happen more often to new coaches and coaches who help clients in a short-term goal or a habit. Habit formation takes about 21 to 30 days. By the end of the month, you will see your client wanting to work on another habit, or wanting to cancel coaching with you, if it has been successful. Sometimes, this happens without notice. So the way to get used to it now, is by seeing digital coaching as a fast track form of coaching. The perfect fit for the microwave kind of society we live in. We want all to happen now, and fast. Another way to deal with possible feelings of rejection is to look back at times when you were rejected in the past, or when people whom you helped had to go. Did you get over it? Of course! So then, you will be okay when clients who receive digital coaching from you cancel services. It’s part of life. There will still be some clients who will stick with you for many months, those who love working with you on all the areas of their lives.

1. **Develop the habit of writing in a concise and clear manner:** This can be done by using shorter sentences and bullet points with symbols (*, -, <, >, ==, |, [x], o, #, ~~). If you decide to be a digital coach, you will have to excel in writing as your form of communication. (Even if some of your clients will hire you to receive phone coaching, some of the communication will still be done in writing).

1. **Start or continue networking often with the digital world**: Some of the platforms to consider are the ones that offer groups or a community of forums where people post discussions, questions, answers, and share tips. Some of the ones you can start with joining groups: Facebook, Linkedin, etc.

1. **You can go to coach.me and start being involved with the community**: work on tracking your own goals, giving props to people, asking questions in the goals you join, and answer questions to encourage someone. *When you have a challenging goal or habit to work on, try to just work on that as priority, don’t worry too much about the other ones.*

1. **Learn to ask detailed questions**: Once you start digital coaching your first clients, you will have to practice asking detailed questions, and follow-up questions. Since digital coaching doesn’t have access to face to face cues, you will have to read between the lines, or ask the right questions. You will learn this in the training at COACH.ME. And you can also practice the skill of asking the right questions with friends, loved ones and family.

1. **Research what is available in the marketplace**. You can do this by becoming aware of who is considered an expert in your niche (or niches). Learn about what they offer by reading their books, visiting their social media platforms, reading magazines about your niche. Also, you are to figure out if there is something unique you can solve in your niche, that hasn’t been offered. The uniqueness can be in your approach, the value your bring, the amount of information the client would have access through you, style, language, your price, your location, etc.

1. **Work on avoiding the comparison trap. **From past experience, my best advice is to stay thankful. Learn to appreciate that there are people who have gone before you, who have worked super hard to learn everything they could to be where they are today. So, don’t compare yourself. You will have to network with other coaches, you will also get support from them, but at the same time, it’s important to value others while blessing others with your input. Your input and encouragement is also important, so don’t hide your areas of expertise.

1. **Start/Continue writing blog posts about your coaching specialties**. This is how many prospective clients will get to know you. In addition, by having a blogging schedule, you are improving the practice of communicating through writing.

1. **Once you write some blog posts, post the ones that get most viewed **on your *Facebook* business page. If you don’t have that yet, make sure you start one and make sure to put on your business page your name. If you have written something else as your Facebook business name, it’s better if your Facebook business page has your name, that way people will find you easier. As a coach, is best to market who you are and your lifestyle, rather than the name of your business. If you can do so, try to put yourself as *public figure.*

1. Whenever you feel ready, go ahead and sign up to become a coach on [**https://www.coach.me/apply](https://www.coach.me/apply?ref=zJA35)** don’t forget the code in the above video for your discount! If you have any questions (especially those related to certification and billing), go ahead and send them here: [**http://support.coach.me](http://support.coach.me)**

# 4 Sleep Hacks to Dominate Your Morning

## 

I do my best work in the morning. In addition, starting the day off with a healthy and productive morning carries over into the rest of my day — increasing my energy and focus throughout. That’s why I’ve worked for over three years to find a morning routine that works for me and make it a [habit](https://medium.com/zero-infinity/26-simple-things-i-do-everyday-to-be-more-happy-healthy-productive-and-successful-20218a1465ff#.9m4t2q8k9).

However, on the nights that I do not get a sufficient duration, *or quality*, of sleep, my morning routine is basically useless.

### I’ve had almost every sleep problem you can image.

* Not being able to fall asleep

* Waking up in the middle of the night

* Not being able to get out of bed in the morning

### And I’ve tried almost everything to solve it.

* Eating before bed

* Not eating before bed

* Maintaining a consistent schedule

* Setting my alarm clock to play funky jams

* Journaling before bed

* Over the counter medications

* *…many more!*

Most solutions were almost completely useless. Some actually hurt my sleep or had negative side effects.

However I did find four strategies that have become staples of my night. With the four hacks I share below, I’ve increased the quantity and quality of my sleep. Each morning I’ve maintained a routine that’s helped me write 2–3 blog posts per week, maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen, and stay focused and energized throughout the day.

Here are four ways to ensure you wake up early feeling motivated every morning (no doctor visits, prescription drugs, or expensive equipment required!)*:*

## 1. Wear a sleep mask to block the light.

![](1*aW_M2DwFJci23M100BOD-Q.jpeg)

Even with the lights turned off, almost every room will have some light from outside street lights, moonlight, or lights from neighboring rooms. It may not seem like it would be enough to harm your sleep, however it may mean the difference between hopping out of bed rejuvenated and hitting the snooze button over and over again. According to [National Sleep Foundation](https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/lights-out-good-nights-sleep),
> # “A key factor in regulating sleep and your biological clocks is exposure to light or to darkness so falling asleep with lights on may not be the best thing for a good night’s sleep.”

A great sleep mask solves just this problem.

I got my sleep mask, a Komossa, [on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2aQjvbf). The Kamossa Sleep Mask has molded cups so that you can open your eyes freely while maintaining complete darkness.

I find a sleep mask especially effective when I wake up earlier than planned and the sun would otherwise be glowing in my window. I sense my eyes opening, but as the light never shows, I fade back to sleep.

If your bedroom is anything less than pitch black, which it probably is, give a sleep mask a try. You’ll question how you ever slept in a room with more light before!

## 2. Wear earplugs to block the sound.

![](1*NPU5xHqhtshYrKSCGy3m2Q.png)

In addition to light, another common reason for not being able to fall asleep or stay asleep is sound. If you’ve ever been kept awake by an air conditioner, a noisy neighbor or roommate, or your partner snoring, your know what I’m talking about.

A set of ear plugs is enough to prevent sounds that might otherwise prevent you from achieving a consistently deep sleep.

I use simple foam ear plugs. You can buy them on Amazon or at your local CVS, Walgreens or Duane Reed.

Wearing ear plugs along with a sleep mask creates a feeling of being disconnected from the outside that I find euphoric. It puts me right to sleep.

## 3. Use [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com/) to wake up at the right time.

![](1*9s3cCsVbstROs-tc94D4XQ.png)

![](1*qOGh4o5bUs4XCDdHzOnDIA.png)

When you sleep, you cycle between [REM and Non-REM](http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/sleep-101) sleep. REM is a deeper sleep. It’s usually when dreams occur. When you wake up during deeper sleep, it feels disorienting, and makes it harder to actually get out of bed.

The Sleep Cycle alarm clock tracks your sleep patterns and wakes you up during light sleep. It uses sound analysis to identify sleep states by tracking your movements in bed.

Waking up during light sleep feels like waking up naturally rested without an alarm clock. It makes it much easier to hop out be bed.

Here’s how you use Sleep Cycle:

* Select the 30 minute window you’d like to wake up.

* Leave your phone within a few feet of your bed.

* The alarm will go off when your phone picks up sound of you moving.

* View charts showing your sleep quality and quantity each night.

Here are the key benefits:

* Maximize the amount of deep sleep you get.

* Wake up at the time that will make it easiest for you to actually get out of bed.

* Track and analyze your sleep so that you can improve it over time.

## 4. Schedule something fun in the morning.

![](1*wjtD2e_iAnSbOlkiMD15Ag.png)

![](1*QiFEYi8POY6gbqHo3gLevA.jpeg)

![](1*VlyLY6dHSijrdK8O2n1Puw.jpeg)

Have you ever experienced the feeling of having your alarm go off, but not feeling inspired to get out of bed? I know I have and if you’ve read this far it’s likely that you have too.

The biggest influence on this occurrence for me is this: When I know the first thing I’ll be doing in the morning is something I don’t want to be doing, such as some grunt work, I’m far less motivated to get out of bed. However, when I know I’ll be doing something I love doing after I get out of bed, I am far more motivated.

Here’s how my morning starts now:

* Drink Bulletproof Coffee (coffee with grass-fed butter and MCT oil)

* Read

* Write

The caffeine in the [Bulletproof Coffee](https://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/) obviously gives the mind and body a burst of energy. More interestingly, the butter and MCT oil provides healthy fats and helps sustain the energy from the coffee, without the crash.

After some stretching and deep breathing, and once the coffee starts to kick in, I move on to reading. Usually a personal development or philosophy book — something inspiring or thought provoking. Then, I [start writing](https://medium.com/@mfishbein/how-to-optimize-your-morning-routine-for-writing-56873247116#.yxz3exenl).

I start by journaling. I simply write whatever is on my mind. It’s a stream of consciousness without any concern for quality. I end each entry by stating something I’m grateful for and writing an affirmation.

Then, I [write something that I intend to publish](http://mfishbein.com/steps-to-writing-a-book/). This is usually my most focused and productive time of my entire today. I get the vast majority of my best writing done at this time.

Writing has helped me:

* [Get my brain started](http://mfishbein.com/fuel-the-brain/) in the morning and increase my creativity.

* De-stress by getting my thoughts out of my head.

* Increase my confidence and happiness levels by writing a [gratitude list](http://mfishbein.com/gratitude-list/) and affirmations.

* Build a [following](https://medium.com/startup-grind/4-growth-tips-i-learned-getting-5-689-views-on-medium-this-month-c931d1c701e9#.4gjimhhgv) and make money.

### Become a morning person

There are a million and one things you can do to hack your sleep. And everyone is different. So I do recommend you try the various suggestions that have been made by the pros and measure the results on yourself. These four hacks have been the most impactful for me.

Here are 4 bonus hacks that have also helped me:

* Take a magnesium supplement about an hour before bed.

* Reduce the quantity of water you drink at night and stop drinking it a few hours before bed so that you don’t wake up to go to the bathroom.

* Keep your bedroom at a low temperature.

* Drink a tall glass of water first thing after waking up.

I hope this is a good starting point for becoming a “morning person” and building a powerful morning routine!

## Two lives intertwined

A meeting of the mind

Game plans set, but

Fate dealt a new bet

Impossible is nothing?

The truth, this was something

A stroke of gold,

A reality untold

Impossible is not nothing

if we risk nothing

Love undefined, redefined

Your heart, held in mine

# The happiness-work chart

## The happiness-work chart

### Measure and improve your happiness at work

You may not be exactly happy at work. You’re missing something and you don’t know what it is. You can be doing tons of money and love what you do, but meh.

Some time ago one teacher told me how to track your happiness in your daily job. It’s as easy as just drawing 3 bars in a chart and figure out why we work. I instantly loved them.

## #1 The “Money” bar

We work for money. Everybody knows this. No hidden tricks or extra thinking about it.

We like money. Or even if you don’t like it, we need it. If you earn enough money to fulfill your needs, your work-happiness chart will look like this:

![Money bar](1*t3WYHdoX1grRWXavXdIoUw.png)*Money bar*

## #2 The “Like” bar

Most of the time we are good at the things we love. Or at least we try to do our very best. Things we love keep us motivated.

We may put all of our energy. You’ll go home thinking about how to solve a problem. You’d look distracted to others. Feeling tired. But in the end, you’ll feel pretty well about it, because you love it.

If you’re lucky to work with things you love, this bar will be high.

![Like bar](1*6BAZrDsdyrZLjj1UmjKUUA.png)*Like bar*

## #3 The “Impact” bar

We got money and love for what we do. But what about the consequences about your job? What’s the impact in others life? Think about your co-workers, your friends, your company, the world.

If you’re building a house, think about how happy you can make a family. If you’re working in a top-secret project in your company, think about the later impact it would have when it sees the light. Solving the next big problem with your startup? Think what’s in for your users and not for you. For real.

This is the strangest one but it may be the most important thing we work for. It may not be obvious, but if everything it’s in its right place, you shouldn’t have problems to picture what’s the outcome of your job for the rest of the world.

![Happiness-work chart](1*W6uUdpEK7br-AZ_jWGpNvw.png)*Happiness-work chart*

## Happiness-work chart in real life

Picture yourself as a painter. You love to paint, you love your drawings and you get paid a lot of money every week. Obviously, *“Money”* and *“Like”* bars will be full. But here’s the trick.

You’re employer comes at the end of every week and burns all of your drawings and throws them at the sea. How would you feel?

![All your drawings at the bottom of the sea](1*g4IwldPYll_zpr32dU9RFw.png)*All your drawings at the bottom of the sea*

You’re a musician and you play on the streets for a living. You’re just like Sonny and Annie from the lovely Treme and you’re not in any regular line-up. You love music, you love playing, you even love the person you’re with, but it’s not near perfect.

You won’t have all the audience you deserve. Some days will be harder than others. It will rain and you’ll barely get a few bucks.

![](1*O4Pvt0-4eKfwsMXDZlgPzQ.png)

Next time, find your audience, with a regular line-up and the stability that you need. Drive yourself to what you love, with a view.

# How do we Measure a Year?

## As we begin to close up shop on another year, we collectively take a chance to reflect on everything we have been through in the last trip around the sun. We have had 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days, 8,760 hours, 525,600 minutes, or 31,536,000 seconds. We’ve been through another series of divorces and weddings, deaths and births, illnesses and recoveries, failures and successes, losses and celebrations, birthdays, anniversaries, a lot of holidays, and way too many food-related things.

### A year is all of these things. And none of them.

Many of us have heard the saying that our lives can change in the blink of an eye. We get about [9,198,000](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-do-we-blink-so-frequently-172334883/?no-ist) of those in a year. That is a lot of opportunities for change.

How many of those opportunites do we take advantage of? There isn’t a number, but it is far too few. We get so caught up in what we are already doing, that we struggle to stop and think about where we might like to go. We go from small crisis to small crisis, with the occassional big one thrown in for good measure. We obsess over details that mostly only we ourselves care about. Every moment has the potential to be the last one for any of us in this life, and we waste so many of them on trivial things.

There are 7 billion of us on this planet, and no two are the same. We each have a different history, different skills, different ideas. Every one of us has a unique perspective on the world, and we spend too much time not sharing our gifts.

### Are you doing something that you don’t love with your life?

## STOP DOING IT.

Stop killing your mind, heart, and soul bit by tiny bit. Give your gifts. Figure out what makes you come alive. Do that. It will be terrifying and exhilerating. You will have no clue what you are doing at first. If you keep doing it, eventually you will turn into a pro.

We may not be able to drop everything and head somewhere different all at once, but it is really easy to course correct a bit at a time until we are headed in the right direction. Life is like riding a bicycle. Every moment we have to make small shifts to stay upright, and it is way easier if we keep going forward.

There is a management goal setting technique called [SMART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria), which breaks down to:

Specific

Measurable

Achievable

Relevant

Time Bound.

We won’t go into too much detail here, but we should note the time bound criteria. Time bound means there is a timeframe for completion. In business, this helps keep all parts of the project working together, but our personal lives work differently. For us, time bound should also mean when we decide to stop trying.

Sometimes we really think we want to achieve an outcome, but we never get our act together. That’s okay. Maybe we lack the [motivation](https://medium.com/@Knowliberation/where-does-motivation-come-from-aea9d1f0b174), which we can work to get in touch with. Maybe we lack the skills, which we can learn. Sometimes we try to get motivated, and no matter how hard we try, we just can’t get into it. We always struggle at one time or another with some projects, and we just try to power through the tough spots. It happens. Sometimes, life is just being a bit difficult and we can’t find a way to carve out the time, or money, to do it right now.

But if we feel a lot of negativity, and very little love, working towards our goals, it is absolutely okay to stop trying. If working towards our goal hurts more than it helps, we can give it up. Always thought you wanted to learn to play guitar, but have never been able to make the time to buy one, let alone practice, and always feel guilty and keep making excuses every day for the last 6 months? Cross it off the list. Permission granted. A weight will be lifted. You can add it again later if you want.

I had a boss once who had one of the most amazing questions to ask during times of transition:

## What will you leave behind?

We don’t have to carry things forward just because that’s what we’ve always done. Every moment is a chance to make a choice. Make the best one you can. Start something. Or stop something. Just keep pedaling.

# These 3 Hacks Will Make You Remember More

## These 3 Hacks Will Make You Remember More

German college is brutal. Here’s how it works:

You show up the first day, then the professor dumps 800 slides and a ton of materials on you. After that, class attendance isn’t mandatory, so naturally, you don’t go. At the end of the semester, you have to take one big ass exam that makes up 100% of your grade.

**last night pre-exam cramming deluxe here we go**

If you’re like me, then whenever there’s something you just have to do, you’ll try to do it with as little work as you can. Over the course of 10 semesters, I managed to put together a decent system with a good effort-reward ratio.

Today, I want to show you 3 parts of that system. They’re my 3 favorite memory hacks and will help you remember what you read and study a lot better.

## **Memory Hack #1: Chunking**

1117200112241999 is tough to remember.

But two consecutive dates aren’t: 11/17/2001 and 12/24/1999. Especially if you put them into context: a friend’s birthday and Christmas 1999. Chunk up large pieces of information into smaller bits and put them into context and they’ll be much easier to recall.

**The way you do this is by coding the data.** For example in a scientific paper, which are usually massive walls of text, you could draw lines separating important paragraphs and mark those with numbers.

For long sentences you want to remember, you can single out and chain together a few keywords. Or make an acronym. Which brings me to the second hack.

## **Memory Hack #2: Acronyms**

I LOVE acronyms. They’re so much easier to remember than what they stand for. And faster too. When I say VIP you probably have an image of someone important in your mind way before decoding it to “very important person.” You might not do that at all, because the image itself is enough.

So let’s say you wanted to remember [a focus hack I talked about before](https://medium.com/personal-growth/do-just-this-one-thing-to-improve-your-productivity-today-1565602fe764): Keep your phone out of sight.

**If you take just the first letter of each word and line them up you get KYPOOS. **What you could make of that is KY POOS. Now you can imagine KY is a dog, for example and that he, well, POOS. 💩

Ky poos. Maybe he poos in the garden, maybe he poos on the street. But now you know Ky and that he poos and you’ve already memorized the acronym.

### **Bonus:**

If you create a word that even remotely sounds like it could make sense, google it. For example if we drop one of the O’s from above we get KYPOS.

A quick Google search tells me it’s some beach or island in Greece and there’s several restaurants with the same name:

![](1*izhuDaH9wsIFfHjDBsp8rQ.png)

Not that you’d have any problems keeping your phone out of sight at the beach, but you have to admit: pretty easy to remember.

## **Memory Hack #3: One-Page Summaries**

Here’s the summary I made for the first exam I took in my Master’s, strategic management in SMEs:

![](1*QL3H98spD2YRXA2P84hWEA.png)

Yup, that’s it. I did write a more comprehensive one before, but in the end, I condensed it all into this one, single page.

As you can see I combined everything using the other two hacks: chunking and acronyms. In the end, all I had to do was memorize this ONE tree structure based on all the chapters and I could recall any of the concepts via its acronym at will.

**Whenever you have to remember a large, comprehensive amount of information, condense it until you manage to somehow capture it on one page.**

It doesn’t have to be visual, although that can help. You could just as well write one fluent text, make a list of bullet points or draw a mind map.

# Do Nothing, Have Nothing, Be Nothing — Part 1

## 

**You’re being targeted and used.**

Used by your culture as a tool for the fulfillment of its own misguided agenda.

You know that feeling? That listless, edgy, [splinter-in-your-mind](http://youtu.be/O4zICmyuNvs) feeling?

That feeling of a background, pervasive hum of discontent each day, but we’re not sure why.

We’ve got no reason to be dissatisfied. We’ve got a good place to sleep, lots of food, enough income to pay expenses, a good group of friends and family.

So, why do we still feel unhappy?

**It has everything to do with the toxic agenda that every culture attempts to force on us.**

### Here’s society’s little checklist for you:

* Be successful (work in an “important” job or business and earn lots of money)

* Be attractive and charismatic (and have an equally attractive partner)

* Be someone important (get famous, get awards, get continual recognition)

* Be extremely busy, be a “go-getter”

* Have lots of money, be a consumer, show off your amazing possessions

**We could sum up society’s agenda as:** Do Something, Have Something, Be Someone

How are you doing with those demands, so far? Are you measuring up? Shouldn’t be too hard, right?

# The Stress of Dealing with a “To-do” List You Didn’t Ask For

Now, the above checklist is definitely not complete. There are a ***lot*** of other demands and expectations that your culture is shoving in your face every day.

Can you see how society’s invisible agenda creates stress, unhappiness, poor health, disconnection, competitiveness and constant, gnawing pressure?

You’re never good enough. Never smart enough. Never “special” enough. **You *need* to prove yourself** (to who, exactly?).

And even when you “succeed” at meeting these highly-pressurized goals, you’ve got new stresses:

Are people using you because you’re well-connected and wealthy? You’ve got an amazing house, your dream car, cash in the bank, but you still feel bored, lonely, and unhappy.

Many wealthy and successful people experience this. They got what they want but they still feel empty. It wasn’t enough. Maybe they just need more money, more recognition, more entertainment. Surely that would fix everything, right?

## Freedom from Agendas

Imagine that you had a simple job that you didn’t mind and it covered your modest living expenses. Your life would be considered simple, basic and unglamorous. You would enjoy your free time immensely doing simple things but you don’t have any big accomplishments (except for maybe close, rewarding friendships).

**You’ve become deeply content, free from society’s constant, infantile badgering.**

I like that. It’s got a nice ring to it.

Could you be happy with minimal possessions, a modest income, no recognition and without much activity (or “doing”)?

If you can do this, then you’re already rich, successful and powerful. At least, internally.

Let’s take a look at the three core modalities we experience as humans: **doing, having and being.** I’ll also cover solutions for living outside of society’s whiny, incessant demands so that we can feel more confident, content, healthy and grounded.

# Do Nothing

There is a lot of busyness in life. And a lot of unneeded action and unneeded communication. We are a hyperactive, attention-deficit society.

*Why is all this action not needed?* Because a lot of our actions are based on ego and desire. And the more ego and desire someone has, the more unhealthy and unstable they will feel.

Our activity is often done as **a distraction from our own emotional pain or discomfort of being alone with our thoughts.**

**A typical day for many of us:** Wake up at 6am for 7am yoga class, zoom around in traffic to drop the kids off at 9am for school, followed by 7–8 hours at a frantic job (doing a gym workout on your lunch “break”). Oh, don’t forget your music class tonight that you need to squeeze in between dropping your kids off at swim lessons, and dammit, you’re also meeting a friend for coffee…you’ll fit that in there somewhere.

Meanwhile, throughout the day, you’re busy in communication, reading and sending texts, emails, and phone calls. Dealing with problems, making decisions (and dealing with [decision fatigue](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/decision-fatigue_b_4044212.html)).

**And it repeats like this, almost every day.** Full. Of. Constant. Activity.

## Life as a Hamster? No Thanks.

Some people do truly enjoy being busy **and** they are also happy, healthy and pleasant to be around. But I’ve observed that most people feel and act stressed out when they’re constantly rushing around all the time. Never resting, never having time alone or time to reflect (and make changes).

Being busy and constantly doing things doesn’t automatically mean that you’re living life to its fullest, it doesn’t make you wiser, doesn’t improve your sense of well-being.

A hamster running in its tiny little wheel is busy too.

## How to Do Nothing

“Do nothing” means you feel content without needing anything special to happen. You don’t need to be entertaining yourself constantly (YouTube, movies, TV, socializing). You are relaxing into this moment, temporarily goal-less and not needing anything to be different.

“Do Nothing” for me is a state of non-desire. It could be resting on my bed for a few minutes while allowing my mind to be still, going for a casual walk with no destination, enjoying a mountain or sea view for a moment.

I’m not suggesting that you never do anything. Obviously, we need to take action each day. It is also important to have goals (and [reaching our goals](http://holdingyourfeettothefire.com/year-review-goals/) is the main focus of this site). **The question is:**

**Are your actions energizing you?** or are they draining your energy and stressing you out? Are you focused? or is your mind scattered?

To “do nothing”, we experience simple, mundane, common activities richly. We are no longer “being productive”, no longer chasing.

If you worked on a farm for a few weeks, and your only task during the day was to water the donkey, could you be completely ok with that completely minimal schedule? Could you feel content doing a simple, unglamorous task like this?

No to-do’s. Just take care of that ass. I mean, donkey.

## In Non-doing, There is Freedom

We can still enjoy our activities, we can still have busy days occasionally.

Take time to reflect on whether constantly “doing” things is something you really enjoy or not. It may feel like you don’t have a choice… you’ve got work responsibilities, family and social obligations, daily chores, the list goes on…plus, you want to feel like you’ve got a life, so you’re busy taking classes, doing sports, going to entertainment events.

**If you want to feel happier and free, **you need to live outside of society’s expectations, demands and unwritten rules that only serve to bind you.

You *do* have a choice and obligations aren’t as obligatory as you might think.

This might mean not attending “obligatory” social events that you really don’t enjoy or get any benefit from. It could mean that you’re less available to reply to personal emails, texts and phone calls. Or maybe you live in a modest house and walk or bike everywhere.

If you’re like most of us, you could probably benefit from reducing your “busyness”, taking time to still your mind, taking time to be alone for periods of time.

**Try doing *less* so that you can enjoy what you’re doing *even more.***

# 5 Misconceptions About Sobriety

## Having been an online sobriety coach for over two years now (and sober for three and a half), I’ve heard a lot of misconceptions about sobriety. Here are the top five I’ve come across, and what the reality is.

**1.Everything will be full of sunshine and rainbows after the first few weeks of sobriety.**

![A view most of us would like to have.](1*MNzDVscfTSAhm4nvqdxmww.jpeg)*A view most of us would like to have.*

While the first few weeks of sobriety can be challenging, you’re unfortunately not in the clear once you get through them. It is 100% true that the days, weeks, and months to follow can be more manageable once you make it past the first few weeks (and, let’s face it, they *aren’t* possible unless you make it past the first few weeks), but that doesn’t mean things are going to be smooth sailing from there on out. It’s that sort of thinking that lands a lot of people in trouble. They build up a type of confidence that makes them cocky — they think they’re invincible and that their drinking problem is a thing of the past. While it’s awesome to be confident with your sobriety, I constantly remind my coaching clients that they need to be **comfortable** in their sobriety in order for it to really stick.

What’s the difference?

![“My eyes are brown” — pretty easy, natural thing to say (if your eyes are brown).](1*f2e9AVR_i5mH0eyJY6B2qQ.jpeg)*“My eyes are brown” — pretty easy, natural thing to say (if your eyes are brown).*

Being comfortable in your sobriety means you identify with being sober, not simply feeling like you’ve got this sober thing down. If someone offers you a beer, your response of “No thanks, I don’t drink” will come as naturally as telling someone what color your eyes are — your sobriety becomes part of your identity.

When you only have confidence to lean on, you’re setting yourself up to play cat and mouse. One little whisper from a voice inside your head (no, you’re not crazy, we all have internal dialogues) will tell you, “Hey, you’ve been sober for a few weeks now. *Clearly* this drinking thing wasn’t as big of a problem as you thought it was. How about you go out, have a round with your friends at a bar, then call it a night. I mean, you obviously have control over your drinking, otherwise you wouldn’t have made it this far!” And you’ll believe it.

That voice is wrong. Oh so wrong. A few weeks of sobriety does not mean “you obviously have control over your drinking.” That’s not to say you *don’t* have control over your sobriety, but what’s a better way of exercising that control than to continue abstaining from drinking? Testing your limits isn’t showing off how in control you are — it’s a slippery slope that can end up with you back at day one, kicking yourself repeatedly.

When being confident teams up with being comfortable, I call that hitting your stride. This is when your mind stops generating a false sense of confidence to make up for your insecurities, when you aren’t as anxious or anxiety-stricken about how you’ll get through the day sober, when you don’t salivate at the thought of an alcoholic beverage, and so on.

I can’t tell you when you’ll hit your stride — for some people it can be around a month or two, for others it can be closer to a year. But what I *can* tell you is that you’ll know for sure when you hit it…and it’s going to feel amazing.

So while you won’t necessarily be basking in sunshine and rainbows after the first few weeks, stick with your sobriety. You won’t regret it.
> # If someone offers you a beer, your response of “No thanks, I don’t drink” will come as naturally as telling someone what color your eyes are — your sobriety becomes part of your identity.

**2. You can’t have fun sober.**

![It’s possible to have fun sober. Trust me.](1*s7s-JcpJ0y_WBOQ4fZ2ZHQ.jpeg)*It’s possible to have fun sober. Trust me.*

This one tends to perplex me. Sure, drinking can be fun, but have you been drinking alcohol since the day you were born? I hope not. Have you had fun before ever having a sip of alcohol in your life? I hope so. That right there proves you *can* have fun sober. You just need to try.

When I “came out” about my sobriety to friends and colleagues, I was once asked, “So if you don’t drink anymore…what do you *do*?” They were referring to what on earth I could possibly be doing with my time if I wasn’t spending it at a bar or a friend’s house getting drunk.

Gee, I don’t know, literally ANYTHING else.

![](1*RZr4d_OmkTaZBGghicJYIg.jpeg)

True, I don’t go to nightclubs as often as I used to, but that’s because I now know that being drunk helped me have fun at them. I thought they were fun until I went to a few of them sober and I realized, “OH! So *this *is why I’d always get wasted at these things.”

They are not very fun to me. I know people who are sober and go to nightclubs, so I’m not saying they’re intolerable if you’re sober, this is just my personal experience.

![I’ve been able to watch the sunrise — after a full night’s sleep!](1*5rKJHnxTlFCc5Ic-wzqJTw.jpeg)*I’ve been able to watch the sunrise — after a full night’s sleep!*

What fun could I possibly be having now that I wasn’t getting wrecked in my spare time? Well, there were lots of options considering you have a LOT of spare time when you stop drinking. For each day I was sober, I didn’t spend six to eight hours drinking, nor did I spend three to six hours babying a hangover the next day. That added up to getting nine to fourteen hours of my life back.

## **Fourteen hours? That’s a huge amount of time!**

And with that time came a lot of thinking about not drinking…which was stressful, which made me want to drink more, which made my anxiety spike. I knew I had to fill that time with *something* and figured out (through trial and error) that doing productive things was the way to go — things I felt some sense of accomplishment from, made me feel rewarded, allowed me to relax, or made me feel good. *Not* things that simply kept me busy.

Other than getting into mindfulness (which was the number one way I was able to get and stay sober), I used my free time to clean around the house (not what I necessarily consider fun, but definitely rewarding; my apartment has never been as clean as it was when I first got sober), explore new hobbies I always wanted to try or used to enjoy but stopped because I didn’t have the time, read a lot more books, dove into the realm of self-care and started to give a damn about how I treat myself, learned new things about anything and everything, and simply took some time to relax.
> # I wasn’t spending six to eight hours drinking, and subsequently wasn’t spending three to six hours babying a hangover the next day. That easily added up to getting nine to fourteen hours of my life back.

3. **People will automatically think you had a huge drinking problem since you’re now sober, or you must have hit rock bottom.**

![We all have tough days. But it doesn’t take the worst day of our lives for us to decide to quit drinking.](1*IVva4y9_Z9KugVzXOOCMvQ.jpeg)*We all have tough days. But it doesn’t take the worst day of our lives for us to decide to quit drinking.*

While there definitely are some folks out there who will think this right away, most people won’t. Either they’ll accept that you don’t drink, or they’ll inquire about why (usually in a curious rather than challenging way — unless they’re jerks).

You know the story behind why you’ve decided to quit drinking. It doesn’t matter if you were a clinically diagnosed alcoholic, someone who drank once a week but could never stop at just one drink, or if you drank a glass of wine every night but didn’t want to anymore. The point is that you felt that alcohol was no longer serving you, it was a problem, so you made a change and cut it out of your life.

A problem is a problem and needs to be treated as such. Problems are also very relative — what I consider to be a problem might be a walk in the park for someone else, and vice-versa. Even if no one would say you had a drinking problem, if you thought your drinking was problematic compared to how you want to lead your life, that’s all the justification you need for your decision.

You actually don’t have to justify your decision to get sober to anyone. If it’s what you want to do, it’s what you want to do. Who are they to question something that’s an improvement to your well-being? While they may not understand it, that’s fine. It’s not their choice that they need to understand and accept. It’s yours. It’d be nice if close friends, family, and significant others could understand it, but that’s not always the case.

When someone asks you why you don’t drink anymore, I’ve found it’s best to have an elevator pitch of sorts ready to use so you’re not caught off guard. Something that doesn’t go into your personal issues (if you have any) but gets the point across. I have a couple, depending on the situation. My light-hearted one when people ask if I’m sober because I don’t like alcohol is, “I actually love beer, that’s why I can’t drink it anymore!” Which is honest, gets a laugh, and answers their question so we can move on.
> # A problem is a problem and needs to be treated as such.

4. **If you can’t get the hang of sobriety the first few times you try, you never will.**

![I bet you couldn’t tie your shoes the first time you tried it, now you’re a pro (or wear slip-ons, that’s okay, too).](1*bbZLWCrOf3IxaA-LXjwGcQ.jpeg)*I bet you couldn’t tie your shoes the first time you tried it, now you’re a pro (or wear slip-ons, that’s okay, too).*

This misconception breaks my heart whenever I hear it. It’s easy to feel like you’re not cut out for sobriety when you go back to “day one” repeatedly, but you can’t allow that to define the rest of your life. Seize the opportunity to learn from your slips and to grow from them. If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll keep getting what you’re getting (as the saying goes).

Getting sober is a process, a process where there isn’t one clear cut way through to the other side. Everyone has arrived at the point of no longer wanting to drink at different times in their lives, after different events, and from different trains of thought. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to sobriety. That means there’s a lot of trial and error involved to find what works for you.

For some people, they can adapt quickly to what works for them and what doesn’t, carve out a plan of action they’re able to stick to, and go from there. For others, they’ll create a solid plan but can’t follow through on it. Another group of people will wake up each morning wishing they could use their willpower to overcome their drinking problem, becoming frustrated and confused when they can’t.

![Step by step, no matter how many times you fall down.](1*6SMFkjLgBSyvCcH0B3B-ug.jpeg)*Step by step, no matter how many times you fall down.*

There are many other situations I haven’t mentioned. That’s because there are simply too many to list. The point is, if we didn’t get the hang of something the first few times we tried doing it and then gave up, none of us would know how to walk or use the toilet. Think of how many tries it takes before a baby learns how to walk. They fall down repeatedly and, yes, they become upset and frustrated but eventually they ***do*** get the hang of it. Soon, they’re running around the house and you can hardly keep up with them. Same deal with sobriety. Fall down, stand up, rinse, repeat until your feet are planted firmly where you want them to be.
> # Seize the opportunity to learn from your slips and grow from them. If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll keep getting what you’re getting.

5. **You’ll never be able to be around alcohol again in your life because it’s just too risky and tempting.**

![Don’t worry, you can still go out with friends or coworkers for a round of drinks once you’re comfortable with your sobriety. Just make sure your drink is a virgin one.](1*xARVmttPYWGKdbTUZiPgaQ.jpeg)*Don’t worry, you can still go out with friends or coworkers for a round of drinks once you’re comfortable with your sobriety. Just make sure your drink is a virgin one.*

Not true whatsoever. While I don’t suggest throwing yourself to the wolves and never giving yourself a break from being around alcohol (if you can help it), there will come a time when you can be in the same room as it, sitting next to people drinking it, and you won’t be fazed by it.

This ties into what I said above about hitting your stride. Once you’re comfortable with your sobriety and it’s a plain stated fact that you don’t drink, that sets up an invisible barrier between you and alcohol. You don’t drink. No if’s, and’s, or but’s about it. It’s not that you’re *trying *not to drink, it’s not that you’re *experimenting* with sobriety, it’s that you don’t drink. End of story. No wiggle room in that statement.

This doesn’t happen right away, and you can’t set a date or time as to when it’ll happen. What I’ve found works really well for many people (but not all; remember, there’s more than one way to get sober) is laying low for the first month or so and not putting yourself in situations where you’ll be around alcohol. After that, you can test the waters a little bit. Think of it as exposure therapy, where someone has a phobia of something and is incrementally exposed to it until the phobia is manageable or disappears. You don’t have to have a phobia of drinking, but gradually taper your exposure to being around alcohol while not drinking. It’s very different to be sober on your own, keeping to yourself, and being sober in a context where almost everyone else is drinking.

A great way to reintroduce yourself to situations where there’s alcohol is the buddy system. By the time you’ve had a few weeks of sobriety behind you, you may find it easier to open up to others about your decision to get sober. You don’t have to sing it from the rooftops (unless you want to, of course), but it’s nice to find someone you can confide in who can go to various events or get-togethers with you, acting as a layer of support when alcohol enters the scene. Maybe have a code word for when you’re starting to get anxious or feel like you’re going to slip. You could ask them to intercept any drinks you get handed (or try to order) and give you a pep talk to help you through it. They can act as a buffer if anyone asks why you’re not drinking and you don’t have a comfortable answer just yet (topic changing can be your saving grace). However, remember that you’re the only one who decides whether or not you’ll drink — your buddy isn’t the gatekeeper of your sobriety.

![There will come a day where you can sit at a table like this and not care about what’s in people’s glasses.](1*f_8NWXwsEdJf3lM3bDKW4A.jpeg)*There will come a day where you can sit at a table like this and not care about what’s in people’s glasses.*

You won’t always need someone by your side if you’re in a place where alcohol is being served. Sometimes having someone on your side who knows what you’re up against and is only a text or phone call away is enough. The more comfortable you become with telling others about your sobriety, the more you’ll find yourself in social settings where everyone knows you’re sober, so you won’t need to put so much stress on yourself to come up with ways to avoid peer pressure. Your real friends will respect your decision to better yourself and won’t try to push you to break that commitment.

# How to Win People Over With Babies, Lovers, Earth, and Dogs

## What I learned about the science of preciousness, first in the movie business and then on Facebook

![Photos from my facebook account, reflecting what our bodies deem precious](1*r61e8Njo19QVACgLqYiSJA.png)*Photos from my facebook account, reflecting what our bodies deem precious*

As a Hollywood studio chief, most notably at Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Studios, I have dealt with the study of the human heart most of my adult life. In part, the fate of the studios rested on that understanding. If our movies could not find their way into people’s hearts, we did not make money, and we couldn’t continue to produce movies.

On average, we tested a motion picture 10 times in order to maximize audience satisfaction before it was locked into its final form. Based on audience reaction, we changed endings, added new sequences, and swapped music. The ending was seminal. A strong finish pushed positive word-of-mouth and kept our movies in the theaters.

## The Finish

The endings that always scored the highest were (1) weddings and (2) births. They signified the productive continuance of the species—life, love, and a future*.* If we had a movie that wasn’t working and we were beyond desperate, we’d photograph and cut a marriage or the birth of a child into the last few minutes of footage and watch the word-of-mouth scores jump.

![](1*D2OdSYn-Q7TBrPrE41Wwzw.png)

For example, while at Walt Disney Studios, we made a buddy-cop comedy with Tom Hanks and [Beasley](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1212798/), one of the ugliest dogs ever photographed. The movie, *Turner & Hooch*, played well until the last few minutes.

The picture tested miserably because in the last reel, Hooch died. The word-of-mouth scores were terrible, which meant no second weekend and a flop on our hands. So we added a love interest for Hooch and reshot a new ending in which Tom playfully engages with the second-ugliest dog in the world, Hooch Jr.

![](1*9pASuyFCprwcfjnqR8FtyA.png)

Of course, the audience was sad over Hooch’s death, but it was also buoyed by the hopefulness of a new pup who could keep the comedy wheel of life spinning. The picture went on to gross $70 million at the domestic box office, which was a good number in 1989.

On a broader level, all of us can be overwhelmed by the news. We each experience that inner sense of apocalyptic species-doom. We know the threats associated with climate change and artificial intelligence. Yet after thousands of screenings, decades of research, and hundreds of walks down those unnerving red carpets, I know one thing with certainty:
> # Audiences are rooting for the continuation of life.

A few years ago, I left the grind of the LA movie business and moved to a farm in the country outside of Boston. It turns out that you can’t quite take the city out of the migrated country mouse. Even in the solitude, my mind still ticks to the data associated with the beating of the human heart.

As someone who has worked and managed commercial art and artists for four decades, my interests rest solidly in the intersection of art and science — or, put another way, story and data. When I relocated to the farm and opened up a Facebook account, I started to take photos of my quiet new world—of horses and dogs and children and ponds and soil and family and friends.

It appears that our bodies are hard-wired to favorably respond to certain forms of life: babies, lovers, nature, and pups.

## The River that Runs Through Us

Always curious, I was moved to understand what, beyond just the weddings and births, people in the online landscape find precious.

I discovered four photo subjects that moved the meter for people: **my dog**, **newborns**, **nature**, and **people in affectionate circumstances**. They are represented in the pictures accompanying this story.

![Photo by [Jon Flobrant](https://unsplash.com/photos/rB7-LCa_diU?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*ieXpaOGSITBMCa5xFWTuww.png)*Photo by [Jon Flobrant](https://unsplash.com/photos/rB7-LCa_diU?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

I did not realize it at the time, but that warm and fuzzy feeling that ran through me before I posted a photo was a biochemical reaction to what I was seeing. In turn, those who viewed the photo responded with the same synchronicity of feeling I experienced when I added it to my Facebook wall. We were in the same river.

We all laugh and roll our eyes at Facebook and Instagram. For many of us, it’s not life; it’s the way we want life to be. But there is always truth in patterning. The trick is to be able to pull it out.

*Braiding Sweetgrass:* *Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge and the Teachings of Plants, [*a book ](https://www.amazon.com/Braiding-Sweetgrass-Indigenous-Scientific-Knowledge-ebook/dp/B00D0V44LC)by professor of botany Robin Wall Kimmerer, opened my eyes to why all my big-city friends were positively responding to my photos of nature.

It turns out that we are biochemically attached to the scent of soil.

### The fragrance of earth

The folklore we all hear about “getting back to the basics” seems to have some scientific truth. Most of us have gotten it into our heads that earth is a *thing. *It’s not.

According to the US Department of Agriculture:
> Healthy soil is living and is a complex ecosystem with an abundance of bio-diversity. Land, then, is not merely soil; it is a fountain of energy flowing through a circuit of soils, plants, and animals.

Indeed, the actual fragrance of healthy soil (i.e., one that isn’t poisoned by ammonia, etc), according to Kimmerer’s research, has a physiological effect on humans. That warm and fuzzy feeling that gardeners experience and walkers of nature know is brought on by the release of oxytocin, also known colloquially as the “love hormone,” into the bloodstream.

![](1*38XC4A8uDQGRqA2cU8TT4A.png)

We can look a little differently at kids playing in the mud or looking for bugs in the grass. They are experiencing pleasure just by having their noses close to fresh humus.

Oxytocin is produced by the hypothalamus and occurs naturally in the body. It can act as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter, affecting many regions of the body and brain. A wide range of recent studies have highlighted its potential to promote empathy, trust, and social bonding.

Remarkably, oxytocin also suppresses the amygdala, which processes fear, helping to generate an immediate feeling of intimacy and confidence. This hormone and neurotransmitter is released to both parties during lovemaking as well as in the act of breastfeeding. Notably, both of these acts are at the very top of the to-do list after weddings and births.

Perhaps it isn’t surprising, then, that my photos of nature also seemed to resonate among my Facebook friends, tapping into deep feelings of longing.

That brings me to another fascinating source of a natural oxytocin release: dogs.

### Dogs

Everywhere I go with my corgi, Arthur, people ask to pet him. That’s not so easy, as Arthur is low to the ground. Nonetheless, people kneel and stretch to get to him. I am always amazed at the joy it brings to them—particularly when they look into his eyes.

![Arthur at a harvest festival](1*8D-j61TqHGo5Z6bjLDPaHA.png)*Arthur at a harvest festival*

Current research provides some intriguing science behind what we already know is true: dogs and humans share a special bond.

[When humans merely look into their dog’s eyes](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6232/333), that eye contact releases a flood of oxytocin. [Other studies](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/news/life-science/smiling-human-faces-are-attractive-to-dogs-thanks-to-oxytocin) show that for dogs, oxytocin is released when a human *smiles *at them. These triggers might be a window into what scientists now describe as the [co-evolution](https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/accumulating-glitches/how_dogs_and_humans_grew) between humans and dogs.

Few people realize that dogs are a relatively new addition to our planet. The most recent archaeological findings pinpoint the appearance of the first dog as only 30,000 years ago. All dogs come from the genomes of the [grey wolf](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/2/163). Early evolutionary theorists, including Darwin, believed that jackals, hyenas, and foxes had something to do with the evolution of dogs, but they were wrong.

As best we can surmise, our hunter-gatherer ancestors brought orphaned wolf cubs into their camps and began to raise them. In smaller and calmer homes, these wolf-cubs began to develop what Charles Darwin called *sports*,* *small genetic mutations that reflected their new living conditions. These mutations made them smaller, leaner, and often less furry. Eventually new breeds emerged.

The history of the dog reveals a very big theme. The hunter-gatherers feared the wolf. But, in the co-evolution of the dog,
> # We transformed what we feared into life that we loved

[Tests on wolves](http://. http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6232/333) have shown that these animals’ brains release no oxytocin in response to either the gaze or the smile of a human. The developing theory is that the interspecies oxytocin loop between dogs and humans developed over time. It took time for humans to breed, train, and discipline dogs to become useful companions — herding, pointing, and retrieving.

The science bears out my experience: it feels good to look at a dog. It seems that it’s pleasurable for the dog too. And those feel-good moments seem to happen when I, or others, see my Facebook posts as well.

### Babies

We have all experienced joy when being close to a newborn. Humans experience some level of chemical attachment to an infant just by [being near its fragrance](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00597/full).

![My nephew Auggie and his new sister, Marigold](1*rZ3R0GaVp7LfxwZDCN6yIw.png)*My nephew Auggie and his new sister, Marigold*

When infants are born, they are already familiar with the smell of their mother’s amniotic fluid. This odor imprint helps newborns find their mother’s nipple, which has a similar but slightly different odor than the fluid. The mutual production of oxytocin aids in the survival of both mother and child.

New studies from Emory University indicate that paternal bonding also occurs. “Our findings add to the evidence that fathers, and not just mothers, undergo hormonal changes that are likely to facilitate increased empathy and motivation to care for their children,” [says James Rilling](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/02/esc_dad_toddler_bonding/campus.html), an anthropologist with Emory University and director of the Laboratory for Darwinian Neuroscience.

But you don’t have to be a baby’s parent to feel heightened senses of care and bonding when you smell a baby’s aroma. [We are wired to be drawn to babies visually too](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17683225). The science of cuteness has even been applied to product development, using “baby schema”—the physical features of babies such as large faces, round heads, and big eyes—to [create attention-grabbing products](https://ppcms.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/usermounts/lederh7/2011/MieslerLederHerrmann2011.pdf).

### Cupid’s Arrow

February is the month of love. Valentine’s Day settles in the absolute middle of it. There’s nothing like that feeling of romantic love, when [oxytocin is joined by a whole cocktail of ingredients, including estrogen, testosterone](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/loves-evolver/201302/the-science-behind-falling-in-love), and the wings of imagination.

![Sue and Jim in Boston on a Sunday morning](1*hubyBi6AaNAW_LOALlA6LQ.png)*Sue and Jim in Boston on a Sunday morning*

It seems, however, that Cupid’s arrow is tinged with more than love’s first blush: it also bears oxytocin.

This hormone can even help wounded lovers make a fresh start. Remember that oxytocin suppresses the amygdala, which processes fear. When we are afraid to start over and can’t seem to get rid of our old baggage, oxytocin helps wipe the psychic slate clean, allowing Eros to once again scrawl poetry across your chalkboard.

Photos can help us recall, and perhaps even relive, that delicious feeling of being in love ourselves. Like any audience, even on Facebook we are rooting for the continuation of life.

Hopefully, you’ve realized by now that this article really isn’t about how to get attention on Facebook … though you could use it for that.

The more important insight I’m offering here is that recognizing what attracts our attention can help us realign our own lives. That doesn’t necessarily mean you need to sign up for Tinder or adopt a baby or a dog. The simple nearness of these extraordinary life forces can have a profound impact on your sense of well-being.

How you access those forces may vary. It might be by reaching out to a friend or family member who has a newborn in their lives or someone who needs your affection, even if it isn’t romantic. Or by leaving behind the colossal corridors of 5th Avenue and entering the natural valley of Central Park.

These natural sources of oxytocin can open up the window for a renewed sense of trust and new associations. They can even make us willing to join new communities. Developing studies at [Duke University](https://today.duke.edu/2016/09/oxytocin-enhances-spirituality-new-study-says) found that oxytocin made study participants more apt to agree with the statement “We are all connected.”

Perhaps we all need to bend our knees and pet a dog . . . or open our arms to the embrace of a newborn. Perhaps there is a new truth at that intersection of data and story, of science and poetry, of photos and Facebook: what is precious is essential.

Happy Valentine’s Day!

# This is the #1 Way to Become Who You Want to Be

## This is the 1 Way to Become Who You Want to Be

Imagine sitting down at a table in a small room with seven other people.

You’re all about to participate in a psychology experiment concerning people’s visual judgments.

The experimenter places two cards in front of you. The card on the left contains one vertical line. The card to the right has three lines of varying length.

The whole group is now asked, one at a time, to choose which of the three lines on the right card that matches the length of the left card. This task is repeated several times with different cards.

Everything is going smoothly. But then, all of a sudden, the entire group unanimously choose what is clearly the wrong line before it’s your turn.

The experimenter turns to you. What would you say?

### The Science of Conformity

As is often the case with psychology experiments, the experimenter has played a little trick on you.

In reality, you’re the only participant. All the other people at the table are actors who have been carefully instructed to give the wrong answer simultaneously to some of the cards.

It’s not your visual judgment, but your level of conformity to the rest of the group that’s being tested.

This clever study design is one of the most famous ones in psychology and was initially conducted by Salomon Asch (1). And the results he got were remarkable.

On average, about 33 percent of the participants who were placed in this situation conformed to the clearly incorrect majority. Over 12 attempts, about 75 percent conformed at least once (!).

In the control group, where there was no pressure to conform, less than 1 percent of participants gave the wrong answer.

### How We Adapt to the People Around Us

Human beings are social creatures. Our need for belonging is very strong. Apparently, so much so that we prefer giving an answer that is clearly wrong as long as it makes us feel part of the group.

This tendency to adapt to the people around us has some serious practical implications for our lives. One study, for example, showed that if your friend becomes obese, your risk of obesity increases with 57 percent (2).

Social scientists are well aware of how much we affect each other. They know that humans have a strong tendency to adopt the same goals (3) and even the same feelings (4) as the people around them.

In other words, it’s been well documented that:

* If you hang out with people who are pessimistic and lazy, you’re likely to feel as negative and perform as poorly as they do.

* If you surround yourself with enthusiastic and hard-working people, those are the feelings and attitudes you’ll adopt instead.

### The People Around You Determine What’s Normal

A couple of months ago, I was regularly writing 1,000 words per day. I felt like I was stretching myself and considered dropping back to 500 words per day. Then [my accountability coach Nik](http://niklasgoeke.com/) told me that he was writing SEVERAL thousand words every day for his [4 Minute Books](http://fourminutebooks.com/) site (which is awesome, by the way).

Suddenly, my 1,000 words a day goal didn’t feel like such a stretch anymore. And instead of lowering it, I found ways to increase it. By just telling me about his goals, Nik had successfully raised the bar for what was normal for me. If I didn’t have him in my corner, I would’ve lowered my goal instead.

And this kind of influence affects us all the time in every area of our lives. If the people around us have high standards, we’ll naturally adjust our own to match theirs. Unfortunately, if they have very low standards, that’s the way we’ll tend to gravitate instead.

### How to Become Who You Want to Be

And this is why it’s so important to have the right people in your corner. If you want to realize all your potential, you need to surround yourself with individuals who are already at the level you want to be at (or who are at least enthusiastically pursuing the same goals as you are). Here are some ideas:

* **Start a mastermind group.** Put together a group of 3–5 people with similar goals. Meet up in person or online for an hour once a week to give each other feedback and encouragement.

* **Get an accountability partner.** Team up with one person and talk regularly about a specific goal you’re both pursuing.

* **Read great blogs.** No matter what you’re trying to get better at, chances are there is plenty of blogs on the topic. Collect your favorite writers in a [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) account and let their goals and attitudes rub off on you every day.

* **Go to meetups.** Find or start a meetup group on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/).

* **Get a coach.** If you’re up for it, [I’d love to work with you](http://www.selfication.com/coaching/)! 😉

### Sum Up

* People have a strong tendency to conform to each other.

* Your social circles have a huge effect on all areas of your life.

* The people around you determine what’s normal for you.

* To become who you want to be, you need to surround yourself with the people who make it possible.

* You can do this by, for example, starting a mastermind group, getting an accountability partner, reading the material of people you look up to, going to meetups, or getting a coach.
> *“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”*
> *— Jim Rohn*

Who are your five people? Are you happy being the average of this group? Or is it time to start looking for some new influences?

# Martyr Syndrome and Starving to Work

## I didn’t have time to eat.
I’m so busy I forget to eat.
There’s too much to do. Sigh…you are such a martyr.

As a business traveler, we have all been in the situation where you think you will have time to grab something from the airport in between connections but your first flight was delayed and now you are running to catch the next one. Or, you arrive to the hotel thinking they will have a restaurant but it’s closed and the pantry consists of Advil, toothpaste, Diet Coke and a sugary granola bar. Who I’m talking about in this post are the people who go all day without eating and wear it like some kind of badge to tell people how they are so busy they can’t possibly eat.

I worked in an industry where I would see this all the time. The person would show up around 8am and work all day until around 5pm without stopping to eat lunch or even to eat lunch while they are working. If someone was with them, they may actually try to make them feel guilty for wanting to get something to eat and act ‘proudly’ about how they just work through lunch. Truthfully, I often ate lunch while I was working or I ran out to get something and brought it back to eat but I never went all day long without fueling my brain and body.

That’s what you are doing folks…you are fueling your brain and body. Whether your work is tedious or physical, you still need to eat something. I was with a woman once who had oatmeal for breakfast (about 150 calories) and about 4 ounces of OJ (about 50 calories). She did not eat anything else until 4:15pm. How ‘present’ do you think her brain was by 2pm? Some would argue that if they are sitting all day they don’t need to eat but that’s not true either. I would argue that anything is better than nothing. This poor woman said that she sometimes feels dizzy at the end of the day and ends up hitting the drive thru for a bacon double-cheeseburger at first chance.

## Starving traveler = poor food choices

I have had two friends on two separate road trips that were stuck for 3+ hours on the interstate with nowhere to walk to. I keep 100 calorie bags of almonds in my car for just this reason. They are my emergency nuts I squirrel away!

I trained and managed people new to business travel at my previous position. They probably thought I was the member of some kind of Crazy Food Cult because I would emphasize and re-emphasize that they need to take care of themselves and fuel their brain and body while on the road. First, you may not know where your next meal will come from (stuck on an airport tarmac for two hours?) and second, this lifestyle is hard and if you expect to come out on the positive side of this race, you have to take care of yourself.

# The best communicators always have a good exit strategy

## The best communicators always have a good exit strategy

### Communication Hacks: Part 2

In [part one](https://medium.com/@clavien/the-simple-truth-about-how-to-be-likeable-is-listening-3138f3953d31#.ext7nwbm7) we addressed the art of [deeply listening,](https://medium.com/@clavien/the-simple-truth-about-how-to-be-likeable-is-listening-3138f3953d31#.ext7nwbm7) which holds surprising power. Armed with this power, you also might have realized you need to know how to control it— in particular how to perform a **smooth** **conversation exit **in maybe a social or [networking](https://betterhumans.coach.me/networking-deconstructed-be-awesome-not-awkward-part-1-f0facaa9ad0c#.xc3tzog3d) situation**. (**Preferably smoother than “I’m going to the restroom.” 😉)

## The time I realized I needed an exit strategy…

I was at a friend’s dinner party a few years ago. The guests were arriving and mingling with a glass of wine. I found myself introduced and chatting to a friend of the host Alex (name changed). Alex was articulate and attractive. I was happy to chat to him when he approached me. I’d set a New Year’s resolution earlier in the year to focus on being a better listener, and here was another chance to practice listening deeply!

However, this experience of listening to Alex made it quite apparent there was a complementary skill required. You see, Alex proceeded to completely talk my ear off for a good fifteen minutes. Then he cornered me again later to continue his talking and my listening. It went on, and on. I could have written Alex’s the biography after that. **I had no skill at all to extricate myself. I had no conversational exit strategy.**

![](1*jMQfwU-sk146vzQrnO79fg.png)

Margaret Millar said
> Most conversations are simply monologues delivered in the presence of witnesses.

I don’t entirely agree with this, but it can be true on occasion!

At the farewell at the end of the night Alex raved, “it has just been so great to connect with you! I feel like we totally clicked. We must catch up soon.”

I did not “connect” with Alex. I did not “click” with Alex. And I wasn’t so keen to catch up soon.

### **How does this misalignment occur? What went wrong?**

It’s easy to just blame Alex, but there are two sides here, and I needed to take some responsibility. I lacked awareness about how listening is a seriously powerful weapon, to be used carefully, and lacked the ability to make an assertive exit — I needed a conversational exit strategy.

### Exit gracefully every time

Whatever the reason you wish to end a conversation, the art of the smooth exit is important. You can learn how to extricate yourself easily. Here’s a deconstruction of the approach I developed to save me in future situations.

## The Smooth Exit Strategy Deconstructed

## 3 Steps — Setup, Validate, Go!

### 1. Setup

Start with body language. People will often pick up on cues related to exiting consciously or subconsciously. These cues might be changing the angle of your body and feet towards where you are going. Or maybe grabbing your bag or drink or any items you will be taking with you. Some people will notice the smallest of cues, and others you will be physically walking away and they still might not appear to notice.

### 2. Validate

It’s great to verbally validate the person and the interaction too. Ideally, wait until they pause (although sometimes you might have to interrupt. I think we all know interrupting is bad, but sometime impossible to avoid).

Tell them something you appreciated about them and/or the interaction. In the worst case a generic “nice to meet you” firmly delivered, but ideally validate on something interesting about the person or the conversation — “great talking to you about x”.

(Some people find this disingenuous, however without being to kumbaya I would argue it’s a really excellent opportunity to practice focusing on positive things. It’s not just the other person that will benefit from your positive comments — but the deliberate practice of gratitude — appreciating something positive, [is known to increase your own happiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=gratitude).)

### 3. Go!

You don’t have to give a reason for exiting the conversation. Really! Just do your setup, validate and go. That said, I’ve found over and over people often telling me they feel uncomfortable to just go without coming up with some fabricated reason. I don’t really advocate telling everyone you need to “go to the restroom.” (By all means, use it if you must), but just remember you are well within your rights to exit a conversation without a faked visit to the restroom! You can just say smile and say “bye!”

## Practice

Give it a try. I’m still working on improving my exit skills, like all communication skills, they are a work in progress!

This three step** setup-validate-go **model is a good hack to help you remember how to make the smooth exit. Exiting is an often overlooked skill. **Having smooth exiting skills means you can enter conversations and listen deeply without fear, backed by the confidence that you can exit smoothly whenever you want.**

# The Habit Ladder&#58; How To Make A New Routine Stick

## When one good habit triggers another, the speed of success doubles.

I can hardly remember what my mornings look like these days. It’s taken years and much trial and error, but I have a routine now that needs no thought to be completed. Each action, all morning long, is pre-scripted, memorized, and controlled by habit.

I wake up and put my running clothes on. A 5-mile run leads to a shower, breakfast, and then my most important task of the day.

The same thing happens, like clockwork, every… single… day.

What I — and many others, perhaps yourself — have constructed is what I like to call a *habit ladder — a*n automatic process that quickly ushers you from a heap of barely-awakeness to a productive human being.

A morning routine is just one example of a habit ladder, though. The same concept can be applied across every aspect of your life to make the important actions you want to take quick and painless. And the trick isn’t so much in *what* you do, but the *order* you do them in.

### The Loop: How A Habit Works

Why do you bite your fingernails without thinking? Get distracted? Eat poorly? Likewise, why do you exercise without the slightest protest? Get your hardest work done first? Floss your teeth every day?

The answer is you’ve built a habit — an automatic action that, once created, you no longer have to think about. It’s your brain’s way of offloading all the work required to get through the day.

And a lot of smart researchers — particularly a group from MIT — have figured out how your brain builds a habit. They call it the *habit loop *[1], and it works like this:

![Image courtesy of Charles Duhigg](0*oGrBDwQI8BCSoQHp.jpg)*Image courtesy of Charles Duhigg*

Take flossing, for example. It’s a habit I recently picked up after being scolded by my dentist for the 25th time.

At the beginning of every habit is a *cue. *This is the thing that tells your brain, “Okay, it’s time to start this habit loop.” For me, the cue that it’s time to floss is when I’ve finished brushing my teeth.

Once your brain spots a cue, you go into zombie mode; you’re driven by your *routine* rather than conscious thought. I go directly from brushing my teeth to rolling a waxed string around my fingers without a pause.

And every habit ends with a *reward* — the reason you’re driven by the cue and routine in the first place. For me, it’s the release of tension knowing my dentist won’t frown as much the next time I see her.

Charles Duhigg explains the ins and outs of the habit loop in detail in his bestselling book, [The Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055PGUYU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0055PGUYU&linkCode=as2&tag=advancriskol-20&linkId=ZUSYNAZFNB5PICT2).

Understanding this will help you identify and alter your existing habits, but there’s another tool you can use to help you create new ones faster.

### Habit Ladder: Stacking Your Habits For Better Results

You know cementing a new habit is hard, but you probably have a few that came naturally. Take a hard look at those easy habits and ask yourself, “What was it that made them so easy to pick up?”

When I look at my own — particularly my morning routine — it’s glaringly obvious. Each habit came easily because the beginning of one is triggered by the end of another.

1. When I wake up, that’s a cue to put on clothes.

1. I choose to put on my running clothes rather than work clothes, and that’s my cue to go outside and start running.

1. When I finish running, I’m sweaty, which cues my shower and, by the time I’m out of the shower, I’m ravenous for breakfast which is my cue to eat.

1. Since I’ve just exercised, my body wants a healthy meal rather than garbage breakfast foods, so I eat a clean meal.

1. Finally, the energy boost from breakfast and endorphins from running give me exactly what I need to tackle my hardest work first thing in the morning.

![](0*Tfv22R0T10IyOOXg.jpg)

This is called a habit ladder because, from the time I wake up to finishing my first work task of the day, I’m leveling up one rung at a time. Each new step is reached because of the last.

Notice from my example, it’s not always the reward from one habit loop that triggers the next. Sometimes it’s a tangential result. The reward from running isn’t “doing better work.” It’s a feeling of accomplishment for my health. But the runner’s high I get as a tangential result boosts me through those few hours of early morning work.

The habit ladder doesn’t just apply to a morning routine, or even just one day. I also use it in my writing tasks where each one I complete to finish an article spurs me on to the next. You could also use it to set yourself up early in the week for actions you know you’ll want to take later but will be worn out if you don’t [put the triggers in place now](http://riskology.co/time-bomb-method/).

If you’re working to cement new habits but having a hard time, it could have less to do with the habits themselves and more to do with how they’re arranged. Try looking at each from a perspective of the habit loop — cue, routine, reward — and find opportunities to rearrange them so the reward — or tangential result — from one helps to create the cue for the next.

That’s how success becomes automatic all day long.

# The Benefits of Working in a Totally Different Field

## The Benefits of Working in a Totally Different Field

### I dare you to try it…

Some people question me why I want to work in different fields? and I just reply, “I just want to do something different. I want to be challenged and bring unique ideas to the table.”

One of my professors told me that most of the people he met in grad school were doing something totally different from what they went to school for. Why? well, it might be for a couple reasons. One is that some of grad students have had a hard time finding a job within their field of study which may force them to apply for other jobs. The second one is that some people want to face the challenge of applying their knowledge to other fields.

Don’t think you’re losing your time by applying for different jobs and here are the benefits:

**1. Stay Creative. **Working in a different field will challenge you to think all the time how to carry out projects your way while still meeting a criteria.

**2. Make unique connections. **You’re always looking how to relate your background/experience with what you’re doing at work. Therefore, you might find opportunities that have been overlooked or not tried before.

**3. Deliver unique outcomes. **Different processes of thinking and different perspectives in problem solving scenarios is the key to delivering creative ideas. You might see what other may not and vice versa. It’s a learning experience for everybody when you have people of different fields in one team.

I’m eager to bring unique outcomes to the table in different fields like fashion, architecture, interior design and accessory design… from the point of view of an industrial designer. Even if it’s freelancing, I want to share my point of view.
> Don’t let your diploma title set the limits. You can go as far as your passion allows you to go. You set the limits. Keep growing and stay creative!

# The Assassination of a Soul

## The Assassination of a Soul

### The first time I saw someone killed I was 25 feet away.

I was in my early twenties and the two things I remember most, other than the actual event, was the uncontrollable shivering and the pack of cigarettes my brother and I nervously chain-smoked trying to calm down.

We were in Albania, We had only arrived that morning at 5:30, and we had only arrived at that location because a bus had abandoned us in the middle of what looked to be endless farmland. We were lost as far as location, but that mattered little to us. We were on a mission for experiences and cared little where it took us as long as it was an adventure. We did what I assume all people do in our situation. We walked to a four-way-stop, my brother closed his eyes and proceeded to spin around with his arm pointed out, stopping only after he was too dizzy to continue. He was pointing east; I think. It was hard to know, as the sun wasn’t even up. We walked for a while and civilization slowly emerged from the fields as we found our way to downtown Tirana.

Two cups of coffee into what was shaping up to be a beautiful morning *it* happened. It was a noise as disruptive as its result. I remember my brother asked if it was a backfire at first. From the look on his face I knew, he *knew* it wasn’t. The question was the natural reflex of an optimistic and innocent soul; a last attempt to believe the loud noise had only broken the silence.

Foolishly, I got up and looked around a vehicle. There *he *was. He was clearly dead. Not like a person in the movies. No, he was more than lifeless. It felt like he had become a vacuum sucking the life out of the world around him. As I saw the shooter across the street my body instantly filled with adrenaline. I felt a shockwave hit me inside. As that shockwave reverberated within me it broke my notion of the world and rattled my belief in humanity. This all happened in a split second, but in a reality much more real than the world around me I felt my world changing. I began to shiver; it wasn’t the cold or the caffeine. Physiologically, I guess it was the adrenaline. It was my body’s response to every part of me, but the physical being disrupted and shaken.

I wish I could say I acted heroically, but I neither ran nor leapt into action. I froze, a captive of an internal battle.

The gunman must have stood still for a second; to this day I think he was expecting something. I heard a brief but distinct pause. In that moment, I am convinced he expected to feel some kind of release that never came. Standing over his victim the murderer turned the gun around and shot himself in the chest. He was on the ground twisting in pain so violently he began rolling down a grassy slope. The murderous shot he had fired moments before had mercifully snuffed out a life in a split second, but somehow he didn’t allow himself the same luxury. No, for him life had clearly been a tortured existence and however tragic and however truly violent, he chose to leave the world much the same way he had been living it.

Within seconds, the threat was gone but I still shook. The world around us, probably 50 people, pretended to return to life as usual. Who knows maybe they did, but for me, life was forever altered. I wish I could say it was the last time I would witness something so profoundly violent but it wasn’t. The world I had known was cracked open and a new beat, a raw center, a duality I could not rationalize had emerged.

This was the moment I realized a person’s core is subjective and our reality is truly a fabricated construct. The context I had surrounded myself with organized the world around me and shaped my thinking and experiences. I had created necessary filters to try and make sense of a world too big to fully grasp. Unfortunately, the necessity of these filters won’t protect them from being shattered in a second.

Up until that point, the world had been undeniably beautiful and hopeful but at that moment it was undoubtedly violent and meaningless, and yet it was the same world.

This is the day I understood there is more than one world. There are constructs on top of constructs. I was on an adventure to find depth and meaning and yet I found understanding all the different contextual layers of the world is a violent pursuit of creation and destruction within ourselves.

I learned about *depth* that day. Depth like most meaningful things is earned. It’s simply the sum of the highest of highs and darkest of lows. It’s coming out the other side and still being open for more. It’s realizing hope is not the answer to a horrific circumstance but hope is *courage* itself. It’s not the courage to face a murder, it’s the courage to face yourself and stay open. Courage is not the answer but the fuel for a fighting soul.

Or maybe you have heard of Tim Ferriss’ Minimum Effective Dose. That’s the idea that you want to do the minimum work to trigger the change you’re looking for. If 20 pushups are going to trigger muscle adaptation, then you don’t need to do 30.

Let me introduce another Minimum Term, **The Minimum Consistent Dose.**

All of these terms are about applying speed and aggression to cut down on failure.

In business, you build the MVP because too often we overspend on the first version. The MVP lets us learn whether we are on the right track early

In exercise, you do the MED because too often we overtrain, get injured and then miss weeks or months of training. In that case, rather than get more fit, the training dose made us less fit.

With goals, the big risk is that we’ll fall off the wagon.

For example, the most optimistic measurements of New Years Resolutions are that 92% of people fail.

Enter The Minimum Consistent Dose. Let’s call it the MCD.

What is the smallest version of your goal that you’d be willing to give yourself credit for?

So often we only define the ambitious, everything-goes-right version of our goal. “I want to run ten miles a day for the rest of the year.”

But what happens if you get sick? Then your streak is ruined.

What if your MCD was jog half a mile. Then that sick day, you could still drag yourself out of bed to get your legs loose.

Or better yet, what if your MCD was run in place for 30 seconds?

If you define your minimum, then you’ve created a defense against failure.

Here are some of my MCDs.

* My normal exercise is run, swim or bike. My MCD is pushups and/or body-weight squats. Ten pushups and ten squats are enough to keep my exercise streak alive.

* My MCD for my todo list is 1 item. But I don’t wait until the end of the day to do that one item. I do it first and feel like I accomplished something. I am more productive once I feel like the rest of the day is optional — it triggers a sense of pride that I’m doing extra credit.

* My MCD for a blog post is a repost from some other content. It turns out that I have lots. So when I’m really, really not feeling inspired, I know I can dig some bit of email or personal advice out and turn it into a post.

* For eating, I try to eat one vegetable. Of course, my idea is a huge kale salad.

Now, you’re probably wondering if the MCD encourages you to consistently take the lazy way out.

A. If it does, then stop using it. Some concerns have trivial answers, and this is that trivial answer.

B. No.

People are motivated by fear and by pride. If you take the MCD approach then you end up with both.

First of all, every day feels like you’re doing extra credit. This generates pride and a feeling of momentum.

Second, once you have a streak, you will become afraid of losing that streak.

In the past, when you didn’t have the energy to give yourself a Mega Dose of training, you might have missed a day, and then a week, and then given up your goal altogether.

Now, when you have a bad day you still keep your streak alive. Of course, you’ll only know if your streak is still alive if you track it on [Coach.me](http://coach.me).

# Swallow’s Day Parade

## Reclaiming California

![Image by Brian Ecclesiastes Park](1*z-ECYA_9KV_2zayKZ_N_pA.jpeg)*Image by Brian Ecclesiastes Park*

*San Juan Capistrano, one of the twenty-one infamous missions that punctuate the long and skinny state of California, holds an annual swallow festival on March 19th. The swallow birds of North America return to the ruins of the church and build their mud nests where the previous generation had a year before, taking shelter on the California coast until the Leaving Season prompts their eminent departure, when autumn descends. And so it goes to show, not unlike these swallows, those of us who are home in California are bound to it; unable to stay away no matter how we stray.*

**The Circumstances:**

Earlier this year, I found myself very recently graduated and still very young, affronted by my perceived realities of adulthood and bouncing from job to job. I tried my hand at working in a law office, then in a television production studio, and finally resorted to the quintessential Generation Y yuppie occupation: marketing. All the while racked by “guilt privilege,” I was in a free-fall, frustrated that commitment seemed to be such a struggle and reluctantly missing the freedom and whimsy of being a student, when I had lived for long periods of time far away from my home. While I’d been away, I spent years singing my California swan song as I tripped from one city to the next. The ultimate promise to return (with the swallows in March) fueled my momentum. I was gone for a long time but now that I was back, I was directionless and afloat in purposeless uncertainty.

It was no longer possible to ignore the bittersweet little tug hoo-ha-ing on my shoulder, trying to get my attention, yelling up at me, “Everything is different now.” I sat on the patio with the people who are still here — Brian was melodically strumming a guitar — and I looked from face to face. I marveled at these adult versions of the tiny people I used to run to the kickball field with. These are the people who knew me in the glory of wild childhood abandon, and isn’t that the most intimate type of knowing?

But we were no longer a part of the daily grind that was our present reality. There was a distinct disconnect: gaps left by friends who were now far from here and pursuing a Great Perhaps that did not involve the Home Team anymore. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow on Rachael’s face that doesn’t light up her eyes; she puts a hand up to her forehead and squints away from the sky. She was leaving tomorrow, only here to visit, and her desire to leave was palpable in the waning summer brightness.

As the biting chill started to set in with the evenings, my old friends trickled away from our hometown. They left for school, or for jobs on Wall Street, or just to go. I, however, the Master of Goodbyes, found that I could not leave. Instead, I settled into a mediocre nine to five routine that paid okay, chanting my mantra: *This is how things are supposed to be.*

**The Fall-Out:**

Inevitably, the less-lovely things that I had left behind when I had left this place made themselves known once more. This was the pool I almost drowned in when I was six: I closed my eyes and could only see my own ghostly fingers stretched out in the ethereal chlorine blue. This was the house he lived in: I drove past and felt so much for feeling nothing. Here was the bar I went to with my god-brother before he moved so far away and beyond my reach that I’d never seen him again. I couldn’t go anywhere without remembering, or being remembered, and it was suffocating.

My high school boyfriend was in town for a week and I clung to him, following him around like some sad little animal and disregarding the sophistication I thought I’d collected in the six years since I’d last seen him. A whirlwind of drugs and ravenous kisses occurred, on cold jungle gyms at the public park, middle of the night. I devastated myself, putting in motion a crazy spin on my axis and then watching the world unfurl. He left again, very probably disgusted and bewildered at my new desperation, and I drank wildly. I wrote a book about the five days we’d spent together in twelve hours flat. I dragged old friends out to bars on Tuesday nights, guzzling whiskey and avoiding their questions. They were confused: *are you really still in love with him, Heidi? Were you ever? *The answer, of course, was no — I was not in love with him but I wanted to be. Perhaps, caught in the throes of passion, I could escape from the feeling that I was slowly, slowly disappearing.

An illegitimate rage, the first time I realized that the things I had spent years missing were gone for good. It could be a big tree, or a cup of coffee, or a Mexican food joint. Sometimes it is a person, which is the hardest. While I had been away, running and falling, growing and hurting, with the assumption that coming home would always be an option, certain fundamental truths had changed. I had been growing further and further in one direction; home had been doing the same in another. I was suddenly humbled by the realization that my home was not exclusively mine, after all. Kneeling, with my knees digging into the damp, dark soil in the garden my mother used to till when I was a child, I would search wildly with frantic fingers for a bulb, a root, some sign of life.

Hung-over from too many shots of tequila taken the night before, I would vomit all over myself on my morning commute to work. The formidable Los Angeles traffic was endless before me as I mopped myself off with a cardigan, wheezing and incapable of grasping what had just happened. *What the fuck. *Later, I would walk into work reeking of puke and alcohol, deftly closing my office door and turning on my computer, my hair still sopping wet. I did not say it, did not even think it, but I knew something had to change.

**The Decision:**

Then, an opportunity arose. I sent my resume out on a whim, not expecting a response; so I was all the more taken aback when one came. A position was offered — to be a reporter for the state-run China Radio International, requiring relocating to Beijing for the indefinite future. I dismissed it, calling it crazy. I did not want to leave again after having just made it back, after having waited and worked for this for so long, but it was an impossible game that I was playing with myself; I could feel the itch to leave blowing in with the hot Santa Ana Winds — Devil Winds.

Still, the determination it takes for an Asian American girl who had grown up very much integrated in American culture to make the decision to move back to the Motherland is no small thing. I had to smoke a joint in the backseat of my car on my lunch break to muster the courage to quit my job. That Saturday morning, confused and afraid of my own endless wanderlust, I called my best friend. Becca drove all afternoon to come home immediately, no questions asked. “I don’t know, I just feel weird. Restless. I think I need to leave but I am afraid to go,” I tried to explain. Before the end of the week, she had rounded up a rag-tag patchwork of the old gang, calling an emergency maneuver and bringing them back from the corners of the world. We tore through the town of our childhood, howling yippees and enveloped in breathless wonderment. Later, we would curl up with each other in front of a bonfire by the sea and they told me to go, just to go. Like the swallows, they said, as long as you claim your California home, you will be back and we will be here too.

There was only one last order of business before I let the Leaving Season carry me away, to Beijing this time. I had to reclaim California. Arrangements were made for two months of travel, my old friends offering to host me in different parts of our Golden State. My travels would be conducted primarily alone, by car, each stop lasting no more than a week and offering a different episode of what it is like to be in your early twenties, living in California. And so began the process of Reclaiming California.

# Parenting with Social Anxiety

## How to help yourself and your kids

![Photo: Andrew Knott](1*Tay6VpTC3LwcqpSpQLpvEg@2x.jpeg)*Photo: Andrew Knott*

“I want to wear this to the park,” my four-year-old said excitedly, holding out a red headband with a pirate emblem on it.

I hesitated for a moment as I imagined the looks we might get from other kids and parents before replying, “Sure, sounds good.”

After we completed our preparations for the short outing, I asked if he was ready to put on his headband.

“No,” he said with a touch of sadness. “People at the park might think I’m funny.”

And right there, in our kitchen on a hot summer day, I died just a little inside. My heart broke not only for my little boy’s self-consciousness, his easy willingness at the tender age of four to deny himself a small pleasure because of fear of what others might think. My heart also broke because my first thought when he asked if he could wear the headband to the park was, “Oh, people might think we’re funny.”

![](0*p-NGb3mu2Fgun4Ib.)

I know this probably seems silly to most people. I mean, what adult cares what a four-year-old wears? But that’s the thing about [social anxiety disorder](http://socialphobia.org/social-anxiety-disorder-definition-symptoms-treatment-therapy-medications-insight-prognosis) — characterized by pathological shyness and avoidance of social situations in large part due to fear of being judged and evaluated — it makes you do things that don’t make much logical sense. This fear of standing out and perhaps being talked about by faceless others leads people with social anxiety to forego many activities they otherwise might enjoy. I have lived with this fear for as long as I can remember, but I didn’t have a name to put with it until I was clinically diagnosed when I was in my mid-twenties.

![](0*Y8GmgO4skUlw4syW.)

As a parent, I’ve learned that it can be particularly challenging to help my children overcome their insecurities and fears. [Academic studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10567-011-0108-1) suggest that children of parents with social anxiety or panic disorder are more prone to developing anxiety disorders, including social anxiety. While the underpinnings of these linkages remain muddy, the consensus among researchers and mental health practitioners is that both genetics and environment play a role. Thus, it is important for parents suffering with social anxiety to consider how their children might be affected. If you have been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, or if you can relate to the type of anxiety I’ve described here, there are several steps you can take to help your children overcome their potential genetic destiny.

![](0*mwi5CIEcN_I-YC0w.)

## ***1. Be Aware of How Your Anxiety Can Affect Your Child’s Development***

In addition to modeling anxious traits and behaviors that children can learn through observation, [parents have substantial control over their children’s environments during their early years](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.12121/abstract). Parents decide when and how their kids interact with the wider world. This can be a problem for children of socially anxious parents, who, because of their own social limitations and fears, often have difficulty introducing their children into organized activities. For example, I had a hard time pushing myself to register my son for preschool, because I knew he would likely resist and taking the necessary steps was difficult for me. Picking up the phone to make that first call was a real obstacle.

So, if you suffer with social anxiety disorder, it’s easy to lock your children, who might already be genetically predisposed to shyness, into the shyness box by constructing limiting and isolating environments. How can you avoid this trap? Start by taking care of yourself. If you haven’t sought help from a psychiatrist or therapist, do it now. If making the phone call to set up an appointment is too daunting, ask your spouse or partner to do it for you. Remember that your anxiety isn’t affecting just you. It is likely having a significant impact on your children as well. Now is the time to act.

![](0*Ba6Z4_1amjjGnn9Q.)

## ***2. Know What to Expect When You Seek Help***

Your counselor or physician will likely prescribe psychotherapy, potentially in combination with anti-anxiety medication or antidepressants. On the psychotherapy side, one prominent treatment concept is [exposure therapy](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/exposure-therapy/496547/). In the context of social anxiety disorder, exposure can take the form of seemingly routine tasks, such as initiating small talk with a stranger in a grocery store. Alternatively, in attempting to immunize against fear of embarrassment or judgment, some therapists encourage more-contrived exposure scenarios, such as intentionally making a mistake while ordering food at a restaurant. The rationale is that, for the socially anxious person, the potential for embarrassment often underlies fear of interpersonal interactions, so purposely making small mistakes can help you learn that the outcomes are not as catastrophic as imagined.

![](0*ldwUt0Hj96O9zihD.)

## ***3. Keep in Mind That Your Therapist Might Not Know Everything***

My first therapist encouraged me to practice exposure therapy by introducing myself to at least one stranger per day. He suggested that I walk up to people in a store parking lot and say hello. I could never make myself follow his advice, quickly became discouraged, and viewed it as yet another failure. However, I later learned that my therapist’s plan of action probably wasn’t the best one.

[Cognitive-behavioral therapy](https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/comprehensive-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-social-anxiety-disorder) (CBT) is the preferred treatment method for social anxiety disorder. And while exposure can be the behavioral part of CBT, cognitive therapies such as role-playing, simulation, and step-by-step deconstruction of anxiety-inducing situations should come first. Without proper preparation, facing your fears can do more harm than good. Exposure therapy failed to help me because I lacked the necessary tools to navigate such situations.

![](0*gnttgCB3oIu6jbu8.)

## ***4. Learn When to Push Your Kids—and When to Pull Back***

When children are confronted with new and difficult experiences, it is difficult for any parent to decide when to push and when to pull back. For example, if your child consistently refuses to participate in group activities, like sports or music lessons, it’s difficult to decide if you should force them to try or pull back, wait, and allow them to move at their own pace. Such decisions become more complicated for socially anxious parents because our default is to avoid. For our own reasons, we’re happy to avoid having to do all the things that are necessary to get our children started in activities and to avoid potential embarrassment that might result when a child refuses to participate.

Here is where your experience with treating your anxiety can start to inform your parenting. Just like you might not be prepared for exposure therapy if you haven’t developed the necessary coping strategies, your kids might not be ready to tackle new situations right away.

For example, my son wanted to try tennis lessons. He was particularly attracted to the knocking-over-cones portion of the proceedings. But once he got onto the court with the rest of the kids, he froze up and refused to participate. Gentle coaxing from me and the instructor failed to get him moving, so we left the court and watched from the sidelines. I decided pushing my son wasn’t the right thing to do in this particular situation. What happened next confirmed that I had made the right call.

![](0*5pMoAVh8H1HZf6fu.)

## ***5. Recognize How Your Experiences Can Help Your Children***

Whether you realize it or not, if you have lived with social anxiety disorder for most of your life, you’ve likely developed a toolbox of coping strategies. Perhaps some strategies are more positive than others, but your treatment should help highlight and enhance the best ones. Next, you can pass along to your children some strategies you’ve learned and developed.

The moment we left that first tennis lesson, my son wanted to do the entire warmup routine he had observed the other kids doing. Just the two of us, by ourselves, in the safety of the parking lot. This unexpected twist was an a-ha moment for me. I remembered from my childhood (and my adulthood) that a key component of my fear of new situations and activities is the fear of not knowing what to do and, in turn, fear of doing the wrong thing. I had probably never thought of it in those terms before, but this experience with my son made it very clear.

What I have always done to combat this fear of the unknown is learn as much as I can about a new situation before I make that first leap. Now I’m using this strategy to help my son tackle his fears.

![](0*g3SD93BLbTimdApS.)

## ***6. Remember the Importance of Getting Familiar with New Situations***

I try to help my son become familiar with new activities before we jump into them, though I quickly realized that creating general familiarity wasn’t sufficient. For example, just verbally explaining to him some things he might do at a tennis lesson wasn’t enough. Instead, we practiced the warmup moves we observed so he would be less anxious about not knowing what to do. This type of preparation, practice, and step-by-step deconstruction of intimidating tasks might not be a cure-all — every situation is different — but it’s a good place to start. Learning to combat this fear of the new and unfamiliar, which is a core phobia underlying many stressors that socially anxious people experience, will go a long way toward helping you and your child begin to tackle anxieties.

# Finish More

## Finish More

Most people who create digital things naturally accumulate a portfolio. Some people, though, end up with an *oeuvre. *These are the notable people in our fields who have a seemingly massive body of work, consistently writing, designing, shipping code, giving talks, and generally creating the *things* that everyone else consumes, discusses, and shares. What sets these people apart?

Talent is only part of the answer. There are lots of talented people with their heads down doing brilliant work with little major recognition. (Incidentally, the inverse is also true.)

It may also seem like they’re simply more prolific. But that’s not it either. You can have a million lines of code on [Github](http://github.com/pius) and never get noticed or build something people are using. Between away messages, statuses, tweets, and e-mail, I’ve shared several thousand interesting links over the years, but that doesn’t make me [Andy Baio](http://waxy.org/2012/04/happy_10th_birthday_waxy/) or [Jason Kottke](http://kottke.org/about/).

So if being talented and prolific isn’t enough, what is? I’ve come to realize that the biggest factor setting the notable creatives apart is simple: **they finish more**. And not in the way you may think.

Most people think of “finishing” as coming to the end of something. I’m more interested in [a secondary definition](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/finish):
> “completing [a product] by giving it an attractive surface appearance.”

Finishing is taking the extra time to not just release what you’ve created into the world like so much digital exhaust, but to sign your name to it, wrap a bow around it, and *present* it to an audience. It’s imbuing a sense of ownership, craftsmanship, and posterity into what you’ve already created. And, importantly, doing the same with your [by-products](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1620-sell-your-by-products).

[Ironically](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_%28signal_processing%29), the digital nature of our work pulls us inexorably towards the continuous — each of our identities become an amalgamation of streams, our wheat and our chaff all mixed together. In this day and age where it seems like everything is a feed of ephemera, switching your mindset to creating for posterity and finishing more can be a huge force multiplier. **Cherry-pick the most interesting bits of what you think about and create every day, then do the extra bit of work needed to finish and aggregate them.**

Fortunately, finishing in this sense of the word is not a binary thing; we can do more or less of it as time and motivation allow. For example, a developer who has just solved a problem in code can publish the code, extract it into its own library, and build a standalone site for the library with documentation and examples. Each extra bit of finish extracts more value out of the work.

When you’ve finished a few things, put them together and *publish* them. Doing this helps us bridge [the gap between our taste and our work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbC4gqZGPSY). Maintain a personal site, publish a newsletter, present at a conference, write a book. Treat your work with respect.

A bias towards finishing is *the* killer instinct and we fail to develop it at our peril. Leaving most of what we do unfinished means that the vast majority of the time, energy, and passion we put into our work is for naught, destined to die with us … or likely much earlier.

# What Advice Would You Give Your Replacement?

## 

My to-do list isn’t much of a list. It’s more of a collection. Brief notes to myself on index cards, the backs of envelopes, on my phone or sometimes emailed to myself. It’s cloud storage, but without any organization to it whatsoever — it’s just “out there.” More like fog storage. Occasionally this gets overwhelming, and I spend an hour or two pulling it all together into one place.

I did this the other day, and even after discarding the things that just didn’t make sense to do anymore, I still had 17 items on the list. Less overwhelming, because it was all there in one place, but still overwhelming. Paralyzed by not knowing where to start, I took a walk to the coffee machine. On the way, I thought of two more things to add to the list.

There are several strategies for dealing with a situation like this. My natural style is to attack things in chronological order — FIFO/LILO. This works brilliantly for the 0.4% of the times when things find their way to me in perfect order of importance. The other 99.6% of the time, my natural approach is a bit less effective.

Some of us will look for quick wins — checking off the items that are the easiest to accomplish. There’s some benefit to that, as quick wins build momentum. But “little” things always come up, and we get stuck in the loop of always working on the quick wins and never focusing on the overall battle that’s waging.

Others will attend to the squeaky wheels first — whichever item is being asked for loudest by the most obnoxious stakeholder gets worked on. Two problems with this approach: 1. You’re training people to be obnoxious squeaky wheels when they want something from you, and 2. You’re always working on other people’s priorities rather than your own.

I transitioned jobs within my company recently, and have been getting my replacement up to speed on the status of everything she’s inheriting. I’ve found myself starting lots of sentences with “The first thing I’d do is…” or “The best thing to do here would be…” or similar phrases. The truth hit me. What those phrases really mean is “What I’ve been meaning to do for the last several weeks (months?) but haven’t gotten around to because I keep letting all of these other less important things get in the way is…”

In my new job, I’m trying something new — asking myself a question. What would I tell my replacement to work on first? Whatever that thing is, it’s what I should be tackling.

Yes, I occasionally still check something off the list simply because it’s been on there the longest, even if it isn’t what I probably ought to be doing. I still put a little oil on the squeaky wheel now and then, just because I need the squeaking to stop. But more often, this simple question is helping me work on checking the big deals off of my list. My list. Not someone else’s. That feels pretty good.

# Rule of Three&#58; Bad Ideas, Arguments and Brainstorming

## Rule of Three: Bad Ideas, Arguments and Brainstorming

### How to kill arguments and force smarter thinking.

This is a quick little hack that holds a special place in my management toolbox.

I call it the **Rule of Three**.

## One idea is a bad idea

Lots of times, someone will tell you they’ve got an idea and they can’t wait to start on it.

But sometimes that idea sounds stupendously bad.

If you just start poking holes in their idea then you come off as an asshole.

And either you fail to convince the person that their idea is bad — in which case you (or your team or your company) still have a bad idea.

Or you successfully berate the person until they give up on their idea — in which case you have no ideas.

Neither is ideal.

## Two ideas is an argument

Sometimes two people will will be simultaneously trying to share their own ideas while poking holes in each other’s ideas.

Or, also common, you will respond to an idea that you don’t like by proposing your own alternative idea.

Congratulations — you’ve now picked a fight.

It’s incredibly hard for the original person to give up their idea because they won’t feel like their idea was even heard or understood. Thus, they also won’t take the time to hear and understand your alternative idea.

Now you’re in an impossible argument. This is not a discussion and it’s not healthy.

## Three ideas is a brainstorm

This is the hack.

Instead of poking holes, ask how it compares to other ideas.

I just flat out tell people that I want to see at least three ideas.

90% of the time they will stare at me blankly — they can’t even think of a single alternative idea.

When this happens I start throwing out REALLY BAD IDEAS.

Let me give you my go to BAD IDEAS that work in almost any situation: we could shut down the company or we could delete the feature or we could do nothing.

For some reason, bad ideas unblock people. My theory is that people are blocked because they’re trying to edit their ideas to things that perfectly meet their own idea of the requirements. That’s natural — people want to say smart things, not stupid things.

But editing ideas is a brainstorming no-no. So BAD IDEAS get the ball rolling.

## Here’s what happens once you have three ideas

You will very shortly have 7 ideas. Nobody is satisfied by the bad ideas I throw out, so they start throwing out some actual good ones.

People (mostly) forget their own idea. Some of the ideas will be riffs that combine ideas. That way everyone in the room will have ownership.

Everyone figures out quickly that they didn’t understand the requirements. Nothing says “that’s not a requirement” like the boss throwing out an idea that’s missing that requirement.

They say you should lead with requirements instead of implementation (or at least if you’re in software, you’ll hear this fairly often). But the truth is that many people think in terms of implementation — so the brainstorm helps a lot of people really understand what’s important and what’s not.

## You flared — now focus

When you do a brainstorm to solve a problem or generate an idea, you’ll always experience two sides. First you flare to generate as many ideas as possible. Then you focus to decide on the one path that you’re actually going to execute on.

*[Hat tip for “Flare and focus” to Adaptive Path co-founder [janice fraser](https://twitter.com/clevergirl). I stole a lot of facilitation tactics from her and designers like her.]*

So, now, you’ve used the **Rule of Three** to generate a bunch of ideas. You’re half way there. You still need to pick a winner.

The good news is that unlike a lot of brainstorming, the **Rule of Three** almost always resolves itself naturally.

It’s sort of magic.

When I do this with engineers usually we’ll hit on an implementation that’s faster, cheaper and cleaner to build. So there’s no argument — just do that one.

When I do this with product design — we also almost always hit on a design that’s simpler or obviously better in some important way.

So, that’s the hack. Tell the people who work with about your Rule of Three:

**One idea is a bad idea, two ideas is an argument, three ideas is a brainstorm.**

# Why You Should Write a Personal Constitution

## 

**If *countries *need one, *we *need one.**

Several years ago, I read Dr. Stephen Covey’s [*The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451639619/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1451639619&linkCode=as2&tag=mmvn-20&linkId=OUNOWZPHXVL45PR6)*, a book I believe should be required reading for anyone interested in achieving success in both their personal life and their career.

Among all the valuable tips in that book, the one thing that struck me most was Covey’s recommendation to develop a “Personal Mission Statement.”

This probably isn’t the first time you’ve heard the concept. It’s something often touted by other personal development and productivity thought leaders like Tony Robbins.

And while I completely agree with them on the benefits of this exercise, I recommend taking the process a step further and creating what I call a *Personal Constitution*.

## What is a Personal Constitution?

When I say “personal constitution,” I’m being literal. I mean an actual constitution, like the constitution of the United States of America.

Much like the Constitution helped shape the future of America, your personal constitution will help shape your future. Do for yourself what the founding fathers did for this country.

While the entire process for the US Constitution spanned over 117 days in the heat of summer — in a time without air conditioning — I’m pretty certain you can get yours done in a much shorter timeframe (and in a much more comfortable environment).

## Why You Need a Personal Constitution

So what’s the point of developing a personal constitution? There are many reasons why I recommend this exercise to my clients and friends, but one of the most important ones is that it gives you a pathway built on the values that you refuse to compromise on and it moves you in the clear direction you’ve chosen.

Think of it this way: To this day, the US Constitution is the one document that holds everything together. When other aspects of the law can’t figure something out, the Supreme Court will make their decision based on this foundational and hard-to-change document.

Imagine having something like this for your own life: A set of values and goals you hold yourself accountable to and cannot compromise on.

When you face the tough decisions we always run into as we manage our careers and develop our personal lives, you can always base your decisions on the contents of your personal constitution. Written well, it will help to guide you toward the right decision and ensure you don’t step off the right track.

## Personal Constitutions in Action

To illustrate how this might work, here’s an example:

About 90% of the people I work with — myself included — would say family is the most important aspect of their life. And yet all of them are incredibly successful in their careers with an unmatched work ethic.

What this means is that they sometimes end up having to make sacrifices and compromises that lead them to make decisions that aren’t based on what’s actually important to them. In this case, their family.

Now imagine a decision like this arises: “Should I take this job that gives me a 20% raise but forces me to be away from my family 5 months out of the year?”

Although the pay raise might be tempting, they’d be able to use their personal constitution to make a decision that aligns with their long-term goals, values, and priorities.

The process to create personal constitution is simpler than you may think. Let me break it down for you:

## Step one: Brainstorming

Set aside 20–30 minutes of time to brainstorm and write down your responses to the following questions:

* [What is most important to you](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-goal-setting/)?

* What are some of the values you want to be defined by?

* What are the values that you would like others to describe you as having?

* If you were to look back on your life in 80 years, what are some of the things you want to be proud of being strong on?

* What parts of you are [internally driven vs externally driven](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/make-motivation-a-habit/)? And how much are you defined by the things important to *you* vs the things important to *others*?

* What are your long-term and short-term priorities?

Keep in mind what brainstorming is: Coming up with a lot of ideas without spending any time critiquing the ideas. It’s a brain dump; you want as many thoughts as possible before you move on to the next step.

## Step two: Organization

Once your brainstorming session is over, it’s time to organize your thoughts into specific areas of importance. I recommend defining specific categories. For example:

* Family,

* Career,

* Social life,

* Physical health,

* Personal development, and

* Lifestyle.

## Step three: Composition

Once you’ve identified all of these categories, write the opening sentence to your personal constitution. It should sound something like this:

*“I’m writing my personal constitution to guide me in difficult decisions and to keep me true to what is important to me.”*

Then create a header for each of the categories you outlined in step two, and list a set of rules under each one. Keep in mind that the constitution shouldn’t be too long. It should be something you can print out on a single page, so think 3–4 bullets under each header.

## The Most Important Thing You’ll Do All Year

As simple as this process is, it could be the most important work you’ll do this year. If done right, it will become the foundation on which you can firmly stand.

Most of us are driven by influences that aren’t quite internal but come from external sources like friends, family, and society as a whole.

Sometimes it’s easy to be pushed in a direction that isn’t right because someone said you something like:

* “You should be doing this,”

* “You’d be an in idiot not to take this opportunity,” or

* “Consider what others might think.”

These are things we often hear when making important decisions. However, if your ultimate quest in life is to seek happiness, these external influences are not what matter, nor what will get you where you want to go.

## Unlock Your Full Potential as a Person and a Professional

One of the side benefits that I’ve seen is that you will appear to be a much more self-confident person. And very often, even if you’re going against the grain, people will respect you more for it.

In fact, if you stick to your path, it could very well be that you achieve more success than you or anyone else expected.

At the end of the day, **your personal constitution will help you stay true to yourself when the winds of change are pushing you in a different direction.** Can you imagine anything more powerful than that?

# The “I’m With Stupid” Principle

## The “I’m With Stupid” Principle

I’ve been in the self-improvement field for quite some time now. It started off as a personal experiment to heal my own anxiety, reading lots of advice from others, trying things, then sticking with what worked.

After seeing immense improvement, I became a believer. Now I share the information I’ve learned as well as some new concepts of my own.

Over the years I’ve stumbled across many different ideas, but the following is one that completely changed how I viewed the world:
> Your thoughts don’t define you, your actions do.

Human beings, up until around the middle school years, are blessed with the power of naivety. Your mind is still maturing and growing, and you haven’t lived on this Earth long enough to experience information overload.

Think about typical kids. Most run around having a grand-old time. Their lives are simple and one-dimensional. They do things they enjoy, and they hang out with others who enjoy similar things.

Most important, the actions they take are a direct result of their thoughts:
> I’m bored → Let’s go play basketball

Taking things one step further, kids are pretty good at associating the things they do with the type of person they are, mostly because they don’t know any other way.
> I’m bored → Let’s go play basketball → I’m a kid who enjoys playing sports
> Think → Act → Associate

This is actually a highly intelligible framework to live by, and it’s really the only way that makes sense.

If I were to think about nothing but being a professional basketball player all day, but never did anything basketball-related, I highly doubt I could call myself the next LeBron James, let alone a professional bench-warmer.

Plus, everybody else can only associate you **with the actions that you take**, so it makes sense that you should, too.

## **Where Most Everyone Goes Wrong**

As a child, you rarely second guess your thoughts or wonder why you do things, at least not on a detailed level. As you mature, the naivety goes away. Budding adults and beyond start questioning *everything* on an existential level. This is because your thoughts shift from one-dimensional to multi-dimensional.

In a sense, you start thinking about your thoughts.
> Think → Think about thoughts → Analyze → Associate → Act → Associate again

See how now the front-end of the equation is convoluted and messy. There’s an awful lot of thinking involved. If your thoughts were popular dips, they just went from a one-layer cheese dip to your mom’s world renowned seven-layer bean dip, self-awarded of course.

This muddies the waters and makes it super confusing as to how you define yourself. Before, it was clear that your actions defined you, and it was very easy to associate with them. Now you have a bunch more thoughts in your head, and a growing portion of you thinks you have to associate with them, too.

Therein lies the problem. People naturally start associating with their thoughts instead of just their actions. It seems like the right thing to do. And with a seemingly endless stream of thoughts, most people get lost and never recover.
> I’m bored → Maybe I should go play basketball → Do I have anybody to play with? → Do the people I play with even like me? → What if I’m not good enough to play? → I think I’d rather stay at home instead → I must be a loser → Wallows in self-pity → I’m a loser.

Whoa. Talk about a lot of noise. That’s the thing though, there are simply too many inputs to ignore.

Unfortunately, a lot of adults never learn how to pilot their own minds. They start wrongly defining themselves by the random thoughts in their head. They start believing they’re weak, not worthy of love, or whatever other crazy thoughts arise, even though nothing they’ve done that suggests that.

Others start living in a fantasy.

A friend of mine told me about his sister-in-law’s boyfriend. Maybe you know a guy like him. He’s a dreamer. Really, though, he’s a manipulator. He talks about starting a business but hasn’t done anything about it. He drags girls along with him, taking advantage of them financially on the promise of future riches and security.
> “One day we’ll be able to look back on these problems and laugh.”

But that time never comes with no action.

I don’t care how awesome you think you are, or how rich and famous you say you’ll be in the future. You don’t get to define yourself that way until you start taking action towards making it happen. Talking isn’t enough.

Don’t let yourself drown in your own diluted thoughts.

When your mind gets more complicated, you have to evolve along with it. You have to be selective with your thoughts and continue to associate based on your actions.

Your thoughts mean nothing until you actualize them. That’s one simple trick that most people never learn, and those people live out their lives wrongly thinking they’re someone they’re not.

## **How to Get Back on Track**

Fortunately, redefining who you are is fairly simple, you just need a little perspective.

If it seems as though someone else hijacked your mind somewhere along the way, you’re kind of right.

Those other thoughts swirling around? They’re not actually you. They’re just a result of your brain doing its job — constantly thinking, analyzing, and working.

Taking a step back to observe these thoughts is an eye-opener for most people. You can do this by a little something you might have heard of called meditation. It helps you to separate your thoughts from the white noise of your mind.

One part of your mind you might be familiar with is the ego. Your ego generates a lot of the weird thoughts in your head, and there are likely many. In fact, if you’re like most people, there’s probably a lot of really weird shit going on in there. Many of us don’t like to admit it, but it’s true.

The ego gets offended by lots of things. It acts instinctively based on emotion and gets really upset in many situations. When you become pissed off at someone and want to punch him, that’s the raw emotion from your ego doing its thing.

## The “I’m With Stupid” Principle

The concept I want to share with you today is called the “I’m with stupid” principle. It’s named as such because it’s like you’re stuck with this other person in your head, and sometimes he’s really stupid.

It’s kind of like the time you went to a bar with your friend who got really drunk, made a lot of people angry, and you were stuck babysitting him all night.

In order to not look stupid yourself, you have to understand the situation around you. You’re just there helping your drunk friend. His choices have nothing to do with yours. You’re actually just the good guy along for the ride, making sure he doesn’t get into too much trouble.

Once you realize that most of the strange thoughts in your head aren’t yours, things start making more sense. It really *IS *like there’s an annoying, stupid other person in there!

Let’s do an experiment. Stop reading this and just observe your thoughts. Where did your mind go? I’d bet there was at least one weird thing that popped up.

These thoughts aren’t you. They’re your ego’s and the white noise of your mind. This just means you have to be selective about your thoughts.
> Think → Filter → Act → Associate

You get defined by others by the actions that you take, and you should define *yourself *the same way.

Want to be a good person? Thinking about it isn’t enough, go do good things.

Want to start a business? Go do business things.

Want to be a triathlete? Go swim, bike, and run.

I think you get the idea. The most important thing to remember is that your thoughts don’t define you, your actions do. So go out and define yourself however you see fit.

# Make professional introductions as easy as feeding a bear

## 

It has been said it is not about what you know but who you know however better stated it is about who the people you know, know.

I have long said you should maintain contact even if it is peripheral contact with those people you have known (school, hobbies, volunteer work) or have worked and done deals with in the past. Social networks are ideal for this type of light interactions which allow you to maintain warm contact.

However, the time comes when one desires or has the need to make an introduction of two of their contacts.
> # Not all introductions will lead to a fruitful outcome and expectations should be realistic.

There are of course good and bad introductions. Sometimes the form is critical and other times making sure the reasons on both sides are valid will save trouble for all.

A well done introduction is appreciated by all involved and regardless of the down the line results all involved will remain appreciative of the effort.

To be clear, not all introductions will lead to a fruitful outcome and expectations should be realistic for all involved. Here are some things to take into consideration:

• Both parties should be open to introductions.

• Both parties must vet each other independent of the referrer.

• Once the introduction is made the referrer should bow out of the interaction.

• In normal networking, other than goodwill the person making the introduction should have no expectation of reward.

• Even the best of introductions and resulting business can and will turn out to be less than fruitful. This should not leave any ill feelings.

Not everyone is open to blind introductions. Generally speaking, unless you know the person receiving the introduction well and hence can be sure of the reception, you should make a private inquiry as to if the receiver is open to the introduction.

I know many people who are pro-networking and or their business are such that introductions can be assumed to be desired. However, this is not always the case.

When making an introduction ensure that you have a clear idea of the person’s needs that you are introducing and how that might be of value to the receiver. Be sure to state how and how well you know the person you are referring and don’t oversell the person or the idea.
> # In all introductions, a no thank you is a definite response and not an invite to push the issue more.

If you are being introduced to someone, your expectation resulting from that introduction should be limited to a simple polite request. It is no different than meeting someone while over at someone’s house. Basic social etiquette applies and should be adhered to. In all introductions, a no thank you is a definite response and not an invite to push the issue more.

If you are introduced, the key is to state your need, desire and or point succinctly. Be considerate of others time and or method of monetizing their lives. Do not push for more contact (i.e. lunch, presentation, full day fishing excursion) then the receiver is willing to consider.

Be mindful that others will be true to their nature. I once introduced someone looking for funding to a person who helped connect people with funding (for profit and not fun) they were later shocked when the contact stated they would expect a fee for their efforts.

When making an introduction make sure the person you are introducing understands what the other person does and how they work if you can.

When I introduce a contact to a recruiter/headhunter, I am careful to make sure the person understands that recruiters work to fill positions for their clients and not find jobs for a job seeker. A lack of understanding of this basic fact might create a very unsuccessful introduction.

In the end, introductions should leave all involved appreciative of the endeavor even if nothing immediate comes of the interaction.

# The 2 Steps I Use To 10X Daily Performance

## The 2 Steps I Use To 10X Daily Performance

### How To Plan Your Day At Night

Imagine you’re an actor.

It’s opening night of a Broadway play and you’re the star. You’re backstage thinking of all the praise and accolades you’ll get. The illustrious career that lies ahead.

You hear the stage manager yell, “Places in 5!”.* *And then you realize…

*Shit — I never even looked at the script!*

**This is the equivalent of not planning your day at night.**

Every day you have on this Earth is an opportunity. An opportunity to make something happen. Precious time that shouldn’t be wasted.

If you wait until the morning to plan your day, three things happen:

1. **You’re *asking* for stress and anxiety.**

1. **You won’t be as productive as you could be.**

1. **You won’t be as effective as you could be.**

Let’s break these down…

## 1. Stress & Anxiety

Take our actor scenario. The curtains go up, the lights shine on you, and… *now what?*

You’re in a panic. You’re not sure what to say, what to do, or where to go next. In the best case scenario you’re improvising and making up something decent as you go.

Another good example is a football player not knowing the play before the ball is hiked. It’s a recipe for disaster.

## 2. Less Productive

If you’re stressed and anxious, you aren’t fully present. You aren’t able to focus clearly on the task at hand. Your mind wanders, thinking about what you need to do next and wondering if you’re missing anything.

This mindset makes it difficult to a) get things done and b) handle unforeseen challenges as they arise. You’re forced to adapt, prioritize, and schedule on the fly.

If you haven’t already set priorities for yourself (see #2 [here](http://adampittenger.com/blog/2016/2/28/how-i-reduced-stress-increased-productivity-and-made-myself-happy-again)) then it’s likely you won’t get important things done that day. Emails will bury you, meetings will derail you, and by the time you finally getting a handle on things, the day is almost over.

## 3. Less Effective

Considering the points above, the quality of your work will obviously suffer. You’ll feel rushed, discombobulated, and unable to provide your complete attention to your work.

Perhaps a more important point here is decision fatigue. By not planning and visualizing your day, you are forcing yourself to constantly make decisions throughout. Big or small, it doesn’t matter. As the day goes on this wears on you.

*Mentally exhausted at the end of each day? That’s decision fatigue at work.*

Although subtle when isolated, the impact of continually using your brain’s processing power for small decisions quickly adds up over the course of a day. Not planning ahead tremendously increases the number of these decisions you have to make.

You’re so tired from the mental energy exerted to go through that day that you say, “eh, I’ll deal with this tomorrow” and the cycle repeats itself.

## Here’s What To Do

It’s clear not planning your day has negative impacts. Luckily this bad habit is an easy one to break. *It requires two steps and less than 20 minutes a day.*** **Here’s how…

### **STEP 1: Plan Your Day At Night.**

**Take 10–15 minutes and do the following:**

1. **Look at today’s calendar.** Take stock of what you did and note any needed follow ups for tomorrow.

1. **Look at tomorrow’s calendar.** See what calls or meetings you already have on there.

1. **Look at your To-Do list.** Refer to the “Post-It System” (#2 [here](http://adampittenger.com/blog/2016/2/28/how-i-reduced-stress-increased-productivity-and-made-myself-happy-again)) if you need help on this. See what your top three priorities are and block out time for them on your calendar.

I can’t tell you how important this is. One great benefit is a feeling of content as you finish your day. Reflecting on things you did and noting things that still need to be done provides a sense of closure. It becomes a ritual of sorts, signaling the day’s end.

A second benefit is that you feel more on top of your life and the important things you need to get done. Everything feels in order. You’re in control. Sure, unexpected challenges may pop up (they will) derailing your priorities — but you’ll be in a better position to handle and quickly adapt to it.

### STEP 2: Stop. Breathe. Visualize.

Once you’ve planned out tomorrow, take a few minutes to visualize what your day will be like. [Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_visualization) is an incredibly powerful technique that is used by the highest performing people in the world. Try it.

Think about yourself waking up. About what your morning looks like. A morning routine is a great thing to have (a little more on mine, #3 [here](http://adampittenger.com/blog/2016/2/28/how-i-reduced-stress-increased-productivity-and-made-myself-happy-again)).

See yourself walking into that office, taking that call, crushing that meeting. Actually watch it happen as if it’s a show on Netflix.

**Go through the entire day. Take a breath. And sign off.**

You’ll go to bed calmer and wake up calmer. You’ll feel more confident and prepared as you start your day. And when that meeting comes up — why be nervous when you’ve already seen yourself crush it? It’s just the next thing on the list. An inevitability.

The day will be less stressful and you, as a result, will be more productive and effective. Getting the shit you need done — and well.

So go. Give it a try. Plan your day at night and report back. See what sort of impact it has on your life.

# What contributes to employee and workplace well-being?

## What contributes to employee and workplace well-being?

*What factors actually make people happy in the workplace?*

In reviewing the literature on the subject, Joseph Sirgy chooses to frame some of the important work conditions that are positively related to work well-being:

***Opportunity for personal control, performance on the job, opportunity for skill use, opportunity for interpersonal contact, supportive and empathic supervision, pay compared to others, valued social position, task clarity, and variety in job tasks, while externally generated goals are generally negatively related to well-being.***

This is a long list, is it perhaps possible to simplify this a bit, to be able to focus on just a few work conditions.

What could be a more general set of important work conditions?

Some research focuses on just three factors that are conducive to well-being in the workplace: *autonomy*, *competence* and *relatedness*.

Autonomy refers to making autonomous decisions and being free of coercion. In work life, a large degree of freedom in deciding how and when to work in order to reach general goals would be desirable.

Competence refers to the experience of performing your work in a satisfactory and effective way, and the absence of the opposite experience.

Relatedness entails interacting with others and related experiences such as feelings of connectedness.

These factors are widely used in many studies so when evaluating different work environments and your own behaviour, it might be useful to focus on these conditions.

An interesting question then is how this compares to the jobs we have or the jobs that we are interested in. Are people focusing on autonomy, competence and relatedness?

Generally, we may not pay enough attention to autonomy and relatedness.

Instead, what one might spend too much time on is societal status. It is true that status in face-to-face groups is important, but that is often not the case with the pursuit of societal status.

So spend less time on this societal status and more time focusing on autonomy and relatedness.

# How to Stick to Something and Not Give Up

## 

How to stick to something and not give up is a concept that is preached in hundreds of personal development seminars. Bookstores are filled with books on this idea of habit formation. Each offering different tools and strategies to forming new habits.

However, have you ever noticed people come up with different ways to develop new habits. This article your reading will introduce a “new” way of implementing habits into your life. What makes this strategy different is the mere fact it’s based on psychology and neuroscience. Willpower has nothing to do with it. As a matter of fact, using will power is almost a sure way to lose because 90% of the population aren’t able to use willpower alone to overcome bad habits.

How to stick to something and not give up is a way for you to transition safely and efficiently into new habits. The motivation will be self-reinforcing, meaning as you continue day by day, you’ll be motivated by the progress and will actually want to continue. You won’t need willpower. You won’t have to force yourself to get up and work on the new habit. This process is so natural and efficient; it’s almost surreal, and as I mentioned in the beginning, it’s close to 100 percent guaranteed. However, there is one caveat, the goal or habit has to be something you really want to change.

**So how can you form any habit you desire?**

The answer is simple baby steps. Yes, the key to developing new habits for a majority of the population is approaching it one step at a time. What do I mean? Science has shown whenever we start a new task or project; new neuronal connections are made in the brain. What happens with most people is they don’t stick with something long enough for the connections in the brain to stay connected. The build a new habit in 21-day myth has plagued our society for decades. Science says something entirely different. For connections in the brain to become active, it could take anywhere from 66 days to 6 months!

There are a few people who can form habits in shorter times such as the 30-day rule, etc… However, the majority of us don’t have that ability. This concept is why this approach to habit formation is so powerful; you’ll be amazed at the results. Below are the steps needed to put this into action:

**1. Select a Habit**

**2. Find a Way To Track Your Habit On a Daily Basis**

**3. Start Very Small(Regardless of whether or not you feel you can do more)**

That’s it! — Let me give a practical example of a recent goal I’ve been able to turn into a habit.

One of the objectives I decided to carry out was that of pushups. I could probably do close to about 20 pushups before I started to struggle. Once I selected a habit, I decided how I was going to track my progress by using an app on my smartphone. The third piece is critical because this is where the action is. What I did was ask myself, what number of pushups do I feel I could do consistently. I decided to start with 15 (even though I knew I could do closer to 20), and I did 15 consistently for about 3 to 4 weeks.

After reviewing my progress through the app, I decided to bump it up to 25 and did this for about another three weeks. Reviewing my progress, I bumped it up again and did that amount for another three or four weeks.

The key point to remember is, regardless of how many you think you can do, you stick with the number you decide. By doing this, you are creating neurons in the brain to make those connections stronger and psychologically, seeing your progress motivates you and you won’t want to miss a day. I remember the day after New Years; I was halfway through my habit formation process, and I was sick as a dog. I could barely move. However, as the day was approaching an end, I realized I hadn’t done my pushups. What did I do? I looked at how consistent I’ve been up to that point and so I rolled out of bed and proceeded to do my push ups.

This process isn’t limited to physical activity. If you want to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Start small, eat one thing healthy every day. Don’t change what you’ve eaten just focus on and make sure you eat one healthy food each day. After a while, you’ll see the progress you’ve made through your tracking system and want to keep going and up the ante. Before you know it, you’ll have adopted a healthy lifestyle without the pressure, without having to use willpower or force.

It’s a natural process anyone can carry out at any time.

How to stick to something and not give up is a reality for each and every person. You reading this article now, have the power to create any habit you desire. It doesn’t have to be complicated, it doesn’t have to be hard and you won’t need willpower as your going through the process!

# Secrets of the “Officially Amazing” World of Guinness World Record Holders

## What you can learn about reaching extreme goals, and how to get your own Guinness World Record

Many of us aspire to be the very best of who we are. But what does it take to actually prove that you’re the best?

Guinness World Records is the iconic judge of record for all sorts of achievements — from the silly to the sublime. The best of them recognize humans who have dedicated at least part of their lives to pushing the known boundaries and excelling in often unusual ways.

The pursuit of a world record can serve several purposes: for some, it’s a marketing opportunity to make people perk up and take notice of their skills. For others, it’s an exercise in confidence building: working to prepare, document, and prove you’re the best — and have it confirmed by a neutral authority.

For the rest of us, studying how high-achievers set world records gives us a new perspective on what it takes to reach our more every-day goals. And, in some cases, you might be inspired to earn your own certificate from Guinness.

The two articles below, both by Guinness World Records holders, explore both sides of this fascinating subject: what you can learn from record holders, and how to become one yourself.

Enjoy!

## [What You Can Learn From People Who Have Broken World Records](https://betterhumans.coach.me/what-you-can-learn-from-people-who-have-broken-world-records-ea0d126cc829)

### Based on interviews with real Guinness world record-holders.

In January of 2014, I set a new Guinness world record for the most number of Aztec push-ups completed in one minute. In the process of setting this record, I learned a lot about the kind of people who set world records.

I started a podcast called *Record Breaking* and interviewed nearly a dozen world-record setters.

Here are the three key patterns I noticed from these individuals, and how you can use their strategies to achieve higher performance for yourself. [***Read more.](https://betterhumans.coach.me/what-you-can-learn-from-people-who-have-broken-world-records-ea0d126cc829)***

## [The Complete Guide to Getting Your Own Guinness World Record](https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-complete-guide-to-getting-your-own-guinness-world-record-a02447cbd016)

### Setting a world record takes skill and effort. Getting your record officially certified by Guinness takes planning. Here’s how to make sure your achievement makes it in the record books

My earliest memory of *Guinness World Records* is from a book I checked out of the elementary school library. I didn’t really think of it again until after I completed my first marathon. Someone pointed out that there was a Guinness World Record for heaviest person to complete a marathon — which was held by a man. I contacted Guinness to see if it was possible to divide the category into male and female. (They do not, as yet, have a category for transgender/non-binary, but I would absolutely support anyone who wanted to ask for one.) They agreed to do so, but told me that I couldn’t get the record retroactively: I had to apply in advance.

And that’s the story of how I came to be a *two-time* marathoner and set the Guinness World Record for Heaviest Woman to Complete a Marathon.

I learned a lot about completing marathons *and *a lot about setting Guinness Records. Since setting the record, a number of people have asked me for help. It’s a tricky, detail-oriented process. Missing details can mean failing to get the record, even if you succeed at the attempt. This guide is designed to help you make sure you get all those details covered.

# This is How to Figure Out What to Do With Your Life

## This is How to Figure Out What to Do With Your Life

A reader recently reached out to me and asked:
> *Hi Patrik,*
> *It would be identifying my own passion. How do I figure out what is that thing that would really make my life meaningful or pursuing that gives me a sense of fulfillment? I would really like to hear your views or personal experience on that subject.*
> *Thanks,
Goutham*

This is an important question that a lot of people struggle with, so I thought I’d share my thoughts in this article.

### The Passion Hypothesis

In his excellent book, “So Good They Can’t Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love” (1), author Cal Newport explains what he calls “The Passion Hypothesis”:
> *(…) to refer to the popular belief that the way to end up loving your career is to first figure out what you’re passionate about, and then pursue it (a strategy often summarized with the pithy phrase, “follow your passion.”)*
> *The more I studied this hypothesis, the more I noticed its danger. This idea convinces people that there’s a magic “right” job waiting for them, and that if they find it, they’ll immediately recognize that this is the work they were meant to do.*
> *The problem, of course, is when they fail to find this certainty, bad things follow, such as chronic job-hopping and crippling self-doubt.*

If you’ve been stuck looking for your passion a long time, you can probably relate to all the confusion, overwhelm, and frustration it brings with it. But if the passion hypothesis isn’t helpful, what are you supposed to do instead?

Newport suggests you forget about finding your passion and instead start working on becoming **so good they can’t ignore you**.

### The Craftsman Mindset

Instead of relying on the passion hypothesis, you should develop a “craftsman mindset”. Newport writes:
> *In a 2007 episode of the Charlie Rose show, Rose was interviewing the actor and comedian Steve Martin about his memoir Born Standing Up (2). They talked about the realities of Martin’s rise. In the last five minutes of the interview, Rose asks Martin his advice for aspiring performers.*
> *“Nobody ever takes note of [my advice], because it’s not the answer they wanted to hear,” Martin said. “What they want to hear is ‘Here’s how you get an agent, here’s how you write a script,’ . . . but I always say, ‘Be so good they can’t ignore you.’ ”*
> *In response to Rose’s trademark ambiguous grunt, Martin defended his advice: “If somebody’s thinking, ‘How can I be really good?’ people are going to come to you.”*
> *This is exactly the philosophy that catapulted Martin into stardom. He was only twenty years old when he decided to innovate his act into something too good to be ignored.*
> *“Comedy at the time was all setup and punch line . . . the clichéd nightclub comedian, rat-a-tat-tat,” Martin explained to Rose. He thought it could be something more sophisticated. It took Martin, by his own estimation, ten years for his new act to cohere, but when it did, he became a monster success. (…)*
> *If you’re not focusing on becoming so good they can’t ignore you, you’re going to be left behind. This clarity is refreshing. It tells you to stop worrying about what your job offers you, and instead worry about what you’re offering the world.*
> *This mindset–which I call the craftsman mindset-allows you to sidestep the anxious questions generated by the passion hypothesis — ”Who am I?”, “What do I truly love?” — and instead put your head down and focus on becoming valuable. (1)*

### The Passion Hypothesis vs. The Craftsman Mindset

I love this piece of advice because it aligns perfectly with my experience.

Whenever I’ve tried to think my way to my passion, I’ve always ended up stuck and confused. The times I’ve made progress is when I’ve focused in on one thing and developed enough expertise that people naturally wanted my help.

And ironically, this is where passion has shown up. Because when you get so good at something that you are making a difference in people’s lives, you can’t help but feel it.

So, don’t worry about how to find your passion. Instead, focus on becoming so good they can’t ignore you.

In other words, **don’t ask what the world can do for you, but what you can do for the world.** This way, you’ll be in a much more empowered position to find meaningful work.

### How to Get Started

At this point, you may be thinking something like “OK, I get it. That all sounds good. But I still don’t have a clue where to get started! I mean, WHAT should I get so good at that they can’t ignore me?!”

So, let’s have a look at how you can set yourself up in the best way possible to offer your unique strengths to the world.

The most useful advice I’ve come across for doing this comes from the book “Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap… and Others Don’t” (3). In it, the author, Jim Collins, describes a framework called:

### The Hedgehog Concept

This concept is based on an ancient Greek parable that states: “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.”

In the parable, the fox tries every strategy it can think of to catch the hedgehog. But no matter how much sneaking, pouncing, racing, and playing dead it tries, the result is always the same. The hedgehog curls up into a ball, and the fox gets his nose full of spines.

The moral of the story is that it’s much more powerful to know how to do one thing perfectly, than doing a lot of things decently.

You can find your hedgehog, your ONE thing, by making three separate assessments:

1. What you like to do.

1. What you’re good at.

1. What the world will pay you for.

Your hedgehog sits pretty where all these areas overlap:

![](0*Ufo4-ti2uh6w5rEp.jpg)

Let’s take a look at each of these areas separately:

### What Your Interests Are

According to Collins, if you are going to do great work, you need to have a passion for it. In this article, I’ve toned the first circle down from passions to interests to help you avoid overwhelm. In my opinion, an interest is enough since it can blossom into a passion if you get really, really good at it.

To figure out what belongs in this circle, you can ask yourself questions like:

* What did I spend time doing as a kid?

* What activities absorbs me so much that I forget to eat and sleep?

* If money wasn’t an issue, what would I spend my time doing?

### What You’re Good At

Next, you need to consider what strengths and skills you currently possess. This can be a bit tricky since they’re usually so natural to you that you don’t even consider it a strength or skill. Here are some helpful exercises:

* Take a personality test. For example, the [Myers-Briggs](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) or [Big Five](http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/).

* Take a character strengths test. For example, [the VIA survey](https://www.viacharacter.org/www/Character-Strengths-Survey).

* E-mail the people closest to you. Ask them what they consider your biggest strengths and skills to be, and why.

* Ask yourself what people tend to ask you for advice about.

### What the World Will Pay You For

Finally, you need to combine what you love to do, and what you’re good at with the needs of the world. Ask yourself:

* How can my unique interests and strengths can be used in the marketplace?

* What jobs does best match my interests and strengths?

* What problems can I solve that people are willing to pay for?

### Finding Your Hedgehog

Note that having only two of the areas overlapping is a problem:

* If you combine interests and skills, but there’s no demand what you have is most likely a hobby.

* If you combine interests and demand but have no matching skills or strengths, it’ll probably be hard to get so good they can’t ignore you.

* If you combine skills and demand but have no interest, you’ll probably end up with a job you don’t like and risk getting burned out.

Finding your hedgehog usually requires some pretty hard work and deep reflection. But when you find it, you have a very powerful position to start working on getting so good that they can’t ignore you.

And when you do that, when you start to [work consistently](http://www.selfication.com/consistency/) toward [getting better at what you do every day](http://www.selfication.com/get-better-at-what-you-do/), it’s only a matter of time before you find meaningful and fulfilling work.

And that’s a pretty damn beautiful place to be.

### How to Figure Out What to Do With Your Life, In Summary:

* The Passion Hypothesis (find your passion and pursue it) is flawed advice that leads to overwhelm, confusion, and frustration.

* The Craftsman Mindset (get so good they can’t ignore you) helps you sidestep these obstacles by focusing on becoming valuable.

* Therefore: Don’t ask yourself what the world can do for you. Ask yourself what you can do for the world.

* The Hedgehog Concept can help you figure out the ONE thing you should offer to the world.

* Your hedgehog lives where your interests and skills overlap with what the world is willing to pay for.

If this article has got you thinking, it’s time to get out your [journal](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-write-a-journal/) and get to work. The world is waiting for you to offer your unique strengths to it. How will you become so good we can’t ignore you?

# For the Girl Who Can’t

## 

I checked into the Emergency Room for the girl who couldn’t walk through the door. With shaking hands I pulled the expired ID from my wallet, while she stays, shaking and alone, in darkness. I listened for the S.A.N.E. request, corrected my date of birth when the nurse couldn’t read the out-of-state ID, and attempted to return a sympathetic smile before sitting in the waiting room.

I started crying for the girl that can’t stop. Tears run down my cheeks as the blood pressure cuff tightens. My temperature was 96.7, but I couldn’t stop shivering. My heart rate was 80 BPM, although I warned the nurse the beating would stop at any second.

I accepted a hug from the Victim’s Advocate on behalf of the girl who will never be offered one. I nodded at the appropriate times, like when the words “strength” and “safe” and “proud” were wrapped around me. I held the S.A.N.E. nurse’s hand when she extended it in my direction. I squeezed her tighter when she explained I will be their guest for at least five hours.

It was then that I became jealous of the girl in the dark.

I stripped in front of the nurse for the girl huddled in her shower. As she rocked back and forth, I stood on butcher paper and peeled my protection off; piece by piece. My shirt was wrapped in plastic, then labeled, then gone. My pants fell next, then quickly wrapped, then placed in a paper bag. My underwear was last, with remnants of him still visible.

I stood naked, in front of strangers, for the girl still trying to find her legs. The shivering doubled, my heart rate increased, and my skin resented the hospital gown it was offered.

I shook the officer’s hand for the girl who’ll never meet him. I tried to concentrate on his explanations, to remember the important information he was offering, and to smile slightly when he told me the chances were good. I took his card, underlined his personal phone number, and thanked him for offering his assistance at any hour of any day. I secretly hoped I’d never see him again.

I pulled twelve hairs from my head for the girl whose cries for help were not answered. I struggled to place them in the small white envelope and wondered who’d decided on the number twelve.

I swabbed my throat and mouth with cotton four times for the girl who can’t get rid of the taste. I coughed when I was asked to swab my tonsils, my lips quivering. I was more than thankful for the bottle of water that quickly followed.

I showed the scratches and bruises to the forensic photographer, for the girl hiding hers. I stopped him twice, holding my face with my uneasy hands, when the click of his camera and lights from his flash became too overwhelming. I stared at his kind eyes through a tear-stained window as he told me to take my time. My hands, my neck, my arms, my back, my breasts, my pelvis, and my legs were all on file. My pieces categorized. My body, now evidence.

I put my feet in the stirrups for the girl huddled under her covers at home. I stared at the ceiling, hands clenched and body tense, as uncomfortable plastic tried to uncover traces of him inside of me. I tried to relax when asked to, tried to breath when the pain hit, and tried to fast forward when it all seemed to go by so slowly. I wondered why they needed to look inside me, when the signs of trauma were written on my face.

I told my story eight times, for the girl who can’t tell hers. Three officers, a Victim’s Advocate, two lawyers, a S.A.N.E. nurse, and a District Attorney now know me better than my closest friends or family. Each head tilt and touch of my shoulder made me feel helpless. Each determined head nod and promise of justice left me exhausted.

I thanked the friends who were by my side for the girl who feels alone. I wouldn’t, I couldn’t, have survived without them.

I hugged each one of them for the girl who’d never have their equivalent. I held their hands for the girl who can only hold her own.

I came forward for the girl who never will.

Because I am that girl, shaking and alone in darkness. That girl who can’t stop crying. That girl huddled in the shower, trying to find her legs. That girl who’ll never meet a police officer, who’s cries for help weren’t answered, and who can’t get rid of the taste. That girl hiding her bruises, huddled under covers at home, unable to tell her story.

I am that girl who feels alone.

# Depth vs Speed

## Depth vs Speed

It’s a lie that you have no time for depth, because speed is all that matters.

You believe it because speed is addictive, and easy to measure: clicks, users, impressions, followers, revenue.

The value of depth is immeasurable, and ignoring this is the fastest way to burn through your time, your money, your life.

It’s hard to remember how to go deep when you only measure velocity, when acceleration is your obsession and priority.

To access depth you need presence, stillness, space and time away from the noise and distractions you love / hate so much.

Depth is core. Depth is foundation. Depth is deep inner drive and purpose. Depth is “why” and all the whys beneath the first answer.

All the things that pull the strings are rooted deep within — the fears and desires and longings that you’ve never really taken the time to get to know or put words to.

Assumptions and beliefs live deep, and they like it because it means you almost never pause to get to know or question them.

You might even be afraid of depth. You might be afraid of stillness and presence.

Consider the efforts you go to avoid them, and all of the reasons.

Your mind has all the reasons why you have no time for depth, for stillness, for rest, for presence.

It isn’t true.

The truth is that it’s a choice you make.

# How to Know You’re Delivering Value

## How to Know You’re Delivering Value

### “Status symbols” should only come (if at all) as a semi-accidental byproduct of doing work that blows people’s socks off.

“All status symbols are tiny things. LIFE is a big thing. I stay focused on the big things. The big thing in life is to focus on providing more value to people than they expect. The rest comes then.” — James Altucher

The first time I was ever mentioned in a newspaper, it felt like I was famous. A taste of fame, as they say. I was a celebrity in my own mind for a split second. The result of this “fame” was a momentary ego-boost, a quick rise in my sense of self-worth, self-esteem, self-importance. I felt, thanks to the validation from some local media outlet, like I was *valuable.*

What’s funny is that now (a decade or so later) not only do I not remember the newspaper, but I don’t even remember what the article was about. Clearly whatever it was highlighting must not have been as valuable as being in the press made me feel it was at the time, or else I’d remember more about it.

I just finished Marc Ecko’s book, *Unlabel: Sell Yourself without Selling Out*, in which fashion mogul Marc Ecko describes his experiences with what he calls “gatekeepers” and “goalkeepers.” Most people obsess over gatekeepers: press, critics, peers, handlers, agents, and haters. They let the gatekeepers’ irrelevant opinions of their work obstruct their path, rather than focusing on the opinions that matter, those of the goalkeepers. The goalkeepers are the ones who actually determine your success—they’re the customers, the users, the beneficiaries, the readers, the viewers, the listeners. The goalkeepers—not the gatekeepers—are the ones who actually tell you what you’re doing is valuable. And they don’t even need to tell you with words—they tell you with their actions, by buying your products, using your apps, and engaging with your content. They’re the ones you aim to please, not the gatekeepers.

But for whatever reason, we keep externalizing our sense of self-worth to the gatekeepers. We’re validation-addicts looking for a fix, and the best fixes seem to come from gatekeepers we secretly want to impress. It takes practice to mute the gatekeepers and amplify the goalkeepers. It takes practice to tune out the noise and focus on what matters.

For gatekeepers who aren’t engaged with your product, it’s easy to make remarks because their skin and soul aren’t in the game with you. They’re not in the arena, marred by dust and sweat and blood. They’re just making comments in passing — they’re not even connected. They’ll forget what they said in a few weeks, whether it was good or whether it was bad. But you won’t. So why don’t you? Why can’t you tell your ego to stop salivating and acknowledge that your addiction is distracting you from what matters: delivering value to the people you care about.

Since that first media mention a decade ago, my relationship to the media has only grown. In fact, being in the media all the time is now part of my job. If I were to freak out every time my work is mentioned in the news I’d be in some kind of rehab. So instead, I now view media (all of it: social media likes and follows, paid outlets, major papers and stations) as a tool to serve the goalkeepers. It helps our organization spread awareness about a cause that matters to me, and it’s a skill I get to practice just like any other skill (coding, sales, accounting, cello, boxing, etc.). And there’s nothing more fulfilling than driving outcomes and adding value for people you care about while improving at a challenging craft.

So forget the gatekeepers, focus on adding value for the goalkeepers, and enjoy the ride. “Status symbols” should only come (if at all) as a semi-accidental byproduct of doing work that blows people’s socks off.

# An Outside-the-Box Time Management Technique

## An Outside-the-Box Time Management Technique

One of my readers suggested I write a post about time management techniques. This is interesting because I actually have some opinions on the matter. But they are a little outside the box.

## How do I manage my time?

To be honest, I don’t.

But wait, that’s not *entirely* true. I do use the [calendar app Sunrise](https://calendar.sunrise.am/) to schedule my appointments, but that’s about it! I rely on my digital calendar a lot actually. But I don’t like the idea of “managing” time.

I’m the kind of person that is a little aloof. When someone asks me what my plans are today, I usually have a hard time remembering. If you ask me what I had for dinner last night, I also need to rack my brain, look a little up and to the left into the air to try to find the answer. This is slightly embarrassing I know.

I’ve tried managing my time and sometimes I’m good at it for a while. Remember, I [woke up early for a year](http://makermistaker.com/wake-up-early-one-year-later/) and had a [pretty ridiculous morning routine](http://makermistaker.com/morning-routine-schedule-2015/). I had about two hours before I had to leave for work where I managed to fit in meditation, reading, yoga, journaling, and a few YouTube videos and podcasts. I started each day by doing a bunch of stuff I wanted. The rest of the day was more in reaction to other people’s priorities (work, family, friends, etc). This was how I managed my time.

## Time is Becoming More Irrelevant

As a freelancer with no “workplace” to be each morning, I can wake up whenever I want. I’ve experimented with waking up at different times using different alarm apps (Sleep Cycle, Fitbit, etc) or techniques. **I have recently been waking up naturally.** I quite like this because it helps me realize that time is actually irrelevant. I wake up and get out of bed when I feel rested. Or when I don’t feel like being in bed. Not when the time says I should. The sun shining through the windows gives me a good estimate of what time it is. **Time is just an illusion,** and the idea of *managing time* just seems silly to me.

**What do we typically feel when we look at a clock?**

* Shit, I’m gonna be late

* Ugh, I wish I had more time!

* Whew, I still have some time left

* Come on, will it ever be time to leave?

* OMG, where did the time go!

All of those reactions are based on this idea that time is a scarce resource that must be properly managed. What’s the number one excuse people have for not doing something? “I don’t have enough time.” We look at our life as a ticking clock and if we don’t get a handle on it, the sand will sift through the hourglass and we’ll be dead. We will sit on our death-bed and regretfully wish we had not worked so hard and lived more in the moment.

![](0*W4DBykVotoIvKAhC.gif)

If you ask me, I’d rather live in the present moment and be completely unaware of the time. To go with the flow! Instead of managing time, I like to manage my energy.

## Managing Energy not Time

I don’t really like the word “managing” but I’ll use it for lack of a better term. As I move more toward living in the present, time sort of fades to the background. What’s more important to me is *how I feel.* What am I inspired and motivated to do? What decisions to I need to make right now? I’ve woken up, now what?

The idea of having to work a set number of hours per day is ridiculous to me. As a newly self-employed freelancer, it’s taken me awhile to get over the guilt of not putting in 8 hours of work. Or 40 hours in a week. Those are old-world paradigms that directly relate time to profits. That no longer resonates with me, so I’m trying something different.

Sometimes we don’t feel like working and it takes a ton of willpower to sit at our desks. Sometimes we can work for hours and hours and well into the night. Time flies by when we’re in the zone. We are in a state of flow and time is irrelevant. On the flip side, time seems to crawl when we’re bored or doing something we don’t want to do.

## Time is a Social Agreement

Time is a social agreement to help people coordinate plans. It is great for setting appointments and creating a sense of predictability and routine in your life. For my coaching clients, I allow them to schedule appointments with me through [Calendly](http://calendly.com/).

**Manage time to the extent that it helps you enjoy your life** and make time for things you want to do. I noticed that when I put something on the calendar, it’s more likely to get done! When I have an appointment, it also helps give a little bit of pressure and limitation to finish a task I’m working on. Knowing I need to be somewhere at 4:00 PM helps me a lot by giving me a container to work within. While I love days where nothing is scheduled, I do like a little structure.

I tried making an [ultra schedule like Jessica Hische](http://jessicahische.is/thinkingthoughtsonscheduling), but I failed and ended up ignoring everything and doing what I wanted to do instead. The idea of stopping when I’m in the zone, or starting when I don’t want to felt unnatural. But I get how it works for some people. Again, it’s a nice structure to fall back on, but always make room for spontaneity.

My friend Elz [wrote a beautiful post about time](http://livingdiscernment.org/2015/01/20/does-anybody-really-know-what-time-it-is/). She talks about “time tyranny” how we are ruled by the clock. In a wonderful shift of language she says,
> “I’ve begun replacing thoughts and expressions of ‘time’ with ‘windows of opportunity.’ Not all windows of opportunity are open, such as those we reserve for sleep, and other set commitments, such as defined work/job hours, but for the rest, try it on…a friend or colleague asks you for coffee or to help with a project/event…do you say, ‘Yes, I have a window of opportunity for that’ or ‘No, I haven’t a window of opportunity for that.’ How does it feel compared to ‘Yes, I have time’ or ‘No, I haven’t time…?’”

Think about that!

## My number one tip for managing time:
> # **Don’t manage time. Be present.**

In the words of the great [Ram Dass](https://www.ramdass.org/), “Be here now.”

But I understand this isn’t always easy or appropriate. Instead of worrying about managing your time, work on increasing your awareness or mindfulness. Notice and observe your feelings, thoughts, and energy levels. What do you feel like doing? Do it. Do you need a nap? Take one. Are you procrastinating and avoiding the work you have to do, take note. Use this as an opportunity for greater self awareness. Some people work better with tight schedules. Some better with none at all!

I’m a mix. I like to schedule my commitments to others and I also like recurring events that I rely on each week like guitar lessons, volleyball games, or coaching calls. It adds an element of predictability and routine. From there I can be free to flow in the moment. Knowing that I have my calendar to fall back on and remind me when I need it to. A little bit of structure helps me feel less stressed.
> # Nature doesn’t give a shit that it’s 1:00 PM on a Saturday. It just does it’s thing.

So do your thing!

## Other tips:

* If you want to really get something done, put it on your calendar

* Use an cloud-based calendar app like Sunrise that syncs with all your devices

* Don’t “manage” time, but work on your mindfulness and increasing awareness.

* Manage energy not time, follow inspiration and curiosity, go with the flow.

* Pay attention to your body signals, thoughts, and feelings as a guide.

* Work when you are inspired and motivated, not when you’re “supposed to” (within reason)

* Use time to coordinate social agreements.

* Set a time to “turn off” your “work-mode” — so you can relax with friends and family

* Use time to add predictability and routine, but not too much.

* Don’t be such a slave to the clock. You are the boss!

* Thinking about the past or future too much can lead to needless suffering.

* Be present. Put your attention to the here and now.

* Stop worrying about not having enough time.

* Think of time as “windows of opportunity.”

* Try waking up without an alarm clock for awhile.

* Try living more like nature does!

# The One Habit You Need To Power Up Your New Year

## 

I bet you’ve got a list of new year’s resolutions as long as your arm. A host of great habits you’d like to put in place over the coming months. But what if I told you there’s ONE habit on your list that will make all the others possible?

*This is your Keystone Habit.*

The Keystone Habit is the one habit that you can set up in 2017 that will underpin all your other good intentions.

Charles Duhigg coined this name in his book The Power of Habit: **Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business**.

Duhigg’s idea is that when you establish a Keystone Habit, it has a knock-on effect on all your other habits.
> # “Keystone habits start a process that, over time, transforms everything.”
> # Charles Duhigg

My Keystone Habit is regular journalling. When I write my journal daily — even if it’s just to quickly outline what I hope to achieve that day — I’m WAY more productive.

I focus much more on the really important stuff and less on ticking items off my to do list or clocking hours.

I identify potential roadblocks much more quickly, instead of ending up in the mire and wondering how I got there.

I’m less likely to mentally ‘dodge’ the issues that I need to wrangle with; and more likely to keep up good habits.

*So what’s your keystone habit for 2017?*

What’s the ONE habit that when you do it helps you achieve a multitude of other things in your life?

It might be journalling for you as well. But there are many other powerful Keystone Habits such as:

* Meditation

* Regular exercise

* Getting up early

* Eating healthily

Committing to any one of these habits will have a profound effect on your well-being and ability to perform effectively.

If you’re not sure which of your new year’s resolutions might be your Keystone Habit, look at each new habit in turn. Now ask yourself which one has the following 3 characteristics:

* it gives you repeated small wins

* it creates a healthy environment from which other habits can grow

* it gives you energy and confidence to do more

Decided? Now get free accountability by joining an existing habit (or creating a new one) on [Coach.me](https://www.coach.me/?ref=rna7K).

Or for uber-accountability, hire an [accountability coach](https://www.coach.me/plans/332087-accountability-coaching?ref=rna7K)!

# This is How to Stick to Your Habits, Backed by Research

## This is How to Stick to Your Habits, Backed by Research

I recently published an article about [how to stop sucking at your habits](http://www.selfication.com/stop-sucking-at-your-habits/).

In short, it explained how relying too much on your initial plan for your habit is a big mistake.

I got some great feedback on that article and it seems like a lot of people can relate to the problem.

One of the readers who got back to me was Sarah.

She wanted my next article to be about specific ways to tweak your plan to make it easier to stick to your habits.

A great idea! Let’s begin with…

## An Analogy of the Mind

Psychologists tell us that there are two systems in our brains — the *rational* system and the *emotional* system.

In his awesome book, *The Happiness Hypothesis (*1), author Jonathan Haidt explains that you can think about these systems as a human rider on top of an elephant.

The rider represents the prefrontal cortex of the brain. This is the rational part of us that plans and problem-solves. The rider is the one making the decisions about where we want to go.

The elephant represents the older parts deep inside the human brain, such as the amygdala. This is emotional side of us. The elephant provides the power for our journey.

Authors Dan and Chip Heath later elaborated on this model in their book, *Switch: How to Change When Change is Hard *(2). They added a third component to the model which represents the path that the elephant and the rider are traveling. This can be thought of as an environmental part of the analogy.

## The Rider, The Elephant & The Path

With all these components in place the complete picture looks something like this:

![](0*GXvRpakHMDu2iQFL.jpg)

It should be fairly obvious to us what the problem is here. If this huge elephant has a different opinion than the tiny rider about where to go, guess who’s going to get to decide?

The rider can try to convince (or push) the elephant all he wants but in the end it’s the elephant who is going to choose where they go.

This is a big part of why it’s so hard to adopt new habits. We can try to rationalize our way into a particular behavior, but it’s useless if the emotional side of us doesn’t agree.

Another common issue is the path. If the rider and the elephant are going to get your desired destination, you can’t have a bunch of distractions along the road they’re traveling. You need to clear their path.

But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s look at all these components individually.

## The Rider

The rider may be small compared to the elephant, but he’s pretty damn awesome at planning the route — IF he’s been given a good map to work with.

Most of us give the rider very vague instructions. If you want your rider to lead your elephant effectively, statements like “*I’ll exercise sometime this week*,” “*I’ll call mom when I get a chance*,” or “*I’ll start eating healthy soon*” won’t cut it.

The rider wants *specific* and *measurable* targets:

* “*I’ll exercise at 6 pm on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at the gym.*“

* “*I’ll call mom from home on Saturday after breakfast.*“

* “*I’ll add one vegetable to each dinner this week.*“

In other words, you need to mark down a big fat red X at the exact spot on the map where you want the rider to lead the elephant.

Two effective strategies for doing this are [scheduling](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-start-a-new-habit/) and [implementation intentions](http://www.selfication.com/easily-improve-your-life/).

## The Elephant

The elephant doesn’t care much for rational planning. He does what he *feels* like doing. So, what you need to do is provide the elephant with enough motivation to take the rider in the right direction.

Here are some practical strategies for motivating your elephant:

* **Start ridiculously small.** Let your elephant experience a sense of competence and accomplishment by taking [tiny steps in the right direction](http://www.selfication.com/get-started-with-a-new-habit/).

* **Celebrate small wins.** Each time your elephant moves in the right direction, [give it an immediate reward](http://www.selfication.com/the-power-of-small-wins/).

* **Create immediate consequences.** If your elephant refuses to move, use a stick in the form of a [commitment device](http://www.selfication.com/stick-to-your-goals/).

* **Use accountability.** [Get a coach](http://www.selfication.com/coaching/) or an [accountability partner](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-use-accountability/). The elephant will be more motivated if someone else is watching it.

* **Track your progress.** Get your elephant [hooked on progress](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-reach-your-goals/) by measuring how many days in a row you’ve completed your habit.

## The Path

The path represents the physical environment where the habit takes place. For the rider and elephant to travel smoothly, you need to:

**Make the desired path as easy as possible.**
Ask yourself how you can alter your environment to make your habit as effortless as possible. You want your elephant to [stick to your desired path by default](http://www.selfication.com/realize-your-full-potential/).

For example, if you want to [read more books](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-read-more-books/), make sure to always have a great book right next to your living room couch.

**Make undesired path as hard as possible.**
The elephant is going to be tempted to stray off course onto alternative paths along the way. Especially if they contain some sort of immediate gratification. To avoid this, you need to make these roads as unappealing as possible.

If your elephant typically prefers watching TV instead of reading the book, then put the TV remote in another room. Make the undesired path uncomfortable enough that the elephant stays on the right track.

## How to Stick to Your Habits, In Summary

* **“The Rider, The Elephant, and The Path”** is a very useful analogy in behavior change.

* **The Rider** represents the *rational* part of your mind that *plans* the journey. He needs **specific** and **measurable** targets to guide the elephant. This can be done by using [scheduling](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-start-a-new-habit/) or [implementation intentions](http://www.selfication.com/easily-improve-your-life/).

* **The Elephant** represents the *emotional* part of your mind that provides the *power* for the journey. He needs to be motivated to go in the right direction. This can be done by [starting small](http://www.selfication.com/get-started-with-a-new-habit/), [celebrating small wins](http://www.selfication.com/the-power-of-small-wins/), [creating immediate consequences](http://www.selfication.com/stick-to-your-goals/), [using accountability](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-use-accountability/), and [tracking your progress](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-reach-your-goals/).

* **The Path** represents your *environment*. To travel effortlessly, the rider and elephant need **the desired path to be as easy as possible**, and **undesired paths to be as hard as possible**.

Improve your map. Motivate your elephant. Clear the path. Then get moving. And whenever you get stuck, simply repeat and refine these steps until the rider and the elephant reach their destination.

# What’s Preventing You From Unlimited Possibilities?

## Photo by Christian Sterk on Unsplash

This is one of my favorite scenes from the movie Fight Club.

The back door opens and Tyler brings the store’s CLERK out at gunpoint, forces him to his knees. Jack follows, freaked. Tyler points the gun at the Clerk.

JACK (Voice Over): On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

```
**CLERK**

Please… don’t…

TYLER

Give me your wallet.
```


The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler snatches it. Tyler pulls out the driver’s license.

```
**TYLER**

Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning,

apartment A. A small, cramped

basement apartment.

RAYMOND

How’d you know?

TYLER

They give basement apartments letters

instead of numbers. Raymond, you’re

going to die.
```


Tyler rummages through the wallet.

```
**TYLER**

Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?

RAYMOND

Yesssss…

TYLER

Your mom and dad will have to call

kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up

your dental records, because there

won’t be much left of your face.

RAYMOND

Please, God, no…
```


Raymond begins to weep, shoulders heaving.

```
**JACK**

Tyler…

TYLER

An expired community college student

ID card. What did you use to study,

Raymond K. Hessel?

RAYMOND

S-S-Stuff.

TYLER

“Stuff.” Were the mid-terms hard?

Tyler rams the gun barrel against Raymond’s temple.

TYLER

I asked you what you studied.

JACK

Tell him!

RAYMOND

Biology, mostly.

TYLER

Why?

RAYMOND

I… I don’t know…

TYLER

What did you want to be, Raymond?
```


Raymond weeps and says nothing. Tyler cocks the gun.

Raymond gasps.

```
**TYLER**

The question, Raymond, was “what did

you want to be?”

JACK

Answer him!

RAYMOND

A veterinarian!

TYLER

Animals.

RAYMOND

Yeah … animals and…

TYLER

Stuff. That means you have to get

more schooling.

RAYMOND

Too much school.
```


Tyler shoves Raymond’s wallet back into Raymond’s pocket.

```
**TYLER**

Would you rather be dead?

RAYMOND

No, please, no, God, no!
```


Tyler moves the gun right between Raymond’s eyes.

```
**RAYMOND**

NOOOOO!
```


Tyler uncocks the gun…lowers it.

```
**TYLER**

I’m keeping your license. I know where you live. I’m going to check on you. If you aren’t back in school and on your way to being a veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead. Get the hell out of here.
```


Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway. Jack and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.

```
**JACK**

I feel sick.

TYLER

Imagine how he feels.

Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger — 
```


CLICK. Empty.

```
**JACK**

I don’t care, that was horrible.

Tyler walks away.

TYLER

Tomorrow will be the most beautiful

day of Raymond K. Hessell’s life.
```


Jack watches Tyler go.

```
**TYLER**

His breakfast will taste better than

any meal he has ever eaten.
```


Live the life you are supposed to live or someone will snatch it from you.

But wait a minute, do you really need someone to snatch your life?

Because for one reason or another, if you are not pursuing your most cherished dream then you are not doing a very bad job of [snatching your own life.](https://theascent.pub/5-cool-methods-to-ditch-your-autopilot-life-38d638ee967c)

## Fear

Do you know, every single fear ultimately derives its energy from the fear of death?

And we all are equally afraid of death and life because we are equally ignorant of both — what an irony?

The fear of its various manifestation is so pervasive that we are often mistaking it as an essential and inevitable ingredient of our daily life.

However, if you choose to show some spine and dare to stare right back at the death — most of your fear would just vanish — because you would no longer be interested in subscribing to the exaggerated version of it.

## Illusion of Simplicity

There is no denying that we are here but wouldn't be here for long — circumscribed by the limitation of time. Then does it make sense living a life where we act like mortals in all that we fear and act like immortals in all that we desire?

And as far as fulfilling desire is concerned, we are willing to do anything —including oversimplification of life.

In the name of simplicity, we often end up constructing an image of ourselves that looks more like a caricature — absurdly oversimplified, too optimistic, and devoid of any contradictions. The inherent complexity of life is conveniently pushed under the carpet.

## Uncertainty

The fact of the matter remains — Life will happen to us irrespective of the fact whether we have planned for it in detail or not.

But that shouldn't prevent us from having our own set of goals.

The very uncertainty associated with life in general and our goals, in particular, makes the whole journey of life quite an interesting adventure — whether you are stressed about it is entirely your choice.

If possible beware of certainty and be willing to befriend doubt. You are capable of changing anything as long as there is no hesitation in changing your mind.

There is no doubt that life will keep throwing distinct color at your canvas which might be completely different from what you thought you may need for the [making of your masterpiece](https://theascent.pub/you-are-a-masterpiece-in-making-4628c17943ce). And it shouldn't discourage you because ultimately i[t’s your mindset that shapes your future and fulfills your potential.](https://mystudentvoices.com/how-our-mindset-shapes-our-future-and-fulfills-our-potential-c2f2c293691)

## Efforts & Direction

For a vast majority of the population having no goal is the norm where they are conditioned to merely accept the goals which are currently in fashion.

However, the path to a good life means setting achievable goals and actually translating them into reality. Once you bring more awareness to your presence, you will soon realize that there can be no good life without your own set of personal goals and dreams.

But mind you —[ the path of transformation](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/the-path-of-transformation-8a93d2d233a) leading to your dream is something very singular to you. If you happen to harbor a dream that is a borrowed one — rest assured that it will never be able to give you a sense of fulfillment — irrespective of the magnitude of your success.

Seneca — a Roman Stoic Philosopher — figured that out some two thousand years ago: **“Let all your efforts be directed to something, let it keep that end in mind.”**

Therefore, there is no dispute that Life goals are massively important and should be an integral part of your growth journey.

## An Example

Researchers in the USA surveyed seventeen-and eighteen-year-old students about the importance of financial success. Many years later they surveyed the same people about their actual income, and about how happy they were with their lives in general.

**The first result**: The greater people’s financial ambitions in their younger years, the more they earned by middle age. Turns out goals work! And it only came as a surprise to the psychologists, who had believed for a very long time that people merely reacted to external stimuli, like Pavlov’s dogs.

**The second result:** All the students who had set their sights on a high-income job after finishing their education — and who had achieved that goal — tended to be deeply satisfied with their lives. By contrast, those for whom money was important but who had failed to achieve their financial goals were deeply unsatisfied. Sure, you may be thinking — Money makes you happy. But that’s not the case because a higher income had no effect on the satisfaction of people for whom wealth was not a life goal.

**It’s not money that makes you happy or unhappy, it’s whether or not you realize your ambitions.**

## Choices & Constraints

Therefore our life is nothing but a result of all the choices that we make. And we are not very good at making decisions — especially when we are spoiled for choices.

Do you know that having more options not only make it more difficult to choose well, but it also robs us of the satisfaction we eventually get from our choice?

So, whenever we have to make decisions involving opportunity costs, we’ll feel less satisfied with our choice than we would if the alternatives were unknown to us.

[The paradox of choices](https://studentlifemadeeasy.com/why-more-choices-doesnt-mean-more-happiness/) will make sure that you remain unsatisfied even after making an extensive and well-researched choice decision.

## The Way

If you can allow your intellect not to get corrupted by **biased beliefs, self-obsessed ideas, default judgments, and abstract concepts** — there is a possibility that you might succeed in seeing beyond [the myth of scarcity.](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/the-myth-of-scarcity-ccdd3c7b5679)

Once you understand how your desires and ambitions influence your life, you are better placed to chose your priorities and values.

Once you become sure of yourself, you can never be compelled to do anything against your wish.

You will stop looking for comfort and security in chains.

You will start appreciating the futility of swimming with baggage.

Once you learn to see through the prism of the law of nature none of your possessions would feel like essentials.

You would be finally on your way to freedom and unlimited possibilities.

# A Practical Guide to Beating Isolation and Becoming a Connected Person

## A Practical Guide to Beating Isolation and Becoming a Connected Person

Since 1985, the number of Americans with no close friends [has tripled](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinebeaton/2017/02/09/why-millennials-are-lonely/#17c711647c35). If this is you, or close to you, get ready for a solution.

![](1*pbMLWTiCkCHk8bJskH3PFw.png)

*“I’m the cat guy. Only I don’t live in Mom’s basement.”*

The strip of fog I’ve wiped from the mirror reveals my cat staring quizzically at me in the hallway. She is Wilson the Volleyball. The one friend on the lonely and deserted island of Austin, Texas. My one friend I speak to daily because I have no other plans, let alone friends, in this new city.

It’s depressing, really. Carrying on conversations with your cat.

*How was your dinner? *Fancy Feast again? I see. Was it delicious?
*How was your day?* Oh, you slept and licked your ass when you were bored? Tell me more.

To be fair, I had one human friend, but most of our weekends revolved around seeing how fast we could screw up any progress or money we made by getting drunk.

*I guess I’ll make friends at work.*

But happy hour became a competition to see who could sleep under their desk at the office because they couldn’t drive home. And often in office politics, you keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

On social media, my life looked great. *Here’s a picture of me clinking glasses with the co-workers! Look how happy I am! Here I am backpacking trails and being adventurous! Like that shit!*

But one of the main reasons I ran trails and went to the gym was the hope of just striking up a conversation. What made my isolation feel all the more hopeless is that everywhere I looked, everyone else was having the same problem. Even when I made friends, something strange happened. *I still felt alone.*

[One in five millennials report](http://mashable.com/2015/05/21/millennials-depression-work/#QrI.8zobvsqO) being so depressed that it affects their work. But you don’t need reports to figure this out. Just look around online and you’ll discover hordes of people expressing their struggle with isolation. Most of us have hundreds of friends and followers spanning our social media accounts. We even have people we spend time with, but the depth and richness of meaningful relationships continue to elude us.

![](1*6zTl5fyu97VeBxuAiJg35Q.jpeg)

We thought technology would help connect us, and to be fair, it has created a global village and awareness. However, it’s also made us more aware of our isolation. The dating app [Bumble](https://bumble.com/) unexpectedly discovered this.

During a panel at South by Southwest, Whitney Wolfe, CEO of Bumble, explained that many women using the dating app reported feelings of loneliness or isolation and suggested the app could be used to find friends. Thus, Bumble BFF was born. Women could now swipe right or left to discover women they might want to become friends with. And it isn’t just women using it: One million men have used the BFF feature since it launched. Other developers have taken note and created apps like [Wolfpack](http://www.wolfpackapp.co/) to help men escape their isolation and find friends.

While these products are great in theory, why do we continue to struggle with loneliness?

### Technology Keeps Us Disconnected

Hiding behind a screen is easy because you can be whoever you want. Consider online dating. Numerous relationships and marriages have begun by using the technology. But an app and a screen produce only the introduction. The hard work of risk and vulnerability begins in person, and that’s a scary step. More than my fair share of friends have talked about how they had fantastic text conversations with someone they’re interested in, only to meet in real life and discover it’s like talking to a tree. Deep and meaningful connections happen face to face, and the screen creates the facade of being whoever we want to be—*not who we truly are*.

So, while Wolfpack and Bumble BFF have fantastic intentions, technology cannot ensure vulnerability, authenticity, or even that first scary step of meeting in person. Overcoming isolation and connection require risk and time, which raises the question, “*How do I move from isolation to connection when everything seems stacked against me?*”

In my experience (and after conversations with scores of friends plus a lot of reading), I’ve found five solid ways to break the isolation cycle.

![Step 1: Write down your goal of meeting with one person this week. Photo: Unsplash | [Thought Catalog](https://unsplash.com/search/journal?photo=505eectW54k)](1*CvcMzyllp8vqg7UsMCXLzw.jpeg)*Step 1: Write down your goal of meeting with one person this week. Photo: Unsplash | [Thought Catalog](https://unsplash.com/search/journal?photo=505eectW54k)*

## 1. Set Goals

I keep a planner that helps me track goals. I found that if I put things down on paper and review them weekly, I’m a lot more apt to do them instead of brushing them to the side. Everyone can dream about the things they want to accomplish, but creating a plan to do it is how progress begins. I made it a point to meet with at least one to two people a week. Whether that was for coffee or sports, it didn’t matter, I had to do it despite the fear.

Set some goals for spending time with people. Turn them into action items by getting them on your to-do list and calendar.

![](0*vXa0OiIdT7_xXdw4.)

## 2. Resist Fear and Laziness

I once had a 25-year-old guy approach me and complain about how no one in our friend group was reaching out to to connect one-on-one. My question was simple, “Well, who have *you* reached out to?” Everybody assumes someone should reach out to them to cure their loneliness, but it doesn’t work that way. Plus, it’s self-centered and lazy. You’re effectively saying, “You fill my needs, but I don’t care about yours.”

The catch is that fear and anxiety can lead to procrastination. “I’ll do it next week” becomes never, and our goal of connecting once or twice a week goes unmet. You must commit and overcome it.

That presence of fear and uncertainty is actually a good sign. In his book *The War of Art*, author Steven Pressfield explains how the presence of fear is a driving motivator:
> # “Are you paralyzed with fear? That’s a good sign. Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do. Remember one rule of thumb: The more scared we are…the more sure we can be that we have to do it.”

The next time you feel that fear of reaching out to create connections and are contemplating putting it off, just remember: Fear is a sign that you are about to take an action to conquer isolation.

![](1*pbMLWTiCkCHk8bJskH3PFw.png)

## 3. Risk Rejection

I once heard a story of a young woman who went through a messy breakup. After taking time to heal, she went on a date with a man she had been connecting with over Facebook. In the middle of their date, he stood up and said, “I’m sorry, I’m just not interested,” and left.

In one version of this story, she then phoned her friend to tell her what happened, and her friend responded, “Well, of course he left. You’re a little overweight and not as pretty as other girls he could date.”

Only her friend didn’t say that. It was just the story she told herself. And the event never happened. The young woman played out this scenario in her head thinking it was what *would* happen.

No one likes rejection, but we’re far more likely to believe we will be rejected long before it even happens, and that belief keeps us paralyzed. Any reward requires risk. Once your tackle your fear, that’s where the risk comes in. There’s no guarantee that things will work out, but the alternative is continuing to be isolated.

If you find yourself dwelling on the worst-case scenario, stop yourself and consider the other possibilities. Try to cultivate an open, curious mind: “I don’t know how this story will go, but it will be interesting to find out!”

![](0*nKEudrYarwQWpR09.)

## 4. Practice Vulnerability

![How you think you’ll look when you’re vulnerable. Photo: Unsplash | [Shane Rounce](https://unsplash.com/@shanerounce?photo=DYpiND4Ic0k)](1*GvzyYe40fcJJOTa-laDqhw.jpeg)*How you think you’ll look when you’re vulnerable. Photo: Unsplash | [Shane Rounce](https://unsplash.com/@shanerounce?photo=DYpiND4Ic0k)*
> # “Vulnerability is the birthplace of connection and the path to the feeling of worthiness.” —Brené Brown

The paradox of vulnerability is this: People assume it is weakness when in reality, vulnerability is strength. It’s the first thing we look for in others but the last thing we want to reveal in ourselves.

More often than not, we want to protect ourselves from risk and rejection, but without being open about who we are, we can’t connect. People can sniff out when someone is being fake or insincere, and no one enjoys feeling like they’re being lied to. A lack of vulnerability will quickly stagnate a growing relationship.

This doesn’t mean pouring out our guts when we first connect. But as trust develops, we can strive to reveal honest pieces of ourselves. This builds an emotional connection with others, who, over time, will do the same with us.

Who are the people you respect most? Are they honest about their life struggles? Often, people who are superficially cheerful or guarded are the first to bail out when a storm appears, leaving you feeling more disconnected than ever.

A good way to practice vulnerability is to ask for help. Is there something in your life you could use help with or an emotional struggle that you could use advice about?

Being mindful of our own feelings can help, too. If you notice that you’re holding tension in your body, pause for a moment to reflect on what you’re feeling. Are you being honest with the people around you about those feelings? Sometimes we don’t even realize that we’re holding back to protect a vulnerable state.

![](0*nKEudrYarwQWpR09.)

## 5. Volunteer or Join a Social League

In 2008, I began mentoring teenagers even though my life was still a wreck. I had returned from Iraq and was struggling most nights to keep myself from drinking. What I discovered, however, was that being in a position where teens looked up to me caused me to live up to that by making changes in my life.

Two other things happened that I didn’t expect. Once I thought outside of what I needed and served others instead, those actions took away the pangs of loneliness. The second thing I found was a group of friends who shared the things I was passionate about. A fellow volunteer and I became best friends and remain so to this day.

Later, I joined a sports and social league. I played intramural games with new people and developed connections that revolved around mutual interests. Serving in shared experiences helps me find people who enjoy similar passions: Writing helped me find other writers, veterans’ groups helped me connect with other veterans. Some of my friends have moved from isolation to connection when they served at their church or an animal shelter.

What are your interests, and what opportunities can you find to serve others in those areas? Choosing a service area that aligns with your interests helps reduce isolation because you are motivated to bypass the risks and fears.

### Unfortunately, This Is Going to Take Time
> # “The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.” —Leo Tolstoy

The allure of technology is that it delivers lightning-quick results. But moving from isolation to connection requires time and effort—there are no shortcuts. While we can swipe to find friends, creating the connections to sustain them with comes with risk, vulnerability, and sometimes rejection. 

The question to ask ourselves is what’s worse: isolation or connection? Remaining in isolation and loneliness is effortless but drains our life of energy and joy. While connection requires overcoming our own inertia, the rewards are many and fill our lives with purpose and vigor. 

*Choose wisely.*

# Science-Based Weight Training

## 

Training for strength is the most important and effective exercise that you can do. Virtually everyone, from teenagers to the elderly, can and should engage in it regularly. It’s important for the gaining and maintenance of muscle mass, which is one of the most underrated factors in health. It maintains insulin sensitivity, prevents heart disease and cancer, and keeps older people from losing muscle mass (sarcopenia) and descending into frailty and dependence.

But it really pays dividends to know something about the topic of weight training and how to do it. Unfortunately, the beginning (and even veteran) weight trainer can get a lot of bad advice, so taking a look at what scientific studies have found about the most effective weight training methods can set the strength trainer on the right path.

Misconceptions and wrong ideas abound in weight training, probably because so many enthusiastic amateurs are involved in it. In this article, I’ll try to clear up some of the misconceptions with a look at science-based weight training.

Here I’ll focus on what science has to say about additional aspects of weight lifting (resistance training). These come from “Evidence-Based Resistance Training Recommendations” by Fisher et al.[1](http://roguehealthandfitness.com/science-based-weight-training/#fn-5366-1) ([Full paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Steele4/publication/228830087_Evidence-Based_Resistance_Training_Recommendations/links/0deec517f801683f22000000.pdf).)

### Intensity of effort

When you lift weights, muscle fibers are “recruited,” which means that as repetitions continue and become more difficult, the body demands that more muscle fibers come into play and perform work. At the final repetition, the point of failure, all muscle fibers possible are recruited, and this is the most important step in muscle growth (hypertrophy).

**Recommendation**: Train to momentary muscular failure in order to recruit all possible muscle fibers. Do not train to a set number of repetitions. (For more on this, see [my article on high-intensity training](http://roguehealthandfitness.com/high-intensity-training-mentzer-style/).)

### Load and repetition range

If a set of repetitions is performed to failure, it makes little to no difference how much weight (load) you use. This comes with the caveat that there are limits to this. For instance, if you choose a weight with which you can do 30 reps, or 1 rep, these are unlikely to optimally recruit muscle fibers. But otherwise, studies have found little difference on muscle hypertrophy in lifting heavy weights (90% of max possible, or 90%RM), or lighter weights (30%RM), so long as the lift is done to failure. However, heavier weights (80%RM) appear to increase bone mineral density more than lighter.

**Recommendation**: Select a weight of 80%RM and do reps to failure, which is optimal for strength, muscular endurance, and bone density.

### Repetition duration

Repetition duration refers to cadence, that is, the amount of time it takes to perform 1 rep, i.e. slow vs fast. Repetitions should be done at a slow enough pace that muscular tension is always maintained. Fast reps or using momentum — jerking the weights around — do not maintain muscular tension.

**Recommendation**: Lift slowly enough to maintain muscular tension. In extreme cases, this may be 10 seconds up, 10 down, though that doesn’t appear to be necessary. I use a cadence of 4–5 seconds up, same down.

### Rest intervals

This is the time spent between sets, and the preponderance of scientific evidence shows that it has little effect on strength gains.

For pure muscle growth, don’t worry about rest intervals. Take as much or as little time as you like.

However, rest intervals may make a difference in cardiovascular conditioning. If you want to emphasize the cardiovascular aspect of training, short rest intervals are better.

**Recommendation**: Select your own rest interval for muscle growth. Use short rest intervals for cardiovascular conditioning.

### Volume and frequency

These refer to the number of sets and the frequency of training sessions, and this area shows probably the greatest disparity between what most people, including veteran lifters, believe, and what the science says.

There’s little evidence that performing more than 1 set of each exercise increases muscle growth if that 1 set is done to failure.

There’s little evidence to support *any* recommendation as to frequency. Some studies have reported no difference with a training frequency of once vs twice a week, other studies showing no difference between twice or three times a week. My own experience tells me that you can train *as long as you feel fully rested and recovered*.

**Recommendation**: Single set training appears to be as effective as multiple sets for muscle growth. There’s little scientific evidence for a recommendation as to the frequency of training.

### Endurance training and lifting

Some people worry that doing endurance training might hinder their lifting gains. There’s no evidence that it does, so do endurance training also if that’s what you want to do. However, additional training may hinder recovery time.

**Recommendation**: Endurance training doesn’t hinder muscle growth.

### Range of motion

Most trainers recommend you use a full range of motion for each rep in order to get the most growth. But there’s no evidence for this. A restricted range of motion appears to increase strength and size as much as the full range.

**Recommendation**: Use any range of motion you like.

### Machines vs. free weights

Another controversial area. Evidence directly comparing the two is meager, but machines do increase size and strength. A muscle doesn’t know whether you’re using a machine or a barbell.

Machines may make it easier to perform a lift to failure. For instance, trying to go to failure on a set of squats is asking for trouble, namely injury. Not a problem to do so on a leg press or hack squat machine.

Just about the only barbell exercise that I’m aware of that has no machine equivalent is the deadlift.

**Recommendation**: Use either machines or free weights as you wish.

### Training and de-training

A mere 3 weeks of training is enough to produce muscle growth in untrained people.

Of more interest, how long does it take, when no training is done, to lose muscle strength?

Again, 3 weeks of no training appears to have little to no effect on muscle strength. Most dedicated lifters don’t ever take that much time off, but this shows that allowing adequate rest between training sessions, even of considerable length, will not hurt gains.

**Recommendation**: If you feel the need to take some time off, or just can’t manage to get to the gym for a while, don’t worry about it.

## Conclusion

Many of these recommendations are to a greater or lesser extent at odds with common training methods, the kind that you hear from a trainer or gym bro.

It’s entirely possible that scientific studies miss some important aspects of training that come from years of bodybuilding experience. Resistance training studies normally last only about 12 weeks, and most have been done using untrained people.

But, when science looks at techniques, muscle protein synthesis, frequency of training, and the like, these are the conclusions, and they form our base of knowledge as it relates to weight training.

If I had to pick a single one of the above recommendations to emphasize, it would be the intensity of effort, which appears to be the single most important aspect in attaining growth in strength and size.

# How to Train and Use a Virtual Assistant to Multiply Your Time

## source: unsplash

Modern-day productivity is more than just getting a lot done. You also want to create more time to do what you love.

Yet many of us find ourselves trapped doing tasks and activities that leave us drained of energy. The worst is when you’re so overwhelmed and so drained that you can’t even work up enthusiasm for the parts of your job that you do love.

I fell into this trap when I was first doing my podcast show. I’d line up the amazing guests and have them spill their secrets on the recording. This is the part I loved doing the most.

After that, I had to go through cleaning the audio file, adding the intro and outro, writing the show notes, creating the album art cover, uploading to iTunes, and sharing the show on social media and email.

The post-production was overwhelming. The post-production sucked up all my time. And, because I didn’t love doing that work, it also sucked up my energy and morale.

Eventually, I got fed up and hit on the idea that I only wanted to work in what I considered my “Genius Zone” and that I wanted to outsource everything else. That’s how I ended up getting started with—and then getting really efficient at—managing virtual assistants.

![](1*FBSpHKgSj8Ut-jUPAzsXKg.png)

## Your Genius Zone

The ‘Genius Zone’ comes from the book by Gary Keller called ‘[The One Thing](https://www.amazon.com/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776)’, which talks about focusing on the one thing you’re great at (or a genius at). It doesn’t mean no one else is better than you at that one thing. Rather, it means that you’re better at your one thing than a majority of the population.

Take the podcast example: I figured I could get someone else to run the entire show for me. Yet I found that my favorite part of the whole process was doing the interviews. Even my guests were telling me I was a great interviewer. (And nobody ever told me I was great at adding intros and outros.)

So I wanted to find out what would happen if I focused on what I *might* be a ‘genius’ at (interviewing) rather than working on improving my weaknesses (post-production). What if I just went all-in on creating a team who loved doing the other parts that I didn’t?

Understanding what work you want to do yourself and what work you want other people to do is the first step in employing a Virtual Assistant.

This is the key to multiplying your time. It’s all about figuring out the few tasks you’re the ‘genius’ at and accepting that you’re not so good at the others.

If you hesitate to call yourself a genius at anything, then focus instead on what you are most passionate about.

If you’re a creative genius, then perhaps you struggle to manage project timelines. Or if you’re a coding genius, you might not have the salesmanship skills to close more projects. The beautiful part about today’s world is that it’s now easier than ever before to find and connect with people who are fantastic at the tasks you struggle with.

![](1*FBSpHKgSj8Ut-jUPAzsXKg.png)

## Checklist before hiring your first VA

Before you hire a VA you need to ask yourself if you’re are even ready for another person to come into your life.

VA’s bring many amazing options for getting more done and creating more time for yourself. Yet hiring a VA only works if you are prepared to provide the structure and guidance they need to be successful.

It begins with a series of questions to ask yourself starting with:

1. How would hiring a VA add more to my life/business?

1. What would my VA be doing for me?

1. What would I be spending my freed-up time on?

1. Do I have the funds to hire a VA?

1. Am I willing to let go of control of some details?

These are some of the most important questions you need to consider when it comes to making a decision that involves another human in your life. There’s no point bringing in someone to simplify your life if you don’t know how they’ll do it.

This is a crucial point: Virtual Assistant’s follow systems that you create — they do not create the systems for you.

![](1*FBSpHKgSj8Ut-jUPAzsXKg.png)

## **Examples of types of work for Virtual Assistants**

If you have never worked with a virtual assistant, then it may help to consider some examples of what they can do.

I tend to think in terms of three categories.

1. **Task** —A discrete task taken to completion (could be audio processing, video editing or email handling)

1. **Project** — A group of tasks that are linked together to accomplish a goal (e.g. scheduling a trip often requires finding hotels, flights, rental cars, getting your feedback, then making the bookings)

1. **Role** — Collective tasks that need to be completed day-to-day on a recurring basis (e.g general administration, customer support or social media scheduling)

![](1*FBSpHKgSj8Ut-jUPAzsXKg.png)

## Start by identifying your repetitive tasks

Usually most people start with a general VA role to handle mundane and repetitive tasks like travel arrangements, social media scheduling, and email management.

You should know and define these tasks before you hire your VA.

To get a good list of these tasks, go through your average week and identify tasks that repeat. If they are in your Genius Zone, then keep those tasks for yourself. If they aren’t, then they’re tasks you can train a VA to do.

The key here is to have tasks that are occurring regularly, so your VA can free up that time and also give them regular hours.

This is important because it’ll bring some stability for your VA to know the type of work they’re expected to perform. Regular hours also sets expectations for your working relationship about when they need to be ‘on’ for work and when they can be off.

![](1*FBSpHKgSj8Ut-jUPAzsXKg.png)

## Training requires being able to give step-by-step instructions

It’s important to capture every step of a task, no matter how small. Write down all the decisions, actions and thought patterns behind why this step is needed.

Most VAs are generalists and so they aren’t coming to your company with domain-specific knowledge. It’s always better to be specific about each step rather than assume that something is common knowledge.

If you’re struggling to break down your task into bite-sized steps, it either means the task requires too much brain power or experience to train someone in and shouldn’t be done (yet!), or you’re just overthinking the process.

Once you’ve written down the steps, do an editing pass. You’ll be surprised how many of the steps aren’t actually necessary.

Ask yourself:

* Is this critical to achieving the end result or the task?

* Can I/the business live without this action?

* How can I do this in fewer steps?

In addition to being clear, I also like to give context to each task. My assumption is that my VA won’t know anything about my business and so this context (even if it feels basic to me) helps put them in a position to succeed:

* Why am I doing this?

* What am I doing?

* What would happen if I don’t do this?

The last question is critical because if you don’t lay out the consequence of inaction or poor delivery, people will not truly grasp the magnitude and the impact of their work. This is really to piece the whole picture together for your VA, and to help them understand the importance of their work and how it fits into the company.

![](1*FBSpHKgSj8Ut-jUPAzsXKg.png)

## Now you can hire your VA

Hiring could be its own lengthy tutorial, where here I’m trying to focus on how to train.

But simply, the first place to look is with your friends. Some VAs are better than others, so often one of your friends will have a recommendation about a specific VA.

After that, there are a number of services you can try. Use the instructions you’ve created for your first task as a sample project. This is why I always recommend people define the first project for their VA before they even try to hire one.

One of the top tactics for finding the best VA for yourself is to give the same task to multiple VAs and then compare the results. Sure, that might cost you an extra $100, but it’s the fastest and most efficient way to evaluate a VA.

If your friends don’t have strong recommendations for you, you can start by looking on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/). This is an excellent service and starting point. If you’re looking to have the search done for you then you might want to check out [Outsourcing Angel](http://www.outsourcingangel.com).

I also recommend trying [FreeEup](https://freeeup.com/), simply because I appreciate their chart listing expected hourly price ranges for virtual support:

![](1*cfQuIr4ECAct--AAM80WWg.png)

![](1*FBSpHKgSj8Ut-jUPAzsXKg.png)

## Applying the 30x rule for training

Often the biggest mistake when hiring a VA is that you don’t spend enough time investing in training.

Training is the most crucial part to outsourcing because the more you prepare at the start, the more time you’ll save from having to retrain them. Training someone to completely take over any task from you takes time.

In Rory Vaden’s [*Procrastinate on Purpose: 5 Permissions to Multiply Your Time](http://www.amazon.com/Procrastinate-Purpose-Permissions-Multiply-Your/dp/0399170626/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1436567130&sr=1-1&keywords=procrastinate+on+purpose)*, he talks about how multipliers use the 30x Rule.

The 30x rule is that you should invest 30 times more on training than it takes you to do the task one time. So if it takes a task 5 minutes to complete, it should cost you 150 minutes (2.5 hours) to train someone to take that task over.

This probably sounds crazy. And yes, it’s possible to spend less time. But I find this rule of thumb inspires me to create the best possible training. Then when I lose a VA (this happens), I have training that’s good enough to reuse with the next VA.

Training comes down to more than just a set of instructions emailed to your VA. Training involves being there to support your VA when they encounter difficulties/challenges or when they come up against something you’ve left off your original instructions. Training time includes time to review their work and then provide feedback.

![](1*FBSpHKgSj8Ut-jUPAzsXKg.png)

## Using video to get training leverage

The best change I made to my training was document all of it onto video and then put that video into a training portal. This has made it much easier to bring on new VAs.

I’ve personally used this to train up VA’s who had no idea what podcasts were to be able to do basic podcast post-production within weeks of hiring.

![Example of our Online Training Portal](1*q4IpG99HjP2Tac7OIhDVLA.png)*Example of our Online Training Portal*

Now in these training websites, I’ve personally found long boring SOP’s (Standard Operating Procedure) documents do not help at the start. It’s kind of like walking into a new office and getting told to read the encyclopedia first. I’ll go out on a limb and generalize by saying no one wants to do that!

So the keys to engaging training that is effective and easily digestible is to create short (3–7min) video tutorials. You can do this very easily with applications like Jing, Camtasia and Screenflow, or even just QuickTime if you are on a Mac.

Why do short videos?

Think of your own video watching habits: anything longer than 10 minutes and you’ll most likely not want to watch it. It’s the same for your VA: you want to make it easily digestible and reduce the barriers as much as possible.

As much as it is their role to make your life easier, it’s your responsibility to make it as easy as possible for them to complete their work. So go above and beyond and make it as simple and easy as possible for them to support you.

We do this by augmenting the videos with the appropriate templates of scripts, emails, message responses and checklists relating to the process. Go further by even providing them links to access the tools they need easily!

This training portal serves as a great base for learning, but also simplifies your VA’s work and empowers them with all the resources they need.

![](1*FBSpHKgSj8Ut-jUPAzsXKg.png)

## Project managing your VA

Sometimes you’ll need to track where your VA is on a project.

I use Trello, partly because Trello makes it easy to create checklist templates. This is also a place where you can place resources (links, files, logos) that your VA will use every day. This project management system is separate from your training library. Your VA uses your training library to get up to speed and then uses your project management portal on a day-to-day basis.

![Our Team Assets Trello Board](1*nufekt3WoFcS9l6Ss2KKeQ.png)*Our Team Assets Trello Board*

It is critical is to manage checklists. Let me show you how detail oriented I get in my checklists:

![Example of our Podcast Production Checklist in Trello](1*6LF8J0wDocpw8THjpkEWVg.png)*Example of our Podcast Production Checklist in Trello*

Having this sort of checklist helps make sure your VA is following every detail. Most VAs are detail-oriented by nature — and so these checklists play to their strength.

Checklists also make it easy to improve or adjust your processes over time.

Creating this much training is a lot of work. Frankly, it is a more work than most people are willing to do. Yet, doing it is why you’ll find yourself with more time on your hands—because you’re guiding, empowering and providing the platform for your virtual team to succeed without you!

That’s the whole point. You make a big investment up front so that your time is freed up to do other things.

As you start to tap into the multiplier within you, you’ll be shifting away from putting out fires and start to figure other tasks that cause noise, pressure and repetition in your life. You can eliminate them or pass those also along to a VA. Your VA will be part of a system that removes your ‘non-genius’ tasks from your life.

# THE PHILIPPINES AND THE UNITED STATES

## A Brief Comparison of their Culture and Psychology

*I googled myself. We all do, just to find what the interwebs say about us. This one is weird. I found an old term paper I wrote for my psychology class 6-7 years ago or so at a local community college here in Southern California (I attempted to go back to school for another degree — yes, attempted). The stats might not be accurate now. Without further ado, here it is…*

As with any other typical country, the Philippines has gone through various societal processes— either political or economical in nature or the combination thereof — that define the current structure of its society. But unlike most of its neighboring countries, the Philippines is not “purely” oriental in a sense.

If the *West-East Divide *ever exists somewhere else in Asia, it is not evident that this country can be somewhere proximate to this demarcation.

For more than three centuries the Philippines had undergone the colonization of the Spaniards (the first Spanish contingents came to the Philippines in 1521). By virtue of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, the Philippines came under American jurisdiction as a result of Spain’s loss to America in the Spanish-America War in 1898. From 1941 to 1944, during the Second World War, the Philippines had to put up with the atrocities of the Japanese.
> # If the *West-East Divide *ever exists somewhere else in Asia, it is not evident that this country can be somewhere proximate to this demarcation.

The years of the Americans’ political settlement before and after the Second World War saw the emergence of a Democratic society (the Philippines is the first country in Asia to have adopted Democracy as a political system). Many other democratic institutions have been established as a result of the American-Philippine relation.

One of the salient impacts of the Americans to the Philippines is the education system which was structured and fashioned after American models. The current education system is an off-shoot of the system developed and exercised by a widely recognized group of American teachers in the early 1950’s called “Thomasites” (so-called after the ship “Thomas” with which they came to the country).

Up to these times, English is the main medium of instruction used in all levels in school. Whether this medium is effective for Filipino students or not have been a question extensively debated in many parts of the country. The efficacy of education relies on different aspects, and one of them is the language being used. But all had to come down to one thing: *Globalization *has become the decisive factor in asserting English as the primary medium to be used in schools.

The implication of this is multifold. An average tagalog-speaking first grader could have a trouble understanding, say, a mathematics subject taught in English while he, the student, in the first place is not yet basically familiar with that language (English) through which he is expected to learn that mathematics subject.

The inevitability of Globalization has “forced” the system to embrace an approach to education that at times contrary to the conservative tendencies of Filipinos. Could the Philippines’ literacy rate of 95%, a national average and one of the highest literacy rates in Asia, attest to the fact that environment-imposed (or globalization-imposed) system is really effective? Another interesting thing to note is that the Philippines is one of the largest English-speaking nations in the world.

These statistics speak for the ability of the Filipino people to adapt or adjust to an element foreign to their native environment. The Philippines’ education system basically **conforms **to the demands of Globalization.

Yet despite the modern trend in the Philippines’ educational process, the popularity of superstitions in most areas of the country is still pervasive. The belief in the ***Albularyo ***or quack-doctor still persists when it comes to treating diseases and some types of mental illnesses. “***Sanib***” or spirit-possession, belief to supernatural phenomena and to the existence of supernatural characters or spirits (*such as “**manananggal**” which is a version of Dracula but only this is half-bodied, has a wing like that of a bat and has the ability to transform to different kinds of animals*) and other superstitions are still incorporated into the culture of the Filipinos. There have been cases of mental disorder caused by drug abuse and depression being interpreted as punishment by a “*white lady*” (a wandering spirit of a dead lady) or “***nuno sa punso***” (literally, elf living in the mound of soil).

The only explanation to these kinds of belief is the principle of Repetition or Assertion, or the Validity Effect, as these beliefs have been passed on from one generation to the other. No scientific evidence seems to prove these kinds of superstitions, or any superstitions at that.

On social life, the Filipinos are generally “moralistic” in terms of dealing with social issues. Living in together without the prerogatives of marriage is not accepted in the society. Same-sex marriage is as much a taboo to the eye of a typical Filipino as is pre-marital sex. If there are relationships of such kinds (live-in and same-sex) that thrive in the society, they are only “allowed” by virtue of either tolerance or being consented to; but, still, never accepted morally. Filipinos are not open to these types of “situations” sometimes common or “normal” to the perception of some Western countries such as the United States. Divorce and abortion are two issues Filipinos consider as both illegal and immoral.

The moralistic attitude of Filipinos demonstrated towards their social life is ultimately determined and influenced by Catholicism which is the major religion in the country (about 85% or more of the population are Catholics).

Almost peculiar to Filipinos is their expression of **personal freedom**. Freedom, for Filipinos, is not an “exclusive” attribute but a communal one.

The world witnessed when the Filipino people united in arms and prayers to stage “People Power Revolution of 1986”. The word “revolt” in that case was actually a misnomer due to the fact that the said “revolution” was just a big rally joined about by huge numbers of people (*which instigated the withdrawal of support by the Armed Forces from the Seat of Power of the Republic*) calling for the resignation of the despot President Ferdinand Marcos.

The mass action (or revolution) had proven its worth. It succeeded to achieve its ultimate goal — to restore Democracy to the country by ousting the despot president. It was an action symbolic of the Filipinos’ collective pursuit of Freedom and the quest for the opportunities to enjoy it.
> # Almost peculiar to Filipinos is their expression of **personal freedom. **Freedom, for Filipinos, is not an “exclusive” attribute but a communal one.

Rallies and other forms of collective mobilization are instruments for Filipinos to express their choice or opinion. From the point of view of an individualistic culture (e.g., the United States) collective actions for the purpose of affecting social change could be taken as “mob rule” or construed as anarchy. But for the collectivist Filipinos this is the only way in which they can fully and totally express their own selves.

*Deindividuation *(the loss of awareness of one’s individuality) is the nearest concept that can characterize this behavior. A Filipino philosopher by the name Leonardo Mercado, a priest, best explained this characteristic. He argued that Filipinos have the concept of “*sakop*” (which literally means “jurisdiction” in English). Sakop is basically the **extension **of one’s self — it is the individual being extended to, but not diffused in, the company of others.

The Filipinos feel a sense of “closeness” to anyone or anything— a person or an event— they can identify themselves with. So the justification of resorting to mass actions when called for is not for the individual Filipino to opt for anonymity but rather for the affirmation of his identity.

If we do a comparative evaluation on culture and psychology of the Philippines vis-à-vis the United States, we must stress the fact that the two countries differ not only in the entirety of the content of their culture but also in many other aspects— from beliefs and customs down to public opinion, attitude and economic attributes.

We can find “parallelism” in the Education system of both countries—the Philippines’ education system being an off-shoot of an American model. But then peripheral issues such as resources and limited access to information can readily accentuate the gap between the two countries.

Globalization, despite its promotion and propaganda on the mass media, is still an alien concept to the majority of Filipinos. If globalization is an inevitable path of progress, most Filipinos don’t look at it as a conceptual framework of national economic progress but as a foreign element.

The sense of “otherness” that Filipinos feel about globalization is one thing they need to “unlearn”. Why is this so? Progress brought about by globalization could alienate people who do not have the capacity and tools to work with it.

Access to information and technological advancements are the main liabilities of any Third World Country such as the Philippines.

The most apparent disparity between the United States and the Philippines is not of the economic aspects but that of cultural ones— the former as characterized by an Individualistic culture, the latter by Collectivistic or Communal culture. Hence, Privacy Rights and its issues are highly important to Americans; and, it is inappropriate and impolite to “mind somebody’s business”.

The individual’s right is placed at the top rung of values Americans uphold. For Filipinos, family values are more important than those of the individual’s.

Close family ties characterize the Filipino family. Extended family settings are “natural” for Filipinos; while Americans would feel “crowded” when a number of family members occupy a house.

All discrepancies on social issues and opinions are to be expected considering the fact that culture comes into play when we talk about norms or social standards, beliefs, and customs.

More important than the differences between the United States and the Philippines is the ability of their people to interact and coexist in a given environment. Views and opinions on social issues may contrast in all aspects as a result of their differences in* dispositional* and *situational* perspectives.

Understanding each other’s culture and way of life leads to appreciating them. The receptive attitude of both cultures is a key factor in shaping any relationship that has existed, that exists and will exist between them.

Acceptance and tolerance also play a key role in determining the compatibility of the two cultures.

### So creative, it seems like magic: a step-by-step guide to unleashing your most innovative brainpower

Our rational, conscious mind is a wonderful thing. But sometimes when we are looking for a solution, it can be a limited resource. I’m always looking for ways to work **smarter**, not harder.

What if I could come up with answers in my sleep? I discovered that it’s possible to do just that.

To the outsider, it can look as if someone were literally dreaming up solutions to situations. What’s really happening, though, is that a person who is skilled at this is first removing their overeager *conscious* mind temporarily from the equation, and then mobilizing the power of their *subconscious* minds through the power of a specific question.

It’s not half as complicated as that last sentence suggests. Questions are the key. I learned how to make this work for me, and I’ll show you how to do it, too. [***Read more](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-make-the-power-of-your-subconscious-mind-work-for-you-295701128db4).***

# The Counterintuitive Stability of Change

## “The more things change, the more they stay the same” – Alphonse Karr

Being in the middle of a lot of change right now, the term [A*ntifragile](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979680?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=0812979680&linkCode=shr&tag=myaddlife-20&linkId=T2527MTMNTHTOV3D) *has been on my mind a lot. I haven’t read the book by the same name yet — but it’s in my queue now. I recently heard its author Nassim Taleb on one of my favorite podcasts, [The James Altucher Show](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-james-altucher-show/id794030859?mt=2) and it’s been rattling around in my head for the last couple weeks.

## What is Antifragile?

If you aren’t familiar with the word *antifragile — *that’s because it technically isn’t a “real” word. That is it wasn’t, [until Nassim invented it](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979680?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=0812979680&linkCode=shr&tag=myaddlife-20&linkId=MOU3JOF2UO64TLX7). I think the meaning at first glance seems pretty straightforward, but when you begin to think about it more in context of life, it gets a lot deeper.

Taleb coined the term “anti-fragility” because he thought the existing words used to describe the opposite of “fragility,” such as “robustness,” were inaccurate. Anti-fragility goes beyond robustness; it means that something does not merely withstand a shock but actually improves because of it.[1]

## Are You Fragile?

I had never thought of myself as fragile — sure I recognized my insecurities, and [I’ve written about my own anxiety levels](http://skillingmesoftly.com/anxiety-service/), but when I heard the term antifragile I instantly connected with it. It put a name to what I’d been working towards for the last few years without being able to articulate it. It’s what this blog is all about [changing your fear](http://changefear.com/) not fearing change.

By being open to change, and to borrow from the antifragile definition — “to not merely withstand change but actually improve because of it” — we experience the tree in the wind that will bend but not break factor. The what doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger approach to life.

## Change vs Stability

In a conversation last night, stability came up — I hadn’t thought about my stability or what makes me more stable until that moment. As I reflected on it, I began to feel even more comfortable about a tough decision that I needed to make. Making tough decisions– to leave something comfortable behind, to change or reinvent myself –whether it’s the country that I live in, the craft that I do or the people I’m around (or not around) it all has an impact on me. And that’s increasing my antifragility.

## What If ‘Stability’ Leads to Fragility?

Nassim gave this example [on the podcast](http://nassimtaleb.org/2014/09/podcast-nassim-taleb-james-altucher-show/#.VDlsCKXF_3Q) of someone who’s done the same thing for 30 years, let’s say it’s for work. Now, if something happens and he suddenly loses his job, he’s not really prepared to continue to provide for himself. At least not in the way that another person who has a different life where they had to switch jobs or careers more often or where the job required them to be resourceful and to go out and find their own opportunities.

Looking back, my wife and I have changed careers more than once from designers to developers to consultants to coaches and that doesn’t even include creating products, writing, and the different industries we have transitioned to work with over time. And we’ve moved almost as many (if not more) times than years we’ve been married.

And on a personal level, moving wasn’t just from house to house, but from larger to minimalist, now in the last few years… from country to country.

All this change, to some might feel unsettling from the outside looking in, but if anything, it’s done the exact opposite. It’s truly made us less fragile – dare I say antifragile, as we seem to be thriving from the experience.

## The Freedom in Letting Go of What You Know

As I’m embarking on a new journey, booking a one way trip to Thailand and beyond, I’m letting go of even more of what I would have thought I needed. My goal (inspired by [Tynan](http://tynan.net/)’s [Life Nomadic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003RISMM0?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B003RISMM0&linkCode=shr&tag=myaddlife-20&linkId=C6IJSKDAQNYSLKZX&qid=1413047183&sr=8-1&keywords=life+nomadic)) is to have more flexibility by bringing just the essentials — my clothes, technology, personal care items, all in one bag. The amazing part is the counterintuitive step of minimizing everything I need to one backpack, doesn’t seem scary at all — it’s freeing.

Maybe we’ve been seeking the wrong thing in the traditional sense of stability — it’s not as important to have the most ‘stable’ environment — since we can’t truly control every environment — but to cultivate the strength to be stable in any environment.

# What the fuck should I do with my life? (A step-by-step process)

## Photo credit of Anton Glavas www.antonglavas.com

​I’m not here to tell you, “It’s ok, you’ll figure it out one day,” or “where you are is exactly where you’re meant to be” or “trust the process.”
 
Bullshit.
 
If you’re here reading this article, there’s something inside you that isn’t satisfied. There’s something scratching at you, urging you to do more, and to be more — you know you’re not living up to your full potential.

The feeling of not knowing what to do with my life is very familiar. In fact, some might say “dissatisfaction” is my middle name.
 
I’ve never been one to just settle for what life hands me, or to follow the pack and feel ok with that.
 
I’m restless. Antsy. Future-focused. Searching. Deep-thinking.
 
I tried environmental education… that wasn’t it.

I tried youth education… that wasn’t it.

I tried life coaching… that wasn’t it (although close).
 
I tried project management… that wasn’t it.
 
Then I finally — finally! — after 15 years of working in various jobs, figured out what I wanted to do with my life (at least for now): career coaching.
 
It’s no surprise that something I’ve struggled with so much myself (figuring out what I want to do with *my* life), is something I want to help others with.
 
**Want a BIG HINT on what you could do with your life? **
 
Look at what you struggle with most, overcome that struggle, then help others do the same.
 
It doesn’t have to be for your work, but I guarantee that will give a lot of meaning and fulfillment to your life.
 
But, I digress.
 
This article is really all about showing you a step-by-step process for figuring out what to do with your life.
 
This is the process I take my clients through to get clarity and you’re getting it here, now, for free (yay!).

## My step-by-step process for getting clarity on what to do with your life

### Step 1: Figure out your ideal lifestyle

![](1*so8Nd29VGeX-SVNGYe0KhA.jpeg)

How many hours do you want to be working? How much money do you want to be making? Do you want to be employed or self-employed? What kind of environment(s) do you want to spend your time in? What kind of people do you want to be around? Where do you want to be (i.e., what city, country)? What do you want to do for fun? What do you want to do for personal growth? What do you want to do for your health?
 
You get the idea!

### Step 2: Get clear on your values

![](1*vC9N13LcCJRL3rGsARHyqw.jpeg)

Your values are basically what’s most important to you in your life. For example, mine are: freedom, new experiences, connection, and vibrancy. You choose how you define your values.
 
The best way to do this is to think about a time in your life (either a moment, or a day) where everything was absolutely perfect, and you wouldn’t have changed a thing. Write out the experience and what you loved about it. Then ask yourself, what are the values in there?
 
For example, if the experience that comes to mind for you is hiking by yourself in Thailand, some of the values might be: independence, travel, adventure, and freedom.

If you’re really stuck on coming up with values, I recommend reviewing [Max Neef’s list of 9 fundamental human needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_human_needs). What values come up for you as you read this list?
 
Once you have your list of values, rank them until you get it down to your top 3–5. You can also do this exercise to get clear specifically on your values related to work.

### Step 3: Get to know your strengths

![](1*Bg1P1S1GiFtabMgcWyTsAQ.jpeg)

Your strengths are what you’re naturally good at. You might not realize you have a particular strength because it’s always come easily to you, and you may assume it comes easily to everyone else too.
 
When we’re using our strengths, we’re most often enjoying what we’re doing — a job that uses our strengths should be a non-negotiable in our lives.
 
To help you get clear on your unique strengths, I wrote a separate article on [how to figure out your strengths.](https://medium.com/@rebecca_beaton/3-tips-to-figure-out-what-youre-good-at-2d82513bf694)

### Step 4: Determine your skills

![](1*zmJHGGZ59KCXpe69xtPlsQ.jpeg)

Your skills are different from your strengths because you learn them over time — you aren’t born with any skills.
 
Write out 3 lists when it comes to your skills: your soft skills (i.e., less tangible skills such as “communication”, “leadership”, or “adaptability”), your hard skills (i.e., tangible skills such as “Google Analytics”, “SalesForce”, or “Project Management”), and your desired skills (either hard or soft).
 
Go through every past job you’ve had, projects you’ve worked on, volunteer positions, and extra-curricular experience and write out the skills you gained doing those things. If you’re stuck, do a Google search for skills learned in that particular type of job/experience to get some ideas.

### Step 5: Identify Problems/Challenges/Opportunities

![](1*BbN3w6TchhNMcDlc39cv2A.jpeg)

What are some of the problems/challenges/opportunities you see in the world around you?

Think about documentaries you watch, blogs you subscribe to, newspaper articles you’re drawn to, magazines or books you read, YouTube videos you watch, or topics you love to talk about — what are the themes/topics you’re drawn to the most?

Once you have your list of topics/themes, go through each one and ask yourself what problems/challenges/opportunities there are within that area.

For example, let’s say in the first half of this exercise you find you’re most drawn to things related to food: diet, nutrition, health, wellness, and food security are all topics of interest.

When it comes to health, some of the problems/challenges you identify might be obesity, diabetes, low energy, anxiety, and depression.

Some of the opportunities might be public health education, functional medicine, supplements, or cleaner diets.

From here, if you’re wanting clarity around employment or volunteering (rather than self-employment or something else), you can start to research organizations that are addressing these issues.

Going back to the food example, you might seek out supplement companies, health food stores, healthy meal delivery services, functional medicine clinics, or government branches related to public health.

Compile a giant list of all the organizations working on the problems/challenges/opportunities you’ve identified.

Now, you might be thinking this exercise is useless because the problems/challenges/opportunities you identified are in one specific area and you already know you don’t want to become an expert in that area.

However, there are a huuuuge variety of things you could do in any area you’ve identified that have nothing to do with the subject topic.

For example, if you identified an interest in healthy meal delivery, it doesn’t mean you need to become a nutritionist or expert in healthy meals. A healthy meal delivery service needs all kinds of people with a variety of strengths and skills: sales, marketing, project management, administration, web/app development, product design, UX/UI design, bookkeeping, accounting, people management, customer support, lawyers, and probably a number of other things I’m not thinking of!

**Step 6: Mush Everything Together**

![](1*iqKnJ3X1anBd_6V4fXNMvQ.jpeg)

Now, it’s time to put everything together and come up with some tangible ideas for what to do with your life (at least for now — because it’s probably going to change! Good news is you can re-visit this process at any time.)

*If you’re going the employment or volunteer route:*

Look at the list of organizations you have and do some research to identify challenges those organizations have to which you could contribute your strengths/skills and that meet your values and lifestyle goals.

For example, say you scoped out some health food stores and you have really strong analytical skills — you might be suited to be a market research analyst or data analyst at a health food store.

Or say you scoped out some companies that sell supplements and you have really strong people skills — you might be suited to be on the sales team or manage the customer success team at a supplement company.

*If you’re going the self-employment route:*

Look at the problems/challenges/opportunities you’ve identified and consider: what are the ways you could address those problems/challenges/opportunities using your strengths, skills, and values?

Brainstorm away!

**Step 7: Research Your Options**

![](1*7pmmv0qMMM98IiZVEaHbnQ.jpeg)

Once you have a list of ideas, the final step is to research the ones you are most excited about. Do what you need to do to get that last bit of clarity:

* Take a free online course.

* Research the employment outlook for that field. (Make sure it won’t be [taken over by robots](https://medium.com/@rebecca_beaton/what-are-the-jobs-of-the-future-how-to-ensure-your-job-isnt-replaced-by-robots-c3cd120161de)!)

* Check out the education requirements.

* Research the expected salary.

* Conduct some informational interviews. (Check out my article on [How to Request, Conduct, and Follow-up on an Informational Interview](http://www.rebeccabeaton.com/career-blog/informational-interviewing-101-how-to-request-conduct-and-follow-up-on-an-informational-interview).)

* Volunteer or take on a “beta-test” client in exchange for feedback.

Before wrapping up, I want to acknowledge that not everyone has the freedom to do what they choose in life and live out their desires. I’ve really written this article for those of us who are lucky enough to have that choice — let’s not take our freedom to do what we want in life for granted.
 
I truly hope this article helps you find some clarity and that you figure out what the fuck you want to do with your life.
 
Hugs,
 
-Rebecca

# 3 Best Habits for a Happy and Successful Life

## 3 Best Habits for a Happy and Successful Life

### Easy to Keep and Amazingly Beneficial

A happy and successful life is all about good habits. But we are unique. If you’d have been forced to narrow down all the choices to three habits, there would have been a great variety of 3-habit sets that would guide different individuals to the same final station of success and happiness.

I’ll provide something I consider the most common set (meaning that maybe 20% of the population would have finished with those habits; we are really unique).

### **1. Gratitude journal.**

A grateful mind elevates and enhances everything. Gratitude is the only surefire way to rewire the human brain into positivity.

When your brain is positive, everything in your life is better: health, relationships, sales, savings, grades, fitness performance… anything and everything. Scientists measured the effects of positivity into all the above-mentioned metrics and many more. They haven’t yet found **a single exception** from this rule.

And, of course, gratitude makes you feel better, aka ‘happier.’

![](1*Z8a7paiaXuiFAenzmRuRqw.png)

This habit is easy to develop and continue. You need only the ability to write and think.

Gratitude practiced mindfully without journaling has similarly positive results; it’s just less efficient. Writing down your reasons for gratitude provides clarity and boundaries that a real habit needs to be developed faster and become sticky.

### **2. Exercises.**

The definition of exercises I mean here is: a regular physical activity. Taking walks definitely qualifies.

Taking care of your body results in high energy levels, more vigor, and less slanginess.

Exercises fight off depression. When you think about a depressed person, the last thing you imagine is someone energetically jumping around. If you have depression, all you want is to curl yourself in a fetal position and sleep.

The body-mind connection is deeper than we recognize. When you are in a decent shape, not only does your health improve — your creativity and cognitive functions increase as well.

The consistency of exercises seems to be a problem. Almost everybody appreciates the importance of physical activity, yet only [49% of Americans exercise regularly](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/exercise.htm).

Often, the problem lies in false definition of exercises. We don’t consider anything less than 2 hours of weight lifting or training for a marathon an exercise.However, my definition states only two requirements: regularity and physicality of an activity.

![](1*Kejx9yFOSrpZ4Ibo4Q_i-w.png)

If you play one match of table tennis a day, it’s an exercise. If you walk briskly 700 yards every morning (my father does that), it is an exercise. If you have sex every day, it is an exercise. If you play tag with your kids every time when they come back from Kindergarten, it’s an exercise as well.

Redefine ‘exercises’ in your head, and you will overcome the biggest obstacle in developing this habit.

### **3. Meditation.**

I was of two minds about which habit should be the third: meditation or journaling?

I decided on meditation, because I already mentioned gratitude journaling in #1. It can lead you to expanding your journaling practice. It led me.

I started from 1–3 entries about my wife and now I’m a journaling machine. I keep several journals for different purposes and I spend about half an hour a day journaling.

The most important effect of keeping a journal is self-knowledge. It’s beneficial for both success and happiness to know yourself.

I chose meditation, because it’s easier to start small and provides similar benefits to journaling almost immediately.

If you meditate for only two minutes a day, after 11 days you have [an enormous chance of 90%](http://blog.coach.me/getting-started-with-meditation/) to make it a lasting habit.

![(source: [Getting Started with Meditation](http://blog.coach.me/getting-started-with-meditation/) on [Coach.me](http://coach.me/) blog)](1*GdHfEXyMS1A1xPLMijU0iA.jpeg)*(source: [Getting Started with Meditation](http://blog.coach.me/getting-started-with-meditation/) on [Coach.me](http://coach.me/) blog)*

Meditation gives you very quick insights into your internal thinking mechanisms.

Tracking our self-talk, which is difficult for most of us in normal circumstances, happens automatically when you close your eyes and focus your attention on your breathing. Suddenly, a multitude of thoughts emerge and cry for your attention. You discover that ‘you are not alone’ in your head, and this realization brings innumerable (and positive) consequences.

You are given the power to step in between an impulse and a response. Instead of reacting, you may choose to act differently.

This simple power over your thought processes provides multiple benefits recognized by science: lesser blood pressure, better focus, improved health, increased performance, lesser levels of stress hormones, and so on.

Some benefits are not ‘officially’ confirmed, but so many meditation practitioners report them that it’s common knowledge: more peace of mind, higher self-control, improved self-discipline, better decision making — and this list is not comprehensive by all means.

I personally don’t think that three habits are enough for a successful and happy life. I practice dozens of them.

However, gratitude journaling, exercises and meditation will give you a very good head start.

# 5 Ways to Use Technology to Write Erotica

## How photos, news, social media and search can improve your smut

A lot of people think fiction writers sit down at their computers and magically have their stories unfold for them. Maybe that’s how it happens for some people, but I love doing research for my erotica. By that, I don’t mean having sex, though that provide fiction fodder, but rather, taking advantage of the fact that you have a wealth of research material at your fingertips, and it’s often in unexpected places. I’ve written about everything from fire eating to collaring to a spanking machine, all thanks to information I found online. Here are some ways to get started with story ideas.

![Photo by [Jonas Jacobsson](https://unsplash.com/@jonasjacobsson?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*-4ljgEm6E9rZpVTV.)*Photo by [Jonas Jacobsson](https://unsplash.com/@jonasjacobsson?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

1. **Google** (or your preferred search engine)—Sometimes I think the advice to “write what you know” can do more harm than good, or at the very least, shouldn’t be a hard and fast rule when it comes to erotica. Why? Because even if you’re one of the most sexually experienced people around, there are still going to be things you haven’t tried, and bringing a diverse roster of sexual identities and activities to your erotic stories means you can write for more markets, and you’ll probably have more fun. Considering that there’ve been erotica anthologies focused on everything from office supplies (yes, really!) to firemen (ones geared toward both gay male and heterosexual readers) and military couples, there’s a whole world of opportunities waiting for you. I know nothing about actual firefighters, but I still wore a story called “Fire Stud” for a book called *Backdraft* about gay male firefighters, by imagining what it was like to be one of them. Want to know more about military families so you can submit to Kristina Wright’s anthology [*Commanding Desire: Military Erotic Romance](http://kristinawright.com/2013/07/commanding-desire-military-erotic-romance/)*? Check out sites like [militarywives.com](http://militarywives.com/) or [Military Significant Others and Spouse Support](http://www.militarysos.com/)).

Also right up there in usefulness is Wikipedia—while it may not be a reliable source for journalistic purposes, it can provide a seemingly endless series of links to topics you’ve very likely never heard of. Sometimes when I’m stuck for a story idea, I look up [sexual fetishes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fetishism) and follow whatever links spark my interest.

2. **Pinterest, Flickr and photo blogs**—If you’re a visual person, often seeing a photograph can help inspire you in ways you never would have expected. Maybe you can’t stand the smell of smoke, but come across an image that captures a person smoking in way that’s so intriguing you can’t look away. These don’t necessarily have to be erotic photos, either. Maybe a [random photo](http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/on-the-street-edgemere-st-montauk/) at a fashion blog will prompt a question like Why would a woman bike around Montauk in just a shirt and panties? Another great place to search is sex toy stores; you can get details and precise images of products you may want to include in a story, as well as learn about items you may not even have known existed.

3. **The news**—Every day there are stories happening in all sections of the newspaper and gossip sites that could spark the beginning of an erotic story. Don’t believe me? Here are four stories I found via *The New York Times* website and the quick plot ideas they prompted: [Modern mothers escaping in the summer](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/fashion/modern-mothers-turn-to-scratch-an-itch.html?hpw)—what if two (or more) of them had a lesbian affair? [Young cigar smokers](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/health/in-all-flavors-cigars-draw-in-young-smokers.html?hpw) — maybe a dedicated cigar smoker shows a newbie how it’s done? A mother [takes her teenage son on a heavy metal cruise ](http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/42-heavy-metal-bands-2000-fans-my-son-and-me/?src=rechp)— what if she were to meet a dad on the cruise and they rocked out in their own way? [Loaner jackets at restaurants](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/dining/dressing-up-the-loaner-jacket.html?hp)—perhaps two men wind up fighting over the last one?

What’s going on in the news informs what kinds of work editors are looking for as well. There’s even a [call for submissions](http://erotica-readers.com/ERA/AR/Take_This_Man.htm) right now for *Take This Man*, an anthology of romantic gay male erotica, tied to DOMA, and a charity one [with an anti-bullying theme](http://erotica-readers.com/ERA/AR/Coming_Together_for_Equality.htm).

4. **Social media**—Similar to the news, there are erotica stories just begging to be created based on Facebook and Twitter posts. Now, does this mean you should steal your friend’s intimate revelation and turn it into smut? No, but with a bit of creativity, you can take almost anything and refashion it in your own way. Maybe a post about visiting a foreign country leads to an idea about two lovers who connect even though they don’t speak the same language. Maybe someone ‘s insomnia leads you to an idea about a character who can’t sleep and goes online in the wee hours, flirts, and through their sexy anonymous emails gets ideas on what to do with their partner during their waking hours.

5. **Technological innovation**—When I had to write a story about joining the mile high club (airplane sex), I knew I wanted to go in a different direction than either a couple getting it on in the bathroom, or seatmates sitting next to each other. This was a few years ago, when wifi was relatively new on flights. I wrote about a couple sending explicit emails, while one was back home, and one was in the air. If you have a smartphone, check out apps that help you connect with people (whether for hookups or just socializing), then use your knowledge of how they function to write a story about them. That’s the beauty of erotica—you get to keep trying on different erotic elements over and over, whether or not they’re part of your actual life. You can apply the same process of free associating with the news to tech news; for instance, the startup MeUndies [sells underwear via subscription model](http://mashable.com/2013/08/18/meundies/). What if one partner bought this for the other—or one intercepted an underwear package? Or take [Fundaware](http://mashable.com/2013/04/21/fundawear-underwear/), a line of vibrating underwear from Durex? Or create your own tech startup (in your mind) and use your creation to fuel a fantasy story.

# How to make debates positive and meaningful

## How to make debates positive and meaningful

*Did you use to watch The Daily Show with Jon Stewart?*

While he has other commendable traits, I think we could learn a lot from his communication skills.

Watch the beginning of this clip with Jon and Fox News political commentator Bill O’Reilly:


Notice the way he establishes a friendly relation between himself and Bill.

Right from the beginning there is some whimsicality, which may be a great way of taking the edge off any tensions that may be there initially.

And Jon always does this, he establishes and consolidates this friendly relation *before* getting into any debate or discussion.

What is the result of this groundwork of his?

*A much more constructive debate*, a debate in which it is possible to consider viewpoints and try to build something out of them.

You’ll see in the clip how Bill, as a consequence of Jon listening to him, also lets Jon speak and explain his train of thought before breaking in.

As a consequence of this friendly climate, Bill makes concessions which he would usually not have made.

And Jon may have learned from Bill also.

All in all, a positive climate, some collaboration and learning opportunities are to be gained from this.

So there it is, the takeaway from Jon is to ***establish and consolidate a friendly relation before getting into a debate***.

## You are what you eat

They say that you are the average of the five people you hang out with. As a proud introvert, I’m usually my own company so I not very concern about these hypothetical five people. However, I’m concerned about others forms of influence, more specifically, digital influence.

I grew up online. I still remember having to connect the RJ45 cable from my PC all the way to my parent’s room, just to have access to a slow, prepaid internet connection. By the way, the worst years of my life don’t wish that on anyone.

I also remember my cousin asking me if I knew about this new website called YouTube. And how hard it was to let go from MSN chat and join Facebook. Man, I sound like an old person…

This tells you how ingrained these websites are in my life, resulting in some unproductive habits. They served me well before specifically to learn video editing and English but now these habits are on the way. Therefore, killing these habits requires my full attention. And here is why…

I often find myself on YouTube or checking Instagram without my full consent. It’s freaky man! It’s like a tic, a twitch. No! More like a brain fart that pulls me out of my work into the land of instant gratification. I would gladly just stop this from happening but unfortunately, I’m literally not in control.

However, I am in control of how I respond once these habits take control.

## Practicing to break the loop

All habits begin with a trigger. A light, a sound or both like… I don’t know… a push notification.

That small trigger can start the habit loop and all of the sudden, you are on the passenger seat, watching. The deeper you go into the loop, the harder it is to break from it and that’s why it’s so important to become good at stopping yourself as soon as the trigger hits you.

During the past days, I have been noting down how many of these brainfarts hit me and cause me to unconsciously do something I deem unproductive. On a good day, this happens more or less 10 times and I really don’t want to tell you what I consider a bad day.

At first, it was extremely hard to catch me in these moments but with time it got easier. Our mind is like a flashlight. If we know where to point it, we will discover a bunch of s*** everywhere. Sorry, I’m new to this analogy game.

This exercise made me better at identifying these brain farts and at stopping myself from going through with the habit loop. However, it didn’t reduce the number of triggers I experienced.

## Feeding the beast

You know how on a good meal plan you have several mechanisms to make sure you don’t overeat or at least stay on the diet?

Specific meal times and cheat days guarantee you eat just enough and still allow yourself to indulge in the food you really like.
I think the same principles can be applied to a content diet.

Instead of indulging in unproductive activities, reserve an hour per day or per week specifically for these moments. By chunking them all together, the amount of time wasted is smaller and we gain more time for the important activities.
> # “How the hell does chunking time-wasting activities reduce the overall wasted time? “— You (hypothetically)

Glad you asked, my skeptic friend. This works for the same reason a cheat meal works. You still get to satisfy whatever cravings you have without feeling guilty. This makes you follow the diet and makes it easier to manage cravings because you know you will have an opportunity to eat whatever you want in the future.

Got it? :)

## Putting it all together

Consider the ability to break the habit loop like the first line of defense. A way to practice discipline by snapping out of these negative habit loops. You will notice that you get better at catching yourself in these moments especially if you also implement a self-reflection practice like journaling.

The second line of defense comes with the content diet. A plan that represents your ambitions and long-term goals.
> ***DISCLAIMER***: This plan can only be made by you, for you. Only you know what works for you. And the best way to discover what works for you is by doing. I would happily make a simple plan but I have something better. Action.

I share these type of journeys on my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/roaddelta/) *(Yes, I know how ironic this sounds)*. There you can see the struggles and what it looks like to live the content diet. That’s the best way I can help you. During this month of November, I will share my content diet, as well as my brain fart hunting expedition.

Are you up for the challenge?

PS: Number of brain farts while writing this article: 5

# This is the Fastest Way to Improve Your Life

## Vince Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in the history of professional football.

During the 1960’s, he led his team, the Green Bay Packers, to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years.

During this time, his team also won the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Today, Lombardi is part of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and the Super Bowl’s trophy is named in his honor (1).

Those are some pretty outstanding achievements. So, what was it that made this coach one of the greatest of all time?

### A Ruthless Focus on the Fundamentals

In his book, When Pride Still Mattered: A Life Of Vince Lombardi (2), author David Maraniss describes what happened when Lombardi walked into his team’s training camp in the summer of 1961:
> *He took nothing for granted. He began a tradition of starting from scratch, assuming that the players were blank slates who carried over no knowledge from the year before… He began with the most elemental statement of all. “Gentlemen,” he said, holding a pigskin in his right hand, “this is a football.”*

This is a football. Imagine being told that as a professional football player. You might just think that this guy is nuts. Yet, this methodical focus on the fundamentals was the start of Lombardi’s streak as one of the greatest football coaches in history.

And he’s not alone. A ruthless focus on the fundamentals has been a recurring theme of many successful coaches. Basketball legend John Wooden, for example, even taught his players how to put on their socks and tie their shoes (3). How’s that for fundamentals?

### The Power of Keystone Habits

It’s very easy to forget about the basics. Still, mastering them is and has always been the fastest way to improve your life.

This is because when you’ve got your fundamentals down, it tends to create a positive ripple effect across all areas of your life.

Author and habit expert, Charles Duhigg, refers to these behaviors as ‘keystone habits’ (4).

For me, exercise has always been a huge keystone habit. Whenever I work out regularly, I tend to eat better, sleep better, feel better, be way more productive and so on. Conversely, whenever I’m missing workouts, all these other areas tend to take a hit as well.

If you think about it for a minute, I’m sure you’ll identify at least one habit that tends to work the same way for you. And if not, I’ve listed out four keystone habits below that you might want to experiment with.

### How to Improve Your Life: The Principles

Now, just because you identify a possible keystone habit, that doesn’t mean it’ll be easy to stick to. If it were, it would probably already be part of your life. That’s why, before we get to the list of habits, I highly recommend you keep these principles in mind when implementing them:

1. **One change only.** That’s all you need. If you execute well on one keystone habit, the rest will likely fall into place by themselves.

1. **Make it so small you can’t say no.** When you’re starting out, always aim for a goal that is so small that it requires no willpower at all.

1. **Use a trigger.** Anchor your new habit to a behavior that is already a natural part of your daily routine. For example, exercise (new habit) right after breakfast (old habit).

1. **Track your efforts.** Use an app like [Coach.me](http://coach.me/) or [Beeminder](http://beeminder.com/) to keep track of your efforts. This will help build momentum and motivation.

1. **Review your progress.** A [weekly review](http://www.selfication.com/weekly-planning/) is an excellent way to do this. If your habit fails, figure out why, and improve your method. Or try another keystone habit.

Sound good? Let’s get to it!

### 4 Fundamental Keystone Habits

**1. Eating healthy.** It’s easy to forget about this, but the food we eat heavily influences how we feel and perform every day. As I write about in [The Science of Willpower](http://www.selfication.com/the-science-of-willpower/), the Glycemic Index (GI) (5) is a great resource for choosing what to eat. Low-GI foods associated with decreased risk for disease (cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, stroke, depression and more) and it also helps strengthen your self-control (6). So, add a vegetable to one of your meals. Eat a healthy snack in the afternoon. Pick one high-GI food and cut it out. Keep making a tiny dietary tweak like this every week and you’ll be surprised at how quickly your diet (and your tastebuds) changes.

**2. Exercise.** We all know physical activity is essential to our health and well-being. What’s perhaps more surprising is that neuroscientists have found that it’s also crucial for the brain’s ability to learn (7). So, if you want to be at your best — physically as well as mentally — exercise needs to be a regular part of what you do. [Establish an exercise routine](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-start-exercising/) where you start too light, make tiny gains every week, and refuse to miss workouts.

**3. Sleep.** This is perhaps the most overlooked keystone habit there is. If you want to be healthy and perform well, [proper sleep](http://www.selfication.com/why-sleep-is-important/) is an absolute necessity. Start prioritizing your sleep by setting clear rules for your evenings. Set an alarm in the evening to remind yourself to turn off all your screens at least one hour before bedtime. Spend this last hour winding down (reading, meditating, journaling, or something else you find relaxing). Turn your bedroom into a haven for sleep by making it slightly cool and as dark as you can to help your body relax deeply.

**4. Meditation.** This simple practice is a very powerful way to reduce stress and anxiety, increase creativity, sharpen mental focus, strengthen social relationships and much, MUCH more (8). I find myself recommending [regular meditation](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-practice-mindfulness/) to clients all the time. Take a couple of minutes each day to sit in silence and focus on your breath. When you find yourself lost in thought, gently and non-judgmentally return your attention to the flow of the breath. Repeat this process until the time is up.

### Sum Up

* If you want to be great, focus ruthlessly on the fundamentals.

* Keystone habits are behaviors that tend to create positive ripple effects across all areas of your life.

* Stick to the principles: One change at a time, make it so small you can’t say no, use a trigger, track your efforts & review your progress.

* The four fundamental keystone habits are; Eat, Move, Sleep & Meditate.

Let’s get back to the basics!

# To be Truly Indispensable, Make Yourself Dispensable

## To be Truly Indispensable, Make Yourself Dispensable

In the current age of massive technological disruption,** the path to success as a [knowledge worker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker)** is not to work to become indispensable, but to work to **become** **dispensable**.

In the long run a robot or even just an algorithm is probably going to come along and make us all completely dispensable, but until then, here’s a few things we can do as knowledge workers to stave off deskilling in our increasingly automated world, and also manage the ever increasing amount of information available.

## Forget Indispensable…

We all want to be needed. It feels good. But sometimes we go about becoming indispensable in scarcity-driven ways.

It’s maybe trying to look busy and important, or being involved with everything or across everything. Maybe micromanaging. Maybe not bothering to fix the root cause, because we know how to do the fire fighting when it comes up. Maybe leaving that long tedious processes in place that only we know how to maintain. Maybe not commenting code or documenting systems and processes. Maybe hoarding knowledge instead of sharing it with others.

This is scarcity driven behaviour, and yes we can all probably recall scenarios where being indispensable in this way has been rewarded. **But as a knowledge worker in this age of technology, working to be dispensable is a better strategy.**

## Try Dispensable…

![](1*p1x_e0hRVQRbNL0DQ2FhYw.png)

## 1. Ignore Low Yield Tasks
> # Roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

The 80:20 or Pareto principle tells us that 20% of the inputs produce 80% of the outputs — meaning 20% of the inputs are very high yield. Applying this to knowledge work means choosing the right things to do. Often these activities lie in the upper right “non-urgent but important” area of the Eisenhower Quadrants ([popularized by the late Stephen Covey](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01069X4H0/?ref=idea_lv_dp_ov_d)). In the modern information-overloaded world of work, ignoring the low yield tasks, (which are often then the “urgent yet non important” 80%), and focusing on the high yield activities is more useful than ever.

## 2. Multiply Knowledge
> # Share the knowledge you have with others.

[Liz Wiseman](https://twitter.com/LizWiseman) [wrote a great book called Multipliers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KT18416/?ref=idea_lv_dp_ov_d), which forced me to ask some hard questions about my own workplace behaviors.

Ask yourself — am I a “diminisher”? Do I try to be the one who has the “right” answer all the time?

Or are you a “multiplier”? Do I share knowledge freely and acknowledge when I don’t know or am wrong?

This time has also been called the Information Age, and now more than ever, hoarding information is a weak strategy. Make yourself dispensable by sharing what you know freely with others, to multiply knowledge.

## 3. Replace Yourself
> # [“Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Y98RG8/?ref=idea_lv_dp_ov_d)
> # [— The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Y98RG8/?ref=idea_lv_dp_ov_d)

This is probably the most important thing you can do. Always be on the lookout for ways to automate your job further, or to make things more efficient.
> If you aren’t looking for ways to automate your job, you can be absolutely sure that **someone else** in your organization, or** *something else** (technology!), *is going to find a way to do it for you!

Replacing yourself — making yourself dispensable in your current role via the use of technology or more efficient process — not only helps your organization improve, but also allows you to be redeployed for other work, making you an asset more indispensable than ever.

# What can you do for 10 minutes every day that will change your life?

## Anything you come up with. Seriously.

It blows my mind when I think about it. In 2012, the very first step I took on the path to changing my life was writing down goals for six areas of my life: career, self-development, relationships, spiritual, health and finance.

For 16 years I was neglecting any self-analysis, any serious thoughts about the future. I abandoned any hope of creating my life consciously. Then **within 20 minutes**, I wrote down some goals and ideas for daily disciplines. I came up with 15 disciplines. I didn’t seriously try to implement five of them. I did start the remaining ten. Three and a half years have gone by, and I still practice six of them. My life didn’t just change, it exploded.

**Stunning Results**

The changes I introduced weren’t grand. Each of them took me no more than 10 minutes a day. One took me almost nothing, it was a decision [to save $60 from my monthly salary](http://www.expandbeyondyourself.com/money-mindset/). One transfer a month takes about a minute.

But as a result of those disciplines, I’m a different person. [I’m a writer](http://www.amazon.com/Michal-Stawicki/e/B00D0MNDJU/)! **Not a single one of the above-mentioned disciplines involved writing**, not even by a stretch. In my career goals, I wrote something about being proficient with database administration, ha, ha.

I live in my own house. I assure you that $60 a month collected for three and a half years doesn’t even sum up to four monthly installments of the mortgage.

However, the final effect of my disciplines are not as stunning as the fact that **these ideas were inside me all the time** just waiting for extraction.

Get this picture, let it sink.

**No self-reflection in 16 years.** But these 15 ideas which were written down were crucial. Six of them are still valid and contributing to my transformation.

**Over 50% Accuracy**

Even those disciplines which I started and abandoned somewhere along the way have helped me.

One of them was home-schooling my son. He had grades well below his abilities. He finished a school year twice with honors and had a solid B+ in his final exam of primary school. He reads twice as fast as at the beginning and has read about 25 books in the process.

Another discipline I abandoned was studying professional documentation. I did that for 10 minutes a day. I passed 3 exams and got a couple of certificates. I quit that around April 2014. Thanks to the new certificates, in 2015 I got a new job which pays about 35% better.

They were the right answers for me at that time. **This is over 50% accuracy!** Can you believe this? No training, no reflection, nothing, and your every second idea for changing your life is **right on the spot!**

**The Six I Still Practice**

1. Speed reading

I read about twice as fast as in September 2012. I read during my practice sessions at least dozen of books I wouldn’t have read otherwise including *On War* by Clausewitz, *The Odyssey* and *The Iliad* by Homer and *Think and Grow Rich* by Napoleon Hill.

2. Bible study

Hey, sometimes I even understand the scripture!

3. Pullups/ chinups

I started from 14 chinups. My last record is 46.

4. Reading a book written by a saint

I’ve read 40 so far.

5. Talking to strangers (kudos to [Shrey Kataria](https://www.quora.com/profile/Shrey-Kataria)!).

Just one story:

*One day, traveling to work, I noticed that the lady sitting next to me was reading a book on an interesting subject — raising a disabled child. I started a conversation by asking about the book. She recommended it wholeheartedly. To keep the ball rolling, I asked her what her relationship was to disabled children.*

*She said she was a social or medical worker, I didn’t dig for more details. Anyway, she worked with disabled children and their families on a daily basis. She told me how rewarding her job is. Some of her words: “pure love, simplicity, sincerity, no pretending, even … mysticism.”*

*I remarked how happy she seemed to have such a job. She confirmed this after a second of reflection. It seemed to be a kind of revelation to her. We talked a little more about the lives of disabled people, their families. We talked about life, and about God. It was a truly enriching experience.*

6. Saving $60 a month.

It allowed me to improve my money mindset. Now I earn about twice as much as in 2012.

**Your Turn**

Take pen and paper, sit down and brainstorm several goals in above mentioned areas of life.

Ask yourself: what can I do for 10 minutes a day to get closer to achieving that goal? Even if you neglected self-analysis for 16 years you have more than 50% chances for life-changing answers.

Then execute on them. Every. Single. Day.

# Do you have an A-Team?

## 

### Think about the ten people you are around the most.

Are they supportive? Inspiring?

Have characteristics or traits you aspire to?

Or are they **vampires **sucking your energy or don’t encourage you to grow as an individual?

Your friends, family, co-workers or workout buddies could be in a different place than you, resulting in pulling you to to do more and be more (yea!) or blocking your path and holding your head under water. With work, you may be really career-oriented right now while someone else is focusing on their family. You may be ready to race a marathon while your running partner can’t fathom anything more than a 10k. You want to cut off all internet and email after 7pm but your wife wants to spend an hour on Facebook or Reddit. Rarely are you going to go through your life with the people around you moving at the same pace.

I have participated in several types of sports and have trained with several people over the years. Some I have become good friends with, others were training buddies. As people progressed, regressed, changed sports, changed jobs or changed locations, I changed who I trained with. I never let a friend/training partner’s choice dictate what I was doing or hold me back in any way. If I needed to move on or find someone else, I did.

The people I gravitated toward, and still do, are considered my ‘**A-Team**‘. In the A-Team, one of my favorite shows from the 80s, each member had their own specialty and was respected for what they did best. I like to surround myself with people who also have a specialty, preferably one that I don’t, so that I can learn from them. I didn’t know how to paddle a few of years ago so of course I wanted a teammate that was a strong paddler. Not so that they can take more of the load, but so that I could learn from them. When I tried to learn to navigate, so I looked for someone who had an easy teaching style and patience to sit down with me.

### Who is on your A-Team?

Do you surround yourself with people you can learn from?

People who are better than you at whatever aspect of your life you are trying to improve on, i.e.business, finance, public speaking, health?

Or do **you **like to be the **best **and surround yourself with the B-Team?

If you are always hanging out with benchwarmers to make yourself feel better, you’re probably going to get stuck at the level of fabulous that you are right now until you are no longer fabulous.

I used to keep my toxic relationships a lot longer then I needed to and one thing about getting older is I realize I don’t have to. If a friendship is exhausting it’s not really a friendship, it is a chore. If a work colleague is poison than trying to minimize time with them may be the only thing you can do. If it’s a family member…well, that might be a visit to a mental health counselor to prepare and to debrief! One of my goals at every race was for people to want to race with me again. Not because I am kick-ass physically, but because I am supportive, mature, and willing to make sacrifices for the team. If I am fun, charming or the best at a discipline then that is even better. It was always the same when I was a part of a team at work.

I have an A-Team for different things: Business, Racing, Finance, Relationships, Personal Growth, etc. I have a lot of people that support me but that doesn’t necessarily mean they **get **me. Some people may not even realize that I am looking at them in order to make myself a better person. They are on my A-Team because they inspire me organically, not because it’s something they are even trying to do.
> **I hope you have an A-Team. Life is too short to sit around on the bench.**

# Networking Circles

## 

A member of my [Los Angeles based networking dinner group ExecTec](http://bit.ly/ExecTec) and I were chatting the other day about managing one’s networks. They were concerned that they had devalued the usability of one of the online tools they were using because they had over connected with people.

This got me thinking about my theory of networking circles. In short, one needs to decide which networking tools one wants to use and for which purpose.

For some, Linkedin lends itself to professional and trusted networking while Facebook lends itself to a more socially/friendly crowd of school friends. The real challenge is where to draw the line as to who to connect with and where if at all.

Many maintain strict rules about who they connect with in these two more trusted networks. By limiting connections to people you actually know or have had more than minimal connections with it is possible to maximize the quality and usefulness of these tools. This also allows you to be a bit more free to share (remembering that one must be willing to live with whatever they say online) among friends and trusted associates.

The crux of the problem is what to do with people who might want to get to know you and who might prove to be valuable but are not yet part of your trusted inner circle. This is where some of the other broader social networking tools come to play. Sites like Twitter, Quora, Instagram, Blogs/comments and even a group like [ExecTec](http://bit.ly/ExecTec) can all allow you to have ever broader relationships without compromising one’s inner networking circles by including people you have not really gotten to know yet.

These tools allow you to develop and track relationships with those who are or might be of interest to you but who you do not yet know well enough to bring into your more trusted networking circles.

Twitter is great for getting to know people from far and wide and is very interest related based on who you choose to follow. I know of someone who, via twitter, came to know an author she respected and had written about on her blog. After a few casually virtual interactions the author happened to tweet he was in the city she lived in and when she reached out and the author invited her to dinner.

Likewise, Quora is a tool that allows you to follow topics of interest as well as people at large. By commenting, voting up and thanking those who participate in the site you are creating positive interactions and you can even choose to answer a few questions of your own sharing your expertise and improving your own social presence.

Instagram allows those more visually inclined to engage and or be engaged with on various topics. The images are in some ways more personal and allow more natural/organic interactions with followers or people you follow who you might have a more casual connection with.

The idea is to not limit your potential interactions but allows looser connections to work their way into the inner circles or more closely held tools.

This technique can also work well for companies who fear that their social media efforts will swamp their available time while producing no or little return for their efforts. Having a strategy that allows a large potential audience to reach out and interact while preserving an inner circle where more detailed information can be shared and interactions can get more real is good for both the company and their audience.

A Facebook page or product forum might be more of an inner circle, in this case, becoming a place for those customers and evangelist of a product to engage with the company and each other while not crossing these customers with the noise of your marketing the product to others.

The key is to manage your networking tools so that you preserve the inherent value while still being open to creating and interacting with new contacts. After all, networking is never static and is as much about new and potential relationships as it is about one’s existing relationships.

# Leaping the Impossible Gap

## Leaping the Impossible Gap

### From Disability to an Open Mind

Imagine having half the taste of your tongue, would you enjoy the same food you do now? Imagine seeing half the colors, would you not want to see the colors beyond your own perception? Now, anyone who is an audiophile wouldn’t even dare think about losing even one bit of hearing.

Here is a test: Plug one ear and try listening to your favorite music or just sit outside and listen to nature. What seems different? Can’t tell which direction a sound is coming from? Is it behind you? Is it to your left or your right? Can you hear the bass or the subtle sounds of your favorite track? You might have unplugged your ear now in amazement that you can be so limited to your hearing. You wouldn’t possibly want that for your entire life, would you?

This is who I am.

Born with one ear has its graces and curses, some an advantage and some a disadvantage. Overall, I worked with what I have and made it my own. I have been afflicted with golden har syndrome, a condition which affected my ear, spine, kidney and cleft palate. I was only two when my mother found the great hospital and organization that is the Shriners of Chicago. That’s where my humanification began.

At age 2 my mother took me to the Shriners Hospital of Chicago where I met my future surgeons. They examined my condition and told my mother to come every so often till I reached age 6 where my surgery would begin. Thee hospital to me was very welcoming and I could never see myself going anywhere else. This hospital was special than public hospitals. Not as depressing as larger hospitals.

![Shriners Hospital for Children of Chicago](0*rdCwQPiZwgi6euR2.jpeg)*Shriners Hospital for Children of Chicago*

Once the day of the surgery began I was nervous and didn’t know how it was going to go. I didn’t understand what they were saying but went with knowing something would come out of it. I got dressed in my gown and headed to the operating room. They injected my IV. I still can feel to this day the pain and the uncomfortable feeling of IV in my vein. Once I surfaced from sleep I was made anew.

I felt myself to make sure I was still on this earth. I felt the head wrap on my head, the tubes of blood that sucked out the blood in my ear canal from my new ear. Then I checked my body to see if I could still move. Then I felt it. The gap between my ribs where they took the bone and replaced it to my new ear. I felt uneasy about this, like my body had to make a sacrifice in order to make my new ear.

My rib has always been in the back of my mind. Wondering what would ever happen if I got hit or worse, stabbed in my open space. I never worried to much about it but still kept in mind. I still imagine life with my rib still intact. Wondered if I could have done more with my life like hard contact sports, or sea diving. This is what keeps me wondering.

This was when I met Brooks, a kid that had facial issues that was the same age as me. I had no care in the world and only worried about himself and his happiness in that time in his life. We would both watch movies like Little Rascals and The Sandlot while eating tooty fruity ice cream that came in little cups. I was only confined in a wheelchair and so was he when he got out of the operating room. We both were the same ultimately both kids with surgeries who just wanted the best in childhood. Nothing could replace the feeling. Even if I was in pain post-surgery.

Brooks and the many of other kids I met during my continuing journey at Shriners has been insightful. They showed me that the ones that are the least privileged and disabled see the world more than anyone else in the world. They are the true explorers of life. They don’t need legs or a body to go where they want to be. They just have to observe. See life at its most basic form even if they don’t understand it. They see that anything that comes their way is important and a life changing moment for them from small to large.

I am privileged to be among these adventurers have my endless gratitude. For I am among them but not on the same level as them. I am the hybrid of both sides. I can only see a glimpse of their view while I see all of the human side of life. In the end of the day, it comes to observation. If you can only take one thing out of this sonata of words, it is to be more aware of the world and be thankful of what you have because there is another person who would wish or look at you as ignorant. Once you realize this you will achieve the most broadest view of the world imaginable.

# A Simple Plan To Win The Year

## A Simple Plan To Win The Year

### For Ages 26 And Older. Or Younger.

There’s this pithy quote floating around the web that I really like:
> In school, you’re taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you’re given a test that teaches you a lesson.

The one thing I *don’t* like about it is that it makes it sound like you have to wait to be given the test either way. You don’t. You can decide to take your own test any day of the week and when you do, you’ll learn a lesson instantly.

At the end of 2015, I designed such a test for myself: Learn something from a new book every day, whether that’s a chapter, a full book, a summary, or tons of interviews, and then [write about it](http://fourminutebooks.com/). Every day for the next year. The day I made the decision I already learned the first lesson.

## The New Year Starts Today

In [*Do The Work](http://amzn.to/2BxGVA2)*, Steven Pressfield writes:
> “Don’t prepare. Begin. Remember, our enemy is not lack of preparation; it’s not the difficulty of the project or the state of the marketplace or the emptiness of our bank account.
> The enemy is Resistance. The enemy is our chattering brain, which, if we give it so much as a nanosecond, will start producing excuses, alibis, transparent self-justifications, and a million reasons why we can’t/shouldn’t/won’t do what we know we need to do. Start before you’re ready.”

As I prepared the website I thought “why not start writing also? It’ll be like a rolling start in a car race.” More like flying.

A big part of why [92% of people fail their New Year’s resolutions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/01/01/just-8-of-people-achieve-their-new-years-resolutions-heres-how-they-did-it/#1094c807596b) is that they think the switch is magical if they flip it on January 1st. But the switch is never magical and you can flip it any day. You can start a new year any day of the year. You’re not a calendar.

When you do it in December, you can fail a lot before January 1st and you won’t need pseudo-motivation to start because you can just keep going.

## An Ode To December

Ever since I learned that lesson, December has become my busiest month of the year. Not with business, but with thinking. “What goals make sense for the next year? How can I make them simpler? What can I do to start today?”

Here’s what I’ve come up with this year.

## 1. Set A Simple, Insane Goal

Talking about [cryptocurrency investing](http://cryptoletter.co) with a successful friend, I asked him: “What’s a good goal for me next year?” Without knowing how much I have, he said: “One million dollars.”

He explained: “Look, last year, around Christmas, I set a completely utopian goal. Not because I need the money. Just because. And I completely destroyed it.”

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The obvious, but hard to practice thinking behind this is that you can’t get a result that’s ten times bigger without a radically different approach. While everyone’s clawing for 1,000 more followers, can you sweat behind the curtain until you’re good enough to pop up on Oprah?

The path to bigger goals is always harder, less straightforward and more people will think you’re crazy. But it’s also less crowded.

Higher risk, more return. Speaking of which.

## 2. Completely Detach Yourself From Your Goal

The shrug emoji above is actually quite important. The reason my friend was so comfortable in setting such an insane goal is that [he knew he didn’t control even half of it](https://medium.com/personal-growth/how-to-deal-with-anxiety-the-art-of-detachment-6336f28c6003).

“You just do the best you can with what you’ve got, you go all in and then you let go.” Sticking with the one million dollar example, he continued: “You’d need to put in 100k and 10x that. But even if you pull off the first part, 90% of the result is out of your control. That’s fine, but that’s what it is.”

If your first thought is “I want a million dollars,” then your second thought should be “I don’t need a million dollars.” Not now, not ever.

What I like about my friend’s line of thinking is that it doesn’t artificially try to increase the part I control. More control just means more work. If I let go I can [aim higher while focusing on less](https://medium.com/personal-growth/12-ways-detachment-will-make-you-more-successful-8a4be99b7b60). I’ll probably like where I end up regardless.

## 3. Put All Your Energy Into 2–3 Core Strengths

Once you’ve placed your target on the moon, you can return to earth, turn your back on it and start digging. For short- to mid-term projects it makes sense to break it all down into small packages. For long-term, life-changing, way-out-there goals, that’s just depressing.

Which activities, if you do them long enough, will get you there? Which of those are you good at? Where have you already built assets you can work with?

Pick 2–3 of your core strengths and find a way to funnel those into your goal. How can you spend more time doing them? What others can you let go? If you’re already going strong, you can just keep going. For me it’s writing, saving a big share of my income and investing that as best as I can.

That’s it. Often, you need to change less of your day-to-day than you think.

## 4. Let Things Fall By The Wayside

Since this approach is so simple, what exactly I write, how much of my income I save, where* *I invest it, and so on, are all secondary. As long as I *do* those things, I’ll eventually get there.

As [someone who thrives on plans](https://betterhumans.coach.me/this-framework-will-make-you-better-at-changing-your-habits-226f12f4375), this is hard to wrap my head around. “Oh, I don’t need an exact portfolio allocation right now? Right, I don’t.” Even if you can follow a rigid, step-by-step plan, chances are you’ll get bored of it halfway through. But besides robbing you of the fun, tunnel vision also blindsides you to new opportunities along the way.

If a faster train to your goal passes you at the 50% marker, you first need to see it in order to jump on. But even before that, you have to buy a ticket.

## 5. Start Before You’re Ready

You don’t feel ready now, do you? That means it’s as good a time as ever.

What’s *your* goal? Can you make it bigger? Let go? Which activities will get you there? How much minutiae can you get rid of?

Don’t wait for life to give you a test. Design your own. If not now, when ever? It’s a new year, after all. And it starts today.

# The Power of Doing the Same Thing Every Day

## 

Imagine. You wake up every day at exactly the same time. You eat the same breakfast, do the same workout exercises, take the same route to work. Have lunch at the same place every day. Use the same apps every day. You practice the same skills.

Sounds boring, doesn’t it?

I thought so too until I discovered how many advantages there are to consistency and a well-planned routine.

## The Advantages of Routinizing Your Life

If I maintain the same morning routine, I never feel groggy when I wake up. I never forget my wallet or my phone. I never forget my car keys or where I parked my car.

If I maintain my food routine, I never have headaches or stomach aches. I never feel hungry or drained. I never have a meal that I don’t like.

If I maintain my same exercise routine, I never get injured or have sore muscles. I never lack the energy to exercise. I never have to wait my turn for a machine at the gym.

When you look at the list above it looks very unrealistic, almost like fiction. But that’s really how it works. If you figure out what keeps you at peak performance and you never deviate, you will never have to deal with those problems again.

## Eat the Same Food Every Day

I started experimenting with food when I was first trying to get in shape. So after doing some research, I figured out what my body needs and wrote down a few example meals to have for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.

Naturally, it wasn’t perfect at first. Sometimes I felt hungry or I didn’t like the meal. But after a month or so of tweaking, I was to the point where I was really happy. I loved all my meals, they gave me the energy I needed and kept my body in shape.

My 3 meals + snacks were quite diverse and included all the necessary nutrients that I needed, so I didn’t have to diversify from day to day.

After doing that for a month or so, I started noticing the advantages really quickly.

### Results Are Predictable and Controllable

Predictability sounds boring, but when it comes to goals, it’s really useful.

When we’re setting goals, we try to predict the action steps that will get us there. But that’s just a guesstimate. If you’ve never worked on that goal before, there’s no way to know with certainty if it’s going to get you the result that you want.

However, if you do the same thing for a few weeks, you start to notice the trends really quickly.

For example, if you eat the same meals every day for a month and lose 2–3 pounds, you can safely predict that you’ll lose 2–3 more pounds next month with the same routine.

This is much more reliable than setting a random goal and trying to reach it by constantly modifying your diet. Instead of guessing the results, this method relies on previous performance to predict the outcome.

### You Don’t Need Willpower

Since you’re doing the same thing every day, it becomes a habit pretty quickly. After that, you don’t really need much effort or discipline to maintain the same routine.

You don’t have to make the decision to stay away from sugar every day. You skip the temptation altogether.

After doing that for long enough, you even stop looking at other foods as available options. Your mind learns that you eat only certain type of foods. You don’t even get the impulse to eat the chocolate when you see it lying around somewhere.

### Optimization and Saving Time

If you do the same routine every day, it becomes really easy to notice where the inconsistencies and time wasters are. You can save yourself huge amounts of time and effort that way.

For example, I was following the slow carb diet and ate a cup of lentils every day. Which takes about 30 minutes to prepare, cook and clean up. So instead I cooked a huge pot of lentils in the weekend and had it ready for every day. Boom, 30 minutes saved every day.

Another big optimization is the shopping. Since you need the same ingredients for foods you can buy in bulk and figure out where the easiest and cheapest place to buy foods is.

Since I know exactly what I need I only have to go to the supermarket twice a week. And I never have to throw away food because I know exactly how much I need.

## Same Wake-Up and Bedtime

This one is even better since our bodies work better with a consistent sleep schedule. The more consistent you are the better your sleep will be. You’ll also wake up refreshed and ready to go instead of feeling groggy.

### No More Sleepless Nights

When you do the same bedtime routine you take all the randomness out of it. You’ll be able to figure out all the things that disturb your sleep. You’ll figure out what it takes to have a calm and restful night.

### Every Day Will Be Productive

You know those days when you wake up and before you know it it’s 1 pm and you’ve done nothing significant? All of those are gone too.

If you do the same morning routine over and over again, it’s like you’re building a highway for your mind and body. You don’t have to carve a new path through the woods every morning.

You no longer procrastinate on the internet because you’re used to starting with your most important task first. You don’t have to use willpower since it’s already a habit.

## But I Love Variety

Variety is an important part of life, and I don’t want to discredit it. But when it comes to achieving your goals, I think it’s overrated. You can make progress much faster if you are following a consistent routine.

We’re already creatures of habit. We’re already doing mostly the same things every day.

For example, try to think of the regular meals that you’ve had in the past 2 months. I’m not talking about when you go to a restaurant and order something fancy, just the meals that you typically have every day.

I bet that most people can’t name more than 10 meals.

So since we’re already doing the same things every day, why not design that routine consciously? Why not pick the 3–4 of the best meals and have them every day?

Of course, life is very unpredictable. Shit happens. You won’t be able to make it every day perfectly, but that’s OK. That’s why we have…

## Exceptions

Having a few exceptions here and there is not a problem, quite the opposite in fact. The occasional variety will feel even more exciting and enjoyable.

It will feel like a celebration, and you won’t have to worry getting fat because you know you’ll be back in your healthy routine tomorrow.

The more organized and in control of your life you are, the more you can *afford* to be spontaneous and crazy. Since your life feels so stable and secure, having one crazy day and going completely off track won’t be a problem at all.

## Pitfalls That Come With Routine

If you do the same thing every day, there’s a tendency to get tunnel vision. You can optimize the routine and make it very efficient, but you can start losing context of the big stuff.

A great example for me was when I created a daily routine to collect all my coaching and website stats to see how my business was doing.

Coach.me didn’t have an easy way to show long term stats. You could only see those for each individual day.

So I started entering the data manually every day in a spreadsheet. In the beginning, it took about 5 minutes to check everything and write it down. In a month I had optimized the routine so much that it took me just 2 minutes a day.

I optimized it to a maximum, but only within that very limited box of entering the numbers manually. And I was stuck with that routine for months, thinking there is no further way to improve and optimize it.

But after a while, I figured out that I could spend a few hours working on it and automate the whole process. I did that (using iMacros) and the whole routine became obsolete. From 2 minutes a day, I got it down to 0.

So to avoid getting blindsided, it’s a good idea to review your routines every month or so. But don’t think about how to optimize it using incremental changes. Think out of the box. Instead of getting 10–15% better, how can you make it 150–300% better?

## But I’m Not a Mindless Robot!

I understand that’s how it might feel at first. After all, if you routinize your life and do the same thing every day, what’s the point of living?

But that’s not the point at all. You don’t routinize your whole life. Only the boring stuff. Only the chores and mindless responsibilities.

That way, you can get through those much faster and do whatever the hell you want for the rest of your day, knowing your life will still be stable.

# What Are The Best Study Hacks For College?

## While getting my Bachelor’s degree, I’ve tried every mode of study you can imagine. Go to all the classes, go to some classes, go to no classes. Self-study, group study, teaching, being taught, you name it, I’ve tried it.

[All I ever got was Bs](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-study-more-effectively/answer/Niklas-Göke).

![(Our grade scale goes from 1–4, 1.0 being the best)](1*DAKYfLqRVLDtFIUvL9JVnA.png)*(Our grade scale goes from 1–4, 1.0 being the best)*

So when I decided to go back to school, I thought why stress myself. I’ve been hacking college since the day I got here.

## **1. Hacking classes.**

In Germany, most classes aren’t mandatory. Since all we have is one final exam for most subjects, you can stay home all year, study for yourself and then ace the class.

Here in Munich, most classes are even recorded to watch at your own leisure, yet most of my fellow students still go for one reason: *they’re lazy and they feel bad if they don’t.*

Last semester, many of them went to all the lectures, did not pay attention, watched the replays, did not pay attention again, and then tried to study the slides.

What I did was to *go to every class once,* see if the professor does nothing more than read off the slides (most of them did), and then *summarized the slides myself instead.*

**For every single slide, I wrote down what it meant in one sentence**. This way, I’d end up with **6–12 dense pages of notes for each class.** All I had to do then, was study them.

![Yeah, yeah, my handwriting sucks, we’ve been over this.](1*qzLEnKAijl24-YlKDHGkaA.png)*Yeah, yeah, my handwriting sucks, we’ve been over this.*
> # **The goal of summarizing is to reduce the amount of information your brain has to hold**.

You’ll do a lot better by knowing 80% of the material in detail, rather than having an idea of 100% of it, but not really knowing what you’re talking about.

When I was all done with my summary, I would try to create **a tree structure of the material on one or two pages**, so I could have the entire class on one piece of paper.

![(doesn’t have to be fancy, as long as it works for you)](1*QL3H98spD2YRXA2P84hWEA.png)*(doesn’t have to be fancy, as long as it works for you)*

### **Bonus tip**:

Minimize the number of classes you take by going for those with *the highest credits on average*.

In my program, 6 credits per class is solid. 3 aren’t worth your time, 5 fall one credit short when adding up to modules (you need 12, 18, 24, etc.), and 8 are usually a ridiculous amount of extra work.

## **2. Hacking exams.**

Everyone I know struggles with studying for several exams in parallel. So whenever you have three in a week, shit hits the fan. You spend way too much time studying for the first and are only left with the time between exam 1 and 2 to study for the latter, and so on.

So the first thing I did was to **pick classes based on exam dates, which were spread far apart**.

Only two of my exams fell in one week, and those classes were mandatory. The earlier in the semester an exam, the better. Classes started in October, my first exam was in December. This not only meant it was far away from all the others, but also that there was less material to study.

![My first exam.](1*yrkWsSLNbBl2Rbb1uibIrA.png)*My first exam.*

The second thing I did was to **improve my exam schedule as I went along**. That December exam I only found out about in November, so I adjusted.

Same thing with a required law class. It was scheduled right between the two mandatory exams, but then the professor opened another slot for it three weeks earlier.

Was it a hassle to study the material in one week rather than three? Sure, but this way, I probably spent more time focused on law than I would have, if I’d had to study in parallel.

![(that is one big ass law book)](1*Vpo9Iro42QN19nYyHREaWw.png)*(that is one big ass law book)*
> # The best thing you can achieve when structuring your exams is peace of mind as you move towards them.

Every minute you spend in a hasty state of worry is a minute of studying lost, so optimize your schedule as best as you can.

## **3. Hacking assignments.**

In one statistics class, we were eligible to get an additional 20% of the exams points as a bonus for completing a report. Had I known this would turn into a 50-page paper about energy drink consumption, I probably wouldn’t have done it, but oh well.

![(You can download the paper [here](http://niklasgoeke.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/CBRM_FR_NG.pdf), if you’re interested)](1*SiT_CQtMYfA4b9LVUVxF0Q.png)*(You can download the paper [here](http://niklasgoeke.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/CBRM_FR_NG.pdf), if you’re interested)*

We started from scratch and went all the way from designing our own questionnaire, to surveying a sample of people to analyzing the data with SPSS.

However, **nowhere does it say you have to do assignments like this the hardest way possible**.

* Instead of designing our survey in Word, we used [Google Forms](http://forms.google.com/), to make collecting data easier.

* Instead of annoying 10 of our fellow students to complete the thing, I sent it to my email list and we collected 100 answers in 24 hours. You could also use a service like [Pollfish](https://www.pollfish.com/) and just pay for people to fill out your survey.

* Instead of formatting the 2,000 data points in Excel to let us import them to SPSS, I hired someone to do it for $20 on [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/#).

You might think outsourcing work as a student is ridiculous, but consider this:
> # **Would you pay $10 or $20 for 3–4 hours of focused study time?**

Not including the stress from fretting about the tasks and delays you encounter. Sometimes, your time really is worth more than the return of a menial task. Even, if you’re a student.

Of course, there is one big disclaimer to all the above: **none of these hacks work if you don’t**.

Ultimately, I put in just as much, if not more time into studying than I did during my Bachelor’s. But thanks to these hacks, it was a lot more fun to do so, because I could focus on the parts that mattered.

And I did it all while writing articles like this one, every single day. If I can find the time, why not you?

# How to Beat Procrastination by Creating a ‘Token Economy’

## In his book, The Now Habit (1), psychologist Neil Fiore writes about how he and his fellow psychology students back in school used to agonize for days over papers that would eventually take less than two hours to write:
> *All of these bright, doctoral-level students of human behavior were struggling as if they knew nothing about directing their own thoughts, feelings, and behavior. That seemed odd to me.*
> *The theories we studied about personality and abnormal behavior weren’t of much help. They didn’t work very well for normal problems like procrastinating, sticking to New Year’s resolutions, getting the laundry done, getting started on a twenty-page paper, or being on time to meet a friend for dinner.*
> *So I began to search for a system that really worked at giving me some control over my behavior with difficult, distasteful, or overwhelming tasks. In my search for a practical system, I discovered that B. F. Skinner, the founder of modern behaviorism, had a time clock connected to his chair.*
> *Whenever he sat down to work, he ‘punched in.’ Whenever he left his chair the clock stopped, as if he were ‘punching out’ — as I did when I worked at a supermarket, and like the ‘billable hours’ that lawyers and architects use to keep track of the time to charge their clients.*
> *This very prolific writer used a time clock! He maintained flow charts that amounted to giving himself a gold star every time he completed a small segment of work! This amazed me. I said to myself, ‘If B. F. Skinner has to use a system, then so do I.’*

This strategy of giving out gold stars (or any other symbol you see fit) for rewarding and reinforcing good behavior is known in psychology as a ‘token economy’ (2). The tokens themselves have no intrinsic value, but can later be exchanged for ‘backup reinforcers’ in the form of actual rewards.

As I’ve mentioned before, [rewarding yourself for good behavior is a crucial part of making it stick](http://www.selfication.com/the-power-of-small-wins/) and if we’re going to do it, why not use the method the founder of modern behaviorism used in his own life?

## How to Create Your Own Token Economy

Setting up your own token economy is very simple and straightforward:

**1. Create specific and measurable minimum daily quotas.** Before you can reward a step in the right direction, you’ll have to determine what that step is exactly and how you’re going to measure it. One way to do this that is similar to B.F. Skinner’s approach is to use the Pomodoro technique (3) and give yourself a set number of tokens for each completed 25-minute session.

**2. Get some kind of token to reward yourself with.** This could be gold stars, coins, poker chips or something else you happen to have laying around the house. Each time you successfully reach your minimum daily quota, reward yourself with X number of tokens. Then start stacking your tokens where you can see them every day to create an inspiring visual representation of your progress that you’ll want to keep building every day.

**3. Set up your backup reinforcers.** These are the rewards you get to exchange your tokens for. The key here is to reward yourself with things that keep you moving toward, and not away from, your long-term goal (4). In other words, don’t celebrate a good week of running by eating chocolate cake, but rather by getting a new piece of running equipment. Create a list of backup reinforcers that allows you to progressively build the identity of the person you want to become. For the running example this could be:

* Water bottle — 5 tokens.

* Running socks — 10 tokens.

* Portable music player — 15 tokens.

* Pedometer — 20 tokens.

* Running shoes — 100 tokens.

* Entry to Marathon — 500 tokens.

This is not a perfect token economy by any means, but I’m sure you get the point. What’s important is that you create a list of rewards that gives you an ever-increasing sense of accomplishment and competence. If you can do that, you’ll create the [motivation](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-motivate-yourself/) necessary to reach your goals.

# the opportunity of a life time

## the opportunity of a life time

### Get 1000 customers cheap — the new media revolution. Are you missing out?

Building a business is cheaper then it was 50 years ago. Today we have systems already set up around the world to bring our ideas to reality cheaply in a third world country.


Our business is globalized and connected to an ever growing platform — the internet.

Our customers our connected and tend to share more data about themselves for free of cost.Most importantly the price for acquiring customers has gone down dramatically.

Today we have the opportunity to build our first 1000 customers very cheaply.

### **Content Marketing that Works.**

Information for the most part is a commodity since it can reach everybody in a matter of time.

It is consumed, shared and used everyday on the internet. Because of this huge demand from consumers for micro information whether it be on platforms like Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, Vine, Blogs, Apps, Kindles etc.

Some say we live in the age of digital information — where knowledge is freely accessible to the consumers.

But the untold truth is that big brands are being built online from content attracting the masses who have clinching thirst to seek information to common problems and new ideas.

Entrepreneurs have an opportunity to ride this tsunami as our cultures shifts and new behavior patterns emerge.

If you can create content that works. If you can create content that sells, then marketing becomes extremely cheap.

It’s cheap because of the relatively new and free platforms on the internet — the social media.

Millions of micro content is being consumed on these platforms by your potential customers.

The internet has created extraordinary platforms for producers to produce great content and consumers to consume it.

This innovation has led to the disruption of old media, broken control from ‘gatekeepers’ and rewritten rules for new the media — *A better media.*

A media focused on letting content rise to the surface through the votes of the people.

A media that is truly democratic. *For the people, by the people.*

Success of social media has changed how we understand view, consume and share information. These platforms have sparked connections that yielded revolutions and movements that changed the world. And that’s because this new media closing the communication gaps.

Having easy accessibility to communicate with customers for free, and for customers to make an impact on the global community has morphed small tribes and communities all over the internet.

Now more than ever, the opportunity for any start-up/business to build it’s first 1000 customers if, and only if, they have something of value to offer and the chops to execute.

“They say 40% of each and every day is simply a set of learned habit you blindly follow. From the place you have lunch everyday to the gym workout you do at 5pm every night to the chocolate cake you gorge on every Saturday night. **If you want to truly be productive harness the power of habits to propel you into success in 2016.** For instance, I made it a habit to write on Quora each day for 48 days and after simply doing it for a short time but keeping it consistent I was able to break 1,000,000 views on my answers. Now after missing writing for even one day on Quora it feels weird to me. Habits are those actions you take that if you miss them something doesn’t feel quite right. Your life is a collective of these choices you have made in the past and if they don’t reflect your current goals actively choose them and you’ll find you won’t recognize yourself in 3 months.”

“The number one change that I recommend to boost productivity is to **plan your day the evening before**. What meetings or obligations do you have to prepare for? What tasks are you planning to complete tomorrow, and within that list, what are your top three high priority items that represent your long-term goals? Spend the evening planning ahead (when mental energy is exhausted) so that in the morning you can tackle those high priority items with more self discipline, creativity, and enthusiasm. You can hit the ground running and make an impact before the daily distractions of everyday life start to surface.”

“Everyone one starts off super motivated when they begin to tackle a new project or goal. However, they often taper off over time. It becomes ‘work’, or maybe life gets in the way. My advice to someone who might be encountering a slow down is to **just do something every day, no matter how small, that is a step toward their goal**. Motivation fluctuates, but building the habit that you’ll do something every day will go a long way towards maintaining and building momentum when you can get back into it at full speed.”

“**Are you BUSY? Or are you PRODUCTIVE?** Busy people get manipulated by time, whereas high performers control their time. We hear it all the time, busy people complaining about being TOO BUSY. Well, have you ever heard a productive person complain about being TOO PRODUCTIVE? Being busy is an indicator of time management. Productivity is manifested through a purpose. Stop waiting for a miracle to happen before taking action, stop looking for others to inspire you, because if you can’t inspire yourself to take action then your dreams aren’t big enough! So are you busy or are you productive?”

“**Put no more than 3 action items on your to do list each day**. One of those actions is your number one priority. This is the first action on the list. The one thing that you will do first. Start nothing new before you finished this action. It will take some effort to do this. You will change from wanting to get as much as possible done to actually getting your most important thing done.
From efficiently checking items of your todo list to effectively doing the most important thing that you need to do one day at a time. Enjoy your new light todo list.”

“Here’s my ‘**SEED Strategic Model**‘ and it is a strategic framework to skyrocket your productivity:
– **Strengths**: what are your strengths & capabilities? Work on increasing awareness on what you are good at or skills that you need to acquire. Know what your best working hours are and spend more time there.
– **Environment**: how is your environment affecting your productivity? Develop an awareness on this and find out what are the distractions or people affecting your current productivity.
– **Expectations**: do you have high goals/high expectations? if the goals are the fuels, expectation could really be the break, so be careful with your expectations.
– **Development**: what’s your level of action today? Reorganize your time for email checking, social networks or multi-tasking. Small changes mean big results. Start small by better planning, limit the number of times to check emails, more uni-tasking.
Plant the SEED to maximize your productivity.”

“It’s easy to be really busy knocking stuff off your to-do list but actually achieve very little. To boost your result and maintain balance, get to know why you are doing everything on there — where does it fit into your life? The best way to do this is to **take an hour to map your life roles** (e.g. partner, parent, businessman, student) and your goals in each. If a task or project doesn’t fit those roles and goals, WHY ARE YOU DOING IT? This helps you say “NO” to unimportant things. Have a great 2016!”

“**Realize that feeling good now is not the answer to long term happiness**. Long term happiness, success and peace come when we can overcome the urge for instant gratification. Instead of running away from our feelings we need to face them head-on. Be aware of these feelings and stay with them. Trying to fight or ignore them will only make you more resistant to action.
Identify the negative effects of delaying the task: ‘I end up leaving it until the last minute and I’ll be in a panic’ or ‘It’s stressful to feel like something is left undone.’ Recognize the benefits of starting now: ‘I’ll be free to go out and do what I enjoy, without the guilt and worry about the unfinished task”. Just start! Starting is the hardest thing to do. Break down the big goal into smaller manageable sub-tasks and just start with the easiest task. Once you’re in the flow, the goal will take care of itself.”

“The top advice ‘how to increase productivity’ from me is simple: **use correct planning and time management**. That’s all you need to work productively on any goal you have. Correct planning means you can plan everything for any period of time and control your way with checkpoints, which you figured out during planning. Make your first step — note all you want to achieve in 10, 5, 3 years. Than for a year and divide step-by-step for every month, week and day. And never forget to plan your entertainment!”

“**Simplify your life and cut back on being busy. **This will allow you to focus on what really matters.

Simplifying means you reduce or eliminate activities that are often distractions, obligations or inefficiencies. Continually look for ways to simplify your days and simplify the way you do things. Free up your time and energy so that you can dedicate it to your long-term goals and to things that are really important for you.”

“There is no silver bullet for productivity improvement. Your advances are going to come from a variety of sources. My simple advice is to** give yourself permission to say “no”**. You’re going to be asked to do things that distract you and detract from your goals. Don’t do them. Politely say “no”, and get back to work. You may have to give up some short-term gains, but in the long term your ability to say “no” will enable you to focus on things that matter.”

“**Set a maximum of 3–6 priorities for your day, to make your day more productive and less stressful**.

This allows you to:

1 — Determine your most important tasks (MIT’s) that need to get done that day
2 — Set realistic expectations for what you can accomplish in a day
3 — Stay focused throughout the day
4 — Stay motivated throughout the day
5 — Enjoy a feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day
6 — Rest and recharge

By focusing on your priorities throughout the day, you can rest at the end of each day in the satisfaction that you’ve accomplished your most important tasks for the day.”

“To be productive in 2016 focus on the important and not the urgent. As the new year rolls in, we start thinking of all the things we want to accomplish. So staying on task and avoiding distractions may just be the hardest part of accomplishing your goals. But if you really want to be productive, you’ve got to make it a point to do fewer things. Again doing the important and not the urgent can be the single most important step to becoming productive. Keep your end goal in mind and everyday do something to move yourself forward to a more productive year.”

# How To Handle A Toxic Manager

## Toxic bosses are everywhere, but everything can be ok. These tips will help.

![[You may not even need one of these.](https://unsplash.com/photos/6tiytXTQ3Yg)](1*Se2JWXbXYoAgSnkMOWA9AA.jpeg)*[You may not even need one of these.](https://unsplash.com/photos/6tiytXTQ3Yg)*

### Toxic bosses are blessed with rare abilities.

They have the rare ability to disengage us from otherwise meaningful and rewarding work. The rare ability to take high performing employees and turn them into incompetent fools who should feel lucky to be employed. The rare ability to single-handedly demotivate and de-energize an entire team, department, and organization.

I’ve worked for more than one toxic boss over the course of my career, and have lived to write about it.
> I’ve been belittled and told I was unqualified for my job in front of people who reported to me. 
I’ve been informed that I wasted my money on college tuition. 
I’ve been asked if I give a shit about my work (loudly, in an open cubicle farm).

All of this was completely and absolutely undeserved, although it didn’t feel like it at the time. At the time, I felt like an unmitigated failure.

I lived down to those expectations.

I’ve had more success in my career than I ever would have predicted for myself, and yet a handful of poisonous, degrading, demeaning bosses over the course of almost 25 years as a professional have had a profound impact on the quality of my work, the quality of my health, and the quality of the relationships I have with important people in my life.

Along the way, I’ve picked up some survival tactics. The tactics in Part 1 will help you deal with the work itself, while Part 2 will help you deal with the emotional / psychological / physical health effects of working for a jerk.

### Part 1 — Deal with the work.

1. **Get out.** The most important survival tactic is to get out as soon as you can. Utilize your network. Call in a favor from a friend to get an interview somewhere else. Figure out how to live on a little less income if you’d have to take a slight pay cut to get out even sooner than you’d prefer. **A couple thousand dollars a year isn’t worth the toll on your emotional and physical health, relationships, and general well-being that your boss is causing.** The additional six tactics below will help you survive until you get out, but the most important step is to work on getting out as soon as you can.

1. **Deliver results.** Toxic bosses don’t care about how you feel. They don’t care about the impact their behavior is having on your productivity or well-being. They don’t care that you hate them (actually, there is a chance that they care, and a better chance that they enjoy it). This is all your fault anyway, so why should they? Toxic bosses care about one thing — results. Specifically, results that make them look good. **Figure out what results the jerk cares about most (hint — it’s likely the project you’re getting yelled at the most about), and hunker down and deliver.** Yes, you’re helping her by doing this. Get over it. You’re also reducing her negative focus on you and adding months (years?) back onto your life. Remember, these are survival tactics, not passive-aggressive sabotage tactics. And don’t forget — while you’re delivering results, keep working really hard on **Getting Out**.

1. **Tell him what he wants to hear. **As you’re delivering results, you’ll need to report progress. Don’t lie. Don’t hide the truth. But focus on shading all progress in as positive a light as possible. **Report on progress you’ve made, and focus on what’s going well. When you choose to report on problems, don’t ask the boss for help or give any indication that you don’t have it completely under control.** Aside from crushing the souls of the people beneath them, toxic bosses love nothing more than pouncing on a problem and finding ways to blame their underlings, ridiculing them for not being able to figure out the solution, and threatening them with their jobs over little things that have gone wrong. Instead, when you have to talk about a problem, talk about it in terms of how you’re actively working to address it.

### Part 2 — Deal with the impact to your well-being.

1. **Stop blaming yourself (and your boss).** Despite how toxic bosses can make you feel — incompetent, worthless, lazy, a failure — you aren’t. This isn’t your fault. **There is nothing you can possibly do to be successful in this situation, except get out of it.** And getting out isn’t failing, it isn’t admitting defeat, and it isn’t giving up. It’s surviving. This isn’t your boss’s fault either, any more than it’s a blue jay’s fault for being a blue jay or a chair’s fault for being a chair. Assholes are assholes. Take all of that energy you’re focusing on hating and blaming your boss, and refocus it on getting out.

1. **Stop expecting her to change.** This is not going to get better. Yes, you can do some things to help in the short-term (Part 1), but those things just make the situation more tolerable. We can apply insect repellent to keep the mosquitoes away, but the mosquitoes will still be mosquitoes. Your toxic boss was a jerk long before you accepted the job, and will continue to be a jerk long after you’ve moved on. **She isn’t going to change, and it isn’t your responsibility to convince her to change or to help reform her or see the error of her ways. It’s your responsibility to survive.** If you follow these tactics, things will improve temporarily. Don’t let that lull you into false hope. The moment something outside of your control goes wrong, or the boss decides to refocus her ire on you, you’ll be right back where you started.

1. **Connect.** You need someone to talk to, someone with whom you can share what you’re going through. Someone who will listen and empathize. One of the most debilitating effects of having a toxic boss is the sense of isolation. **Toxic bosses actively isolate us, making us feel stupid and incompetent and afraid to share our struggles with others, so that they can maintain all of the power.** Find someone to talk to about it. Perhaps it’s a family member, perhaps it’s someone at work (be careful — make absolutely sure your work friend can be trusted), perhaps it’s a professional counselor you find through your company’s employee assistance plan. When you work for a toxic boss, you’re afraid to connect with others. Fight that fear. A trusted confidante can help you feel better about yourself, and help you see that no matter how bad things get, it won’t last forever and there is indeed light at the end of the tunnel.

1. **Stop caring.** There will be plenty of future bosses who will fully engage you. Plenty of future jobs that will demand extra hours, and travel, and late meetings that force you to miss the occasional dinner at home. This is not one of those jobs. This boss doesn’t require that effort. This job doesn’t require those hours. No amount of effort or hours will make it better anyway, so check out. Focus on friends and family instead. **Treat this job as a way to keep a roof over your head, clothes on your back, and food in your belly.** Treat it as a way to pay for the things you really want to do with the people that truly matter to you. Distance yourself. There will be plenty of time for work to truly matter. Right now, it doesn’t. Treat it that way.

Working for a toxic boss can feel hopeless. The tactics above can help turn a miserable situation into a tolerable one, at least for the short-term. The long-term solution is simple. Get out as soon as you can, and don’t look back.

# How to Hire from the Top 10% Without Breaking the Bank

## Embracing the Remote Employment Revolution to Build Your Dream Business

![](1*X8a83EGOmyoT0nAtHM66xQ.png)

So you've figured out the next big app or app-driven service that will take the world by storm making life better for thousands of would-be customers. That was the easy part.

Then, you set out to make your business plan, maybe even paid a freelancer to program a prototype; you tested it with a limited pool of subjects and were blown away by the results. Maybe you've managed to secure funding already; or maybe you’re still looking into it.

But what you’re sure of is this: you have a great product (or service) and you need to build an equally great team capable of making it justice. You know you want top performers in programing and UI design — and suddenly you start worrying that the freelancer isn't going to cut it. And you are probably right to worry about it.

Now, I’m not dissing freelancers. That would be a very stupid thing to do as I moonlight as a freelancer myself. Freelancers can be an excellent solution for some projects, or specific phases of projects — the aforementioned prototyping is a great example!

But once you know that you have a potential hit in your hands and you need to knuckle down and build a business out of it, the stakes are higher and you need someone that you can be sure to be focusing 110% on your baby — someone that you can get a hold of easily and discuss details knowing that once you finish your discussion, they’ll get down to implementing the decisions ASAP instead of working on someone else’s project, one that has a deadline coming sooner. You need someone that owns the product as much as you do.

So now you have two choices. You can either pay your freelancer a retainer fee so that he or she will break out a predetermined chunk of his or her week to focus entirely on you and your project — and my friend, let me tell you, this requires a freelancer with iron discipline and a high standard of work ethics — or you can get your first employee.

This decision comes — as most important decisions do — with its own set of problems.

On one hand, it’s really hard to gauge a freelancer’s competence as a retainer from one or two simple projects. If the test project went smoothly, you know he’s a great freelancer, but it’s quite a leap to go from there to a fully functioning retainer — effectively, a part-time employee.

On the other hand, full-time (or even part-time) top talent is really expensive to hire, and if you go after a mediocre employee just to cut expenses — and believe me, I know from experience that a new business venture is always hard pressed for cash, so I’m not judging you for balking at the cost of top talent — you’re just buying a 6-month pass to the Black Mirror version of Disneyland. You might as well start stocking up on antidepressants right now.

There is an escape clause, though, one that you can use to not only find better talent, but at a startup-friendly price. You can join the Remote Employment Revolution. You can get a remote employee.

Think about it: where are you more likely to find the best talent willing to work for you: in a pool that includes only your average North-American or Canadian programmer, and where you are competing with the best and highest-paying companies in the tech world, or one that includes the whole English-speaking world?

There are thousands of highly intelligent programmers graduating from prestigious universities and IT courses all around the world — and most are perfectly fluent in English!

When hiring these people, you face little to no competition from big tech companies, and you can pay them a wage that is fair by North-American standards and likely extremely motivating by their own countries’ standards, as well.

You are automatically injecting cultural and though diversity into your startup and you start benefiting right away — as both research and empirical accounts by ultra-successful remote companies amply show — from the increased productivity associated with remote employees.

Now, I’m not here to say that this is a magic ticket to building a great team. There are non-trivial challenges involved in hiring, managing and motivating remote employees — just like with any kind of employee, frankly.

However, we at DistantJob are firm believers in the Remote Employment Revolution and have dedicated a considerable amount of time and brainpower to coming up with solutions to help facilitate all things related to hiring and making the most out of a remote employee.

We don’t have all the answers, nor do we have the only answers, of course — companies that thrive due to having remote employees are equally invested in the Revolution and have made public extensive tactics and strategies on this very subject. Basecamp and Automattic are just a couple of heavy-hitters that come to mind.

But DistantJob makes it its business to find compelling solutions for those wanting to make the jump to hiring remote employees. We preselect candidates for the people that come to us to interview from a pool of reliable top performers, and we help with all stages up to and including on-boarding and management.

In the end, whether you seek help from experienced professionals or decide to self-educate yourself on the matter (feel free to ask questions in the comments, by the way) what I urge you to consider is this: do you really need to limit yourself to the North-American hiring pool, already poached dry of talent by a myriad of competitors, and with inflated prices?

Or are you willing to go truly global, find incredibly talented professionals without breaking the bank, and join the Remote Employee Revolution?

# How to Write Follow Up Emails That Virtually Guarantee a Response (with Templates!)

## Your first message is only the start. Here’s a tested method for following up to get results.

![Photo by [dh_creative](https://pixabay.com/en/users/dh_creative-5201554/) via Pixabay.](1*yOnxe9m2p4iLFA5XN0vhZw.jpeg)*Photo by [dh_creative](https://pixabay.com/en/users/dh_creative-5201554/) via Pixabay.*

Ever spent what felt like ages drafting the “perfect” email, only to get nothing but radio silence in return? If you’re anything like most people, you probably have.

After all, a recent study found that [**the average person receives about 141 emails a day](http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2017-2021-Executive-Summary.pdf) but *sends* only 40.**

It doesn’t take a mathematician to realize that means **3/4th of the emails someone receives never get a response.** The question is, how do you stack the deck in your favor to increase the odds of being a part of that coveted 1/4th?

Sure: How you write your initial email plays a big part in that, and I’ve written pretty extensively about [how to write emails that get replies](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/get-email-replies/).

But at the end of the day, your initial email’s only half the battle. Even if you do everything right, you *still* may not get a response. And when that happens, the fortune’s in the follow-up.

The problem is, many people don’t know how or when to send follow-up emails. This uncertainty makes them uncomfortable and, as a result, they often don’t end up sending anything (or they send something that’s ineffective at best).

Today, we’re going to talk about three proven follow-up email templates you can use to virtually guarantee a response from your recipient.

## First Things First: Get Over Yourself — It Isn’t Personal

But before we get there, there’s something important I want to point out. If you send an email that doesn’t get a response, don’t take it personally.

A lack of response doesn’t necessarily mean anything was wrong with your email, nor does it necessarily mean the other person is intentionally ignoring you.

In my experience, that’s *rarely* the case.

The truth is, the recipient probably saw your email and had every intention of responding. Just, later. When things slowed down. The problem is — despite their best intentions — by the time things finally slowed down hours (or even days) later, they simply forgot.

I know I’ve done that, and you may be guilty of that too.

So keep that in mind: As long as your original email is coming from a place of providing genuine value to the other person, you’ve got nothing to worry about.

They aren’t ignoring you, and you aren’t pestering them by sending a follow-up email (if you do it right). In fact, **if you’re truly confident in the value you think you can provide this person, you’d be doing them a disservice by not following up.**

So push through that initial discomfort, and I think you’ll find that many people actually appreciate the reminder.

## The 4-Week Follow Up Email Game Plan

And with that said, let’s get into the follow-up game plan.

Below, you’ll find three separate follow up emails. Note that these emails aren’t supposed to be interchangeable — they’re a sequence that should take place over a 4-week period (don’t worry, I’ll give you timing recommendations).

***A quick note:** These templates have been proven time and time again both in my experience, and the experiences of many of my clients. So although you certainly want to personalize the content to make it feel as though it’s coming from you, I recommend you **don’t stray too far from the original messaging.***

### **Follow-Up Email #1: The Quick Re-Ping**

This first follow-up message should be sent 5 days after your initial email, and it serves a single purpose: **To bring your name back to the top of their inbox.**

It should be short, low-pressure, and guilt-free. From a content perspective, all you’re doing is summarizing the content of your initial email in a single sentence or two.

It’s also a good idea to **include your original message at the bottom of this follow-up email** so your recipient doesn’t have to dig through their inbox to find it. For example:
> *Subject: Touching Base*
> *Hey John,*
> *Just wanted to follow up on the email I sent awhile back about meeting up for a quick interview. You’ll find the original email below my signature. Is that something you’d be interested in?*
> *Cheers,*
> *Anne*

In most cases, I think you’ll find a single follow-up message like the one above will be all it takes to get the reply you’re looking for. But if it doesn’t …

### **Follow-Up Email #2: The Friendly Check-In**

The second follow-up email should come 7 days after the Friendly Re-Ping follow-up message.

Like the first, your goal here isn’t to guilt or blame the other person. In fact, this email should do the exact opposite. **Give your recipient the benefit of the doubt** and assume your messages are simply being lost somewhere. For example:
> *Subject: Did my email come through?*
> *Hi John,*
> *I wanted to send a quick message to follow-up on my email about connecting for a short interview.*
> *Since I haven’t heard back yet, I’m wondering if you got the emails in the first place and I wanted to make sure they didn’t fall through the cracks (I know I’ve certainly missed a few emails that have been accidentally sorted into spam). It’d be great if you could send me a quick ping to let me know you received it. I’ve included the original email below.*
> *Cheers,*
> *Anne*

Again, I recommend keeping this email in the same thread as your original follow-up message so they have all the context and information they need to reply directly to this email.

### Follow-Up Email #3: The Last Chance

The final follow-up email should be sent 14 days after the Friendly Check-In. At this point, it’s been almost 30 days; so it’s time to change up the approach a bit.

With this message, you’re looking to create a sense of urgency by taking your offer off the table. Let me give you an example first, then I’ll break it down into its core elements:
> *Subject: Checking in one more time*
> *Hi John,*
> *Since I haven’t had much luck reaching you via email, I thought I’d try a different channel. I just left you a voicemail following up on the research project email from a few weeks back.*
> *If I haven’t heard back from you, I’ll assume it’s not the best time right now and stop following up on this matter. If I misread the situation and you are interested, shoot me a quick ping. I’ve included the original email below for your convenience.*
> *Cheers,*
> *Anne*

As you can see, this email has two primary components:

* First, **it assumes you’ve tried another medium to reach the recipient**. Maybe email just isn’t their preferred method of communication, their spam filters are cranked up a little too high, or their inbox is simply too slammed. You can overcome this potential problem simply by trying a new outreach method, such as a phone calls, texts, or social media.

* Second, it creates a sense of urgency and scarcity with the line, “If I haven’t heard back from you, **I’ll assume it’s not the best time right now and stop following up on this matter**.” If the recipient has any interest in whatever you’re offering or asking for, a line like that is almost guaranteed to get a response.

### Wait: What if I Still Don’t Get a Response After These Emails?

The fact of the matter is — even with the right initial message and the follow-up email game plan above — you still aren’t going to get a response to every email you send (*especially* when we’re talking cold emails).

If you haven’t received a reply after sending these three emails, it’s usually safe to assume now isn’t a good time for them. I recommend shelving your outreach attempts for 3–6 months — depending on the relationship and the context — and then trying again.

After all: Until you get a clear “no,” you can always assume they’re still interested.

# 3 Tequila shots to start

## 3 Tequila shots to start — Building on personal experience

Learning from our own experiences — the choices that truly stick.

We can so easily read and learn and watch and learn and listen and learn. But, it will always be a little bit easier to learn when you feel it with your own body — mind — soul.

They say, “do as I say, not as I do”. Our parents, our bosses, our friends, random people we meet. These people who come into our lives for a day or years. They expect that we listen and pretend we do not see. That we never forget the lessons they have **told** us and somehow avoid making the mistakes for ourselves. *If only it was that simple*.

I've mentioned this in a past [blog](https://medium.com/better-humans/fell-so-fast-i-crashed-a218e3a3fd6d)
> We, as humans, are beautifully flawed. We don’t always figure things out right away and sometimes we never do. That’s alright, it’s okay to fall! It’s okay to stumble!

Within myself, I believe this to be a very true statement. My mother could tell me a million times the mistakes of her past relationships with men and though I ***get it*** I seem to still make just as many mistakes and even more with the men who come into my life. I’m 25 years young and stumbling almost daily.

One of my favorite brands is [flagnorfail](http://flagnorfail.com/) and their founder, Rob Bailey, is a master of motivation. He has such a drive that he can stir passion for movement in even the more bleak of souls. In one of the companies latest releases of new clothing he had this description for an item:
> Loving the process is what keeps us going. It took me a while to realize but I am not chasing the end goal as much as I am doing this because I love the process. Working with our hands, printing, choosing fabrics, traveling, meeting fans, the stress of managing life, training…… it is all part of the process. It is far more important then the end result. The process is what we live. Learn to love it. Loving the process is a mindset. It is a mindset to which we can shift our way of thinking. Life is about reaching goals or reaching dreams. The path you take to get there is sometimes unpleasant. But those struggles and overcoming them is what will set you apart from being average. Love the Process is a reminder to enjoy the road, no matter how bumpy, enjoy the journey.

I *LOVE* this.

These people live what they say, they breathe what they do. This is what learning from your own experiences is. Figuring it out as you go and expanding on what you know about yourself the world as the days pass while not wasting a moment.

So….

Can we learn from what we hear from others? Or must we fall for ourselves in order for the lessons to stick?

I believe it depends. I have learned much from the experiences of my mother but there are always things I must learn for myself. Just as you must. No matter the amount of time or the science or the heart behind a person telling someone else to quit smoking…until that mindset is right for the smoker…it will never change. You must live and breathe your own choices and learn from them. You may not always have to stumble yourself but it will happen and you will be the better person for it. It may not seem that way and yeah, you’d like to just read others mistake and not make them, but thats life.

That is the human experience and it’s *beautiful*.

# How to Say No to Requests (Without Damaging Your Relationships)

## The Art of No: How to Accomplish More by Doing Less

![](1*M5_vOSWCWfqGnAjCNpm7Ag.jpeg)

As an entrepreneur or executive, it can often feel like half your day is spent fielding endless requests for your time; and not all of them good.

For example, does this sound familiar?

* Your head of engineering needs feedback on a feature,

* An old colleague wants to hop on a Zoom call to catch up,

* Someone in your network wants an introduction to someone *else *in your network,

* A candidate that didn’t work out wants to schedule one more call to collect feedback, and

* An aspiring entrepreneur you’ve never met before wants to buy you coffee and “pick your brain.”

And that’s all by 10:00am Monday morning. The week’s just getting started and *already *it can be easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of inbound requests.

As a founder or CEO, **time is your most valuable — and scarcest — asset.** And that’s why **learning how to say no at work is one of the most important — and most underutilized — leadership skills.**

The fact of the matter is, you can’t say “yes” to every request that comes your way. And **until you stop trying to appease everyone, you’ll likely struggle to reach your fullest potential**.

## The Hidden Danger of “Yes”

**Saying “yes” to everyone is tempting because it’s easy and — in the moment — it makes you feel good.** At the very least, it’s certainly better than saying no and often becomes our default reaction when we don’t want to spend too much time thinking about the “right” decision.

But if you’ve made a habit of accepting every request you get, you know that one of two things tends to happen. You either:

* Fill your calendar with so many urgent-but-unimportant tasks that every day is spent spinning your wheels without making any real progress, or

* You make more commitments than you can possibly keep, leading to unfulfilled obligations and damaged standing in your network.

So **when you overcommit, you’re either hurting your *business *or you’re hurting your *network.*** Continued over a long enough timeframe, this not only burns *you *out; it burns bridges and loses trust with the people who matter most.

But the funny thing is, most of us already understand that saying “no” at work is important. In fact, most of us don’t even need to be told *when *to say no. More often than not, we’ve got a pretty strong intuition about which requests should be turned down.

The *real *problem is that, although we know we *should *say “no,” we often don’t. So before we can talk about *how *to say “no,” we need to understand what’s holding us back in the first place.

## Why it’s so Hard to Say “No”

On a basic level, saying “no” just *doesn’t feel good*. After all: Do *you* like being turned down? In most cases, probably not. We all know from personal experience that rejection doesn’t feel good, so we avoid doing it to others.

But let’s dig a little deeper: When our brain hears the word “no,” it processes that response as a threat. And — [as research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15963650) — when our brains perceive a threat, our amygdala — or the “fight-or-flight” control center of our brain — kicks into overdrive.

**While in threat response mode, our creative thinking is limited and we become more reactive, impulsive, and rash.** Although this reaction was vital in the days of our ancestors — when “threat” meant something like a “saber-toothed tiger” — the response isn’t as helpful in the modern world, where the so-called “threat” is simply being rejected.

Although that response may not be *rational* — which is why *Emotional Intelligence* author Daniel Goleman ([@DanielGolemanEI](https://twitter.com/DanielGolemanEI)) calls it an “[amygdala hijack](https://ed.ted.com/on/p03hEANL)” — **our brains nevertheless process saber-toothed tigers and rejection in much the same way**.

And so, because we don’t want to be perceived as a threat, we often avoid saying “no” in one of two ways:

* We say “yes” to avoid creating an awkward or hostile environment, or

* We simply ignore the request in the hopes it will be forgotten or resolve itself.

Although not applicable in every situation, choosing to ignore a request is often much more viable than simply saying “yes.” Let’s talk about why.

## “No” vs Ignoring

At face value, choosing to ignore a request might seem negative or socially damaging. But the truth is, **ignoring requests has become so commonplace that, from many social aspects, it’s not only *accepted*; it’s *expected*.**

For proof, look no further than social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn. From time to time, you’re going to get unwanted Friend or Connection requests. And when you do, you’ll notice that neither network offers a “reject” option.

Instead, Facebook gives you the option to either “Confirm” or “Delete Request,” with the added bonus that the sender “won’t be notified” of the deletion.

![](0*LfW05j9e4ycu9fx1.jpg)

LinkedIn, on the other hand, takes the more direct route. When you receive a connection request, you’ve got two options: Either “Accept” or “Ignore.”

![](0*vmv6rpSDFBp5_yGs.jpg)

This isn’t a coincidence. I can practically guarantee both companies did extensive A/B testing to discover whether people prefer to “reject” or “ignore” unwanted requests.

For relationships or requests you aren’t particularly invested in, this approach to rejection can be highly effective because it avoids the unpleasantness of saying (or hearing) “no.”

However, it isn’t applicable in *every *situation. For example: If the request came from someone you care about, you can’t afford to simply ignore it. In these cases, there’s usually no way around it: You’ve got to learn to say no.

So what’s the best way to *say *“no” and turn someone down in a way that doesn’t damage the relationship?

It’s pretty simple: **Turn your rejection into a relevant source of value by offering a viable alternative.** There are a number of ways you can do this, but let’s look at three of the most common.

## Say, “No, but [alternative].”

The more successful you become, the more requests you’re going to get. And while many of these requests will lead to mutual value for both parties, there’s a good chance just as many (if not more) won’t be compelling enough to warrant a commitment.

When you encounter requests that aren’t mutually beneficial, be honest: Let the other person know you won’t be fulfilling it; but end with an alternative to help them reach their goals.

### For example:

**The request: **“Hey John, any chance I could buy you a cup of coffee next week? I’d love to sit down and pick your brain about leadership.”

**The response:** “Hi Erin, thanks for reaching out. I appreciate the thought, but my priorities are elsewhere. I won’t be able to meet with you, but I did recently launch a pretty extensive blog post about my thoughts on leadership. Why don’t you take a look at that, and ping me back with any questions you might have?”

## Say, “No, not right now,” (or “Yes, but not now.”)

Often, you’re going to get requests you genuinely want to follow through on but, for whatever reason, you aren’t able to commit at that moment.

Instead of closing the door, let them know that you *do* want to help if they’re willing to check back in later. This is effective for two reasons:

* First, the other party will appreciate your willingness to help, even if you can’t in-the-moment, and,

* Secondly, there’s a good chance their situation will resolve itself by the time you’re available, negating the need to meet in the first place.

### For example:

**The request: **“Hey Erin, would you be free for a 30-minute Zoom call on Thursday? I’ve got a few questions about fundraising and I’d love your input.”

**The response: **“Hi John, thanks for thinking of me. I’d love to connect but, for this quarter, I’ve decided to focus my time exclusively on helping our company achieve our sales goals. As a result, I’m currently not taking meetings outside that objective. I hope you don’t mind, but why don’t you check in with me next quarter? Things may have slowed down by then.”

## Say, “Yes, but not me.”

Occasionally you’ll get requests from those you want to help but, for whatever reason, you’re unable to. In these instances, ask yourself: Who do I know that could help this person?

Then reach out to both parties — the person *seeking* help and the one that *can* help — and see if they’d be interested in connecting.

Although you won’t ultimately be the one who fulfills the request, you can still be extremely valuable by offering an introduction to someone who *can*.

### For example:

**The request:** “Hi John, do you know much about CRMs? Our sales team’s growing and we’re looking into a few options. If you’ve got the time, I’d really appreciate your feedback. Would you be willing to meet up for lunch sometime soon?”

**The response:** “Hey Erin, congratulations on the growing sales team! That’s really exciting. Unfortunately CRMs aren’t my area of expertise, but I may know someone that can help. I’m good friends with Rob Smith, Rapple’s Head of Sales, and I bet he’d have some great recommendations for you. If you’d like, I can reach out and see if he’d be available for a quick Q&A.”

## A Valuable No is Better than an Empty Yes

At the end of the day, “no” doesn’t have to be a bad word. In fact, used correctly, **an honest “no” is often more valuable than obligatory “yes.”**

Delivered well, a value-focused rejection is actually a win for both sides:

* For you, because you now have more control over your time and resources, and

* For them, because you’ve provided them an alternate (and potentially more valuable) solution.

## A Closing Challenge: Just Say No

So here’s my challenge to you: Do you have a pending request you know you *should* reject? If so, use the tactics above to close the loop on that request with a viable, valuable alternative.

Then review your calendar: Are there any upcoming engagements you’ve agreed to, even though you know you *shouldn’t have*? Engagements you *could *cancel without any major consequences?

If so, cancel them. Then **use your newfound “no” time to invest into the things that truly matter most**.

# Subscription Overload

## 

## Do you have subscription and newsletter overload?

A few years ago I had Delta Airlines points that were going to expire. I didn’t have enough for a ticket but I could cash them in for magazines.

I think at one point I was getting about 10. The ones that arrived weekly, like TIME or Newsweek, did nothing but cause me anxiety. If they started stacking up I felt behind – ‘Yikes! They’re current events! I have to read them now!” I also subscribed to fashion, fitness, home, and cooking magazines. When I made the decision to get rid of all of them, it was partially because I couldn’t keep up and partially because I wanted to stop being subjected to advertisements.

It’s easy to look at a stack of magazines and determine what you are behind in. How about your email newsletters and RSS feeds? How behind are you in those? Do you subscribe to so many that you can’t possibly read them all? Does it cause you anxiety because you feel like you’re behind?
> **Repeat after me “I will never be able to read everything I want to on the internet and it’s okay.”**

Unsubscribe. Unsubscribe. Unsubscribe.

There is a reason why I only send my newsletter once weekly. In my opinion, anything more than that is too much. I include everything that I’ve put out in the last week directly in the newsletter so you can pick and choose what interests you to click on. Do I want you to unsubscribe from me? Of course not! No one wants that, however, I also recognize needing a low-information diet. If you find relevance in my message, or any message, continue delivery. If the message starts to feel stale or regurgitated, or you’ve gotten what you needed from it, unload it permanently from your inbox.

Need help controlling what’s left? Try out unroll.me. It’s free but it shouldn’t be. It will change your life.

For the next week, take inventory of what comes into your inbox and make a decision to keep or release. I promise, you’ll still be smart, beautiful and you won’t miss out.

# How to Deal With Problems

## How do you typically react when life hands you a new problem to deal with? What do you do when nothing seems to be going your way? Do you accept that problems are a natural part of life or do you resist them and complain about the unfairness of it all? Perhaps you’re like the man who, in an effort to rid himself of all his problems, sought the advice of the Buddha:
> *(…) After the man had told the Buddha one of his problems and asked for help, the Buddha replied: ‘I cannot help you get rid of that problem.’*
> *The man was surprised that the Buddha could not help him in this regard, but he told the Buddha about another problem; he thought to himself that the Buddha should at least be able to help him with that problem. But the Buddha told him ‘I cannot help you with that problem either.’*
> *The man started to get impatient. He said: ‘How can it be that you are the perfectly Enlightened Buddha when you can’t even help people get rid of their problems?’ The Buddha answered: ‘You will always have 83 problems in your life. Sometimes a problem will go, but then another problem will come. I cannot help you with that.’*
> *The baffled man asked the Buddha: ‘But, what can you help me with, then?’ The Buddha replied: ‘I can help you get rid of your 84th problem.’ The man asked: ‘But what is my 84th problem?’ The Buddha replied: ‘That you want to get rid of your 83 problem.’ (1)*

This anecdote reminds of a scene in American History X where the main character played by Edward Norton is clearly agitated while folding sheets in the prison laundry room. Eventually, the prisoner working next to him gets fed up and says:

“Every day I watch you go through these sheets like you gonna get to the end of them. No matter how fast you get through them they gonna keep bringing them in and bringing them in. Throwing them around like that ain’t gonna do a damn thing but give you a heart attack!” (2)

Isn’t that what most of us do every day? We attack our problems aggressively thinking that the faster we get it done, the sooner we’ll get rid of all of them. And when the next one shows up, we get surprised and frustrated and attack that one in the same way. And so, this pattern repeats itself again and again.

Does this sound familiar to you? Do you suffer from the 84th problem and make yourself miserable over the fact that you have problems? If so, the good news is that THIS problem can be solved. All you have to do is learn to accept life, as it is, difficulties and all.

Instead of desperately trying to get all your sheets folded, realize that there will always be a new one brought in the moment you’re ‘finished’.

Approaching life this way will save you from a lot of unnecessary stress and help you move [slowly and steadily](http://www.selfication.com/the-tortoise-mindset/) toward your goals.
> *“If there is a solution to the problem then don’t waste time worrying about it. If there is no solution to the problem then don’t waste time worrying about it.” **— Dalai Lama***

# How to Make Sure Your Product Will Be Successful — Before You Launch

## How to Make Sure Your Product Will Be Successful — Before You Launch

Pat Flynn rocks. If you don’t know who he is, [this is a good place to start](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/passive-income-101/). Feel free to hit that link and then come back. I’ll wait.

Pat describes himself as the “Crash test dummy of online business,” with good reason. Over the past decade, he has successfully launched everything from ebooks, to websites, to podcasts, to SAAS products, and more. According to his public income statements, he typically earns over $100,000 from these products and services — *every month.*

Pat’s latest product is a book called *“Will It Fly?” *I read it in a single day, and it didn’t disappoint. In fact, it’s one of the best books I’ve ever read. I reviewed it on Amazon and used the following headline: **Incredibly Good. Is this the next *Four Hour Workweek*? **That’s how highly I recommend it.

In *Will It Fly?, *Pat explains how to launch your product with as much certainty as possible, effectively stacking the deck in your favor for a successful outcome. These are the main steps covered in the book:

1. *Figure out what you want out of your business. *This is genius. I’ve never seen an expert pull this out as a mandatory first step. So many people go into business with a product that isn’t a good fit for them. They build a venture-backed startup, only to realize they can’t stand the responsibilities that come with having an elected board. Or, they build a product that requires heavy travel, when they would have preferred staying in one place. Determine the lifestyle you want *first*. Then build a business around that. Otherwise, you’re far more likely to get frustrated and burn out.

1. *Identify an unfair advantage. *You need to have a superpower. That might sound overwhelming, but don’t let it scare you. It doesn’t have to be incredibly awe-inspiring. You just need a slight edge. Pat started off by creating a study guide for a test called the LEED exam (Similar to the BAR exam, but for the field of architecture vs. law). He was well equipped to do this because he studied architecture and passed the test himself. He also had an edge because he could present himself to clients in a very personable way. “Hey, I’ve been through this. I’m just like you.” This was his super power. It’s not fancy, but it gave customers a sense of trust, which led to sales. This mostly comes down to *doing what you’re good at*. Play to your strengths and use your existing knowledge to your advantage.

1. *Create a mind map.* This is a common technique that will get every aspect of your idea out of your head, and into a more palatable form. I’ve used this process for writing books, but it works for any product. The mind map ultimately allows you to distill your product into a one-page description, a paragraph, and finally — a single sentence. All of these exercises are important for focusing your concept and defining a clear value proposition.

1. *Share your idea with prospective customers and gather feedback.* This sounds obvious, but very few people do it. Pat gives great advice on how to do it effectively. He tells the story of interacting with actual food truck owners before settling on the final idea for Foodtruckr.com, one of his online businesses that pulls in tens of thousands of dollars.

1. *Research and Analysis — Create a market map. *To improve your chances of success, you should dig into the market to see what’s already there. Pat suggests looking at three different categories: Places, People, and Products. He includes some incredibly insightful techniques for how to find this information online (right down to the specific advanced search inquiries you can use to surface the most relevant and useful material).

1. *Understand and engage with your customer. *Pat uses the acronym “P.L.A.N” for this step, which stands for: Problems, Language, Anecdotes, and Needs. Going through this exercise will get you into the mind of your customer, so you can provide them with the best product possible. Again, there some amazing tips for how to go about doing this. One of my favorites is typing *“How do I” site: [site URL]* to generate problems people are having with a particular product or service. These results can then point you in a direction for how to solve that specific issue.

1. *Validate your idea by pre-selling. *There are a few parts to this step: (1) Get in front of an audience, (2) Hyper-target that audience, (3) Interact and share your solution, and (4) Ask for the transaction. Essentially, you’re trying to find the people who really want your product based on your prior research. After you do that, you should ask them to pay up front so you can build the product and deliver it to them. This might sound crazy, but it works (if you do it correctly). Pat provides several case studies to show exactly how people worked through these steps to validate their idea, and ensure success* *before even launching (or building the product).

There are two main takeaways from this book: (1) Doing prep work is underrated. When you see a successful product launch, there’s usually a bunch of stuff happening behind the scenes that contributed to the success. (2) *Your product idea will change*. As you work through the steps above, your concept will morph, which is a *a good thing*. You might find that your original idea won’t fly, or isn’t well suited for your lifestyle. That’s okay. The goal of *Will It Fly? *can be found in the byline: *“How to Test Your Next Business Idea So You Don’t Waste Your Time and Money.” *Your future success or failure can be identified in the testing stages. Why waste your time and money on something that won’t work?

As I mentioned, this is one of the best books I’ve ever read. It’s a rare “life changer.” Do yourself a favor and [pick up a copy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BCLPPAK). I’ll see you in the clouds.

# The Value of 500 Days

## Today marks 500 days since I quit drinking. That number is incredibly intimidating, daunting, and deceiving.

## Intimidating

September 4th, 2013 was the first day of my current streak of sobriety. I say current streak because there were many failed attempts over that summer to get to where I am now. I never thought I’d make it to 500 days without alcohol — five HUNDRED days?!

That’s also:
71 weeks and 3 days
12,000 hours
720,000 minutes
43,200,000 seconds

Pick your measurement of choice, it’s still intimidating. Getting past a week was intimidating, as was a month or a year. Hell, even some days seemed to crawl by with every tick of my clock’s second hand chanting “drink, drink, drink.” 43,200,000 seconds later, the chanting is gone and no longer stresses me out.

500 days are behind me but that doesn't mean I’m not intimidated by the next 500. I know I could relapse at any time and it’s important that I keep that in mind, lest I get cocky and go down the slippery slope of “I can handle a drink, I’ll just stop at one.” No length of sobriety will magically grant me the ability to moderate.

Without intimidation, I wouldn't be as motivated to stick with the challenge of sobriety.

## Daunting

My decision to quit drinking didn't come with an end date. This is a choice I plan on maintaining for the rest of my life. Compare 500 days to forever; 500 days is teeny-tiny when you stack it up next to an endless amount of time. I am only 24 years old; I could potentially live another 60 years without drinking! What’s a mere 500 days in the face of 60 years?

Well, to get to 60 years you’d have to get through 21,914.5 days and you can’t get to 21,914.5 days until you get to 500. Likewise, you can’t get to 500 days until you get to a year, you can’t get to a year until you get past a month, you can’t get past a month until you get past a week, you can’t get past a week until you get past a day, you can’t get past a day until you get past an hour, you can’t get past an hour until you get past a minute, and you can’t get past a minute until you get past a second.

500 is daunting, as is forever, but you can’t get there until you get past today, one second at a time.

## Deceiving

Hitting 500 days doesn't make it any easier. I still have cravings that send me down memory lane, romanticizing about the good ol’ days when I had booze to numb my feelings, filter out my thoughts, and provide me with the distance from myself that I needed. I was escaping reality and lying to myself by thinking drinking was making it any better. It was a dirty bandage placed upon a festering wound.

The real problem at hand isn't that I have a penchant for binge drinking, it’s that I have unresolved issues manifesting themselves in a series of ways, one of which was through my affinity for intoxicating substances. In order to start the task of working through those issues, i.e. healing the metaphorical festering wound, I had to remove the bandage and figure out what the hell was going on so that healing could finally begin. This has been extremely hard and there are moments of self-reflection where I hate what I see and want to run back into the mind-numbing arms of a six-pack of Sam Adams. I don’t, of course, but the temptation is there no matter how many days are behind me.

Don’t let my accomplishment of 500 days deceive you, I’m still working hard everyday to fix myself from the inside out — something that can’t happen unless alcohol is out of the picture.

### While the words “intimidating, daunting, and deceiving” sound negative, **I should make it clear that I have absolutely no regrets about my decision to quit drinking.** I have more hours in my days, I’m more clear-headed, I feel healthier, I’m saving lots of money, I don’t have to apologize for my blacked-out-drunk actions. That said, it’s also not all rainbows and butterflies. I have issues I need to work on; issues that, if left unresolved, would turn their ugly heads and make me wish I hadn't left them out of sight for so long. Dealing with these issues sucks but it has to happen and it wasn't ever going to happen if I didn’t stop drinking.

# Feeling Stuck? You Need Accountability.

## Achieving our goals can be hard, no doubt about it. We have to adjust so many little pieces until we hit a critical mass and the scales tip. The leadup to an avalanche is a million flakes of snow and thousands of tiny shifts, until one moment the whole thing breaks loose.

We like to think that everything is nice and contained, but for genuine transformative change, we have to be overwhelmed. We have to decide that another course of action is what will serve us much better, and [get things lined up](https://medium.com/better-humans/positive-thinking-is-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-f17ad492036) to act accordingly. We have to be outside of our comfort zone. We need pushing. We need a mentor who knows the lay of the land better than we do to guide us. We have no idea how to get where we want to go, but we also have to be [dedicated enough to the outcome that we go through the painful process of not having a clue what we are doing](https://medium.com/@Knowliberation/drunk-on-desire-2934c704b9c2).

Sometimes, we discover we are uniquely suited to do some particular thing, and we feel a fire burning inside to share it with the rest of the world. We don’t know how to do that, but if we are dedicated enough, we will work to figure it out.

Don’t feel like doing the work in the moment, but still feel committed to the end results? You need accountability. Don’t feel like filing those papers or reading those reports, but want the paycheck? You don’t even need to wonder how your boss might feel about it. They are there to provide accountability.

The nice thing about accountability is that we don’t actually need a hierarchical structure. Usually, that’s where we get it, from our boss, a more skilled peer, a coach, a mentor, but it isn’t a given. We can just as easily get it from a stranger, or a pet, or someone who isn’t even interested in what we are trying to change.

All the accountability buddy does is make us be honest with ourselves. Did we do it today? Yes or no. Why or why not? What will we do about it when this situation comes up again?

### Learning to keep yourself accountable is an invaluable skill.

Accountability is why I put [a project I believe in](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/477320647/loves-letters-a-shortcut-on-the-road-to-happiness) on Kickstarter; not the money, but to [deepen the obligation I feel to deliver on a project](https://medium.com/better-humans/excellence-is-only-at-the-edges-23428aad1840) with the fact that now, people expect me to deliver. Accountability is why I want a dog, to make sure I get outside every day and get some exercise, as well as to love and to bond with. Accountability is why I ask my loved ones to hold my video games for ransom, so I can get work done without temptation or distraction. Accountability is why I always say hello to the check in clerks at the gym, so they can ask me where I’ve been if they haven’t seen me in a couple of days.

**Accountability is all about us [working to build](https://medium.com/@Knowliberation/everything-is-permanent-d1fb34e9cc87) the [best that we can](https://medium.com/@Knowliberation/how-do-we-choose-to-live-7a5d87fcd70f), but it is also about [others](https://medium.com/better-humans/it-can-never-be-all-about-you-e9803da247c1) being interested in and curious about us, in being engaged with our life and our work.**

## An exercise in humility

> The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.
- Omar Khayyam

I was conceived somewhere in the country of Iran in the winter of ‘76 by a young couple. My mother was 19 and my father in his mid-20s, both idealistic communists living in the [third world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_world) with a totalitarian military regime in power and a fanatically religious population. They were opposed to both castes.

During that power struggle, both before and after the revolution of ‘79, it was ([and still is](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/01/iran-torture-executions-arrests-un_n_2784284.html)) very common for the Iranian government to capture members of [opposing political factions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_executions_of_Iranian_political_prisoners) and torture them, so brutally that they would be reduced to making public “[confessions](http://books.google.com/books/about/Tortured_Confessions.html?id=-QJgbEeoLfEC)” of their guilt. My brother and I would watch these confessions, [played on television](http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/news-item/trial-by-camera-tv-confessions-and-the-death-penalty-in-iran), as children. They would, of course, be followed by the untelevised but sometimes public execution of the guilty (as appears in the photo above). As it came to pass, our father happened to be one of these “guilty” people, and so I was introduced to violent death at the age of six.

I often imagine how much pain my father endured without revealing his family’s secrets. What sacrifices did he make towards the end? [Being tortured](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Then_They_Came_for_Me) must rearrange a man’s priorities. How did his change? The story of my father’s death deserves a book. And an anthem. But this is a different story.

My father’s was not the first nor the only death I knew as a young child. As we were swept from city to town to village, and hidden from authorities in attics and basements during a time of war, I became more and more familiar with death and dead bodies. Sure, I was only six or seven, but certain images at that stage of your life always stay with you. The amount of suffering and turmoil for my family during that time is staggering.

My mother searched for my father for two years under her maiden name, not knowing if he was alive or dead, while at the same time hiding us and herself from danger in that extremely hostile and awful place. Naturally, from a very early age, I did not think I would live that long.

It was only through my mother’s* *sheer determination and willpower that my brother and I landed safely in the United States of America on January 4th, 1985.

My mother followed simple working-class principles. Hard work produces results. Willpower determines fate. You make your own luck. The best way to [accelerate serendipity](https://medium.com/makeshift-thoughts/1d03b0d4da2b) is to put yourself in the right place. She knew the mere act of setting foot on American soil would drastically improve our future. To her, and to me in retrospect, the ends justified the means. Our lives were [too precious to be wasted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_drain_in_Iran) in a primitive and barbaric land.

So she lied and manipulated the weakest part of the system to enter this country with no intention of ever leaving. The consequence? A decade long court battle in the immigration system. We asked for the legitimate right of asylum, and were denied it. Toward the end of 1995, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals [reviewed our final appeal, and denied relief.](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6KhtnX-mO6dQnlRMTFkak5hcm8/edit?usp=sharing)

I remember sitting together as a family and trying to decide where to go: Canada? Australia? Iran was out of the question. By then, we had lived in Oklahoma City for over a decade. We had attended the schools and worked in the shops, and we were a part of a new community, as Americans. I felt as if we were being thrown out of our homeland, and for my mother, it was the second time.

Once again, through the *sheer determination and will* of my mother, and a far fetched idea from our lawyer (shout out to Lawrence Davis in OKC), we rallied support from our community. We actively asked for help from our friends and neighbors in the form of letters, and lobbied our (Republican) Congressman, [Ernest Istook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Istook). With help we were able to convince Mr. Istook to take up our cause of staying in America and being American. Because it is what my mother wanted for us.

Since she had some strong friends in Houston, she decided it would be best for her to move there to help our cause, while my brother and I attended the University of Oklahoma. She moved to Houston in early 1997.

![](0*VHP857PbbXwzrfa4.jpeg)

My mother was killed in a car accident in Houston, Texas on November 13, 1997, just before all her aspirations, all her dreams, and everything she had longed for, worked so hard for, and sacrificed so much for, were about to come to fruition.

This link is an ode to her: [I love you, mom.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/848)

After this, I felt like death was around the corner. All the statistics and facts of longevity in this society would not have dissuaded me from the obvious truth: Life is fragile, and death is swift and coming.

[The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam](https://medium.com/@sandfarnia/the-rubaiyat-of-omar-khayyam-ea1351a7703) became my bible, and I adopted a philosophy of hardcore hedonism. My highest priorities in life were music, travel, drugs, sex, and gambling (not necessarily in that order). I didn’t just live, I attacked life.

Others thought that I was in a downward spiral because of the tragedies in my life. Yes, I did feel the pain, but it was just another part of life. I loved life. I wanted to experience it to the fullest before I died, which would be very soon, as history had taught me.

Too often, though, I got reckless. I took risks that put my life in danger. I was flirting with death.

For me, happiness was the here and now. My pursuit of the physical pleasures of this world was the driving force of my life. There was nothing more… until I outlived my father.

The first milestone of my life was the age of 31, because I was sure that my father had not reached the age of 31, regardless of exactly when he was murdered. From a young age I assumed that I would not outlive my father, because the odds were stacked too highly against me. The dead bodies in Iran had taught me, they were engraved into my soul.

*I took it for granted that I would not outlive my father.*

Wow! What a feat I had achieved. I was inspired! Imagine the possibilities of life, if I could experience it fully!

This was the time in my life that the light came on. I took a page out of my mother’s book and put myself on soil that would make my future better. I moved to the beach in my favorite place, Tampa Bay. I made it a goal to make good decisions a habit.

If I truly loved life, why am I not taking steps to extend it as long as possible? It is irrational, knowing how fragile it is, to abuse it, or the temple that supports it, your body!

Thus ensued a transformation of mind and body. My health became a priority, and I began achieving healthy, long-term goals.

*I can do anything!*

I should have been dead by now! How am I still alive? Oh wait, I know.

*The sheer determination and willpower *of my parents*.* This willpower took a child born to atheist communists in a third world totalitarian regime being overthrown by a fanatically religious majority, and transported him to the greatest society of humans on Earth. Even when the bureaucracy of that new society created a wall, this willpower overcame it, such that the very leaders themselves succumbed to it.

I turn 37 on Monday. Six years from now, I will have outlived my mother as well. So then, what is next? What is the third milestone?

[*It is the year I wish to die: 2077](http://www.genealogyintime.com/GenealogyResources/Articles/how_many_people_live_to_100_page1.html)*

I can choose how long I live in this world, by making the right decisions and [creating the right habits](https://medium.com/better-humans/4b2bb721ea5b) to extend my life, as my parents did for me. I have already begun this process. My milestones are numerous both in those achieved and those still on the horizon.

As for my parents, I am only starting to understand the willpower they instilled in me now. I have been a child for over three decades, not knowing what to do with it. Now I am becoming an adult and learning. I think too many people take their blessings for granted, and I do not want to disrespect my parents’ legacy by doing the same with mine.

Writing this has been an exercise in humility for me. I did it so that I do not forget where I came from, where I can go, and what I can achieve.

# 3 Ways to Receive Inspiration, Backed by Science

## 3 Ways to Receive Inspiration, Backed by Science

*This essay is an excerpt from the new book, *Boost: Create Good Habits Using Psychology and Technology*, which is [FREE on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P6KCEPI/) for a limited time.*

Although musical preference is generally open to debate, the world seems to have come to a consensus about who deserves to be crowned the greatest band in history: The Beatles. Of course, you can disagree with this all you want, but The Beatles lead the pack in sales (nearly one billion albums sold, based on some estimates), number one hits (20!), and public opinion (if you Google “greatest band of all time,” The Beatles are the first search result). The Beatles are so beloved that Abbey Road, the road in London that served as the setting for their *Abbey Road *album cover, may employ a full-time [crossing guard](http://news.yahoo.com/beatles-abbey-road-crossing-could-traffic-warden-105527662.html) due to the dozens of adoring fans that stop in the road to take pictures.

With all of this success, it’s natural for us to wonder who the band members were, where they came from, and how they reached this level of musical genius. In his book *Outliers*, Malcolm Gladwell uses The Beatles as an example of how ten thousand hours of deliberate practice elevated the band to an elite level of performance. That may be the case, but one of their songs in particular originated in a single moment of pure inspiration, and it went on to become one of their greatest hits.

The song was called “Scrambled Eggs.” At least, that’s what Paul McCartney says they called it originally. He [tells the story](http://books.google.com/books?id=-eh8BedNtLgC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=%22I+thought,+%E2%80%98No,+I%E2%80%99ve+never+written+like+this+before.%E2%80%99%22&source=bl&ots=ALkkifFEK4&sig=uhGPCEnlSCRRil8otBdMxSuv0dc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QZ4GVK-dFouVyATK6YCYCA&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22I%20thought%2C%20%E2%80%98No%2C%20I%E2%80%99ve%20never%20written%20like%20this%20before.%E2%80%99%22&f=false) of how the melody came about:
> I woke up with a lovely tune in my head. I thought, ‘That’s great, I wonder what that is?’ There was an upright piano next to me, to the right of the bed by the window. I got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th — and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot but because I’d dreamed it I couldn’t believe I’d written it. I thought, ‘No, I’ve never written like this before.’ But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing.

McCartney explained that the tune was so familiar to him that he went around asking other people in the music industry, “Who wrote this song?” Eventually he accepted that he had written the song himself–inspiration struck and the melody was born. At the outset, McCartney just sang along with silly lyrics, “Scrambled eggs…oh, my baby, how I love your legs…” because he only had the melody. The song eventually became “Yesterday.” It has dozens of accolades, including number one on the US Billboard charts, and may be the most “covered” song of all time. (I highly recommend the song, you can [listen to it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WQAl5nJWHs).)

## The Origins of Inspiration

If only it were that easy—you wake up in the morning next to a piano and sound out one of the greatest melodies of the last century. You may be surprised to learn that while this type of inspiration is clearly an outlier, finding inspiration is something that you can actually DO; you don’t need to wait for it to occur. Allow me to introduce you to the study of inspiration within the field of psychology.

In 2003, two psychologists at the University of Rochester, Todd Thrash and Andrew Elliot, set out to conduct the definitive study of inspiration using psychology. This was not your average academic study—it was a seven-part study that tested dozens of hypotheses about inspiration and created a framework for studying it in the future. The entire research study was an impressive undertaking, and by the end the researchers had two very important results: 1) a psychological scale that could be used to measure inspiration, and 2) a list of over thirty personality traits with data to show whether these traits cause inspiration to occur. In essence, Thrash and Elliot turned inspiration into a science: if you exhibit particular personality traits, you’re more likely to be inspired.

That brings us to the burning question: What were the inspiring personality traits? Like I said, they tested over thirty different traits; some were directly related to inspiration, others not at all. Here are the top three traits, in order of how strongly they related to inspiration: openness to experience, self-esteem, and creativity.

Now obviously you can’t just pick-up some extra creativity in the checkout aisle at Walmart–it’s a personality trait; it’s part of who you are. But you can change your personality over time, and if you strengthen these traits in particular you can optimize yourself to receive McCartney-esque inspiration.

## The Top Traits

Each personality trait has volumes of literature on its own, so I trust that you’ll dive into the ocean of research and find what works best for you. However, here are a few suggestions to get you started. And, since technology can be a powerful force in personal change, I’ll include a few apps that might help you along the way.

### 1. Openness to Experience

In their conclusions about this trait, Thrash and Elliot wrote, “These findings suggest that inspiration is facilitated by receptiveness.” *Openness *is certainly not an easy trait to develop. We like habits and customs because they give us comfort and security. For example, do you drive the same route to work every day? So do I. It’s the fastest route, that’s why I take it, but the repetition of the same sights every day doesn’t seem to offer much in the way of inspiration.

Here’s a simple suggestion to start being more open: Give up one thing you’re accustomed to. Try a new food, drive a new route to work, listen to a radio station that you’ve never heard before–anything to break an old routine. For years, I’ve ordered the same exact burrito from the menu at one of my favorite restaurants, Cafe Rio. I never order anything else, and honestly I don’t even know what else is on the menu. But if you’ll try a small experiment, I will too: the next time I visit Cafe Rio, I’ll order something different.

If you want to think bigger than just a new lunch entree or route to work, you might try out [Everest](http://www.everest.com/), an app that’s meant to help you achieve goals. Everest seems to place an emphasis on trying new things, so the social community within the app might help nudge you in the direction of developing openness.

### 2. Self-esteem

Inspiration comes more frequently to people with high self-esteem, and that makes sense: with high self-esteem, you’re less likely to set artificial limitations on your own abilities or be inhibited by what other people might think. Low self-esteem can have deep psychological roots and I’m certainly not qualified to offer advice for such a complex issue. Instead, I’ll offer a simplistic suggestion that is applicable to self-esteem: avoid comparing yourself to others.

I’ve [written before](http://www.maxogles.com/does-winning-matter/) that comparing yourself to other people is a worthless exercise because there will always be someone smarter, richer, and more beautiful than you are. And that’s based on statistics: you virtually have no chance of ever being the BEST in the world at anything. (If it makes you feel better, I’m right there with you!) So rather than focusing on everything you don’t have, make an inventory of what you DO have.

I’m sure there are hundreds of tools you can use to list what you have and what you’re grateful for; I’ve found one app that I especially like, called [Grateful](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grateful-what-are-you-grateful/id758059884). Every day it asks for one thing you are grateful for, with a simple and effective interface.

### 3. Creativity

Creativity is similar to openness in that we need to let go of conventional or routine ways of doing things to find new ways of expressing ourselves. Unfortunately we often have default habits that we rely on in situations that might otherwise yield creativity. For example, when we stand in line at a fast food restaurant, we don’t exhibit any creativity in attempting to preoccupy ourselves–we just scroll away on our smartphones. In fact, not long ago some psychologists found that most people would rather [be electrocuted](http://nypost.com/2014/07/07/most-people-would-rather-get-electrocuted-than-sit-alone-and-think-study/) than sit alone by themselves.

If you’d like to be more creative, my app suggestion is a bit counterintuitive. Choose to use an app that limits your smartphone functionality so that it becomes less of a distraction. Stop opening apps, checking notifications, and taking phone calls to devote more time to clear thinking. An app for this on iPhone is called [Mobile Flow](http://www.themobileflow.com/). It works in conjunction with Airplane mode on your phone, so it eliminates all unnecessary distractions. Deliberate focus can allow you to think and be creative without distractions, so I highly recommend the app.

# How can I start to change my life?

## How can I start to change my life?

I think that what hinders us most, you and me both, is hidden in our own minds. The external circumstances don’t determine your standings in life. You know this. You can pretend otherwise, but in the depths of your heart you know better. You use the excuses to abstain from action.

The way to see this truth clearly is really simple. Just think of your biggest obstacle, your biggest fear or doubt.

Then think of someone who had the same obstacle or fear and overcame it. Or better yet, think about someone whose obstacle was twice as big as yours.

There are people on this planet who faced the same struggle, on an even larger scale than you, and still succeeded. That is an indisputable fact.

Thus, it’s not the external obstacles that hinder us. The reason of our malaise lies in you and me.That’s why you need to feel, to touch and taste, that you have the power to change your life.

**Your body**

In my personal opinion (which is supported by the experiences and recommendations of many successful people), the best starting point is your body.

Your body is definitely something you have control of. What is more, you recognize this ability to control your body. You are perfectly sure that, if you decide to raise your hand, you will do it. The connection between the decision and the result is instantaneous. It is hard to come up with something more controllable than your own body.

Have you the gorgeous body of a model or a sports star?

Yes? Then my idea is not applicable to you, find another way.

No? Then there you have an occasion to improve.

**Start small**

It doesn’t have to be a magnificent transformation. I’m talking here about the first step, baby step, in gathering your confidence.

Just. Start. Doing. Something.

And observe that you have the control of one entity in the universe — of your person.

Are you morbidly obese? Don’t start by planning to run the marathon next month; walk around the block instead.

Have you got a high cholesterol level? Don’t radically change your diet; pick the one kind of food you want to get rid of and replace it with raw veggies or fruits. For example, every time you want to eat a slice of pizza, eat an apple or carrot instead.

[**Be consistent](http://www.expandbeyondyourself.com/staying-consistent/)**

Nothing more is necessary to start.

Your action doesn’t have to be smart, scientifically proven or even effective in the grand picture, but it must be consistent.

I used to do pushups to lose weight. This is a ridiculous idea. I know, because I went through it.

You can lose weight by doing pushups. And you can hammer a nail using your hand. But it is much more effective to focus on your diet in the first case and use the hammer instead of your hand in the other.

I was doing pushups almost every morning for four years without any visible effect. In fact, I gained some weight.

**Additional advantages**

But I also gained different advantages to those I expected. The consistency of this habit taught me that I had control over my behavior. It also built my muscles. When I finally lost the excessive pounds, I found I had a nice musculature.

When I read [*The Slight Edge](http://www.expandbeyondyourself.com/about/the-slight-edge/)* and was looking for the [small, consistent activities](http://www.expandbeyondyourself.com/ten-minute-philosophy/) in my life that made the difference, it was my keystone experience.

Because I was doing pushups for four years, I immediately understood Jeff Olson’s teachings. It was the first stop to embracing his philosophy and the starting point of my transformation.

Do you see how many blessings came from this single tiny discipline? Without it I would have said, that the book is a heap of New Age garbage. That it fuels wishful thinkers with false hopes for good fortune, which will never come.

**It’s not just me**

Darren Hardy, in his book, [*The Compound Effect](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P1YCNK/)*, gave an example of an obese woman who wished to run a half-marathon. He trained her. She started with the 1 mile walk around the block. During the first 2 weeks she had to walk this distance 3 times. Then she was gradually increasing the intensity of her trainings.

After a total of seven weeks, she was jogging one mile.

Then she was gradually increasing the distance of her runs.

In nine months, she was running 13.5 miles regularly.

Start doing something. And never give up. Tune your methods, but never give up.

I went from doing a single consecutive series of common pushups in the early morning to doing a few series of legs-elevated, different types — narrow or wide grip or diamond — pushups. But I still do them.

**Try**

There is always something you can start with. And you know perfectly what this is. You just … procrastinate.

Or you think your past equals your future. You tried to quit smoking several times and failed. Once you persevered 6 months before you went back to your addiction. What’s the use of trying? You will fail anyway…

But what’s the use of ***not*** trying? You already are [a loser](http://www.expandbeyondyourself.com/its-ok-to-be-a-loser/), you smoke; you cannot make the situation any worse by another attempt to quit smoking.

Maybe you are the Thomas Edison of quitting smoking? You just have to try 999 times and fail to find this one method which will work for you.

**Start doing something**

Passiveness, indifference, is not the solution. There is a definition of insanity — doing the same thing and expecting a different output. As the late Jim Rohn said, you cannot change the destination of your life within the single day. But you can change the direction of your life within the single moment. The moment of decision.

I saw once Nick Vujicic, on YouTube, genially illustrating this point. There was a phone on the stage and he was supposed to reach it. Instead, he wandered around the stage for a couple of minutes.

At last, he set himself straight toward the phone and he came to it slowly, one pseudo-step at a time.

When you put yourself in the right direction there is nothing left to do, but to move closer and closer to your goal. The speed is irrelevant as long as you go steadily in the right direction.

**Transform Your Body Transform Your Life**

We are spiritual creatures put into a physical body. The bond between your spirit, your mind and your body exists and affects you all the time. Use it to your advantage. Take care of your body and you will change your life.

# This is How to Grow Your Grit&#58; 5 Secrets From Research

## This is How to Grow Your Grit: 5 Secrets From Research

Do you stick to your long-term goals? Or do you constantly get distracted by new ideas and projects?

Do you keep showing up when things get difficult? Or do you procrastinate and give up?

Your answers to these questions are important because they say a lot about the level of success you’re likely to experience in life.

### “80% of success is showing up”

That quote belongs to legendary actor, author, filmmaker, comedian, playwright, and musician Woody Allen (1).

When giving advice to aspiring writers, he elaborated on his statement this way (2):
> *My observation was that once a person actually completed a play or a novel he was well on his way to getting it produced or published, as opposed to a vast majority of people who tell me their ambition is to write, but who strike out on the very first level and indeed never write the play or book.*

Some people *talk*. They are the ones who “strike out” and get stuck.

Other people *do*. They are the ones who make consistent progress and get real results.

So, what separates these two groups from each other? In one word, the answer is…

### Grit

In short, grit is “perseverance and passion for long-term goals.” (3)

The psychological definition of grit contains two components:

1. The ability to stick to long-term goals.

1. The ability to keep going despite adversity.

Angela Duckworth is a professor of psychology and pioneer in grit research.

In study after study, she has found that “where talent counts once, effort counts twice.” (4)

She explains that finding with this formula:

**TALENT x EFFORT = SKILL**

**SKILL x EFFORT = ACHIEVEMENT**

When you apply effort to a talent, you get a *skill*. And when you apply effort to a skill, you get *achievement*.

Without effort, your talent is just untapped potential.

And without effort, your skill is just something you could’ve done, but never did.

That is why grit counts twice, and that is why it’s such an important factor.

### 5 Ways to Grow Your Grit

Grit is the best predictor of success that researchers have found.

It helps kids do better in school, high-school students graduate, university students get higher grades, soldiers follow through on demanding military training, and adults succeed at work and stay in their marriages (5).

No matter what long-term goals you’re trying to achieve, you need grit to get there.

And the good news is that you can grow your grit.

By looking at life as a marathon rather than a sprint, and by developing certain factors that are indirectly connected to grit, you can [realize your potential](http://www.selfication.com/mindset/realize-your-full-potential/). Here’s how:

### 1. Pursue Your Interests

You’re going to have a hard time sticking to goals that don’t fascinate you.

So, **the first step to growing your grit is to find something interesting.**

But that doesn’t mean sitting around thinking about what your passion is.

According to Angela Duckworth, it’s much more efficient to get out there and try different things until you’ve found something you’re passionate about.

Once you’ve done that, it’s time to find a role model, mentor or [coach](http://www.selfication.com/resources/coaching/) to help you improve.

### 2. Practice, Practice, Practice

Hard work leads to competence, and we’re much more likely to stick with things we’re good at.

The most gritty people always want to improve, no matter what it takes or how good they already are.

So, when you’ve found your interest, put in the work to [get a little bit better every day](http://www.selfication.com/peak-performance/get-better-at-what-you-do/).

**Compete with who you were yesterday.**

Do a slightly harder workout. Meditate a little longer. Stick with a boring task even though you don’t want to.

Consider these challenges [mental resistance training](http://www.selfication.com/mental-toughness/comfortable-being-uncomfortable/).

### 3. Connect to a Higher Purpose

People who connect what they do to a higher purpose are grittier.

It’s not enough to have a compelling interest.

You also have to take a step back and understand how what you do contribute to the well-being of others.

That is not only useful for increasing your grit. It also helps you enjoy the task more.

So, **reflect on how what you do benefit the people around you.**

### 4. Cultivate Hope

If you want to reach your goals, you first need to believe it’s possible.

Limiting beliefs about your abilities being fixed and unalterable affects your grit negatively.

And they are also plain wrong.

Research has shown that you have the possibility to change your brain and learn new skills throughout your life.

Your brain is “plastic”(6), and you can reshape it through effort and experience.

So, **go after your goals with the belief that you can improve if you work hard at it.**

Because you can.

### 5. Surround Yourself With Gritty People

The people around you have a huge influence on your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

When you spend enough time with a particular group of people the way, they do things become the way *you* do things.

Their norms and values will rub off on you and become your new standard.

So, one of the most efficient ways to grow your grit is a kind of positive peer pressure.

**Surround yourself with gritty people, and it’s only a matter of time before you’re just as gritty yourself.**

### How to Grow Your Grit, In Summary
> *Grit is the stubborn refusal to quit. — Jonah Lehrer*

Successful people **stick with their long-term goals instead of getting distracted, **and they **keep showing up, even when it’s difficult**.

If you lack those abilities, you can grow your grit in these five ways:

1. **Pursue your interests.** Find something that fascinates you.

1. **Practice, practice, practice.** Get a little bit better every day.

1. **Connect to a higher purpose.** Ask yourself how you are helping other people.

1. **Cultivate hope.** Remove your inaccurate, limiting beliefs.

1. **Surround yourself with gritty people.** Create positive peer pressure.

80% of success is showing up. With that in mind, what will you stop talking about and start doing?

# Washing Strangers’ Hair

## 

I began washing hair when I was sixteen. Don’t get me wrong, I did other things — I swept, and I took people’s money and put it in the cash register; sometimes I stood next to a hair stylist and held a lock of hair in place while she searched for the perfect bobby pin. But, mostly, hair washing was my gig and I liked it that way.

That’s the way you make tips, after all, and that’s the way you get to explain yourself to clients. Because when the weekly perm comes in for a touch-up or the young business man stops by for a trim and sees you dusting shelves and sweeping up and washing towels, they form an opinion of you. And maybe when you’re a teenager that opinion isn’t so bad, maybe it’s just that you have a good work ethic and how that must be nice for your parents, but when you get to be a bit older, people become less generous with their assumptions. Maybe they think you don’t take yourself seriously; definitely they think they’re brighter than you — you with the fingertips stained with dye and the single dollar bills spilling from your apron. They think they’re brighter than the hairdressers who are learned in chemistry and they think they’re brighter than the salon owner because she wears plastic gloves to perform a part of her job. Of course they think they’re better than you, wash girl. That’s why it’s nice to have a chance to explain yourself.

You can adjust their head in the sink just so, and once you have determined if the water temperature is too hot or too cold, they will say hello and ask you polite questions and you can explain that you’re home from college and earning extra money for the holidays and this is your major and here’s what you plan on doing with it and you’ve also had several internships and yes, you’ve read that book and here are some arbitrary facts about politics-theater-sociology thrown in for good measure to prove you are better than they think you are. They will be happy to hear you have ambitions beyond washing strangers’ hair and they will tip you and, the next time you see each other, they will ask you how your studies are coming along.

Of course, you shouldn’t begin to explain yourself without provocation; some people would prefer that you listen to them talk about their daughters-in-law or their retirement parties or their grandchildren. That can be nice, if you are interested in gossip about people you do not know, which I usually am. Others prefer silence — for some people, the only quiet time of their day is spent with you; their busy busy heads quite literally in your hands as your fingers spiral their way over every inch of scalp. This is simple enough to learn though; we intuitively know when someone prefers his own silence to the sound of another person.

What isn’t as easy to learn is the actual washing part, because some heads fit into the sink better than others. Some people instinctively crane their necks upward when talking about things that excite them, twisting to make eye contact, and the hose sprays out into the open air and gets everything wet. When people are afraid to relax, their necks tense and refuse to rest in the space created specifically for them; when these clients rise from the chair, their backs are damp, little half-moons of sink water staining their shirts. And don’t get me started on hair dye; as soon as hair dye is involved, you are scrubbing ears and cleaning hairlines, and your charge refuses to leave the sink area until all traces of inauthenticity have been removed from his skin. This takes forever in some cases.

But eventually I learned how to wash any head. How intimate it is. You have to figure; I could see things they didn’t even know were happening to them. I could see pimples that had been scratched raw by way of invisibility, I could see scars, I could see patches of grey coming in like rainclouds — blacks and blues, bruises and bumps. Not only that, but I could see their faces lose shape as I brought them pleasure, as they let go, as they became clean. I was very good at this by the time I stopped working in salons for good, about three years ago.

Would it be strange to tell you that I miss it? It’s just that I’d become very good at the whole thing, the whole intuitiveness and listening and touching thing. I’d become good at working with the difficult ones, the ones who didn’t quite fit in the sink but needed my attention and expertise all the same. I became good at it all, and some days it feels like it’s going to waste. So once in a while I ask whomever I’m dating at the time, when we’re in the shower together, if I can wash his hair. And he’ll allow me to lather and scrub and massage — but the rinsing part, the part where I’d gently lean the head back and take special care to protect the eyes; each one always takes this step into his own hands, and each one does it the same way. Their heads tilt forward, the water passes through soapy strands of hair, and shampoo stings their eyes like it’s no big deal. Every time this happens, I can’t believe what I’m seeing; it’s like they feel nothing.

# This is the 1 Thing Successful People Do Differently

## This is the 1 Thing Successful People Do Differently

In the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, psychologist Walter Mischel explored the self-control in children with a simple but effective test (1).

He and his researchers began their experiments by presenting a preschooler with a plate of treats such as marshmallows.

The child was then told that the researcher had to leave the room for a couple of minutes. Before they left, they gave the child the two options:

”If you wait until I come back you’ll get two marshmallows. If you can’t wait, you can ring a bell and I will come back immediately, but then can only have the marshmallow in front of you”.

Mischel’s ‘marshmallow test’ laid the groundwork for the modern study of self-control and it has been replicated many times over.

And the results are always fascinating.

### What Marshmallows Can Teach Us About Success


The purpose of the experiment wasn’t to study the children’s strategies to resist the marshmallow. Although it does provide some pretty great entertainment.

It wasn’t until years later when Mischel revisited the children in his study that he got his results and made a groundbreaking insight.

When interviewing the participants, who were now in their teens, he found that those who had waited longer in the marshmallow test were more likely to have higher grades in school.

Their parents also rated them better at planning, handling stress, having self-control in frustrating situations, and concentrating without getting distracted.

It turned out that Mischel’s simple marshmallow test in many ways could predict how successful the children would be later in life (!!).

### The 1 Thing Successful People Do Differently

In 1940, insurance industry executive Albert E.N. Gray gave a speech that has since become very popular (2).

In his speech, Gray tells the story of how he wanted to find out what makes successful people successful.

In fact, he wanted it so badly that he set out on a decade-long quest to find the answer.

He began by reviewing the research on topics like motivation, behavior, performance, and job satisfaction.

Next, he read thousands of books, magazines, and biographies.

And finally, he spent over 20 years conducting empirical research on the subject.

What all this searching taught him came down to the following:
> *“The common denominator of success — the secret of success of every person who has ever been successful — lies in the fact that **they formed the habit of doing things that failures don’t like to do.**”*

### Do What Others Don’t Like to Do

This is exactly what the kids in the marshmallow experiment were doing.

The ones who could successfully resist the urge to eat their marshmallow (doing what others don’t like to do) ended up more successful.

That is the 1 thing successful people do differently — [they suffer now, so they get to spend the rest of their lives as champions](http://www.selfication.com/comfortable-being-uncomfortable/).

Successful people understand that **to get results most people don’t get, they have to be willing to do what most people aren’t willing to do**.

And because of this they [consistently make progress](http://www.selfication.com/get-better-at-what-you-do/) by pushing through where everyone else gives up.

### Tearing Down the Brick Walls

Randy Pausch was a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University (3).

In 2007, he was given a terminal pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Before he passed away, he gave a fantastic lecture called “The Last Lecture: Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams” (4) where he gave the following advice:
> *“The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. **The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something**. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough. They’re there to stop the *other* people.”*

Whenever I get stuck in my writing, tired in a workout session, bored while meditating, or resist some tedious business task, I try to remember these wise words.

This discomfort, this obstacle, this *brick wall* is just another opportunity for me to do the 1 thing successful people do differently.

This is my chance to do what other people don’t like to do.

And for every brick wall I tear down, I get a little stronger. Every pile of bricks I leave behind makes me more confident I can take down the next wall in my path.

### How About You?

What are you resisting in your life right now? What tasks should you get started on? Which projects should you complete? What habits should you get started? Who should you call?

Each one of these ‘shoulds’ represents a glowing opportunity for you to start doing the 1 thing successful people do differently.

Which brick wall will you tear down first?

# Leonardo’s Bridge

## Leonardo’s Bridge

### Striving for simple solutions to complex problems

Recently the [Arizona Science Center](http://www.azscience.org/) hosted an exhibit of Leonardo da Vinci’s works. Leo created some very cool stuff. Big Stuff. Mona Lisa big.

Anyway, tucked off to the side of the display amidst all of these glorious creations was this pile of logs.

“What’s this pile of logs doing here?” I wondered.

Rewind back 600 years and Leo was a military engineering gun-for-hire. He soon gained fame among war mongers far and wide for his ability to create solutions to the pressing problems of the day - castle conquering, army slaughtering … things like that.

![Leonardo’s multi-barrel Canon Carousel.](0*c4erIrD-rplOyrIZ.jpeg)*Leonardo’s multi-barrel Canon Carousel.*

Some were visually and technically impressive indeed. The multi-barreled canon carousel, the human powered tank, massive catapults and the like.

One day, a prominent war monger calls Leo in and the following conversation occurs:

War Monger: Leo, I need to build a bridge to span a creek or small river

Leo: No problemo

War Monger: I need to build it with only the stuff laying around nearby

Leo: No problemo

War Monger: And it needs to support the weight of men and horses and war machines.

Leo: Still no problemo.

War Monger: And it has to be assembled quickly and disassembled without leaving a trace of its existance.

Leo: Relax. I got this.

The next day Leo shows up with a pile of logs.

War Monger: “What is this?”

Leo: “It is a bridge to cross a creek or small river built with only materials nearby that will support the weight of men and horses and war machines that can be assembled quickly and disassembled without leaving a trace of its existance.”

War Monger: “That’s just a pile of logs”

Leo: “Watch this”

And faster than you can say “holy crap they just crossed the river” Leo transforms the pile of logs into a fully self-supporting bridge.

These days we like to throw all kinds of fancy resources at problems. Asked to build a bridge, a gaggle of newly minted CAD savvy engineerlings pound keys and run load analysis algorithms until voila - a bridge is born.

Back in the day, we just needed a creative mind and a pile of logs.

I keep this photograph on my desktop now as a constant reminder to strive towards solutions of elegant simplicity and function.

# Why happiness should be your business model

## Make Happiness Your Business Model

### There’s a new breed of entrepreneur on the block — those that put happiness first. But what’s remarkable is how, in making this choice, these companies are becoming highly profitable.

Last year saw a huge surge in startups. In the UK alone half a million new companies were started. With only 25% of all startups continuing business a year after they’ve launched, the question on every budding entrepreneur’s lips is:
> # “What’s the secret to building a successful company?”

Well, we believe we have the answer.

**Zappos** have done it.

**Southwest Airlines** have done it.

And now more and more **startups **are following suit.

### **They’re making happiness their business model.**

Yes, you heard that right.

There’s a new breed of entrepreneur choosing happiness before profits**. **But what’s remarkable is how, in making this choice, these companies are becoming highly profitable.
> # By placing the happiness of their employees and customers first, they’ve created incredibly strong cultures and an even happier balance sheet.

So if you’re one of those people setting out into the world of entrepreneurship, then it’s worth spending some time defining what will make *you *happy as this will give your startup a more solid foundation to build upon.

### Happy founders are the first essential component of [**happy startups](http://www.thehappystartupschool.com/).**

![](1*q_FhZobTuaZj3HBDBD0UFw.png)

### **It starts with passion**

We spend most of our waking lives at work.

It’s a big part of who we are, so it’s important that however we’re earning a living, we’re enjoying what we do.

By finding and following what excites you, you’ll help to give your life real meaning and your business its mojo. The path to a profitable business starts with recognising where your passion lies.

And don’t just think *‘what do I enjoy?’*, but rather *‘which problems do I see that need addressing that get me excited?’*.

![](1*1tJ39n5osk35R5dPR3h4FQ.png)

It’s vital to your startup’s progression that you’re passionate about the problem you’re trying to solve.

After all you’ll probably be devoting several years of your life and some long hours, so it’s vital that you’re into what you’re doing.

If you’re not, it will show – in your ability to motivate yourself and others, the quality of your service or product and the relationships you build with your customers.

### **Happiness and effectiveness**

Take a second and think about how you work when you’re not happy, when you’re feeling negative, anxious or stressed.

Are you creative? Inspired? Motivated? Engaged? Is our productivity at its peak?

Our ability to work at our most effective reduces when we’re feeling stressed or under pressure. We can’t make decisions thoughtfully or work to our full potential.

Now turn it around. When you feel happy, how do you work? Are you charged up, feeling creative and positive about outcomes? More resilient and persistent when we suffer setbacks?

Our brains become more alert, open to ideas and innovation when we’re happy, letting us to work to our full potential. It’s a recipe for productivity that comes much easier to those whose business idea revolves around something they believe in.
> # “If employees are treated right, they treat the outside world right, the outside world uses the company’s product again, and that makes the shareholders happy.”
> # Herb Kelleher, Southwest Airlines

### **Happy employees = happy customers**

Study after study proves that happy teams are more creative, productive and effective. Just think about it for a second.

* **Happy employees **are nicer to be around, they like making their customers happy and therefore work harder to achieve that.

* **Happy customers** spend more money, are more loyal to a brand and tell their friends and family. It’s a marketing plan in itself.

* **And as a founder** working with people you like on a business you believe in, means everyone can work together towards a common, meaningful goal.

![*It’s not a sexy graphic, but it proves that happier customers spend more*](0*yNuMJu3tIz3Hx7hx.png)**It’s not a sexy graphic, but it proves that happier customers spend more**

## **So who’s on board the happy bus?**

As well as a variety of diverse businesses we’re seeing a movement of individuals that want to start businesses firstly as a lifestyle choice, and secondly to make money.

These startup founders are choosing to do things differently for various reasons that may include:

* Spending more time **doing what they love**

* Spending more time **with who they love**

* Flexibility to make** better life choices**

* **Solving problems t**hey see that need fixing

* The freedom to **choose how and where they work**

![](1*qOSvR15D9Ce3RxDmR1kMug.png)

## **So how can you take action?**

Start with the following 3-step process to make happiness your business model:

### **1) Define what success looks like to you**

Before you start on your entrepreneurial journey, it’s vital that you consider what you’re in this for.

Whatever success looks like, it’s probably not where you are now.

*Really* spend time thinking about what your end goal is. Try to focus on the life you want and the impact you want to make on people’s lives, not the numbers you need (that will come).

![Take our free lesson: [Cheery postcard from the future](http://www.thehappystartupschool.com/cheery-postcard)](1*U7wf67gczae32FS5evOjNw.png)*Take our free lesson: [Cheery postcard from the future](http://www.thehappystartupschool.com/cheery-postcard)*

> # Richard Branson

![The Happy Startup Canvas: Our framework for building a purpose-driven business](1*93KC5fuSXF_Ixc0mJQ3XnA.png)*The Happy Startup Canvas: Our framework for building a purpose-driven business*

### **2) Define your company DNA**

We believe you can lay the foundations for success by really defining who you are and what you stand for – your values, passion and purpose. At [The Happy Startup School](http://www.thehappystartupschool.com/), we believe passion trumps any kind of entrepreneurial experience. Defining your passion is what will drive you to succeed – after all if you’re not passionate about your business why should anyone else be?

This passion will help you define your business purpose and help people rally around your cause.

**Rather than saving ‘the real you’ for the margins of life, you’ll be living a [seven day weekend](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seven-Day-Weekend-Better-Work-Century/dp/0099425238)!**

It will create a contagiously happy environment for the people around you, with a positive effect on both productivity and profits.

Having a clear purpose will help people to know why you exist, giving your brand more resilience and your company a reason for being. It will also help you make quicker decisions.

### **3) Play around with your ideas**

Boldly go where no one has gone before. There are hundreds of challenges yet to solve and you have the exciting opportunity to create a business around your purpose.

**It’s just a matter of testing different ideas and creating some engineering some serendipity.**

By exploring different business models from your mission, we firmly believe you’ll make your own luck and be on the path to aligning your work to your values.

Happy startups means a happier world – something we all believe in.

***At [The Happy Startup School](http://www.thehappystartupschool.com) we’re helping a new breed of entrepreneur to realise their dreams. We run [experiences and programs](http://www.thehappystartupschool.com/events) that set people on a happier path, with the support of inspiring teachers, mentors and peers.***

# The Urge to Create.

## The Urge to Create.

I used to think I wasn’t creative. That I couldn’t be, that just wasn’t who I am. But, I was wrong in all honesty. Why was I wrong? I was wrong because being creative is a choice. Understanding this had been pivotal for me.

How is being creative a choice? And how am I creative? I am becoming more and more creative as I CHOOSE to do so. I open my mind to the possibility of creation and study those who are labeled “creative-types”. If you hear any of “them” talk you’ll soon see the pattern that it is a choice and everything is creation on some level. You’ll hear them talk about struggles/successes on the path to getting their work done, and how they strategize to impose self sanctions or guidelines that enable the process. What each may do differs slightly or even greatly, but there is a framework. It can appear that there is a modicum of chaos or disorganization, especially on the surface level in any creative endeavor by anybody — some fall more so towards one extreme or the other. But, below the surface for any creator there is *some *kind of structured choices. Be it the time of day, location, diet, drink of choice, exercise, morning ritual, or any other number of infinite variables. Managing these afformentioned and the countless other small details of the process of life and it’s relationship to creation. Creativity in framework, medium and method are always available as a choice.

How will I choose? First I think that the only way to do anything long term is to get it to the point of becoming habit. Continuous repetition of behavior until it becomes “second nature”. The habit and momentum framework. I’ve read recently that a habit can only be replaced by another habit. I choose to make creativity a habit, if I need to replace a bad habit for that to occur then I embrace that. I am exploring the best framework to enable me to habituate a continual creative practice. This exploration is ongoing, and has yet to manifest in concrete sustained behaviors but that is the direction of my intents and actions.

![Order, chaos. Creating.](1*WXtSQlbMClcZkCgGbzpw6g.jpeg)*Order, chaos. Creating.*

Anybody can be creative in some form. You and I have many gifts to explore and many destinys awaiting choices, the many ways to answer the question: What do I want to create? There needs to be a dream, something chosen. Then, how you create is by choosing a medium then, learning from and studying those that are doing it *well. *Couple that with effort, and dedication of attention, or focus. What keeps you going? Your *motive-*ation. Why? Why you create is a deeply personal place, it will be different just as the framework chosen to facilitate creation will be. I think that choosing to truly express yourself, and give the world something —is a reason that almost anybody can get behind to develop something valuable. Don’t think like I did, that being creative is something only reserved for “them”. CREATE with the choices of daily life, CREATE with dreams and imagination. Find CREATIVE people that have long ago made the choice that bonds every designer, developer, entrepreneur, inventor, artist, writer, and all the others. The choice to express and give something they have. They have it, you have it, I have it too.

# Dieting&#58; The Vegetarian Edition

## Becoming a vegetarian to lose weight is the same as saying everything you buy at Trader Joe’s is healthy.

![](1*sTQl8-P7d_IsimUofBrC5g.jpeg)

It’s easy to think that cutting out meat or animal products all together will make you healthier. However, as an almost lifelong vegetarian, I know it’s easy to be a chubby, not-so-healthy herbivore.

![](1*DN7vsy7r-vdxxP44EwALPA.jpeg)

**I’ve been a vegetarian since I was six. This decision has been blamed on the movie, *Babe*.**

**Like any kid, my diet wasn’t optimized for health. The main components were grilled cheese, pasta, and milk.**

**There was great debate over whether or not animal crackers were allowed. I ate them anyway.**

### Over the years I evolved in an effort to stay trim.

I was never *super* overweight, but I had my chubby periods. As a girl growing up in “The OC,” knowing I wanted to be an actor, and seeing how I compared to my friends (let alone successful actors), my weight was always a concern. *We’ll save the debate on social influences affecting self-image for another day.*

## Here’s my journey:

![My weight loss has been a gradual process, so instead of some cool before & after photos (which really only look cool if you’ve lost 100lbs), here is a little timeline.](1*b2FuYOYPOkTdZKzxYLcw9w.jpeg)*My weight loss has been a gradual process, so instead of some cool before & after photos (which really only look cool if you’ve lost 100lbs), here is a little timeline.*

**High School:** I decided I wanted to be a healthy (skinny) vegetarian. I started eating tons of tofu and whole-wheat everything. I was made fun of for only eating “health foods,” while my friends ate candy, pizza, cookie dough, and all things terrible for you. Despite my diet, I was always bigger than my meat-eating, junk-food-loving friends. That’s what I get for hanging out with cheerleaders.

**College**: I experimented with calorie counting, but only started losing weight when I had to strength train for a role I was cast in. This is how I inadvertently stumbled upon the simple fact that **muscle burns fat. **I also discovered something more important: ***when I was not obsessing over losing weight, I actually saw a change***.

**Real Life (Post College):** A herniated disc put me out of commission for a little over a year. While the limp and inability to sit for more than 15 minutes were not super fun, I do credit my injury for getting me in better shape. The physical therapy I received helped me step up my strength training more than ever. Again, my goal was not to lose weight, but the work I was doing made me more fit than I had ever been.

Since then, I’ve gradually lost more weight as I reduced the grains in my diet. I went from eating whole-wheat pasta, bread, and brown rice to only eating quinoa. Then I made the shift to [Tim Ferriss’ Slow-Carb Diet](http://fourhourworkweek.com/category/the-4-hour-body/). This meant getting rid of all grains, fruit, dairy, and soy products. I was reluctant, but saw a significant improvement once I got rid of these foods.

In the year before I started the Slow-Carb Diet, I began to allow myself cheat meals. Now that I’m on the Slow-Carb Diet, I’m having full cheat days with croissants, pizza, beer, and ice cream. I would *never* have done that in high school, yet I’m 15–20 lbs smaller and having a lot more fun.

## **Lessons Learned:**

### **1. Focus on another goal.**

*My ability to work as an actor kept me on track, whether it was improving strength for a role or so I could walk straight after an injury.*

*This goes with the lesson below, but it should be noted that I don’t think I would have been as successful if I was working out purely to lose weight. These other goals were huge motivators for me; I was no longer working out for vanity’s sake.*

### 2. Build Muscle

*Treadmills are fun and all, but I didn’t see any significant results until I started strength training.*

### **3. *Slowly* cut out the grains, soy, dairy, and fruit.**

*I couldn’t have imagined having a diet in which I didn’t rely on these staples. I think the only way I’m able to keep on track with the Slow-Carb diet is because I took my time removing these foods from my diet.*

### 4. Protein. Protein. Protein.

*I didn’t realize how much more protein I could have in a day until starting the Slow-Carb Diet. I credit much of my improved shape to egg whites and black beans.*

# Get to sketching

## Get to sketching

### Tips on sketching your way into an idea.

Sketching is something we are all capable of. If you’re skeptical or intimidated by taking up the pencil, here are a few tips on getting ideas out of your head and into your hands.

## Build your own language

![Throughout your sketches, settle on just two or three shapes to represent your ideas. I lean a lot on boxes to represent the images, text, and buttons that go on websites.](1*4PdWsxZ-8gbUK3BIOnvD0w.jpeg)*Throughout your sketches, settle on just two or three shapes to represent your ideas. I lean a lot on boxes to represent the images, text, and buttons that go on websites.*

I sketch a lot of websites, so most of my experiments are a mix of images, text, and buttons. Whatever you’re working on, think of a way to visually reduce it to only 2 or 3 shapes or symbols that you use repeatedly. Ideally, these symbols are some type of box that you can adjust.

## Less wrist, more elbow

Lots of people sketch using a lots of little lines until they have a prickly shape created.

Instead, look where you want to go and make the mark in as few lines as possible. Keep a still wrist, then use only your elbow and shoulder to draw. Who cares if shapes are crooked or misaligned. The more ambivalent you are about your marks, the quicker you will find them useful.

## Avoid criticizing yourself

Ignore whatever internal voice tells you that your sketch *“sucks”* or that it’s *“bad”*. You are physically exploring an invisible problem and that is all that matters. Ignore the criticism, especially from yourself.

## Use huge paper

Personally, I love big sketch books, especially [this beast from Moleskine](http://shop.moleskine.com/en-us/notebooks-journals/creativity/folio-book-a3-plain-hard-cover-black).

![I love my huge Moleskine. At times, the big pages can be intimidating. It’s important to stay honest and not let the book formalize what you’re there to do: explore rough ideas quickly.](1*yK0lVFigwA2cWXChpAC9fA.jpeg)*I love my huge Moleskine. At times, the big pages can be intimidating. It’s important to stay honest and not let the book formalize what you’re there to do: explore rough ideas quickly.*

Give yourself enough space to work through whatever it is you’re sketching. Maybe use all that extra room for notes or chop through a few *“bad”* ideas. Sometimes, interesting things happen when you give your mind a chance to explore without doubt or judgement.

Unless you’re a Pixar animator and can simultaneously create art while you doodle, try not to idealize or overthink the act of keeping sketches in a book.

## Start with a box

Don’t use the edges of your paper for the edges of an idea. Designate a separate space on the paper to sketch in. That will give you enough room to do multiple versions, or pepper in some questions or instructions to yourself.

![Using boxes or other symbols to get thoughts out of your head is all you need to get a big benefit from sketching. Start slow and don’t be too hard on yourself.](1*Oldxr7y2Z3SlPDYprXv0Gg.jpeg)*Using boxes or other symbols to get thoughts out of your head is all you need to get a big benefit from sketching. Start slow and don’t be too hard on yourself.*
> # Ignore whatever internal voice tells you that your sketch “sucks”* *or that it’s “bad”*.*

![It’s OK if sketches don’t reveal the entirety of your idea. As long as it’s enough to let your mind move on.

As long as it’s enough to let your mind move on. In the comparison above, once I felt comfortable with the content I jumped into coding a swanky invoice template for clients.*

## Getting started

The only thing you need to start is paper, pencil, and a problem to solve. Whatever you’re building, whether it’s a plan or a website, sketching is a super gratifying way to get your mind going. ***Good luck!***

# This is How to Master Your Habits&#58; Secrets From Research

## This is How to Master Your Habits: Secrets From Research
> *“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”
 — Aristotle*

Your life today is the result of your habits from the past:

* How in shape you are is a result of your habits.

* How educated you are is a result of your habits.

* How happy you are is a result of your habits.

* How much money you have is a result of your habits.

* How good your relationships are is a result of your habits.

I could keep going, but I’m sure you get the point. As the late, great Jim Rohn used to say: *”Success is nothing more than a few disciplines, practiced every day. Failure is a nothing more than a few errors, repeated every day.”*

So, if you want to lead a successful life, it’s crucial that you learn how to master your habits. Here’s how.

## The Habit Loop

According to researchers at MIT, all habits follow the same neurological loop (1):

![](0*NT9G2f0ykitJoL-_.jpg)

1. **A cue** — The trigger that starts your habit. Example: You get an email notification.

1. **A routine** — The habit that follows the cue. Example: You open the email.

1. **A reward** — The benefit you gain from doing the habit. Example: You get to know what the email is about.

If you perceive the reward as positive, you’ll want to repeat the loop again the next time the cue shows up. If you repeat it enough times, it will become a habit.

The habit loop is a very useful framework because it makes it easy to dismantle your habits and manipulate its different parts.

Let’s go through each of the habit loop parts and look at the most powerful strategies for mastering them.

### 1. The Cue

Most people have very vague intentions for the habits they want to create.

Unfortunately, as you may have noticed, telling yourself that ”*I’ll work out three times this week*” rarely works.

And that’s because you haven’t created a proper cue for the behavior.

To build a solid habit, you need to know exactly when and where it will be taking place.

A stupid simple, yet incredibly powerful way of doing that, is to use [”*If* → *Then*” statements](http://www.selfication.com/habits/achieve-your-goals/) (2). You do that by completing the following statement:

***If* [situational cue], *Then* I will [planned response to the cue].**

For example: ”*If* I’m leaving work on a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday → *Then* I will go to the gym.”

Don’t be fooled by the simplicity of this strategy. More than 200 studies have shown that people who use *If* → *Then* planning are about 300 percent more likely than others to reach their goals (3).

### 2. The Routine

When we create new habits, we tend to want big results fast.

And because of that, we try to create big changes.

The problem, of course, is that it rarely works. Instead, what typically happens is that we overwhelm ourselves and quit shortly after we’ve started.

To avoid that trap, you need to make a simple shift in your mindset.

**Instead of obsessing over the results, start obsessing over showing up.**

Forget about the long-term results, and instead make the habit so ridiculously easy you can’t say no (4).

Go for a five-minute walk. Meditate for two minutes. Read one page in a book.

Build motivation and momentum by setting yourself up for, and celebrating, small wins.

Then, when the behavior is well established, you can incrementally increase your efforts.

### **3. The Reward**

To reinforce your habit, you need to reward yourself for doing it.

That can feel a bit awkward, especially in the beginning when the behavior is easy to do.

But the thing is, **you aren’t celebrating your results. You’re celebrating your ability to show up.**

Stanford psychologist and behavior expert BJ Fogg suggests you think of it this way (5):

*”The fact that you’re learning to change your behavior is a big deal. Think how rare a skill it is. Think how long behavior change has eluded you. And now you are succeeding.”*

Don’t celebrate your five-minute walk. Celebrate that you’ve taken another successful step to improve your life.

Allow yourself to do a quick fist-pump, short victory dance, or exclaim a proud ”yay, me!” each time you complete your habit.

Your brain will associate your habit with your reward. And that, in turn, will make it likelier you’ll keep doing it in the future.

## Breaking Bad Habits

The Habit Loop isn’t just helpful for creating good habits. It’s also very useful for getting rid of unwanted behaviors. All you have to do is analyze and manipulate the different parts of the already existing loop. Here’s how.

### 1. Cut the Cues

First, think about how you can cut out unhelpful cues. For example:

* If you smoke when you drink, don’t go to the bar.

* If you eat unhealthy snacks when you have them around the house, throw them out.

* If you watch too much TV, put the TV remote in another room (or put the TV in the garage).

Try to remove as many triggers as possible from your environment. In psychology, this is referred to as ”stimulus control.” (6)

### 2. Replace the Routines

Then, use *If* → *Then* plans to replace unwanted routines. For example:

* If I get the urge to smoke –&gt; Then I will [play Tetris](http://www.selfication.com/habits/overcome-cravings/).

* If I feel like eating a snack –&gt; Then I will have a fruit.

* If I want to turn on the TV –&gt; Then I will read two pages in [a great book](http://www.selfication.com/resources/recommended-books/).

The key here is to experiment with different routines to find substitutes that work for you.

### 3. Remove the Rewards

And finally, come up with creative ways to remove the rewards associated with your bad habit.

Let’s say you want to stop drinking alcohol. One way of removing the rewards associated with drinking is to take Antabuse (7). That will replace the pleasant short-term effects of alcohol with a reaction that is so unpleasant that you’d rather abstain from drinking.

You can also use services like [StickK](https://www.stickk.com/), [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) or [Pact](http://www.pactapp.com/) to create immediate consequences for giving into your bad habit.

# How to Overcome Bad Burnout at Work

## image source
> # The experience of long-term exhaustion and diminished interest, especially in one’s career. [[1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/burnout)]

You know that feeling when you’re exhausted but you still have so much to do? Your brain is working at 10% capacity, but you still keep pushing. That’s what we call burnout.

It’s when your body and mind are stretched to the limit, but you have to keep going. All your cells are screaming, “Give us a break!” and you say, “It’s OK. Just one more thing.”

It’s a common trap that we fall into when trying to get more things done. Ironically, working all the time and getting burnt out is counter-productive and we only end up sapping our energy.

## Why Is Burnout The Worst Thing Since Slavery?

### It Destroys Your Capacity for Work

If you only focus on doing more work, you’re ignoring a critical aspect of your productivity — your capacity for getting things done. Not taking breaks and sleeping enough will get you more work hours but in that time you’ll be operating nowhere near your full potential.

It’s like having a sports car that is tuned to perfection. But at the same time, you don’t put in good fuel, and you’re overheating the engine all the time. How well do you expect the car to perform, even if it’s perfectly tuned in every other aspect?

Your body and mind have a certain capacity to perform. If you take care of yourself well, that capacity will expand. And if you keep burning energy that you don’t have, your capacity will diminish.

### It’s a Downwards Spiral

The more burnt out you get, the less effective you’ll be. The less effective you are, the more hours you’ll have to put and get even more burnt out. Get the picture?

It’s not a good idea to try to do more work in, by putting more and more work hours in. Don’t keep burning energy that your body doesn’t have. Don’t sacrifice your long-term productivity just to get a short-term boost.

It’s just like budgeting your finances correctly. Sure you can spend money you don’t have by going into debt, but sooner or later it will catch up with you. Sooner or later you’ll have to suffer the consequences.

### You’re Screwed Long Term, Not Just for Today

The terrible thing about burnout is that you can get used to it. If you keep pushing yourself all the time, you won’t even notice that you’re tired anymore. It will just feel like your normal, everyday state.

So if you don’t take care of the burnout now, your whole life becomes one perpetual cycle of not having enough energy, and having to push yourself to the breaking point every day.

### It Kills the Passion for Your Job

Even though you might love what you do, being constantly burnt out makes you hate your work. Being in an endless rush to get things done doesn’t let you enjoy and appreciate your work.

After a while, it feels like your whole life is being consumed by it and you start asking yourself, “What’s the point?”

Don’t let burnout skew your feelings about your career. No matter what you do, it will never feel good if your life isn’t balanced.

## Practical Ways to Stop Burning Yourself Out

### Stop Procrastination

“I have plenty of time to do it later.”

That sentence has gotten me in trouble more than anything else in my life.

Sometimes we waste our energy on YouTube all day and then end up working until 3 AM getting burnt out. And on the next day, the pattern repeats since, “Hell, I was working so late last night, I deserve some YouTube today!”

By default, we’re very unrealistic about how much time work is going to take. We always underestimate it and end up staying up late.

So aim to start your most important work *first thing* in the morning. That extra willpower you spend on forcing yourself to start early will pay off big time in the long term.

Another awesome way to be more aware of how you spend your time is to track it. Toggl.com and Rescuetime.com are your friends.

### Be Careful with Coffee

Do you use coffee to enhance your productivity or to compensate for the lack of rest? If you drink 10 cups a day, it’s probably the latter.

Coffee can give you a nice boost of energy and focus, but again it’s a trade-off. Once your body has been alert and working on 120% for a while, you have to give it some extra rest afterward. Not burn it out with even more coffee.

Whenever you use caffeine, make sure you’re not trying to compensate for the fact that you haven’t taken a break in the last 5 hours. Or that you haven’t slept at all last night.

### Don’t Say, “Yes” Too Much

Prioritization is all about saying, “Yes” to the right things and, “No” to the wrong things.

Even if you’re the most productive bear in the world, you can’t get it all done. And if you’re a productivity nerd like me you probably hate saying, “No.” Is it like you’re admitting your limitations right? You want to be able to do everything that comes your way.

Well, that’s a one-way ticket to crazy land. You’ll feel more and more disappointed in yourself with each missed deadline.

A great habit to get into is never to say, “Yes” on the spot. Get into the routine of saying, “I’ll think about it and get back to you shortly.”

That’s a nice way of taking off the pressure to make the right decision immediately. It will also give you the space to think about your priorities and schedule realistically.

## What to Do When You’re Already Burning

Say you’ve already screwed up by saying, “Yes” to a ton of projects.

Or you’re so far behind on your work that you’re getting questionable looks from your boss.

Or your final exams are in 3 days, but you spent the last month making sure your browser’s history stays above 1,000+ Reddit entries/day.

What do you do then?

### Damage Control

Getting into a panic mode right now is probably the worst thing you can do.

First of all, admit to yourself that you won’t be able to get it all done. You ain’t got time for that.

You have to do a reality check and see how you can get the best out of the time you’ve got left. Prioritize and pick the 20% of the stuff that will get you 80% of the results. If you manage to do that 20%, you might be able to save your skin in the last minute.

### Stay Hydrated

When we’re burnt out, we tend to ignore what our bodies need even more. Even if you feel you don’t have time for it, take care of your body’s basic needs. Drink enough water and have a healthy meal.

The time that you will “lose” is nothing compared to pushing your body even further outside what it was designed to do.

### Take a Power Nap

Again, that feels very counter-intuitive, but naps have a huge effect on productivity and focus. Even 10–15 minutes can “restart” your brain and get you back on track.

Another benefit from naps is that they do kind of a “mood reset.” In critical situations when you’re stressed out of your mind saying, “Fuck it!” and taking a nap can be huge. You will wake up feeling much better.

Don’t use the “I don’t have a good place to do it in” excuse either. You can always find a way if you’re determined to do it.

I used to do some crazy stuff while working in the office to get my 10 minutes of shut-eye. I couldn’t sleep while everybody was watching, so I used my lunch break to sleep in my car. I also used the office bathroom to nod off for 5–10 minutes every two hours.

You can always find a way if you really want to.

### Get Your Blood Pumping

This is especially important if your ass is glued to a desk chair all day. Your body and brain get stale from the inactivity. And the more inactive you are, the worse your focus and productivity will get.

All of your systems work better when you get more oxygen and increase your heart rate. So use your body the way it was meant to be used. Give *it* what it needs so it can give you the focus and energy that *you* need.

Again, don’t make excuses. You can always find the time and place for a few pushups or squats. Stretching also feels amazing after hours of inactivity.

## Summary

When trying to get more things done managing your time will only get you so far. If you really want your productivity to soar learn to also manage your energy.

### How to Manage Your Energy Better

* Start with your most important and difficult to-dos

* Use coffee for enhancement, not compensation for lack of rest.

* Learn to say, “No” to the projects that are not important or you don’t have time for.

* Take care of your body’s basic needs *first* — food, water, exercise and sleep.

# Move with Presence

## Move with Presence

Movement is an experience.

There is great beauty in the recognition of your own movement. Moving is in our innate nature. However to truly enjoy movement — Presence is necessary. Despite the disconnection from nature, our modern cities have an abundance of activities where presence is necessary in movement. Yoga, dance, ancient martial arts such as tai chi and qigong all bring our awareness to the simple act of moving. In this post I will use [systema](http://m.blitzmag.net/training/reality-based-self-defence/502-internal-secrets-of-systema-breathing-and-conditioning) as an example of how to bring Presence to movement.

In the Cossack derived movement philosophy — systema, movement begins with a chain extension of awareness.

The first extension of awareness is Breath. In movement, it is important to oxygenate areas of the body that is moving. To bring presence to movement, it is essential to sync it with breath. There is a difference between syncing your breath with movement and syncing your movement with breath. In the later, there is an effortless elegance that coordination cannot match. The former is simply breath and movement occurring together and requires maintained focus. **Let the intelligence of the body guide your movement through breath **rather than thinking how to move and then trying to adjust your breathing to your movement. With Breath even moderately straining exercise such as free standing hand-stance and push-ups can be free of strength and, effortless. The importance of breathing will become more apparent with the second and third extensions of awareness.

The second extension of awareness is Relaxation. It is important to relax moving muscles. It is a common practice in fitness and personal training to overexert in order to build strength. However, the lactic acid build up during these exercises brings the immune system to a fragile state. Taking an alkaline diet and buy alkaline water is besides the point when you are undoing it with anaerobic training. **Where attention goes, breath follows. **Breathing into parts of the body that are moving will naturally relax these areas. Even when working out — relax your body. Relaxation will bring full range of movement, increase the duration of movement, reduce toxic acid buildup and therefore, negate recovery.

The third extension of awareness is Posture. Without proper alignment, movement takes more effort than necessary. Bringing awareness to the body with breath and relaxation allows the body to auto align itself. Key things to remember is to keep the spine straight and have a balanced weight distribution. Improving posture will immediately heighten your alertness and is fundamental to your presence. **Presence is generated within and has nothing to do with the way you get perceived.**

Movement becomes fluid, coordinated and effortless when the body is guided by these forgotten but nevertheless rudimentary principles.

In systema training, Presence is paramount under pressure. For example, when receiving a fist strike, if the body is not relaxed through breathing, tension in the body will absorb the hit and become a bruise. With the relaxation techniques described above, the body becomes like jelly and the impact of the hit is distributed evenly over the body.

When the body learns to relax under pressure, stressful situations in daily life trigger the body to relax naturally. **Relaxation becomes a natural response to stress.**

Bring Presence to movement. To be aware of which muscle groups are active in different movement patterns will greatly accelerate the process of learning new movements. The techniques described will stimulate your body’s natural intelligence — **You will move by instinct.**

# How to Weave the Social Fabric of Your Telecommuting Team

## One of the biggest problems of telecommuting is the isolation.

Work is a framework for a large part of our lives, so it’s only natural that it forms a part of our daily social fabric.

![We also recommend using Fiverr as a source of team inspiration. Here, a portrait of the Coach.me team by Fiverr artist [Cambyng](https://www.fiverr.com/cambyng/draw-cartoon-of-you-with-superhero-costume).](1*f_JykVfl9Eg0Z6du44FRDQ.jpeg)*We also recommend using Fiverr as a source of team inspiration. Here, a portrait of the Coach.me team by Fiverr artist [Cambyng](https://www.fiverr.com/cambyng/draw-cartoon-of-you-with-superhero-costume).*

The isolation of telecommuting is often seen as a problem of the individual. The solutions involve providing the individual some feeling of contact during the work day, often by way of a co-working location or shared office space…with members of other teams.

But isolation is a problem for the team, not just the individuals. Social interactions build trust, understanding, and resiliency that help a team function better.

There are chat and teleconferencing applications that work great for basic work communication. But these lack most of the hooks for the social interactions you get by working in the same space.

So you have to create them.

When [Coach.me](http://coach.me/) went completely virtual [in April](https://medium.com/@tonystubblebine/why-we-went-virtual-76b272051434#.hfl8g5yje), we knew we wanted to keep our social fabric active. We decided to have a video stand-up every morning. A daily video call like that is a great way to touch base regularly.

But then someone — probably [Alicia ](https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/)— had the brilliant idea of extending one of our weekly meeting tactics to our daily standup.

In our weekly product meetings (held in person at the office we used to occupy), we used our round robin strategy of asking a simple question to get each person to speak out loud right at the beginning of the meeting.

Here’s how we describe this tactic in our book, [Meeting Mastery](https://www.amazon.com/Meeting-Mastery-Coach-me-Leaders-Meetings/dp/1533326061):
> People who speak early in a meeting tend to speak up later. If you have people who tend to be reticent, try having a Round Robin of something easy and social at the beginning of the meeting so everyone speaks early.

In the product meeting, our question was simply, “What was a highlight of your weekend?”

## The Daily Question

We extended this tactic to our daily stand-ups by starting each morning with a “Question of the day”. We have a regular rotation to take turns answering the question of the day (and we still start Monday’s with “what was a highlight of your weekend?)

It quickly became obvious that this was a tactic we wanted to keep. It was FUN! Fun to come up with an interesting question, fun to think of an answer, and fun to get to know our co-workers on a deeper level. We enjoyed expressing ourselves, having philosophical debates, and gaining new respect for the life experiences of our teammates.

Some examples of our “Question of the Day” include:

* When did you feel like you were in the most danger?

* What got you to where you are today, but is now holding you back?

* What book did you read recently that you recommend?

* What’s your favorite movie/book/TV show/hike?

* What’s been in your Netflix (or similar) queue the longest that you still intend to watch?

* What’s the weirdest thing in your fridge?

* What’s the coldest/hottest temperature you’ve experienced?

* What are three other places you would live?

* What is a new hobby you started doing?

* What is your go-to thing to cook?

* What is your favorite food from childhood?

* What superstition/weird thing do you believe in?

* What is your ideal day?

* What new bit of slang have you learned recently?

* How has your sense of adventure changed as you’ve gotten older?

* What do you wish you could go back and tell yourself as a child?

As you can imagine, we learn quite a bit about each other in the course of answering these questions!

My experience is that I feel more bonded to my teammates. (Before we went to a completely telecommuting team, I was a telecommuter who came into the office once a week or so, so I probably benefit even more than the others.)

If you work with a telecommuting team, you probably lack some of the opportunities for social bonding that can make the team function better — and make it more enjoyable to work together. Try using the “Question of the Day” for any small remote team, or maybe even a small team working together in the same office.

By the way, we thought we’d start sharing our “Question of the Day” on Facebook and see how our larger community might like it. Follow us at [https://www.facebook.com/coachdotme](https://www.facebook.com/coachdotme) to see upcoming daily questions. We’d love to see your answers!

# 7 Things Employees Do That Bosses Hate

## 7 Things Employees Do That Bosses Hate

Forget what Rhonda Byrne said…

This is the REAL secret…

If you want to land the job of your dreams, get promoted, or just sleep easier knowing your job is secure, then this will be the best article you read all year.

But first, who am I to give you career lessons?

My name is [Justin Brooke](http://about.me/justinbrooke), I've been an honor student and a drop out. I've been the class clown and the curve breaker.

I've also been the employee that skates by, milks the clock, works the system, and now I’m the business owner of a highly sought after [marketing agency](http://www.adskills.com).
> # This makes me intimately aware of both sides

My intention with this article is to step back on your side, shoulder to shoulder as employees, and share with you what I've learned being on the other side of the desk.

Maybe one of the mistakes I've seen my own employees making, which lead to them being fired or passed up, will help you see where you can improve in your own career.

### You’re Too Busy

It might feel like it, but your boss doesn't want you to always be “busy.” What he/she actually wants is for you to always be effective.

When you complain about or demonstrate how busy you are to your boss, what he see’s is that you’re working ineffectively. You’re reminding him that you can’t manage your time, delegate, and problem solve well.

You feel like showing people how busy you are is something to be proud of, but actually you’re just reminding everyone that you‘re struggling to get the job done.

### It’s Never Your Fault

When something goes wrong, or a crisis happens at work all of a sudden it’s nobodies fault and every bodies fault at the same time.

Fingers fly out faster than roaches scatter when the lights turn on.

I know it’s scary to admit you've done something wrong. In fact it goes against your very own natural survival instincts. However, when you blame someone else your boss see’s you as just another person not helping him solve the problem.

As long as you’re not repeating the same mistakes over and over again it’s OK to take ownership of your mistakes. By redirecting the blame you’re showing the boss that you’re not on the same team as him.

### You’re On The Wrong Team

Many employees see their boss as the enemy or that they need to try and outsmart their boss.

Do you really want the guy (or gal) who signs your paychecks as your enemy?

The truth is they should be your greatest ally and they want you to be theirs. They have the power, knowledge, and resources to solve all of your problems and make all of your goals come true.

Trust me your boss can sense when you’re trying to pull the wool over his eyes, everyone’s doing it to him and he’s desperately looking for who is on his team and who is not.

### You Stretch The Truth

Did it really take you 4hrs to create those reports on Friday or was it more like 2.5? Were you just trying to make your day look full?

As the founder and owner of my own business, I can’t express how easy it is for me to tell when my employees are stretching the truth. I think they forget sometimes that I used to do their job.

Besides, the last thing in the world you want to happen is get caught in a lie — I mean truth stretching!

Once the trust is broken between an employee and a boss it’s very hard to get it back. Your boss will constantly question if he’s being fooled again and he may not say anything about it.

I promise you though that he’s thinking about whether or not he should hire someone else he can trust.

### Working The System

There is always that one employee who happens to know all the rules in the company handbook.

They’re the one who reminds everyone of holidays, HR rules, labor laws, etc. etc. Congratulations, to you for learning all of the rules and your boss applauds you for following them so closely.

He definitely does not want to bend the rules, especially the laws. He had all of those rules and systems created to protect him from doing exactly that.

However, chances are your boss is not a lawyer and is concerned more with making enough sales to cover your paycheck, than labor laws.

If you make your boss feel like he or she needs to walk on egg shells around you or like they have to constantly be aware of section 6a of page 17, you’ll be reminding them that you are a liability.

Just like you want your boss to be accepting of you when you make a mistake, he would like you to extend the same courtesy. And just like if you were to repeat the mistakes there would be consequences then the same should happen for the boss.

Lighten up, you’re both on the same team. If a mistake happens, talk about it, correct it, and move on.

### You’re Too Content

It’s your god given right too choose whether you want to be a ladder climber, or the guy who does what he’s asked and that’s enough for him.

I’ll tell you this though, building and running a business is fucking grueling work. Some days your boss thinks you’re the smart one and he’s the idiot for trying to be a business owner.

He’ll respect your right to choose whether to be content or motivated, but he’ll also be thinking “Damn I need to find someone who wants to grow with me.”

Remember it’s all about remembering that you are on the same team. You've got to align your goals with your bosses goals, otherwise, in the long run the inevitable will happen — your boss will outgrow you.

### You've Got Too Many Excuses

I saved the best (or should I say worst) for last.

As an employer, whenever I hear an excuse it makes my ears want to commit suicide.

Your boss already knows there is a “reason why” something went wrong and really he doesn't care. Your bosses boss is the clients and the customers and they don’t care about the reasons why or excuses.

The customers want results or they want their money back. In fact, I’ll bet that’s even promised somewhere in your companies marketing.

Save your time and your bosses time and skip the excuses. If something went wrong, apologize sincerely and briefly. Then tell him how you plan to fix it and by when, because at the end of the day that’s all that matters.

### One last thought…

If your first reaction is to say, “my boss is different and you don’t understand,” then you’re right. Your boss is different and I don’t understand.

What I do understand is that you’re not on the same team with him and that’s not going to work out long term. It’s not helping you nor him, so shit or or get off the pot!

My goal is to help a few people see through the eyes of their boss. To understand what the business owners perception is, so that they can align themselves with that and grow their career.

**Your CEO Friend,
Justin Brooke**

# It’s time to outgrow the generation gap

## It’s time to outgrow the generation gap

### Because we’re making progress and you’re going to be left behind.

I’ve read [so](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wait-but-why/generation-y-unhappy_b_3930620.html), [so](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/generation-y-millennials-entitled-poor) many lists and opinion pieces full of statistics, assumptions, and generalizations explaining why the people of my generation are the way we are. Why myself and my friends live in limbo between feeling like we deserve so much and still feeling like children, and most of all: why we won’t shut up about it.

Yes, many of us received at least one participation trophy in our lifetime. Many of us were told we can do anything. A lot of us got degrees we can’t use in a meager work force and paying off those degrees is proving to be, well, [near impossible](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/do-millennials-stand-a-chance-in-the-real-world.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0). But another [Top 20 List](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonnazar/2013/07/23/20-things-20-year-olds-dont-get/) of observations getting to the bottom of why we spend so much time on our smartphones and how to handle us seems to be beating a dead meme.

My generation as well as my parents’ and my future kids’ generations are all born into circumstances which define how our stories affect this planet. Millennials’ natural inclination for technology and aversion to paper maps are not pitfalls anymore than having a bit of a drawl is a pitfall of being raised in Georgia. We are products of our environment—for better or worse. You can call it anthropological, but the extreme scrutiny clouding each generation of 20-somethings is creating a mass hysteria. The words “millennial” and “Generation Y” have become [dirty ones](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/11/dictionary-baby-boomer-definitions-millennial/71261/). And at this point, these social explorations are not adding much to the conversation about the next generation to wear the metaphorical pants.

While my generation was unlearning the Dewey Decimal System and foregoing phone calls for texts, we were building up some new perspectives on the same old same old. We have some understanding of [who we are now](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682348/millennials-genuinely-think-they-can-change-the-world-and-their-communities), and we’re trying to focus on the future of the [world that was handed to us](http://www.fastcompany.com/1148348/millennials-rising-recession-road-map-gen-y).

There are plenty of Generation Y leaders whose entrepreneurial gumption was sparked by their millennial predisposition (and probably a handful of unpaid internships and decades worth of student debt). People like me and many of my friends who have thought, “Why not right now? We have nothing to lose.” It’s not a convenient choice. To be honest, it can be painstaking, but the resources to turn a passion into a profession are right at everyone’s fingertips, so why not grab it? Millennials continue to use their often-criticized [optimism](http://www.fastcompany.com/1533609/gen-y-more-positive-other-generations) as a motivating force to change the game.

**These are some of those people. The ones who make us think we can do anything, because they did.**

## **Brandon Stanton — [*Humans of New York](http://www.humansofnewyork.com/)***

*Proving social media can be more than a self-serving time suck—it can be a platform for powerful storytelling.*

Few people have had the immense success of social media storytelling as Brandon Stanton. Everyday, he posts photos of people in New York. Some of them look bizarre, some stylish, others pique his interest by their social interactions or setting. He snaps a picture and asks them a question about the saddest thing in their life or what they want to be when they grow up. And from this pocket full of questions comes the most gut-wrenching, sometimes simple, sometimes funny, sometimes enigmatic stories from complete strangers.

But what got him started taking the photos? Three years ago, Stanton got laid off from as a trader in Chicago and moved to New York to pursue his weekend hobby full-time. Since then, he has built up a following of almost 2 million people on Facebook alone. Even with hundreds of thousands of likes within the first few seconds of posting his photos, Stanton had trouble getting his book published. Publishers said, [“Photography books don’t sell.”](http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/64068501554/dead-tired-as-im-writing-this-all-the-adrenaline) But Stanton knew his would. He knew people saw what he saw in these strangers. Of his two offers, he published with St. Martin’s Press, a Macmillan imprint, and [*Humans of New York](http://www.humansofnewyork.com/book) *immediately topped the NYT Best Sellers List when it was released last month.
> “Photography books typically don’t put up big numbers. And [Humans of New York ](http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/64068501554/dead-tired-as-im-writing-this-all-the-adrenaline)does ‘sound’ like a regional book. But what they didn’t know was this— an amazing, international community of people had gathered around this blog. And week after week, you guys put up pre-order numbers that were absolutely jaw dropping.”

What started as just taking photos of interesting people has turned into a force of universal truth. Bringing life into the eyes of strangers behind a screen.

## **Matthew Manos — ***founder of [Very Nice](http://verynice.co/)*

*Proving that design is more than fonts and Pantone swatches. And then proving that design can change the world.*

Several years ago, Matthew Manos found that nonprofits were spending billions of dollars on services and he set out find a way to change that. After interning at different firms, Manos realized that many of them weren’t living up to his ideologies. So, he created his own. In college, the idea started out as a 100% pro bono design firm. That didn’t work out, but five years after founding VeryNice, he’s operating on a 50/50 model. Half of their work is done for free with help from volunteers and an extremely dedicated team that works with twice as many clients to balance out the costs. And their design goes way beyond pretty things. In his [TEDx Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigiAXs9d2w), Manos addressed a big stereotype people have for designers: “Business makes money and that designers help sell things.”
> “But what if systems weren’t all such a static thing. What if they actually were a dynamic thing. What if they were a designable thing?…This shift in mindset I would argue… can transform the practice of entrepreneurship into a medium of design.”

Watch any of Manos’s [lectures](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=matthew+manos&sm=3) and you’ll see VeryNice comes from a place of treating design as tool for impact. They design ideas and their knack for innovation is guided by the belief that philanthropy starts at the beginning of a business—it’s not an afterthought.

## **Tavi Gevinson —*** founder/ Editor-in-Chief of [Rookie Mag](http://rookiemag.com/)*

*Proving teenage girls are made of more than hormones and emoticons.*

I wasn’t a teenager that long ago, but when I was Teen Vogue was the closest I could come to reading about other teenage girls like me, and Teen Vogue had nothing to do with girls like me. It was a lifestyle they wanted to sell to me—a two-dimensional one at that. Tavi Gevinson felt this void too, and she did something about it. After the success of her pre-teen fashion blog, [StyleRookie](http://www.thestylerookie.com/), she created Rookie. An online magazine for and by teenage girls. Brilliant, funny, strong, depressed, happy, quirky, dark teenage girls. The magazine features sections like “Dear Diary,” “Live Through This,” and [“Ask a Grown Man.”](http://rookiemag.com/tag/ask-a-grown-man/) There are playlists, lovely illustrations and essays about girls, about boys, about love, sex and what to wear.

Before even graduating high school, Tavi has started a stellar and respected career by making something she’d want to read and putting together a team she’d want to be a part of. She never seems like she’s trying to grow up too fast or linger in the age of teeny bop. She is fearlessly embracing what comes natural to her and exploring what doesn’t—traits which are key for any entrepreneur.

Her pre-teen ambition has left her in a seemingly idyllic position approaching her fist year of college, and could be a running theme for high school graduates in future generations.
> “[I feel lucky](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/11/tavi-gevinson-interview-rookie-magazine-road-trip-nicole-holofcener-acting) in that I don’t really have to go to college to study something job-specific. I just want to go to learn about what is interesting to me and learn about the classes that you don’t really get to take in high school because you have to take the basics.”

## **Amy Kaherl — [***Detroit Soup](http://detroitsoup.com/) facilitator/director/ coordinator*

*Proving young folks still know how to get things done offline.*

The sharing economy has brought about more than the ability to rent strangers’ apartments. It’s given us a platform to share and fund [ideas](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hunterleesoik/shadow-community-of-dreamers) that may have never been heard otherwise. Most of these crowd-funding platforms are on the internet, but Amy Kaherl is the director of one that’s face-to-face. Three-year old Detroit Soup is a simple idea: dinner attendees donate $5 at the door, then they hear four big ideas from their peers and neighbors about education, startups, art, agriculture—anything affecting the community. After the presentations and plenty of soup, everyone votes on which idea they’d like to fund and the winner gets the earnings from that night.

A city like Detroit is not without new ideas, but growing beyond the perception of being the [bankrupt Motor City](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2148171,00.html) is still tricky. Kaherl is one of the people making a positive impact in rough times, and she’s doing it on a neighborhood scale.
> “We want to make sure that neighbors are helping neighbors with decision making and supporting the community. [My goal](http://scratchblog.viacom.com/2013/05/15/millennial-entrepreneur-amy-kaherl/) is to have at least 10 dinners happening in our neighborhoods. Once they grow I just hope we can sustain the momentum and become a staple in these communities.”

On the streets of cities like New York, Los Angeles and Austin you’ll find plenty of people who are working on their big ideas and they’re going to Kickstarter and Indiegogo to fund it. But there’s a different kind of pride and vulnerability that comes with getting up on a stage in front of the people who will be directly affected by your idea and just laying it all out. Through Detroit Soup, Kaherl is facilitating the kind of offline impact that can make lasting change.

Most millennials have never known the full-time-job-in-our-field-with-benefits-right-out-of-college life we planned for growing up, because things change. Less jobs and less money with more technology has left us a whole new equation to solve. We’re trying to carve out space for ourselves where there wasn’t space before and re-imagine expectations for not just us but the people around us. Call it grandiose or naive but, before you do, look at these young people and the thousands of others who are making it work and laying groundwork for big change.

# The Frame of Reference–How Your Outlook Affects Your Willpower

## 

350 miles of pain and suffering.

That’s what [Joe De Sena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_De_Sena) and his three teammates were looking at as they approached the starting line of the 2001 [International Raid Ukatak](http://www.xtri.com/features/detail/284-itemId.511707525.html). The Raid Ukatak is an adventure race held in [Quebec, Canada,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec) in the middle of the winter.

Despite the challenge, Joe’s team was ready and willing to endure torture.

**This was Joe’s first real test of his willpower.** He was not much of an athlete, especially compared to his teammates who all had decades of experience, so in order to make it through the race, he would have to rely on his mental strength much more than his physical strength.

The race began with him and his team iceboating down the [Saint Lawrence River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec). It was so cold that they may as well have been in the Arctic. Floating ice would constantly knock into their boat, sending the team overboard and into the freezing river.

Without any dry clothes to change into, they had to simply endure the pain of being wet and frozen. **And this was just the beginning of the six-day race!**

After the Saint Lawrence, they hiked for two days in snow that was knee-deep. This was so tiring that Joe needed to ignore every human impulse to stop and rest. He had to silence the shouting of his [primitive brain](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/short-term-and-long-term-motivation) in order to keep putting one foot in front of the other.

Then he started to literally lose his mind.

He saw members of his family, he saw fast food restaurants, and he smelled the delicious aroma of a cheeseburger — despite the fact that the nearest McDonalds was hundreds of miles away. **He was half mad, and he wasn’t even at the halfway point!**

So how did he and his team not only persevere through the next 150-plus miles of the race, but*also become one of the first teams to cross the finish line? *[[1](http://amzn.to/1r1D0CL)]

## CHANGING HIS FRAME OF REFERENCE

To make it through the rest of the race, Joe thought about an explorer named [Ernest Shackleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton).

In 1912, Shackleton led [an expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_Expedition) of fifty-six men to be the first to cross Antarctica. From the very beginning, the expedition was doomed. Shackleton’s ship crashed into ice hundreds of miles from the shores of Antarctica.

He and his crew spent over a year trying to get home, traveling over 1,000 miles in temperatures much colder than those in Canada, in a place where nobody could help them. **Compared to that situation, Joe’s journey to the end of the race didn’t seem so bad.**

*If Shackleton was able to make it,* Joe thought, *there’s no reason why we can’t.*

When Joe thought of Shackleton, he changed his frame of reference. And doing so vastly increased his willpower to keep going.

## HOW A FRAME OF REFERENCE IMPACTS YOUR WILLPOWER

My guess is you’re probably not going to be freezing cold in the Canadian winter anytime soon, so how can you use the frame of reference in your life?

Imagine you come face-to-face with the opportunity to make an impulse $100 purchase.

**Immediately, your whole body feels like it’s in panic mode.** The temptation to buy seems like it’s too much to bear. Part of you is telling yourself that you deserve it, another part is reminding you of your plan to stick to your budget this month.

Almost everyone in this situation gives into the temptation. And almost all those people regret it when they get their credit card bill.

However, one study found that participants that faced this dilemma were much more likely to avoid the impulse buy if they asked themselves a simple question.

*”Would I accept one hundred dollars to NOT buy this?”*

This seems obvious. Shouldn’t everyone realize that saving the $100 is the exact same thing as getting $100 dollars to not buy something?

**The answer is no. **Because if you believe you are saving $100 you will still consider the impulse purchase as a reward. However, if you shift your frame of reference to getting $100 dollars as a “gift” for not buying that thing, now the $100 is the reward.

So your impulsive, emotional, primitive brain that motivates you to seek short-term rewards now wants you to get that $100 for not making the purchase just as badly as your long-term, rational, modern brain wants to you to save it. [[3](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461258896)]

## WAYS TO SHIFT YOUR FRAME OF REFERENCE

This experiment shows how powerful a simple change in your frame of reference can be. But there are obviously more ways to capture its power than simply by saving money.

Here are some other proven ways to change your frame of reference and increase your willpower:

## 1. SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY, NOT AN OBLIGATION

Several years ago, I really struggled with[ developing an exercise habit.](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/create-exercising-habit) I would exercise every single day for a week, then crash–leading me to skip a day, then another, then another…

I would then follow this with several weeks of doing nothing, before repeating the cycle by going to gym every single day again.

I was able to finally break this cycle when I signed up for a [Spartan Race](http://www.spartan.com/). I’m extremely competitive. So once I signed up, I wanted to do as well as I could in the race.

**Instantly, my frame of reference for workouts completely changed.** Rather than the trip to the gym being an obligation that I “had to” do, it became an opportunity to get faster and stronger for the upcoming race.

Whatever your goal, you probably set a plan that you “have to” follow. You see working towards it as an obligation and are therefore more tempted to [procrastinate](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/why-we-procrastinate) it as I did.

However if you can shift your frame of reference to see working toward your goal as an opportunity to learn more, become healthier, and become the person you really want to be, it will require much less willpower to make progress. [[4](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/663212?uid=2&uid=4&sid=21105180733563)]

## 2. IDENTIFY WITH YOUR FUTURE SELF

When facing a challenge to your willpower, it is very easy to lose sight of the big picture.

Your short-term, impulsive, primitive brain can make it feel like saying “no” to a dessert or impulse purchase will be the end of the world. While also convincing you that saying “yes” to relaxation or[staying in your comfort zone](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/learning-zone) will be the key to happiness.

**By doing this, it is making it harder for you to see that your future self will feel the consequences of your decisions today (good or bad). **That’s why it is so easy to procrastinate and feel like you can always make up for it tomorrow.

However, if you can shift your frame of reference to your future self, it will help you immensely in overcoming your current willpower challenge.

Sticking with my gym example, whenever I want to skip the gym in the morning, I think to myself:

*“At 8 AM I’m going to be sitting at my computer, rested, relaxed and starting my work day. At that time, I can either be proud of myself for choosing to go to the gym right now, or regretting the fact that I didn’t.”*

That simple shift in my frame of reference allows me to [identify with my future self](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/10-10-10-rule) and see the benefits of exercising more clearly. This gives me that extra edge I need to make the right decision and lace up my running shoes.

## 3. SEE YOUR CHALLENGE THROUGH ANOTHER’S EYES

It is very easy to constantly look inward when it comes to willpower. This could be by trying to justify taking the easy way out, or motivating yourself to rise to the challenge. This is why using another’s perspective on your challenge can help you make the right decision.

**There are 2 ways you can do this effectively:**

The first, is using the same technique as Joe DeSena by thinking about [how a hero](https://book.willpowered.co/the-will-of-heroes) or inspiration to you overcame a similar challenge.

Not only does this give you extra inspiration and motivation, but thinking about their story reminds you that the task you’re working towards is attainable. That might just be enough to give you the[rush of willpower and belief](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/schwarzenegger-willpower-vision) you need.

The second way, is to think about what advice your friends, family, or your mentor would give you to help you achieve a goal. Shifting your frame of reference to their perspective can help give you more clarity and accountability on your challenge.

For example, an alcoholic will be much more likely to quit drinking if he thinks about how his drinking impacts his family.

Also, someone who tried and failed at something will be much more likely pull himself together and try again if he thinks about the advice his best friend would give him–rather than [beating himself up](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/science-behind-guilt) and feeling hopeless.

The biggest reason why these two methods work, is because **they allow you to see your challenge for what it is, **rather than what your primitive brain is building it up to be. [[5](http://amzn.to/1WfhR3m)]

## CONCLUSION

How you view a situation matters. If you see working towards your goal as an opportunity rather than an obligation, you’re going to be much more likely to achieve it.

If you see your future self as a real person that will have to deal with the consequences of your actions right now–good or bad–you’re going to be much more likely to ensure they’re good.

And if you can see your challenge through the eyes of one of your heroes, family members, or friends, you will be much more likely to see your challenge for what it is–not what your short-term, emotional, primitive brain is building it up to be.

Whatever your next willpower challenge is, ensure you’re approaching it with the right frame of reference.

# Why This Isn’t About My Book

## Why This Isn’t About My Book

***A Cautionary Tale***

Don’t be like me!

I *know *that reaching a big goal is a matter of taking small, persistent actions towards it. But I have a tough time doing that. I have trouble moving from the vision to the actual work. (It blew my mind when I realized that that’s the ultimate skill of a successful executive: the ability to execute.)

Recently, I got a wake-up call that showed me just what that sloppiness of habit costs me.

Last month I attended a conference where I ran into some colleagues, a husband and wife team, for the first time since we’d last had dinner in Ghana two years ago. Back then, we’d talked about life after Peace Corps, and I told them how I hoped to write a book about the experience. They both kept journals themselves, and became just as enthusiastic about the project as I was…with one difference.

They actually wrote a book. They showed it to me at that conference and even told me how that conversation had inspired them to write it! Now you can buy their wonderful memoir, [**Three Hundred Cups of Tea and The Toughest Job](http://www.amazon.com/Three-Hundred-Cups-Toughest-Rollercoaster/dp/1508638462)**, on Amazon.com.

![Asifa and David with their finished book.](1*BLfpB5vGtuMC2UQ8txKotw.jpeg)*Asifa and David with their finished book.*

Meanwhile I’ve got a partially finished manuscript and I cringe every time I think about how I’ve neglected it.

The difference is simply this: they did the work.

[Derrick Jensen spoke about this in our interview with him last October](http://blog.coach.me/derrick-jensen-interview/):
> “I’m known for being very prolific. I’ve written more than 20 books. But the truth is that I haven’t written more than 20 books. Instead I’ve written a page or two every day, and it has added up to more than 20 books.”

Whether you’re writing a book, finishing a thesis, building a web site, or working on a business plan, there’s one thing you have to do: you have to do the work and do it consistently. There’s all sorts of complex research about why doing that can be so tough.

Fortunately, I’m pretty sure that the solution is pretty easy: setting aside time using the Pomodoro Technique and accountability coaching to help me stick with it.

The [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) was named for the [cute tomato-shaped kitchen timer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O22MSY8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00O22MSY8&linkCode=as2&tag=terrieme-20&linkId=AAUZN24OIMZRCHS2) that [Francesco Cirillo](http://francescocirillo.com/) used when he developed this method for finishing his own academic work; pomodoro is Italian for “tomato”. Basically, you set aside 25-minute blocks of focused work on a project, with short timed breaks to keep you fresh. [There’s an entire book devoted to the practice.](http://pomodorotechnique.com/book/)

Accountability is the other part of the solution. I can know everything there is to know about the Pomodoro technique, but *it doesn’t work unless I use it*. It sounds simple but in practice this is a big hurdle for me. So getting accountability — forcing myself to check-in with someone one whether I’ve done this is key. When I’m faced with uncertainty or doubt in myself, I need to commit to another human being that I’m actually going to do something; it’s just my nature.

I’ve got a book to write. It’s time I help myself do it.

# Running Injuries&#58; Risks, Prevention, Fixes

## 

**1. Runner’s Knee**

**What is it?** Patellofemoral pain syndrome is the irritation of the cartilage on the underside of the patella (kneecap). Runner’s knee typically flares up during or after long runs, after extended periods of sitting, or while descending hills and stairs.

**How do you get it?** Risk factors include overpronation (excessive inward foot rolling) and weak quads, hips, or glutes.

**What to do?** You can run through it but I recommend running every other day and only as far as you can go without pain. Some runners find that uphill running is less painful and has the added value of working your glutes. Bicycling may speed your recovery by strengthening the quads. Elliptical training and swimming are other knee-friendly activities. Strengthening weak hip and glute muscles is key. You can also shorten your stride length and land with your knee slightly bent which will take 30% of the load off the joint.

**2. Achilles Tendinitis**

**What is it?** The Achilles tendon connects the two major calf muscles to the back of the heel. Under too much stress, the tendon tightens and becomes irritated (tendinitis).

**How do you get it?** Runners who dramatically increase training (especially hills and speedwork) and have tight, weak calves are vulnerable.

**What to do?** This is a an injury you SHOULD NOT run through. If you catch a minor strain early, a few days off will be ample healing time. If you keep running as usual, you could develop a serious case that may take six months to go away. Treat it with ice during the acute phase of the injury. Then strengthen the calves with eccentric heel drops: Stand with the balls of your feet on a step. Rise up on both feet. Once up, take your stronger foot off the step. Lower down on your injured foot, dropping your heel below the step. Pool-running, swimming and elliptical can be used as cross-training as long as they are not painful.

**3. Hamstring Issues**

**What is it?** The hamstring muscles run down the back of your thighs bend your knees, extend your legs, drive you up hills, and power sprints.

**How do you get it?** When your hamstrings are too tight or weak to perform well they can get strained or even tear. Hamstring issues usually arise because they are weak from being too long or too short. If you are too flexible then stretched-out muscles are more vulnerable to damage. However, if you are a person who can barely touch their toes or who sit for long periods of time, you are also at risk. Tight, short muscles are under greater tension. Another factor is muscle imbalance: Many runners’ quadriceps overpower their hamstrings, which sets them up for injury.

**What to do?** If the pain comes on suddenly and strong and the area bruises, you may have a pull or a strain and you’ll need extended rest. If it’s a less severe, chronic overuse injury, you can usually run, but need to be careful. Bicycling, pool running, and swimming are good alternative activities. Strengthen your hamstrings with one-legged hamstring curls and one-legged deadlifts. Use a foam roller to alleviate tightness before and after a run.

**4. Plantar Fasciitis**

**What is it?** With each step, our feet absorb a force several times our body weight. Plantar fasciitis, small tears or inflammation of the tendons and ligaments that run from your heel to your toes, is usually the top foot complaint among runners. The pain, which typically feels like a dull ache or bruise along your arch or on the bottom of your heel, is usually worse first thing in the morning.

**How do you get it?** Runners with very high or very low arches are vulnerable and extreme pronation (foot rolls inward excessively) or supination (foot rolls outward excessively) and increasing your mileage too quickly can cause PF.

**What to do about it?** Plantar fasciitis is one of the most notoriously nagging injuries, and running through it, while possible, can delay healing. Recovery time can range from three months to a year, but six months is fairly typical. Pool running and swimming keep pressure off your feet. Cycling or using an elliptical can help you maintain fitness, but only if you can do those activities without pain. Roll your foot over a frozen water bottle for five minutes at a time, five times a day. Stretch your calves and use a foam roller on them to loosen since calf tightness can be a factor. Doing core work (planks, back extensions) is essential because it reduces stress on the spine and stops pain transference to the foot.

**5. Shinsplints**

What is it? “Shinsplints” refers to medial tibial stress syndrome, an achy pain that results when small tears occur in the muscles around your tibia (shin bone).

**How do you get it?** Shinsplints are common among new runners and those returning after an extended layoff. Basically you do too much too soon. Shinsplints strike runners wearing the wrong shoe or a pair with too many miles, and those with high arches or flat feet.

**What to do about it?** When the first twinges of pain strike, back off your running to a comfortable level for a few days to a week, then slowly up your mileage using the 10 percent rule (no more than 10 percent increase per week). Rest, ice, and ibuprofen can ease the pain. Taping the shin with Kinesio Tex tape can relieve pain and speed healing.

**6. Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS)**

**What is it?** The iliotibial (IT) band lies along the outside of the thigh from the hip to the knee. When you run, your knee flexes and extends, which causes the IT band to rub on the side of the femur.

**How do you get it?** The irritation caused by the rubbing on the side of the femur happens if you take up your mileage too quickly, especially if you’re doing a lot of track work or downhill running. Runners who develop ITBS may overpronate, have a leg-length discrepancy, or suffer from weak hip abductor and gluteal muscles.

**What to do about it?** ITBS is known as a stubborn, nagging injury. Take a rest day or two and back off your mileage for a week, and you could avoid a full-blown flare-up.** **Strengthen the hip abductors with lateral side steps, side leg lifts, clams, and one-legged squats. Use a foam roller before and after you run on the outside of your thigh. Swim, pool-running and using the elliptical trainer can be used as cross-training.

# Why Productive People Turn Off Phone Notifications

## Why Productive People Turn Off Phone Notifications

### Five Key Strategies

Screw notifications.

Who’s the boss? You or your phone?

The whole concept of notifications is, for the most part, completely backward.

You bought your phone as an expensive, advanced computing tool. And instead of you wielding that tool according to your best interests, the tool has ended up wielding you.

My [coaching group](https://www.coach.me/plans/467818-coach-me-vip-program) did a month of work on single-tasking and taking control of notifications was the simple exercise that everyone considered the biggest win.

Below are the big realizations and strategies that you could use right now to manage notifications on your phone.

## #1. Multi-tasking is for idiots

I don’t mean that as a pejorative. Rather, literally, multi-tasking interrupts learning.

Here’s a lay explanation of something important going on in your brain.

When you repeatedly exercise a neural pathway in your brain, [the neural fibers in that pathway grow additional protective myelin](http://coach.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b63a335429513c468aec8add7&id=58306c34f1&e=b873efed04). That’s learning.
 
The problem is that it takes sustained focus to trigger the myelin growth. Multi-tasking interrupts the trigger for myelin growth before it gets started.

So, you think multi-tasking is a virtue because you’re working so hard, but, the reality is that you’re retarding your intelligence. While everyone else works and gets smarter, you stay put, your intelligence frozen in time.

Notifications are alarms that trigger multi-tasking. You should hate them as much as you hate your office fire alarm (ours seemed to get tested monthly).

Getting rid of them takes about five minutes and permanently eradicates an entire category of multi-tasking.

## #2. The Easy Change: No Badging

![](1*Xnc2etlDRB_RVyXC9vHILA.jpeg)

On iPhone at least, there’s a huge propensity to put red dots with numbers on top of every app.

These are called badges and what they say to you is “Urgent: opening this app is WAY more important than whatever else you are doing.”

But the good news is that you never need this feature.

If the app matters, you’re going to open that app on your own time.

Go through your apps and turn off all badging for every single one.

## #3. Text messaging and inboxes

Because I’m older than 30, I get very few text messages, and they often are urgent. So I leave my text messaging notifications on.

However, if you send hundreds of text messages per day, consider the opposite approach. If this is you, then you use your text messaging the way I use my email inbox.

In that case, schedule time when your #1 focus is text messaging. You can even schedule that multiple times per day. You just have to commit to only processing your text messages during that time.

The only thing you can’t do is have text messages interrupting your work all day. This is the sure-fire way never to get smarter and never to meet your real potential.

Special case: Slack. I don’t have any Slack notifications on my phone. Slack is supposed to be asynchronous, so use it that way.

## #4. On-Demand Services, i.e. Uber, Postmates

These are the only apps to leave uncontrolled notifications on for. Occasionally they take advantage by trying to sell you something.

But for the most part, you do want to know when your Uber arrived or when food is at your front door.

## #5. Reminders, i.e. Calendar, Coach.me

Reminders are the one category of app that uses notifications the way they are intended.

You set a reminder and get reminded as a service to aid your memory. That’s fantastic.

So leave notifications on for your calendar or any other app where you control the timing and purpose of the notification.

# 6 Drawings On How To Be A Stoic

## 
> # “You have power over your mind — not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” — Marcus Aurelius

![](1*YIFgCNDk31_8mMu0vCYWIQ.png)
> # “Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We’ve been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.” — Seneca

![](1*udwa-EI0lV_4S9S0goQrdg.png)
> # “What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, **who understands that he is dying daily**? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed, Whatever years be behind us are in death’s hands.” — Seneca

![](1*gDvIodqdpThTln2o12eXcA.png)
> # “When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive — to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love” — Marcus Aurelius

> # *“The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.” *— Seneca

![](1*-nq6cAHYXV0BUOMxmj4egw.png)
> # *“No one is to be found who is willing to distribute his money, yet among how many does each one of us distribute his life!… You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last.”*— Seneca

# Automate to Keep Your Willpower Bucket Full

## 

*You enter your kitchen after a long day and go straight to the refrigerator for the most convenient, fastest, processed thing you can get to shove in your mouth. There is no way you have the energy to even THINK about what to eat.*

*You stand at the ice cream/cupcake/bakery counter for several minutes before deciding on the flavor because the choice overload is too much. Then you get the same kind you always do in defeat.*

*You’re asked to sign a contract that you are a little nervous about at 4:30pm on a Friday. You default to the status quo and just decide to decline the contract.*

Every day we make thousands of decisions. Researchers at Cornell found that we make an average of 227 decisions about food alone.

As covered in my video on your [Willpower Bucket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDTNn5MAvIU&feature=youtu.be), willpower and discipline are not finite. Think about it like this…you start the morning with a full bucket of Willpower Monkeys. Every decision you make causes a monkey to jump out of the bucket. At the end of the day, you have a lot fewer monkeys. These aren’t the smartest ones in the bunch either. These are the tired or lazy monkeys who didn’t want to expend energy earlier. These are not the monkeys you want making decisions for you.

Some of the questions I have to decide on every day, within an hour of waking up:

***What do I wear to exercise?***

***Do I start with strength training or cardio?***

***Do I add vegetables to my grits or eat them like Kevin makes them?***

***Do I shower before or after breakfast?***

***What color of lipstick do I put on?***

When we are tired, low on energy or have had most of our monkeys jump out of our bucket, we tend to procrastinate, defer to the status quo, make a fear-based decision or take fewer risks.

How do you get around this? Keep as many monkeys in your bucket by planning as much as you can in advance and reducing your choices. In other words, automate your decisions.

If my husband is making breakfast, it is the same one, with no changes, every single morning. Sometimes I’ll have it with him + add veggies. He has a few monkeys still left in his bucket for later. Maybe they’ll choose a healthier lunch and dinner because there are more of them to say ‘Hey, let’s eat the better choice!’

**Some ways I automate my decisions:**

1. On Sundays, I plan my workouts for the week and have a general idea if I am doing them in the morning or afternoon. The only thing that changes this is if my heart rate variability score is low on my Sweetbeat App or if the weather makes me have to flip around days.

1. On Sundays and Wednesdays, I spend an hour washing, chopping, prepping and cooking for the week. This way I don’t have to make too many dinner decisions. I just throw together what’s already cooked or ready.

1. On Sundays, I pick out all my outfits for the week on days I am working outside the home. Each outfit gets hung on one hanger and includes my jewelry. Weather or mood may change my mind on a specific outfit, but it’s never a waste of time because that entire outfit is ready to go when I want to wear it. This is HUGE for me because I will stand in front of my closet for several minutes deciding what to wear if I don’t do this. I don’t even have a lot of clothes and it is still a time waster.

1. I’m not a condiment hoarder and have an entire fridge door filled with different sauces. I have a few and tend to eat pretty simply.

This may not seem like a big deal, but science tells us that it can help. Simplify what you can and make decisions in advance if possible. Make your important decisions earlier in the day or after you’ve done something that renews your energy, like exercising or eating a healthy meal.

***What is one simple thing that you aren’t automating in your life that you can start doing today?***

# Embrace Discomfort

## Because Comfort is for Lazy Asses and Kittens

So you’ve hopped aboard this train because you want to [design your life](https://medium.com/@denniscorsi/what-a-fallen-branch-taught-me-about-living-7f20d6fd4cdc). You want to fly this shit show into space instead of letting it drive you down to the ground. Let’s get one thing straight. If you expected to be in the first class train car with the cushy seats, unlimited gin & tonics, and perfectly calibrated air conditioning, you might as well leave now. Those people in first class are watching the world through a frosted window, sitting on their lazy asses, in a drugged-up haze. The rest of us are here for adventure, for excitement, and for living! Let me tell you folks,
> # ***Comfort is overrated!***

Step on into my time machine and let’s take a trip back to caveman times … … … Okay we made it. We’re in the past.

Meet Ugg. He’s a caveman.

![Marvel in my amazing drawing skills. Yes, I drew this. No, it’s not for sale. You couldn’t afford it anyway.](1*owZeWIkOjXX-A5D5RwVhBQ.jpeg)*Marvel in my amazing drawing skills. Yes, I drew this. No, it’s not for sale. You couldn’t afford it anyway.*

Ugg is your great great great great … (x 1,000) … great grandfather. See the resemblance? Ugg spends most of his day sitting on a pointy rock. It’s uncomfortable for him. *(He’s not into sitting on pointy objects, he’s not that kinda guy. But if that’s your thing, you do you.)* While sitting on this pointy rock he is alert, focused, and engaged with the world around him. He HAS to be. There is a giant terrifying creature living next door that wants to eat him and his family (no, it’s not his mother-in-law, it’s a hungry saber-tooth tiger). Ugg is living his life, on the edge of his seat, feeling the present moment. The remaining bit of Ugg’s day is when he is safely in his cave and he gets to relax by the fire. (His wife Ugga discovered fire yesterday. They are both very proud.) During these moments of comfort, chemicals are released in Ugg’s body allowing him to relax and look back on a day well-spent not getting eaten. These chemicals soften his focus, his mind turns inward, and his hunky caveman body recharges for the next day.

I know what you’re thinking. Dennis is on the special juice again and is telling crazy, random stories. So I’ll get to the point. As humans, we were never meant to be constantly comfortable. Comfort was for rejuvenation. Discomfort was for living life at the height of our senses, for survival. Comfort puts us into a foggy haze of noncommittal behavior. **Comfort is what causes people to blink their eyes and all of a sudden realize that 30 years have passed them by unnoticed.** Comfort is what those rich people in first class have while they are boozed-up on unlimited gin, missing all of the amazing sights and adventures passing them by. When they arrive at the destination, they slump off the train, wondering why they paid so much money to get here in the first place. Those who were in economy class, feeling uncomfortable most of the time, hopping on and off, having adventures at each stop, arrive to the destination feeling full of life and having had many amazing experiences along the way, wondering how they got the opportunity to take this incredible journey for so little money.

So here’s the thing. Most people take being uncomfortable as a sign that something is wrong. We need to change our thinking. Being uncomfortable should be a sign that you are stretching and growing. That you are taking advantage of the life you were gifted.
> “Western culture has things a little backwards right now. We think that if we had every comfort available to us, we’d be happy. **We equate comfort with happiness. And now we’re so comfortable we’re miserable.** There’s no struggle in our lives. No sense of adventure. We get in a car, we get in an elevator, it all comes easy. What I’ve found is that I’m never more alive than when I’m pushing and I’m in pain, and I’m struggling for high achievement, and in that struggle I think there’s a magic.” ~Dean Karnazes

There are no limits. Only edges. Yeah it feels uncomfortable at the edges. But that’s also when we grow and learn to push those edges further. It’s at the edges where ordinary people become extraordinary. It’s up to you: live on the edge, or wither away in the middle.

![My morning coffee and a daily reminder to embrace discomfort.](1*eVlSgBl1Yr4NjcmYgvX8DQ.jpeg)*My morning coffee and a daily reminder to embrace discomfort.*

## Action

A great article, [“How to stop giving a F@$% what people think”](https://medium.com/life-hacking-2/how-to-stop-giving-a-f-what-people-think-46bf86584c95), introduced me to the idea of having a* Growth List*. The author writes, “a Growth List is comprised of all the things in life that makes you uncomfortable. These are fears, insecurities — anything that gives you the jitters.”

Basically, write down all the things that make you uncomfortable. And then, well…you do them. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s just start by making the list. That is your action for the week. Pull out a pen and paper, your smart phone, stone tablet (let’s not exclude our caveman friends), or whatever it is you write on, and start a list. Have this list handy throughout the week and whenever you think of something to add, write it down.

Here are a few items from my own growth list:

* Travel alone to a country where I don’t know the language and spend a week there. Don’t plan, just buy a one-way ticket and go.

* Ask a stranger out on a date (in person, not through a dating app).

* Lie down in the middle of a sidewalk for 10 seconds (there must be other people around that I don’t know).

* Wear a tiny bathing suit to the beach.

* Fly an airplane.

* Run a marathon.

* Spend a week without any internet or cellular connection.

I started this list a while ago, and one of the items on it was “start a blog”. Check it out, I’ve already crossed that one off! Doing something on your growth list is rewarding and will help you to push your edges and enrich your life.

So get writing (or chiseling) and comment with some items from you own growth list!

# 8 Most Popular Goals For People Who Hire Coaches

## 8 Most Popular Goals For People Who Hire Coaches

Coach.me invented and still owns a very specific corner of the coaching market: habits.

You might hire a life coach if you feel like your life could be better generally. But you’d hire a Coach.me “Wake up early” coach if you feel like your life would be better specifically if you slept better. People who hire our coaches tend to have a pretty good sense of what the fix is — they just want help getting their faster.

So, in our habit coaching niche, I was curious what habits people were most likely to work on.

Then, I was curious to find out why people wanted a coach for that habit. The question of why is much more subjective. Thankfully, we have testimonials. I’ll try to summarize those Zagat style.

Below are the eight most popular. Popularity as a percentage of all coaching hires is in parentheses.

## #8. Inbox Zero (2.3%)

This involves developing a system for processing your email efficiently with the goal of having a completely empty inbox at the end of each day.

### Why people hired a coach.
> At my wits end… had tried virtually everything… feeling out of control… constant reaction mode.

### Benefits
> Within just one week… seeing the light at the end of this email tunnel… the progress I’ve made with my business and overall productivity… reduced my time from around 2.5–3 hours down to less than 1 hour… invest my energy or more important tasks/projects… reduced the amount of time I spend in reaction mode… within 21 days I was down to inbox zero and stayed there… helped me clean out my 60,000 email inbox

Highly rated coach: [Coach Marshall Hughes](https://www.coach.me/Marshall/882).

## #7. Slow-Carb Diet™ from The 4-Hour Body (2.6%)

### Why people hired a coach
> Stop procrastinating… start taking action… keep on track… more and more unmotivated by the day

### Benefits
> Able to prioritise… work far more efficiently… instilled good working habits… holding me accountable… focus… foresight to plan for upcoming problems and distractions… kind, understanding, helpful and persistent

Highly rated coach: [Kristina Jeppsson](https://www.coach.me/kristinajeppsson/1187)

> helped me get my goals crystal clear… best decision I’ve ever made… practical tools to help you grow… checking in to remind you of your chosen path… “small wins” by identifying my strengths… lasting impact on my community, my team, and myself.

Highly rated coach: [Jeff Fajans](https://www.coach.me/jefffajans/906)

Mostly I meant this post to be an insight into how people think and work — I try not to make the Better Humans collection a sales pitch.

However, these coaches are obviously doing something right. And the goals they’re coaching are extremely powerful.

The major hurdle to hiring any of the coaches above is answering the question of whether you will have chemistry with them.

# The Definitive Guide to Understanding Proactivity and Becoming a Proactive Entrepreneur

## 

Here we go again: *Another *article on proactivity, right? Hold on: **This one’s different** and it may just be the *last *you need to read.

But I get it: I’m not the first person to stress the importance of being proactive.

In fact, it’s become *so *common it’s almost a *buzzword *among founders and entrepreneurs; something people say to sound impressive or “in touch,” but not something they necessarily act upon or even understand.

Sure, they’re happy to tout its importance … But can they tell you what proactivity *means*? Can they actually tell you how to *be *proactive? In my experience, no.

***And that’s a huge problem.***

By turning proactivity into a buzzword, we’ve cheapened it. It’s become like white noise; something you hear but tune out.

It’s time to add clarity and turn up the volume, because here’s the truth: **Proactivity is a vital part of creating massive success, and it’s the only way to reach your full potential.**

So let’s get to the heart of it: What *is *proactivity, and how can you become a more proactive person?

## What is Proactivity, Anyway?

Let’s start off simple: What does it *mean *to be proactive? According to Merriam-Webster, it means, “acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or changes.”

![](0*6k_wQU0bhZKFiZ5K.jpg)

Put differently, **being proactive means completing carefully-planned actions to achieve the goals that move the needle most for your business.** It means focusing on what’s *important*, not just what’s *urgent*.

Sounds like a good idea, right? The problem is, our world is becoming increasingly *reactive*, not *proactive*. According to Merriam-Webster, a reactive person is someone who is, “readily responsive to a stimulus.”

![](0*H73dlfXs4XobmheA.jpg)

In other words, a reactive person is at the mercy of urgency and outside influence. Because the feeling of urgency often trumps the feeling of importance, many of us spend our days stuck in an endless loop of:

* New email? Better respond right away.

* Meeting request? Can’t say no to that.

* Slack notification? Better respond before it’s lost in the endless stream of messages.

Then, at the end of the day, **we wonder where our time went.**

What makes reactivity so dangerous is that it *feels *productive. After all, you just responded to 53 emails, right? Sure, but there’s a world of difference between “getting stuff done” and actually making *progress*.

Think of it this way: A proactive person is like a stallion and a reactive person like a rocking horse. Both are *moving*, but only one is moving *forward*. Who do you think [wins the race](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/stallions-vs-rocking-horses-mastering-proactive-productivity/)?

You guessed it: **Proactivity *always *outperforms reactivity. **You’ll see why soon, but first let’s take a practical look at proactive tasks.

## What Does Proactivity Look Like?

Alright, we know *what *proactivity is. The next question is, what does it *look* like?

After all, *reactive *tasks are pretty obvious; they’re the urgent day-to-day time sinks most people do out of habit. And it’s not that reactive tasks *don’t *need to be done; it’s that they don’t have to be done in the moment, and they don’t necessarily have to be done by *you*.

Proactive tasks, on the other hand, take more thought and involvement. They’re the projects that move the needle most for your business; the great ideas you’ve been putting off until you “have more time.” For example:

* Developing strategic goals to make the upcoming year successful and productive,

* Creating a compelling list of reasons why a specific feature is important for your product in order to move the company in that direction, or

* Writing a blog post to develop thought leadership in your market.

In short: **Proactive tasks are the strategic initiatives that move you dramatically closer to turning your goals into reality.**

## The Most Important Trait of Proactive People

So what does it take to *be* proactive? In a word, *discipline*.

Here’s why self-discipline is so important: The moment you start incorporating proactivity into your life, the world *will *test your resolve. Emergencies will arise, demands will increase, and you’ll be tempted to fall back into unproductive, reactive behaviors.

**To stay proactive in a reactive world, you need unyielding self-discipline**; because you can’t always control your *circumstances*, but you *can *control your response. You can *choose *to remain proactive.

Because in the end, **success isn’t the result *of* circumstance; it’s the result of response *to *circumstance**. And *that’s *the heart of self-discipline.

Here are the three best things you can do to bolster your self-discipline today.

## 1. Create a Compelling Reason to Stay Disciplined

When reactive temptations arise, you’ll need a reason to remain disciplined. You *could *try to white-knuckle it, but you can only do that for so long before you wear out your resolve.

You’re much more likely to stay disciplined if you have a compelling reason to do so; a clear and motivating picture of what you’re working towards. That’s where goals come in.

According to [research by Harvard](https://hilt.harvard.edu/files/hilt/files/settinggoals.pdf) (and that of [many others](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.640.7392&rep=rep1&type=pdf)), “ … individuals with [clear, written goals](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-goal-setting/) are significantly more likely to succeed than those without clearly defined goals.”

Think of it this way: If you wanted to travel somewhere new, what’s the first thing you’d do? Probably find it on a map. Then, once you knew where you were heading, you’d develop a plan to get there. And only once you’d done *that *would you actually start traveling.

In the face of distraction and temptation, goals are a vital tool to stay proactive, disciplined, and on-track to success.

## 2. Eliminate Procrastination

Procrastination creates pressure, pressure creates stress, and [stress severely limits your brain’s creative processing powers](http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/stress-and-anxiety/the-body%27s-response.html).

As we’ve already discussed, creativity is a vital aspect of proactivity; so it’s not a stretch to say that when you procrastinate, you render yourself incapable of being fully proactive.

For the sake of your productivity, here are [five steps to channel self-discipline and beat procrastination](https://hbr.org/2016/07/how-to-beat-procrastination). According to Harvard Business Review:

* Vividly imagine how it’ll feel to complete the task you’re putting off,

* Visualize the consequences of failing to complete that task,

* *Publically* commit to completing it by a clear deadline,

* Identify the first step to get started, and

* [Reward yourself for completing the first step](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/make-motivation-a-habit/).

Once you’ve taken that first step, the momentum and follow-through often take care of themselves.

## 3. Just Say No

At any point, there are near-endless demands on your time. From emails to Zoom calls to meetings, someone always needs a “quick” 15 minutes from you.

But those “quick” requests add up fast, and it doesn’t take much for a month to pass before you realize you’ve been entrenched in reactivity and haven’t made any real progress.

It’s time to take back control of your time, and that starts by saying “No.”

Next time you get a request for your time, ask yourself: “Is this aligned with what I’ve decided to proactively work on this week?” If the answer’s no, [your response should probably be no](https://hbr.org/2015/12/how-to-say-no-to-taking-on-more-work).

Not sure how to turn the other person down? Afraid of hurting their feelings? A study by the Journal of Consumer Research found that simply changing your wording can [change negative associations to the rejection](https://blog.bufferapp.com/a-scientific-guide-to-saying-no-how-to-avoid-temptation-and-distraction), both for you and the person being rejected.

Here’s how it works: Instead of saying “I can’t … ” or “I won’t … ”, which are perceived as negative and personal, say, “I don’t …” which is more general and sets a precedent for future requests.

With this approach, you aren’t rejecting the *person*, you’re rejecting the *event*. For example:

* I don’t respond to emails after 8:00PM,

* I don’t meet outside of the office, or

* I don’t reply to Slack messages over the weekend.

An added bonus: When you make an “I don’t” statement, you set a rule. As people become familiar with that rule, you’ll face fewer similar demands in the future.

## Incorporating Proactivity into Your Life

Alright, you know what proactivity is, you know what it looks like, you know why it’s important, and you know how to protect it with self-discipline.

And I think you’ll agree: When you take all the hype and buzz out, you’re left with a very simple concept: **Being proactive means investing in your future.**

So here’s the question: Are you 100% happy with the present? Have you completed all you set out to do? Is your bucket list empty? Or do you feel there’s still more success to be experienced?

Let me share a secret: There is. No matter how good things are now, there’s always the potential for something even greater. And that future can be yours, *if *you’re willing to invest in it.

# I Walked 10,000 Steps Every Day For A Year

## I Walked 10,000 Steps Every Day For A Year

### These Are The 7 Things I Noticed

*“My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She’s ninety-seven now, and we don’t know where the heck she is.” — Ellen DeGeneres*

*Bzzzzzzt.* There it goes again. The only new tech gadget I bought in the past 3 years. **A fitness tracker.**

What my [Garmin Vívosmart HR](http://amzn.to/2Ejxfv6) tries to tell me with its soft, yet definite vibration is that it’s time to* get off my butt and move*.

![](1*hBZ5a6WBSliiTOS11v1Vjw.jpeg)

This recurring reminder to not sit still for extended periods of time was one of the two primary reasons why I bought it. The other was that it constantly exposes me to the number of steps I’ve already taken that day.

It’s the perfect nagging granny equivalent of fitness:

*“Have you taken your 10,000 steps yet, boy?”*

*“Have you?”*

*“Have you?!”*

For me, the *“alright, alright, I’ll do it”* response kicked in often enough, because as of June 2017, **I’ve averaged 10,000 steps a day for the past year**.

![](1*rSayw0pLRkczuYj_umblXg.png)

That’s a lot of steps. I think it warrants stopping for a second, turning around and looking back. Here are seven lessons I learned from a year of walking.

## 1. Numbers are arbitrary.
> “99 percent of all statistics only tell 49 percent of the story.” — Ron DeLegge II

10,000 steps is the number that’s advertised everywhere, mostly because it’s a nice, round number. *It doesn’t have to be the same for you*. You could shoot for 9,000, 11,000, 7,000 or 15,000.

Maybe your legs are short. Maybe you’re a runner. Maybe you have knee problems.

This habit isn’t about hitting some arbitrary goal. **It’s about learning to love moving more**.

## 2. Walking is where people waste a lot of time.
> “It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much.” — Seneca

Then again, numbers do matter in some cases. Like this one.

As I would have expected of a repetitive task, I automatically walked faster the more I walked. Not so much on my deliberate walks, but when walking was about getting from A to B. I couldn’t help but notice:

*People are slooooooooow.*

They drag their feet, stop and stare randomly and end up in front of closing subway car doors. Sigh.

**There are times when walking needs to be fun and times when it needs to be efficient. **Knowing the difference could save you 15 minutes a day, equals two 40-hour work weeks per year, equals one full year over an 80-year life.

So know the difference.

## 3. Walking changes how you sit.
> “No matter how slow you go, you are still lapping everybody on the couch.” — Anonymous

Here’s a crazy fact:

*You sit more than you sleep.* [On average, people sit for 9.3 hours a day, while sleeping only for 7.7](https://hbr.org/2013/01/sitting-is-the-smoking-of-our-generation/). No wonder they say sitting is the new smoking.

Once my tracker had annoyed me to get up often enough, I started noticing myself. I became more uncomfortable with sitting. That’s a *good* thing.

As a writer, I still sometimes sit 2+ hours in one go. [When you’re in the zone, you’re in the zone](http://fourminutebooks.com/flow-summary/). But I shift around in my seat a lot more. I change position. Move to the edge. Lean back. Sit properly again.

**When sitting is inevitable, pretend you can’t sit still and it’ll take less of a toll.**

## 4. Walking keeps you healthy.
> “Healthy citizens are the greatest asset any country can have.” — Winston S. Churchill

Notice I didn’t say fit. But healthy. I know a proper health regimen includes real exercise, but it’s only when you give that up that you realize how valuable walking really is.

I stopped swimming when I started school because there’s so much work and so far, walking has kept me healthy through even the most stressful periods.

It’s not a lifestyle I’d want to keep forever, but **it’s good to know that while I can’t outrun a runner, I can still outrun a lot of people when I need to.**

Plus, I’m sure the extra vitamin D from all the sun helps.

## 5. Sometimes, it’s better to be average.
> “I don’t think there’s too much normal out there anymore. Though there’s still plenty of average to go around.” — John David Anderson

10,000 steps are about 5 miles, or 8 km, give or take. Walked every day this *is* serious exercise — just not in a time frame that makes you sweat like crazy.

**Your legs will want rest. Let them rest**. It’s also easier to walk more on a day that’s already high in steps than forcing yourself out of bed Sunday morning.

Dancing really helps. I rarely go clubbing, but if I do, I always add an extra 8–10k.

For once, shoot for average and use the buffer you build wholeheartedly to rest. Enjoy those days, they’re precious too.

## 6. Walking = Thinking.
> “All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking.” — Friedrich Nietzsche

A lot of my best ideas of the past year came to me while walking. New revenue streams. Business obstacle breakthroughs. Advice for friends. Advice for myself.

I’ve had hour long phone conversations, sent endless voice messages, listened to densely packed podcasts.

**To walk is to think. And we all need to make more time for thinking.**

## 7. Walking = Living.
> “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.” — J.K. Rowling

I’m a music junkie. I often listen to music while walking. Whenever I don’t, I remember walking is the ultimate mindfulness practice. I just walk and watch the world.

The people around me. The ways I could go. The rooftops of the buildings I pass. **Walking is one of the most fundamental experiences of being human**.

Don’t rob yourself of that experience.

If you feel inspired now, the best thing you can do is to **take one more step than you took yesterday**.

[Get an activity tracker](http://amzn.to/2Ejxfv6) like mine. Or don’t. Use your phone. Count the steps in your head. Think. Listen to music. Look out for rooftops.
> # **As long as you keep walking, you keep working on yourself**.

That’s what we’re here for. Oh, and to find Ellen DeGeneres’s grandma, of course.

# Want More Freedom and Love in Your Life? 

## Then you need integral power.

Most people I have ever met have been interested in power. They want to feel more powerful than they presently do. Why is that? Well, I would argue that people learn from an early age that power equals the capacity to have what [David Deida](http://deida.info/) calls “freedom and fullness” in their lives. And perhaps even closer to home, they learn that to be loved by a another person often requires that they be powerful.

So given that so many people love power, how can we build an approach to power that is healthy — i.e. integrated and balanced, leading to a feeling of wholeness rather than fragmentation?

[Ken Wilber’](http://www.kenwilber.com/)s quadrant model gives us a way in to answering this question. In his pioneering approach, Wilber has demonstrated that each moment of our lives has at least an interior aspect, an exterior aspect, a collective relational aspect, and a collective systems aspect. This can be seen in the diagram below:

![Ken Wilber’s AQAL Model](0*YB7dpw5umfONlKD8.jpeg)*Ken Wilber’s AQAL Model*

What do these four aspects or domains of life have to do with the issue of developing our strengths or power? Well, what I have intuited is that there is a specific form of power that corresponds to each domain. And note well, power over other people is NOT a part of this integral approach to power, because power over others leads to a destructive dynamic that ends up hurting all involved.

**Your Power Source #1: Power of Authenticity**

In the upper left quadrant, the interior parts of the us, the form of power that is healthy, that leads towards the experience of real freedom, is the power of authenticity. The power of authenticity is the power that derives from being true to ourselves. To be true to ourselves means being honest with ourselves.

Being honest with ourselves is a little trickier than we might think, since we DO seem to have a tendency to lie to ourselves sometimes. There is a specific technique developed by Ken Wilber and taught by Diane Hamilton, called the [3-2-1 process](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x64raziI_4I), that you can use to address this pesky tendency to be dishonest with yourself, and I will teach it to you in an upcoming post. To get started right now, take a few minutes to journal what you are currently thinking and feeling. Then review what you have written and ask yourself, “is there anything *more* to this story?”

Going within can be a challenge if we are not used to it. As a life coach, I can assist you with this process by providing an emotionally safe relationship in which to explore this inner terrain.

Another way of stating this kind of power, then, is that it is the power of sincerity. You have probably met people who seem sincere to you, and you find them undeniably attractive. Most of us have a bullshit meter that we use to help us discern who is sincere, and who is “playing games”. I also call this type of power, “power within”.

**Your Power Source #2: Power of Self-Mastery**

Ever rubbed shoulders with a martial arts expert, highly experienced yoga teacher or elite athlete of any kind? Think about Michael Phelps, perhaps the ultimate current example. What makes people like this powerful is their mastery of their bodies — i.e. their behaviors. In this sense, the power of self-mastery is a kind of power over — it is an objective form of power, but again not power over the bodies of other people. The power of self-mastery could also be seen as relating to mastery of any kind of technical discipline. For example, in the arena of productivity, David Allen has developed a wonderful approach called [“Getting Things Done”](http://www.davidco.com/). Mastery of the specific actions involved in Allen’s process leads to this kind of power, the power of self-mastery.

As a life coach, I can assist you in developing this kind of power by assessing what disciplines the development of which would be most likely to move you towards your goals, and then developing a plan together with you to move you in the direction of mastery of those approaches.

**Your Power Source #3: Power of Relationship**

I believe it was the spiritual teacher [Starhawk](http://www.starhawk.org/) (yeah, I know, her name is a little pretentious) who first named this kind of power in a pithy way, calling it our “power with”. This form of power is the power that we feel when someone really understands us, and when we really understand another. Buber called this the power that comes from the experience of [“I and thou”](http://www.amazon.com/Thou-Scribner-Classics-Martin-Buber/dp/0743201337/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1344287491&sr=8-1&keywords=I+and+thou). This is an increasingly influential form of power, and thankfully so.

The development of this kind of power depends on a three key skills, which I can help you develop. The first skill is that of perspective-taking, which means being able to take the perspective of the other person, to look at the world — and especially to look back at us — as though from their eyes. This is the first crucial skill for developing the power of relationship.

The second crucial skill is empathy. We don’t only need to be able to see from out someone’s eyes, we need to develop a feeling of care and concern for the particular experience of that person, especially their challenges and difficulties in life.

The third crucial skill is the communication of empathy. Feeling empathy for another is not enough — we must be able to communicate it to the other person in a way that they can hear it.

The humanistic approach to coaching in which I was trained, as developed by the pioneering psychologist [Carl Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Rogers), is based largely around these three skills. Since I was trained in this approach in my Masters of Arts in Counselling Psychology program, you will experience the benefits of the power of relationship by selecting me as your coach / therapist.

**Your Power Source #4 — Power of Membership**

“Membership has its privileges” went the old American Express mantra. And it is true. Ken Wilber has suggested that the power of membership is the single largest source of power affecting where people are at in their lives, on average.

I’ll use a personal example to illustrate this form of power. I completed a Master of Arts in Counselling Psychology at the University of British Columbia. By completing that course of studies at an accredited institution, I also became eligible to become a member of the [Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association](http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/). This in turn allows me to purchase practice liability insurance, one of several benefits of membership. Many employers in my field expect their counsellors to have completed at least a Masters in Counselling as a pre-requisite for being hired, and for us to be members of this or a similar association.

Here’s another example at a greater level of power — a physician who holds membership in the College of Physicians and Surgeons in British Columbia where I live can charge the BC Government insurance plan for their services, resulting in the capacity to earn income at a much higher level than most other, more “regular” folks. And if they are a specialist, then they can charge the government health insurance plan that much more, pushing their annual income into the $300k plus range.

More recently, many of us are realizing that the power of our membership as homo sapiens needs to be taken a lot more seriously. We are recognizing that we are members of a planetary biological system that we need to honor. Membership has its privileges, in this case, but also its responsibilities and requirements.

As your coach, I can help you evaluate your current level of power in this domain, and then devise a strategy to develop it — in a way that is hopefully respectful of your membership in our ecological system. For example, in the medical field and others domains, educational initiatives like those put forward by the [MetaIntegral Institute](https://metaintegral.org/) can help you develop your power of membership.

**Power Source #5 — “Secret” SOURCE Power**

OK, I admit it, I lied to you. There aren’t four types of integral power — there are, in fact, five.

And this fifth one probably should be listed first. All the sources of power I shared above have to do with the “power of becoming”, whereas this one has to do with the “power of being”.

The question of “how” of develop this type of “causal consciousness” power is thus paradoxical. Paradoxical yet important, so here are a couple of practices. They won’t enlighten you, because as it has been said, enlightenment is an accident. But they definitely can help make you “accident prone”.

The first one is well-liked by my father, Chris Foster, who publishes his work at [The Happy Seeker](http://www.thehappyseeker.com/). Dad likes John Sherman’s approach to the paradoxical, mysterious nature of life, and John’s approach can be summed up as [“look at yourself”](http://www.riverganga.org/). In other words, use your intention to shift your attention to your inner sense of being an “I”.

In addition to Sherman’s approach, I really like [Candice O’Denver’s](http://www.balancedview.org/) “short moments of awareness, repeated many times, becomes automatic”. Candice suggests that there is available to all of us at all times as kind of “open intelligence”; in fact, that our most intimate experience in any moment is of that very nature. It’s open — not closed. And it is intelligent, not stupid.

In terms of the visual that I provided above, we could think of this fifth kind of power as the paper or screen itself on which the diagram itself appears!

So to develop this kind of power, take a few moments whenever you remember to do so, and ”look at yourself” or allow yourself to rest in “open intelligence”.

# How to Set Goals that Actually Matter

## 

You might be thinking about goals this time of year, and you might be thinking about them all wrong. Or at least kind of wrong.

Resolutions like “get fit,” “eat healthier,” “spend more quality time with my family” all sound lovely, but don’t do us any good. Those are concepts, not goals. Same for work goals like “support team in troubleshooting efforts,” “complete the root cause analysis,” or “resolve failures.”

To be effective, goals have to be concrete. Because only concrete goals drive concrete action.

In the early 1960s, with the US in the middle of the Cold War, when lots of Americans were terrified of Soviet communism — the “Red Scare” — President Kennedy didn’t vaguely suggest that we should defeat the Soviets in the space race. He got concrete.
> # “I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.”
> # -John F. Kennedy, May 1961

Not much wiggle room there. There was no question what the US was setting out to accomplish, and that goal motivated a nation. Words matter. History may have unfolded differently had Kennedy suggested we “leverage our capacity to achieve excellence in space exploration.” That goal probably wouldn’t have led to Neil Armstrong’s 1969 moon walk.

Or consider Boeing’s development of the 727 passenger jet during the same time frame. They could have stated a goal worthy of buzzword bingo — “synergize business structures to enhance air travel.”

They didn’t. They got concrete. As told in [Chip and Dan Heath’s “Made to Stick,”](https://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others/dp/1400064287/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1483109525&sr=1-1&keywords=made+to+stick) the design goal was for the 727 to seat 131 passengers and be able to fly nonstop from Miami to New York City, landing on Runway 4–22 at La Guardia airport. Boeing wanted the 727 to be able to service smaller airports, and La Guardia’s 4–22 runway was too short for their existing passenger jet fleet. The engineers knew exactly what they needed to go do.

Concrete goals motivate concrete action.

There’s a necessary step to defining a concrete goal. If you want to “get fit” — how fit are you now? How quickly can you run a mile? How quickly do you want to run a mile by the end of the year? Even better — by the end of February? Measuring approximations towards an overall longer-term goal is a great way to achieve it. And a great way to celebrate small victories along the way.

Defining where you are now can be eye-opening, and maybe not a lot of fun. Want to get more sleep in 2017? Measure how much you’re getting now. For real, with an activity tracker. Then set a goal. Want to be more present with your family? Count how many times you pull out your iPhone while your spouse or kids are talking to you, and write that number down every day. Chart it. Then set a goal. We don’t need a moonshot to be motivated. Sometimes “little things” like showing progress towards a goal are all it takes.

# How to Manage Your Fear of Public Speaking

## You’re nervous and anxious about public speaking. Now what?

![Me, standing in one place, much calmer than I’d been ten minutes before walking on stage. [Credit James Duncan Davidson](https://www.flickr.com/photos/oreillyconf/4581721721).](1*YkAOwbFEWxNrgloehZr1lg.jpeg)*Me, standing in one place, much calmer than I’d been ten minutes before walking on stage. [Credit James Duncan Davidson](https://www.flickr.com/photos/oreillyconf/4581721721).*

Public speaking often has personal and professional benefits, and it’s required in many jobs. What do you do if the very thought of it sparks dread? The bad news here is that the fear is not just in your head; it’s a real physical experience. The good news is that you can learn to tackle it, and the steps to doing so are not hard to follow.

There are [a number of theories](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/smashing-the-brainblocks/201711/why-are-we-scared-public-speaking) about why people get nervous before speaking in front of others. One that makes a lot of sense hypothesizes that standing apart from a group of people and being watched by them (or the idea of doing that) triggers an instinctive sense of potential threat. You’ve probably heard this referred to as the [fight-or-flight response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response), in which adrenaline floods your body. The physical results are distinctly unpleasant:

* Your digestive system slows down, so your mouth gets dry, you get butterflies in your stomach, and hunger evaporates.

* Your breathing and your heart rate speed up, and your breathing gets more shallow.

* In extreme cases, you may lose hearing or get tunnel vision.

* The queasiness generally comes in 30-second waves—and you have to live through this unpleasant feeling.

You may not be aware of these specific physical responses, but when you get up in front of an audience, you can tell you’re unhappy. Moreover, you may find yourself deeply concerned about being judged for your ideas or your delivery.

The good news is that you can take 12 simple steps to make the adrenaline effects of public speaking less severe and to combat your own internal monologue about how people will receive your talk. In 10 years of hosting conferences, I coached hundreds of speakers. I also tested these ideas on myself in nearly 100 public talks.

These tips for handling stage fright and other physical aspects of public speaking are effective. There are 12 tips total, organized into those that can be used before your talk, those that can be used right before your talk, and those that can be used during your talk.

## **Things to Do Before Your Talk**

### **1. Know that your job is to make the audience members awesome, not to make yourself look awesome.**

Lots of speakers worry about appearing less smart or less dazzling than they think the audience expects. Popular speaker [Kathy Sierra](https://medium.com/@amyjokim/game-thinking-og-my-tribute-to-kathy-sierra-102f3d9df52) (who deals with stage fright every time she talks) gives this tip:
> You will seem incredible to the audience if your talk gives them a new super-power or makes them better at what they do. [Focus your energy on them](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/connect-your-audience-vulnerable-adam-grant/), not on making yourself seem awesome. If you can lose yourself in that part of the experience, stage fright fades quickly.

Sierra, author of the terrific book [Badass: Making Users Awesome](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019), suggests thinking of your audience members as your users. They’re there to learn something or feel something that you guide them to. They aren’t there to judge you.

How do you put this insight into practice? Pick a topic and an angle in which your experience or expertise can truly help others. Then frame your talk in terms of lessons they can take away. Putting your focus on substance that serves them, rather than on style, will help you *and* them.

(Sierra and I talked about this tip, and many others I discuss here, in [a YouTube session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMXX95ZCAYE&t=0s&list=FLecHdzcQDqnqm55XI85-2-w&index=2) a couple of years ago. There are no visuals, so it’s more like a podcast you can listen to anywhere.)

### **2. The single most important thing you can do to serve your audience and beat your own nervousness is practice. A lot. Then do it some more.**

By “practice,” I mean giving your whole talk:

* Out loud

* Standing up

* In the tone of voice you’d use in front of people

* With a timer

Counterintuitively, a ton of practice makes you seem spontaneous. Little or no practice makes you seem stilted. During practice, you’ll iron out the kinks of your talk and get a feel for its phrasing, which will create muscle memory you can fall back on during the real event, when adrenaline tries to override your brain.

I always, always find that practicing out loud at home is awkward at first, but then it gets immediately easier. Do it for the dog, and then for a friend, coworker, or partner/spouse (in person is great, but via video call is totally fine). Working up to bigger and more relevant groups not only helps you work out nerves but is also a great way to get feedback and gain confidence that your talk is resonating with people.

Aim for 10 full run-throughs of your talk — and maybe more if you’re giving a big keynote or the type of talk that requires you to memorize it. If your pets can give your talk, you’ve probably practiced enough.

### **3. Go see the room where you’ll be speaking.**

Knowing what the room feels like and how it’s laid out gives you less to process and think about when you show up. Being able to picture yourself onstage helps with your final out-loud practices too.

Do a rehearsal with a mic and the slide setup if you can. Then, for the actual presentation, you won’t be surprised to hear yourself amplified or be baffled in front of everyone by the system for advancing slides. Plus, again, you’ll have some muscle memory to rely on. Main presenters at most conferences get a chance to rehearse. People in breakout rooms don’t always get this opportunity, but you can often go look at a room ahead of your talk.

At one of the conferences I ran, one of our keynoters was a former TED producer. Of all the speakers I’ve ever hosted, she was the most single-minded about not only seeing the room she’d be in, but also doing a full-length, mic’d rehearsal to a near-empty room. After years of watching speakers try different things to prep, she knew exactly how important this stage could be.

## **Things to Do Right Before Your Talk**

### **4. Rate your nervousness.**

When you’re in the middle of one of those 30-second waves of adrenaline I mentioned above, rate your nervousness on a scale of 1 to 10. A 1 would be that you’re aware of your nerves but they’re no big deal; a 10 is “I might die if I go out onstage.”

Just the act of observing where you are on that scale and externalizing your fear will help you ride the adrenaline wave. When you check back in a couple minutes later and rate yourself, you’ll find that you will almost always be at a lower place on the scale.

This one sounds weird and unlikely to help, but I have found it’s actually one of the most effective things I do. And lots of speakers have told me that trying it helped them a surprising amount. Do it as needed in the hours or minutes before your talk.

### **5. Breathe.**

Breathing is the only autonomic bodily system you can control — and doing it intentionally can have calming effects on everything else. So about five minutes before you go onstage, or between those adrenaline waves, focus on slowing down your breathing for about a minute. You’ll find that it helps your whole body. Try it again a minute later, or as needed.

### **6. Do the Wonder Woman power pose.**

Several years ago, Amy Cuddy gave [a TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en) about the Wonder Woman power pose, and it’s become one of the most viewed TED Talks of all time. The theory is this: Stand with feet planted at shoulder width, hands on hips, shoulders back, and head straight ahead for about two minutes. You’ll get the benefits of higher testosterone and lower cortisol just from standing in a different way.

In the years since her talk, [controversy has arisen](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html) about whether this actually works. But that doesn’t matter at all if it works for you — and [the placebo effect is real](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mental-health/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect). So try it with an open mind. Lots of people find it’s very effective. I’ve seen many a nervous speaker run off to the bathroom to give it a whirl before his or her talk and come back smiling a little more assuredly.

### **7. Eat and drink—a little—beforehand.**

Adrenaline suppresses your appetite. But do eat a little bit, or you may get jittery from hunger. When I first started hosting conferences, the morning adrenaline would persuade me not to eat. That would seem fine — smart, even — until early afternoon, when I’d suddenly feel like crying for no reason, even when the event was going swimmingly. It took me a few turns to realize that adrenaline would override my hunger but didn’t actually compensate for food. So I’d hit a huge dip midday from not having eaten, and that was avoidable. Nibbling rice cakes or eating some yogurt, even when I didn’t feel hungry, solved the problem.

It’s also important to beware caffeine: it will feed your adrenaline response, and it will make you have to pee. Definitely don’t drink more coffee, tea, or soda than you normally would. You might even cut back, since adrenaline will keep you plenty alert.

Because adrenaline will create dry mouth, you’ll be tempted to drink a lot. Sipping water is great since you don’t want to get dehydrated. But don’t drink so much water that you’re dying to pee the whole time you’re onstage. (By the way, it’s great to have water onstage with you for dealing with dry mouth up there too.)

## **During Your Talk**

### **8. Don’t mention that you’re nervous.**

Speakers are often certain that the audience knows they’re nervous. So they say something to acknowledge what everyone can plainly see. Except that literally nobody knows how you’re feeling if you don’t mention it. Moreover, audience members are there to learn something from you (selfishly), and they’re quietly rooting for you (generously). They *want* you to do well, because that will serve them, and so [their cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) cause them to see you as confident.

They can’t feel or see the butterflies in your stomach or your dry mouth. And they admire that you’re onstage. Meet them where they are by leaving out your internal narrative about your nerves.

### **9. Speak at a normal pace.**

Adrenaline will speed you up, and speaking too quickly not only makes it hard for the audience to follow you but can throw you off your game. Making matters worse, as a speaker, you exist on a different time continuum than your audience: what will feel to you like a slow pace with excruciatingly long pauses will feel completely normal to everybody else. So you have to plan for that. Indeed, for conferences where I’ve collected feedback about individual presenters, one of the most common complaints is that speakers were hard to follow when they spit out words too quickly.

Of course, it’s helpful just knowing that normal speed will feel slow to you, because then you can aim for that. In addition, in transition moments in your talk, take pauses to emphasize a point and catch your breath or take a sip of water. You can even build pauses into your deck with occasional visual slides that you don’t intend to speak about. When you practice, you’ll get a feel for where you need to slow down or pause.

Finally, if you’ve practiced with a timer, you should have a sense of where you should be, say, three slides in or after five minutes. If you’re running ahead of schedule, you know it’s time to sloooow down.

### **10. Plant yourself in one place on the stage.**

There’s a very big myth among speakers that moving around the stage makes you seem more energetic and helps people connect with you. It’s a complete lie. If you’re a person who naturally has a lot of physicality, and you can really get behind your movements, flying all over the place and punctuating your talk with incredible physical gestures, great. If that’s not you, and if you are speaking for one of the first times,* *the absolute best thing you can do is find a spot, stand in it very firmly, and stay there the whole time.

People will see you as grounded and confident if you are standing on both feet very solidly.

You can stand somewhere in the middle of the stage, and there’s also no shame at all in staying behind the podium and standing there very solidly. You can move to the side of the podium and just have it be your friend right next to you (but don’t lean on it, as that’ll look too casual).

What you want to focus on — and this will take a little bit of practice — is standing so that you’re very grounded and aren’t jiggling or shuffling around. It’s great to use lots of hand gestures, but you want your feet to be very planted. Practice. Be surprised at how hard it is at first.

### **11. Make eye contact with the audience. Sort of.**

In many conference rooms, you’ll have what’s called a confidence monitor — a smallish screen on the floor in front of you that lets you see your slides as you speak. It’s very tempting to just look at your slides the whole time, which to the audience will look like you’re staring at the floor.

That matters, because people like it when you make eye contact with them; they feel more engaged. But eye contact can make you feel very threatened (part of the fight-or-flight response comes from a lot of eye contact with a lot of other people). You don’t want to trigger yourself into a bad place by making a ton of eye contact, and it will feel to you like you’re holding people’s gaze for a really long time if you’re looking at them for, like, half a second.

You can cheat your way through this. Think about the room in front of you as being in four quadrants — two in front and two in back, left and right. All you have to do is look at each quadrant one at a time and change quadrants approximately every sentence you speak. You don’t have to actually make eye contact with anybody in the quadrant, but everyone will think you have. This works even in a room where the audience is in the dark and you’re under lights so that you can’t see them.

### **12. At the very end, signal your talk is over by saying thank you.**

Go out strong and avoid the awkward, “Uh, so that’s it…” by saying a definitive “Thank you” to let people know they can leave or ask questions or expect the next speaker — whatever is appropriate for your situation.

After your talk, especially if it was short, you might feel the effects of adrenaline draining away and find that you’re surprisingly tired. Managing nerves is hard work! But hopefully, you’ll also get a rush from having delivered a talk that you not only survived but also used to help other people. That’s a physical feeling that’s hard to get any other way — and it’s a great one.

# Build Relationships…

## Build Relationships…

### The Business Will Come.

About 10 years ago someone I met through a company I was consulting with called me out of the blue and asked me for a favor. He said he was going through a difficult time, his mind wasn’t in the right place, and he thought having a sit down, face to face conversation with me help.

1. I was humbled.
2. I was also hopeful I would have something
to share with him that would make a difference.

At the time, I was charging about $500/hour for consulting.
He told me upfront he had just lost almost everything and he
couldn’t afford to pay me a nickel, but swore he would make it up to me some day.

That same guy called me today.

Today he is one of the top earners in the company he is in, he has built a sales team of thousands of people all across the country, and he found out many of his distributors are hiring business coaches and spending $500/mo or more.

He said if I had the time and was interested, he could easily have 50-100 people who would sign up next month for a coaching program with me because he was certain they would get more value with me.

1. He is probably right.
I am still humble, but
also ridiculously confident.

2. That would be $25,000 - $50,000/mo income for me.
That I wasn’t even trying to get….
To do something I LOVE to do anyway.

3. There are many more exciting things
he and I can/will do together business wise.

What’s the point?

Literally every single one of the biggest business deals I have ever done in my life have come together almost exactly like that.

Build Relationships.
The Business Will Come.

# Get more sleep to become a better speaker

## 

## Get more sleep to become a better speaker.

Even after one night of not enough sleep, our thinking slows down, our creativity suffers, and our coordination gets off kilter; it’s everything that a presenter needs for a good talk.

In his book, “The Promise of Sleep,” Dr. William Dement talks about a concept called “sleep debt.”

He explains, “Sleep debt is the difference between the amount of sleep you should be getting and the amount you actually get. It’s a deficit that grows every time we skim some extra minutes off our nightly slumber.”

Let’s say you are someone who needs 8 hours of sleep each night but on Tuesday night you get only 6. Well, even if you get 8 hours a sleep for the rest of the week, you’ll be carrying around those extra 2 hours of sleep debt!

We’ve all experienced. We have a bad night and the rest of our week seems off. We aren’t as productive at work and we zone out during meetings. Maybe our attention to detail suffers. The ultimate cause is the sleep debt we’re carrying. If we continue to not get the required amount each night, then we keep adding to that debt.

Many people think they can catch up on their sleep through naps, yet Dr. Dement found that wasn’t possible. Rather, we have to tack on the sleep debt to the longer periods of sleep to catch up. Our brain has to enter that deep REM sleep in order to take on the debt owed.

So how do you know if you have sleep debt you’re carrying?

There’s a pretty easy test that you can do each night.

If you lie down to go to sleep and fall asleep instantly, you are carrying some sleep debt! Essentially, your brain is saying to your body, “We need to go to sleep NOW!” If you stay awake for about 10 or 15 minutes, then you’re fine.

There are plenty of sleeping tips out there and that’s another article for another day. Become a better speaker by recognizing if you’re getting enough sleep. You’ll feel better and perform better for your next presentation.

# 20 Difficult Truths About Love + Relationships from a Life Coach

## 

Even for the most grounded, emotionally intelligent people, the vagaries of love and despair can keep our lives in high drama.

There are roadblocks and misguided perspectives that come up frequently with my clients when we sit down to figure out what is causing misunderstanding and friction in their relationships. The following is a short list of what I’ve learned that I hope will give you clarity, support, and resonance.

**1. Some people put up with a lot of BS in relationships and think they are proving their love and loyalty.** But really, they are putting up with BS because they are addicted to the other person, afraid to be alone, or addicted to how they feel as the Saviour, “good one,” or hero/heroine. The shit-taker goes through high-highs, low-lows, confusion, starvation, self-loathing, vindication, relief, depression, and victory. If this is you, **I have a message: love doesn’t feel like this.**

2. He is smart, has a decent job, has a wonderful family (that loves you), and would make a great dad some day. But he is often emotionally remote, depressed, and can’t see how awesome he is.

She is sweet, sexy, understands your need to zone out on the weekends, and makes your life fun. But she quizzes you about other women, talks constantly about the past “cheaters” in her life, and would rather complain about her lack of confidence than do something about it.

**Lack of self-worth from either partner will screw up your relationship, even if there is a lot of potential.**

3. Love and partnership comes in many forms. **You can make a great life with someone who is not your soul mate.**

4. The French say that in every relationship there is the “Kisser” and the “Kissed.” That means **in every relationship there is a “Nurture” person and a “Freedom” person.** These roles can switch, depending on the dynamics of your partnership (in one relationship you might be the Nurture person, in another, the Freedom person). In a healthy relationship, surrendering to your partner’s needs will give you more of what you want. Communicate about this thoroughly. A very important new book on bonding styles: [Attached, by Levine and Heller](http://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139). I’m recommending it to all my clients.

5. The breakup sucks for your ex too, but for different reasons.

You guys shared everything together and he’s got to be hurting as bad as you, right? This will be the first harsh reality check: **Something that is happening to both of you won’t be something you can bond on.**

6. The next bus leaves in 5 minutes. Translation: If you’ve given it a fair shot and your partner is not the right fit for you or doesn’t treat you well, move the hell on. There is a lot of love, opportunity, and partnership possibilities in this Universe ready and waiting for you. **Stop imprisoning yourself in a perpetually mismatched (or abusive, or luke-warm, or dysfunctional) relationship.**

7. **Loving someone, but not being IN LOVE with them, is a real thing.** You have to decide if you can deal with that.

8. You can love someone even if you don’t love yourself. It will be difficult, and it will make for a problematic and arduous relationship, but the statement: ‘You can’t love someone until you love yourself’ is a lie. **Work on building love, trust, and respect for yourself**…and know this is a process for both you and your partner.

9. ‘No one can make you happy except yourself’ is another lie. OF COURSE people can make you happy. They can make you immensely fulfilled, profoundly directed, ignited, and inspired — sometimes more than you could for yourself. The self-sufficiency pendulum needs to swing back into balance here. I don’t suggest being vampirically co-dependent on others for your sense of personal happiness and security — but **hell yes — other people can make you happy…deeply and deliriously so. LET THEM.**

**10. You can have more than one soul mate in your lifetime.**

11. I have coached people through infidelity, sex addiction, money problems, possessiveness, jealousy, anger issues, lack of sex drive, and poor communication skills. These issues were sucking the life out of the relationship, but were not the deal breakers. Most things can be worked through. **The #1 relationship killer is the offending partner’s refusal to get help.** Refusal looks like: stalling, making excuses, admitting/crying/doing nothing (see #14), and blaming you.

12. The highest level of attraction will occur when you meet someone who closely matches the composite sketch of your primary caretakers (mom and dad). This visceral attraction filter lies in your subconscious. **Consciously we want to be happy, subconsciously we want to be healed.** [It’s called imago matching](http://www.therapy4couples.com/imago-theory.html) and accounts for most ‘soul mate’ relationships. Imago matches can be deeply healing, or, if you don’t know you’re in an imago match — devastatingly painful (think Romeo and Juliet).

**13. Stop bad mouthing your ex to others. **Every time you create him/her with your language, you are creating an aberration of them in the room. They get invited back into your life the very same way they were invited in when you were creating them with love and excitement….you are conjuring energetically. Love and hate are two sides of the SAME coin. (Hint: Your goal is neutrality.) — Elizabeth Gilbert gives some fine advice [here](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/456196-i-m-not-laughing-i-was-actually-crying-and-please-don-t).

14. Don’t be placated by a partner who is a good admitter/apologizer. No one gets a parade for admitting their shit and saying sorry. **Credit is given to partners who take action and change their behavior.**

15. Sometimes the only purpose of a marriage was to bring some amazing, sweet kids into this world. It takes work, forgiveness, and a lot of grounded-ness to get to this place. **If you and your ex can compose co-parenting vows to replace your marriage vows, you can create “one family living in two homes” **— which is what my ex and I did. Our kids are happy, well-adjusted and secure, 14 years post-divorce.

**16. Do not attempt to marry someone while you are still in love with another.**

17. Gramma said, **“Spend 4 seasons with someone before you claim to know them** and certainly save marriage talk until after a year.” Yeah, I’ve broken this rule before. Sorry gramma….(you were right!)

**18. Understanding masculine/feminine energy (and the role you want to embody) is essential** to having a successful, connected, and sexually dynamic relationship.

**19. A period of time spent alone will be the best gift you can give to yourself. **If you resist medicating yourself with alco-, worko-, or Bravo Channel-holism, you will learn to trust yourself deeper, hear the voice of your inner guide clearer, and in the absence of another person telling you how beautiful/smart/clever you are, you will learn to generate this for yourself. Your future self and your future healthy relationship will thank you.

**20. Let go when you’re hurting too much. **Give up when love isn’t enough. Move on when your gut tells you to. Remember that you have been given this one gorgeous, sparkling, comet-of-a-life and you are free and entitled to choose how to spend it. Don’t wait around for a permission slip, better timing, or a better financial situation… Go for it now.

# What tiny daily habit could be life changing?

## The definition of tiny habit says it’s an activity that
> *-you do at least once a day,*
> *-takes you less than 30 seconds,*
> *-requires little effort.*

Tiny habits were invented by BJ Fogg from Stanford University, as a result of his[ study on behavioral change](http://tinyhabits.com/). They are the tool for common mortals to learn the nits and grits of the process of habits development.

I won’t go into the details of my study about the etymology of the word *‘habit,*’ but it clearly revealed that your habits define who you are.

Thus, any tiny habit in itself is life changing. **If you learn how to develop habits, you and your life will never be the same.** I didn’t learn the art of habit development by practicing tiny habits, but I can confirm that one’s life changes when his habits change.

99% of answers to this question don’t refer to tiny habits. Heck, the top answer is “Read books **at least 30 minutes** a day!” That’s 60 times greater than tiny!

Here is the really tiny habit that has not only the potential (“could”), but real power to change lives:

![](0*5OFKlJHM-3B926nK.)

It has the power of setting your brain to positivity. Experiments confirmed that it’s enough to come up with three new reasons for being grateful every morning for one month to change hardcore pessimists into optimists.

Why is that important? Will those “newly created” optimists going around in blissful state with goofy smiles and saliva in the corners of their mouths? Nope. Their brains will be positive. Here what happens when your brain is positive:
> **“Every possible outcome we know how to test for raises dramatically.”**

Cultivating gratitude is one of the easiest habits on earth. I started from jotting down 1 to 3 things about my wife in a dedicated gratitude diary.

Let it sink in. A tiny habit, less than 30 seconds a day. Every measurable output increases.

How’s that for a life change?

The above revelations are the result of scientific studies and they are right at the general level. Let me tell you a couple of stories that demonstrate the power of gratitude on individual level.

## Stronger Than Death

I have a friend, let’s call her S. She had been keeping a gratitude diary for well over a year when her boyfriend died in a car accident. Can you imagine a more excruciating experience? Her whole world fell apart in a single moment. But she had a gratitude habit. Habits are not to be taken lightly. They are hardcoded in the most primal part of your brain. It’s not easy to get rid of them.

She kept her gratitude diary even throughout that dark time. It helped her to stay sane.

Today she is in a new relationship and her gratitude streak is well over 1,000 days long.

## Saving Relationships

As I mentioned above, my adventure with gratitude started with a diary about my wife. As a proper tiny habit, it opened doors for more gratitude in my life. Now I am thankful for everything. I also started separate gratitude journals about my kids and about my days. I’m a fount of gratitude.

I’m deeply thankful for this first small habit however. The past three years were tough on our marriage. It was the usual story: years of marriage brought routine, boredom, over-familiarity and predictability creeping in.

I decided to turn my life around and my wife was absolutely not prepared for that. Quite often she said *“I don’t recognize you.” *This was obviously all “her fault,” (blaming is the easiest way in a relationship, isn’t it?), however the daily conscious effort of looking for something to be grateful for in or about her helped me to keep the right perspective.

I don’t claim that, if not for my gratitude journal, we would have been divorced or some other tragedy would have happened. It’s just that this tiny discipline made the turmoil in my life and marriage more bearable. It helped me to diminish my ego a bit.

## Begin in a Tiny Way

Every morning (morning shapes your day), take a journal and note down at least one thing you are grateful for. If you can come up with 100, that’s fine, but 1 is enough. If you can elaborate why you are grateful for it, that’s fine, but focus on writing this one thing first. It should be a new thing every day.

There is no excuse for not doing this, not even the one my rebellious teenager throws at me: *“I don’t know what I’m grateful for.”* Everything can be a starting point: air, water, food, shelter, your body or its parts…

If S. found reasons to be grateful after her boyfriend’s death, you surely can find something too.

# What I learned from getting fired when I was 11

## What I learned from getting fired when I was 11

I’m one of those people who’s always been good at most things I did without having to try. I got good marks in school and excelled without really putting any effort in. I was always told “if you focused and paid attention, can you even imagine how well you’d do?!” — but I had a really hard time getting there, since without effort I was doing pretty well — not as well as I could have done, but well enough. To me, failure was something of a foreign concept — I didn’t get it, and I didn’t want to get it.

When I was 9, I discovered musical theatre. The play was Grease, and I was cast as Patti Simcox — the annoying head cheerleader no one likes. Anyway, I had stage presence, and when I said my lines people laughed and seemed to like watching me, and it was a giant adrenaline rush. People immediately told me I was great, and I got a thrill out of performing that I’d never found elsewhere — I was hooked.

Now, my ideal role in Grease was one of the Pink Ladies, and when one of the Pink Ladies dropped out right before the show opened, I knew I had my shot. I was the best in the cast! I had this one DOWN! So I took the opportunity to ask if I could switch roles. Well, the director took me aside and told me that even though I was talented, they liked me too much as Patti to change my role. She softened the blow by changing the actual show so that Patti became a Pink Lady at the end, instead of being laughed at by the cool kids (wish life imitated art on that one!). Even still, that was my very first moment of theatre heartbreak — the first moment I realized that it’s not always about how good you are, often, it’s about factors beyond your control.

Around then, I started taking my first vocal lessons. Now, I’m told that I had already had a pretty good voice, but it was a little tiny voice. Once I started training and learning how to belt, there was no stopping me — I was this little tiny child with a voice like Ethel Merman. I imagine it must have been a weird thing to see. I started to get cast in far bigger roles — my next one after Patti was Annie, in Annie.

When I was 11, I went for an open call audition for a show being workshopped on its way to Broadway. I walked in and sang a song called “Look at Me, I’m Sandra Dee” (which set me well apart — because really, you notice an 11-year-old kid who sounds like Ethel Merman singing about virginity, which is the second line in the song!) — and the director laughed and smiled and clapped and asked me whether I could dance. Me, being the direct kid I was, told him no, I couldn’t. He cast me anyway. Getting that phone call a week later was one of the happiest moments of my life. I’d been cast as a named role in a professional show — crazy stuff, and I was the happiest I’d ever been.

When rehearsals started, I remember being in a state of bliss. I was working with big names but had no idea — I didn’t realize until years later that some of our cast members were Tony Award winners and had recently come from Broadway, or that our director had directed several of my favorite shows of all time. I started rehearsing my lines and my solo.

And I remember the exact moment when I first felt self-doubt. It was the first dance rehearsal. They’d double-cast the kids, and my counterpart and I were called to rehearsal, where we sat by the side of the room. The choreographer came over and started explaining steps and what he wanted us to do, and the little girl beside me nodded and smiled and stood up. And I looked at him blankly, thinking to myself “God, I wish I knew what a Grand Jeté was…” I sat by the side all day and watched while he worked with the other little girl, and she nodded and smiled and did exactly what he said and looked brilliant, while I, for the first of many, many times, wished that I hadn’t quit ballet when my mother tried to put me in classes when I was 5.

A couple of days later, my mother and I were called into a meeting with the director, choreographer, and assorted production staff, who told me that I was not in fact suited for the role and that I wouldn’t be able to continue playing it. They offered me two choices — keep my union status and drop out of the production, or take a pay cut, lose my union status and stay in the cast as an ensemble member (so no lines and no solo). After a lot of tears on my part, and with lots of support from my (admittedly horrified) parents, I chose to stay in the show — one of the things about me has always been a desire to stick it out and not to quit, even when things get really hard. So I stayed, and watched another girl take my part. The worst part about the whole thing was that since the show was still being workshopped and was continually changing, by the time the production was up and running, my role had almost no dance left in it.

All I knew was that I’d failed — to put it bluntly, I’d been fired — because I wasn’t good enough. Heavy stuff to deal with at 11. Definitely my first true experience of rejection, and I’m not ashamed to say that I’ve been learning ways to cope with — and eventually break through — my fears around rejection and failure ever since.

So, onto the main point of this post — the lessons I’ve learnt that have allowed me to grow into the person I am today. And let me be clear — I’m pretty happy with where and who I am. That’s taken a really long time, and a lot of hard work and a lot of learning. I’m finally — *finally* — getting to a point where I’m understanding that failure happens sometimes. Failing at something doesn’t make ME a failure, and if I don’t take the risk — and maybe fail — I’ll never learn to fly.

## LESSON 1: SHIT HAPPENS. GET OVER IT.

Please don’t think that I mean that you shouldn’t grieve loss, or take the time necessary to get past something terrible happening. What I really mean is that if you want to grow past whatever it is that’s happened, it takes work and a true choice to make that happen. For a long time, I was really mad. I refused to talk about this story with anyone — it made me cry to think about. I let this really traumatic experience affect my perception of myself and the choices I made. I was bitter and angry at the folks who did this to me. Until I made the choice to acknowledge and deal with how I felt, and did the work to understand what was creating those emotions, I couldn’t move forward with creating a new story for myself, and pushing past the safe and comfortable place where people couldn’t reject me and I couldn’t fail.

## LESSON 2. DON’T LET THEM BEAT THE FIRE OUT OF YOU. NOT ONLY THAT — DON’T BEAT IT OUT OF YOURSELF EITHER.

I’ve always been something of a fiery person — I was a crazy kid who loved to burst into song in public, who would never say no if someone asked her to perform because I loved it more than anything. Only now am I finally learning to say yes again and to embrace the opportunity to give what I can to the world instead of hiding because someone may tease me, not like me, or make me feel badly about myself if I do. I tried so hard for so long to be everything I’m not to make up for some perceived lack — I’m done trying. If you like me, great, that’s wonderful, because I pretty much like everyone unless you give me a reason not to. If you don’t, that’s your choice and I choose not to care.

## LESSON 3. IT’S OKAY TO QUIT, PARTICULARLY IF WHAT YOU’RE BEING OFFERED IS LESS THAN YOU DESERVE.

This has manifested itself in every aspect of my life. I always felt like it was the moral choice, or the right choice, or the better choice, not to quit something if I’d committed to it. I’ve literally never quit anything in my life — even if something made me feel worse about myself, wasn’t any fun, or really added no value to my life, I would stick it out. I’m slowly learning that it’s okay to walk away if it’s justified. Not always — my level of commitment is still a really critical and key piece of my personality. But I’ve begun to identify the areas of my life where I am not getting what I deserve, and I know now that I can make a choice to leave if a situation is truly unbearable. I do not need to “stick it out” — sometimes the better choice is to be strong enough to quit.

## LESSON 4. ON A RELATED NOTE, YOU DESERVE MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU DO. ALWAYS.

There isn’t much to say about this one. Believe that you deserve more — and work to have more — and more will come.

## LESSON 5. OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING CAN ARISE OUT OF REALLY TERRIBLE SITUATIONS.

Don’t ignore the learning and focus on the negative — be grateful and try to show appreciation for what you’re being taught. Or at least, make a real effort to come around to that point of view once you’ve had time to think about what happened and process. I am truly and honestly grateful for some of the really awful experiences I’ve had — I regret nothing, because each one was an opportunity to learn and grow and become a better person with more knowledge about the world and myself.

# Gave up my Mobile Phone

## Gave up my Mobile Phone

### A challenge of staying ahead of the time & trends, are you ready for it?

Yes. You read it correctly, I have stopped using my mobile phone since almost a month ago and it couldn’t have been cheesier to express, but *— I’m Loving It!*

Before I dig deeper and share this experience and the rationale that’s helping me find my way back to real life, here’s a little disclaimer:

*I owned an iPhone 3G since 2007 and haven’t changed since, although I’ve used other smartphones like Blackberry, Nokia, etc. for my international roaming numbers alongside the iPhone over the last 6 years. Secondly, I continue to have the number and use it as a Landline only when in office i.e. to call and receive calls, to send and receive text messages, when am at the desk; just like we do with our Landlines numbers or Instant Messengers / Email Clients, etc. just that mobile phone handsets are really smarter and more manageable with these 1000s of contacts, than Landline Models.*

![](1*7ZeEPd8vV24yyMHmli0ybQ.jpeg)

So why then did I even think of something so drastically opposite to the direction in which things are moving,globally? I mean WhatsApp, BBM (now on Android and iOS), Viber, WeChat and “What Not App” is gaining users by the hundreds of thousands per day and here I am totally giving up this very powerful device that the smartphone is turning out to be?

### Have I lost it?

Or are my reasons more powerful and reasonable than the passing thought many of us do, or do not, give to this “always connected” lifestlye — we will soon find out, or should I say confirm :)

**PRIVACY**

![everyone thinks that the latest is the best, then comes another, then yet another…](1*g5207gDJ7WgjRXPNAj2Z6A.jpeg)*everyone thinks that the latest is the best, then comes another, then yet another…*

True, we’ve every app that guards all our passwords and other private data from prying eyes, but what is that app that’s guarding our private time from the every hungry time gobblers — social networks, chatting apps, etc. are putting us in touch with people who’re only interested with our entertainment value to them — what funny and interesting new thing we share with them, whether that be a pic of ours or of a random internet meme; most of “always connected” friends wish us because the software reminds them too or in some cases grants incentives to wish across the network.

Really who cares about such people anyway? I’d rather spare my time away from the internet with the people who curse me and fight with me because that’s what real friends do, instead of liking every stupid update I post, even if it’s posted by mistake.

Why does every, and frustratingly so I mean literally every, silly thing we do in a day has to be shared with those who weren’t there to see it, I mean they weren’t there for a reason. Tell them if they ask for it.

**INFORMATION**

![nobody cares for irrelevant information, no matter how precisely correct it is, stop giving and taking it.](1*_mOLnpUUZD7K55Z_4MdimQ.jpeg)*nobody cares for irrelevant information, no matter how precisely correct it is, stop giving and taking it.*

News, Blogs, RSS, Forums, blogs, etc.? Do we even need all that information? Can we even keep a significant part of that information with us? If we miss it, technology will find the information in future for us, but what (Tech/App) will bring back this time that we’re supposed to spend doing quality stuff?

Nothing. One of our teachers used to ask us, as to what could one do if we were given a little over ₹ 88,000 everyday, but then we’ll have to spend those in that day itself; no carry over, yet we’re guaranteed to have that kinda money daily till we die. Everyone was amazed at how rich we’d get and then the teacher would open our mind by telling us that we did indeed get that kinda money daily, only it was those many seconds given to us and we all used to wonder.

**ETIQUETTE**

![when am in office, am working. when am not, am not working](1*HcfaEgJaSLoP-04nN46jvg.gif)*when am in office, am working. when am not, am not working*

Today’s Hip and Happening generation might not like me mentioning this, as many believe it’s an *unnecessary evil of the elite. *Well, if only people understood what elite meant. Our ancestors used to say the one with maximum time and one with best of health to use the time the way (s)he wanted, was the most elite, wisest & wealthiest of us all. True That!

With a mobile I had no time, because I was paying for and carrying an expensive device & plan to make myself available for those who wanted to reach me, whenever they wanted (most of the times it was URGENT). Seriously, without a mobile, I am available to talk on a telephone, when I want, how I want and most importantly, it’s NEVER URGENT, just lazy on part of those who delay the calls till the last minute, because with the mobile & “always connected” life, they can!

When people called me repeatedly while I was in meetings or conversations that I didn’t want to interrupt, there was no way to stop that and it annoyed me like nothing else has. Can someone please respect the fact that I did not pick up the call the first time means that I will (and I always do) call back?

Now, however, that constant irritating behaviour doesn’t bother me as much, my office’s reception takes all the calls and they’re good at that.

**VISION / COMMON SENSE**

![habits should die before you do](1*DbQw8EcIVqJWD1jl6qVP8Q.gif)*habits should die before you do*

This one is a little tough for those who don’t know me, but I don’t want to live in a particular fashion, just because “that’s the trend”. I never have and I will try not to comply simply because everyone else does.

I don’t say this to sound fashionable, but if something is a trend or a norm, the idea of not complying with it flirts with my mind all the time. I believe in conventional wisdom and listening to the elders, more experienced people, if you will. I actually believe in *Law Of Contrary Public Opinion.*

When people are madly in love with their phones, to a large extent more than people, there’s had to be an opportunity in moving away from it - a thought I was toying with for a while and then I saw, all my ills were linked to this little machine that made me change plans because “i got a call…” Well, no more.

It wasn’t until I got married and someone told me how much time I spend away from MY LIFE on phone, for other people and at other people’s leisure time. She certainly never expected such in depth analysis and the least she expected was such an abrupt reaction — me giving up my Mobile Phone, entirely; but I can’t thank my wife enough for this.

It’s not only her, even my folks and friends are now happier because there’s one less ringtone to worry about, while we’re HAVING fun, instead of RECORDING for/and SHARING it.

### Try it, it won’t kill you! If anything, it’ll give you another LIFE!

You can always meet me in person or reach me on email, office phones and social media, only don’t expect me to reply urgently. At least not until I am convinced it’s urgent too ;-)

# The New Girl.

## And I’m not talking about the American sitcom starring Zoey Deschanel, where she talks all cute and wears way too many polka dot dresses.

**A girl, a railway ticket and a half eaten sub walk into an ad agency.**

I invested an entire lunch break into that title.

I write this post as a rookie. I speak as someone who gets excited at the sight of free cereal and milk . I’m also the person who took a week to figure out how the coffee machine works.

Being the new girl anywhere can be tricky. It’s a lot like being the new girl at a new school. You want your bench mates to be kind enough to wake you up when the teacher passes by and you pray that you find good friends to share your lunch with.

I seem to have entered advertising at a time of deep reflection. A time when everyone around me seems to be looking at the residual remains of what advertising has turned out to be. In my opinion, a little too methodic and a little less mad.

I think I started my embryonic career in advertising for typical reasons. Graduated from college, applied to an advertising school, and got accepted.

I didn’t think much into it. I normally don’t much into anything. I still wear bell bottoms sometimes.

All I knew is that I wished to infect the media I distrusted with simple, honest statements of my own. I wished to change opinions and start conversations. A single thought, my single thought, could create so many waves across mediums. It all started with a single thought and I found that bloody hell trippy. As a student of communications, we all have these preconceived notions about the mad life of advertising. You’ve watched the *Mad Men* series a million times and you secretly say those lines that make you feel like you’re the cat’s pajamas.

What? You don’t do that?

So, it’s just me then?

Cool.

That cute looking Don Draper guy once said something that really hit a chord with me. I wasn’t even drooling over his face when he said, “Advertising is based on one thing: happiness. And do you know what happiness is? Happiness is the smell of a new car. It’s freedom from fear. It’s a billboard on the side of a road that screams with reassurance that whatever you’re doing is OK. You are OK.”

You know what I mean?

But it takes a reality check. The kinds that includes reality and an offer letter, a desk and those delicious yawns that get snapped into half by sudden realizations of deadlines that then get stuck on a sticky note in font size 22 on your computer screen. Slow shattering of all those preconceived notions you had, but the picture is of a slightly different shade on the other side.

A fortnight in advertising and I had an indication of what I had gotten myself into.

I managed to stumble upon a profession that allows you to live inside your head. I was given the permission to build a Neverland around me and say things like, “Why don’t we put a life size pilsner glass in a mall?” or “How about filling a pool completely with chocolate shake?”

You can dance to your own tunes and sing a different one every day.

I wonder how one manages to get old in advertising with a Peter Pan living inside your head that says anything is possible, as long as the client has the budget, of course.

“What a buzz kill!” my greenhorn mind exclaimed when I heard about the existence of “the client” first.

But, maybe that Don Draper guy wasn’t completely wrong.

Maybe we really are in the business of happiness. And every creation that leads to happiness, I’d like to think of it as a successful campaign. Reassuring people with loud shiny billboards. Commercials that make you feel, “I’ve been there!” Catchy jingles that leech on and find their way to your Monday morning showers.

Maybe there’s a lot about advertising that hasn’t found me yet. Maybe there are harsher truths waiting for me. Maybe I won’t like it that much. But I wish to remain naïve about those for as long as I can. I don’t think the Peter Pan inside my head will like it that much.

Till then, I guess I’ll celebrate life at the starting point by dancing like the girl in that old Cadbury commercial.

Damn, good ad that.

# How To Develop Razor-Sharp Focus With The Tetris Effect

## How To Develop Razor-Sharp Focus With The Tetris Effect

In the movie [Pixels](http://amzn.to/2fISr2b), there is a scene where Tetris blocks suddenly fall from the sky, arrange themselves on buildings in the real world and thus destroy them.

Remember the image above, for it’ll be your guide towards razor-sharp focus.

## The Result of Obsessive Play

In 1990, Vladimir Pokhilko wanted to stay at a friend’s house in Tokyo for a week. There was only one problem: They had a brand new Game Boy. And Tetris.
> At night, geometric shapes fell in the darkness as I lay on loaned tatami floor space. Days, I sat on a lavender suede sofa and played Tetris furiously. During rare jaunts from the house, I visually fit cars and trees and people together. Dubiously hunting a job and a house, **I was still there two months later, still jobless, still playing.**

What Vladimir Pokhilko learned in those two months changed how we view video games forever. Being a clinical psychologist, he became obsessed with the idea that Tetris must have an impact on our neural system.

Some kind of…*Tetris effect.*

One year later, at the University of California, Irvine, Richard Haier scanned the brains of Tetris players. He found the game initially raises cerebral glucose metabolic rates (GMR), the amount of sugar your brain uses to perform.

**But the more you play, the more efficient your brain becomes.** After a few weeks, your GMR stays steady, while your performance increases seven-fold.
> Tetris trains your brain to stop using inefficient gray matter, perhaps a key cognitive strategy for learning.

This initial finding lead to a waterfall of research on the subject:

* In 1994, Okagaki & French showed video games may improve spatial skills, such as mental rotation, spatial perception and spatial visualization.

* In 2000, Stickgold et al. saw even amnesia patients dream about Tetris after playing, indicating it comes with its own form of memory, likely related to procedural memory.

* In 2009, Oxford University researchers found Tetris reduces post-traumatic stress disorder when played soon after the traumatic event.

* Also in 2009, Stickgold did a follow-up study showing Tetris increased grey matter in the brain, which boosts your brain’s efficiency and memory capacity.

But what makes the Tetris effect special, compared to other findings from cognitive research?

## When Games Turn Into Reality

The Tetris effect is one of very few biological phenomena that makes *its benefits obvious to those it affects.*

How?

When you play the game for a few hours straight, your GMR skyrockets and you feel like you’re on a high. It’s the biological connection to a well-known phenomenon in psychology: [**flow](http://amzn.to/2fJ24y6)**.

After you spend a certain amount of time in this state of optimal performance, **your Tetris training spills over into the real world — just like in the scene from Pixels.**

You might dream of Tetris, see Tetris blocks on your living room floor or even hallucinate about boxes and items organizing themselves properly on grocery store shelves or in the trunk of your car.

But how can you use all this to improve your focus?

Here’s the real beauty of the Tetris effect:
> # **Tetris is just a metaphor**.

It’s not limited to video games. Whatever activity triggers flow for you you can use to boost your brain’s efficiency.
> The Tetris effect is a biochemical, reductionistic metaphor, if you will, for curiosity, invention, the creative urge. To fit shapes together is to organize, to build, to make deals, to fix, to understand, to fold sheets. **All of our mental activities are analogous, each as potentially addictive as the next.**

For most of us, what we do at work each day isn’t exactly exciting. But what you do in your free time is up to you. If you choose well, you can become a lot better at everything you do, not just work.

How do you become laser-focused?

## **Find Your Tetris**

Your Tetris may not be a video game and it may not be what others think is fun. But whatever activity spreads through your entire life and makes you see the world as a space full of opportunity is your shot. And you can win so much more than just the game.

Some days I write for one hour. Some days for four. Some days for eight.

I’m not just a writer during those hours. **I’m a writer 24/7.** When I’m not writing, I spend most of my time thinking about writing or what to write about.

When I see text, I see opportunity. Each word is a way to improve, each line a chance to level up. I’m always focused, yet always open to new ideas.

That’s the kind of life I love to live — and it feels just like a game of Tetris.

# The Minimalist Guide to Fitness

## The Minimalist Guide to Fitness

Minimalism is all the rage right now. Not that any one of us can pinpoint exactly what it is.

So let’s start with a definition shall we?
> Minimalism seeks to utilize the simplest and fewest elements to create the maximum effect.

Originally part of the art and design world, minimalism has become a movement and a lifestyle, transcending into all areas of life.

So what about fitness? How do you get the maximum effect with the fewest and simplest elements?

## **Option 1 — Throw out the equipment**

You don’t need one single piece of equipment to get into the best shape of your life.

All you need is your body and a willingness to push it in new directions.

This option is perfect if you can’t get to the gym, either because of time constraints or finances. And hey, no equipment, so no cost.

And trust me, you will get results and you will be amazed at just how challenging bodyweight movements can be.

A great resource of bodyweight movements is the **Convict Conditioning **program. Check out their **Youtube channel **to find tons of movements, from beginners to the more advanced.

## **Option 2 — Pick one piece of equipment and do compound movements**

Pick one piece of equipment, and let me just say, this should be a barbell or dumbbell. The heavier the better.

Now create a full body workout plan with one hinge movement, one hip flexion movement, one pull movement, and one push movement. Yep, four movements can be a full workout.

So what do I mean by hinge, flexion, push, and pull?

Hinge movements include deadlifts, rack pulls, Romanian deadlifts, and kettlebell swings.

Hip flexion movements are movements like squats, lunges, and step-ups.

When you think push and pull, think push-ups, bench presses, pull-ups, and dumbbell rows.

So, with these options, let’s say you picked a kettlebell as your one piece of equipment (which, FYI, is a great choice) your workout could look something like this:

* 15-20 **Kettlebell Swings **(move directly into)

* 10 **Goblet Squats **(move directly into)

* 10 **Renegade Rows **with push-ups

* Repeat x3 with 30-60 seconds rest between each set

And there you have it, a minimalist guide to fitness. It’s so minimalist that it only requires two options. Either of which will get you on the road to your best body.

# Why Aliens are our only salvation?

## Why Aliens are our only salvation?

### The hope of a hopeless person

We are on the verge of another war. A big one. Its hard to believe that the human race still “resolve” international issues like jealous kids. And when I say that, I don’t mean to put my self in a position of a pacifist well understanding person. I’m just very ashamed to leave on this planet.

![](0*u61cVjSoW_tO_bWB.gif)

And to be honest, I don’t believe that our society will ever learn how to coexist.

I’m a pessimist in that way because I lost my hope in ourselves. But I never stop thinking about how we could achieve a state of plenitude where stupid decisions, like bombing another country, don’t exist.

For me, the only salvation for the human race is to receive a visit of a superior race that will arrive and say **“WHAT A FUCK IS GOING ON HERE? SERIOUSLY!”.**

I’m optimistic in that way!

They will come and say **“step up, let us show how to not do shit with your own life and your home planet”.**

![](0*4W2JuzLIdHPccr9p.jpeg)

You may think that I’m very naive to hope for something like this but just take a look around… almost everything you see is wrong, isn’t it?

Maybe I’m very naive, I don’t care. Maybe they can teach us how to be alive and enjoy ourselves. For me its a fact that there are other kinds of life across the universe and this possibility is something that I dream wake every day.

![](0*NN11PztybGN5El6q.gif)

We only live once. It should be different, but we seam to be very far to figure this out.

We need help…

# New Year’s Resolutions That Work

## 

What usually happens to your resolve in the New Year? Does it disappear before the pine needles are even vacuumed? Do you spend more energy on excuses than on execution? Can you even remember your intention by Valentine’s day?

Try something different this year. Take some time to think through your plan before jumping into action. Here are some guidelines that can help.

**Downstream Self**

Imagine a vital, successful, and grateful you five years in the future looking back and beaming with pride at your foresight. What are you grateful for? What seeds that you planted are now flourishing? What are you looking forward to this year? What are you glad you started five years ago?

**Year in Review**

Where have you been over the past year? Look at all aspects of your life–- work, recreation, friends and family, your environment. What made you happy? What successes can you build on? What were the qualities that made them successful?

**Brainstorm**

Now make a list of all the goals you can think of. Remember the rules of brainstorming — all ideas count, repetition is okay, no judgment, repetition is okay, keep going when you come to a lull. You can prime the pump with the old standbys — eat better, get more exercise, floss regularly, then add some wild ones — try skydiving, learn to tap dance. Go for at least 26.

**Who Cares**

Take a look at the list and ask yourself which ones matter and to whom. Is it something you really care about or is there a big should attached to it? Whose voice is telling you it’s important?

**So What**

Now take only the goals you care about and structure them with a “so that” phrase —

I will __________ so that __________.

This is a critical step. It’s the rationale that gives you motivation. I will eat better so that I have more energy. I will eat better so that I don’t have to take blood pressure medication. It also checks the appropriateness of the goal. Will doing this really give me that? I will eat better so that my partner will get off my case.

What is your underlying rationale, and is it the ultimate one? I want to get a new job so that I can make more money? And then so what? I want to make more money so that I can feel good about myself.

If you honestly identify the “so what” you can create goals that accomplish your actual purpose.

**Realistic and Measurable**

It’s a whole lot more inspiring to achieve a goal and set a new one then to fail again because you’ve set the bar too high.

Don’t say you’ll get to the gym every day if you know that’s next to impossible. Start smaller — I’ll get to the gym three times a week for a month. I’ll walk in the door and get a locker. Every day for a month I’ll set aside time to do my daily journaling and I’ll reward myself if I do five days out of seven. Then keep track. Count them. Put a gold star on your calendar. Make a grid and put check marks. At the end of the time period stop and evaluate?

If you’ve set realistic goals and measured them you’ll have a sense of accomplishment and valuable information about how to maintain your success or make any necessary adjustments to your plan.

**Final Thoughts on New Year’s Resolutions**

Don’t just put another paving stone on that road to hell. Turn those good intentions into accomplishments in the new year. On behalf of your downstream self we thank you.

# Why We’re Horrible at Achieving Goals (And What to Do About It)

## 

We’re naturally wired to set horrible goals. We usually think in terms of results, outcomes, and what we want to get at the end. For example:

* $100k in my bank account by the end of the year

* Lose 20 pounds in the next 90 days

* Find my soulmate this year

These are the types of goals that I see my clients set all the time. And yes, they are specific, measurable, time-bound, etc. All in all, they seem to be very reasonable goals to set on a first glance.

Yet the vast majority fail miserably. Just look at the success rate of new year resolutions. Why?

While these really are the results that we want in the end, we’re not in control of those results. We can’t influence the results directly, only through indirect action.

E.g. we can’t directly create a $100k in cash. We can’t directly manifest our soulmate and make them fall in love with us. We can’t directly remove the fat from our body (yes there are shortcuts, but I’m talking about the long-term sustainable results here, not liposuction or get rich quick schemes.)

So, if setting goals that are end results doesn’t work, what does?

## Action Oriented Goals

What does work is to set goals that we are directly in control of? Goals that will likely lead to the end result that we want (lose 20 pounds), but we’re able to achieve them with direct action. For example:

* Instead of “$100k in my bank account” make it “invest 90 minutes every morning working on my side business”

* Instead of “lose 20 pounds” make it “cut out all processed sugars out of my diet in the next 90 days”

* Instead of “find my soulmate” make it “go out and meet 10 potential partners every month”

So now, instead of hoping that the universe will bring you that end result, you can start working on it directly.

## Measuring the Progress

Once you start setting action-oriented goals that you’re directly in control of then measuring how you’re doing makes much more sense.

Using any [habit/goal tracker](https://www.coach.me/?ref=42mYk) (or a [simple spreadsheet](https://goo.gl/yOsTLc)) you can track your daily and weekly actions. You can see if you’re doing better or worse with your task. You can see where your strong points are and where you need more work.

Compare that to measuring just the end goal, e.g. the money. You can measure the increase or decrease of money in your bank account month to month, but so what? You don’t directly control how much people pay you.

## Calibration

Since we don’t control the end result, we can only make an educated guess as to what is going to produce it. Even if we achieve the action-oriented goal a 100% (we completely change our diet for example) we still don’t have any guarantee that it will result in weight loss.

That’s why we have to constantly track our actions and see if they lead us to the end result. We have to calibrate our approach and strategy until we figure out what type of actions lead to what we want in the end.

* If that type of business doesn’t generate the money you want, change your approach. Try something else.

* If reducing the processed sugar doesn’t help to lose fat, try a different diet or exercise.

* If the people you meet are far away from what you’re looking for in a partner, change your environment or approach.

Testing and trying different strategies is what learning is all about. Only after getting the feedback we can learn what works and what doesn’t. Until then, it’s just a guess.

Using this approach, it’s just a matter of time until you find what types of action and strategy lead you to the end result. You just have to keep calibrating, keep cutting what doesn’t work and do more of what does.

## Strategy

For easy outcomes, like learn how to ride a bike, one or two action-oriented goals might be enough — e.g. practice riding the bike for 30 minutes every day.

But for more complicated long-term results, we need to orchestrate many different changes and actions to produce the result. Planning all these actions is your strategy to get to the end goal.

Let’s take the fat loss goal for example and create an example strategy.

Knowing about measuring and calibration, we can predict that the first thing that we try is probably not going to work. That’s why we need to plan for failure and create a strategy with a few action-oriented goals to test, in order to increase our chances to get to the end result.

Another helpful thing when creating your strategy is to plan different “paths” to your end result and separate them into different groups. For fat loss, two example paths are Diet Change and Exercise.

### Diet Change

* Cut all processed carbs (table sugar, pasta, flour)

* Stop drinking soda

* Go vegan for 30 days

### Exercise

* 30 minutes of cardio every day

* Strength training 4 days/week

* CrossFit session 3 days/week

See how all the goals here are action oriented? You can control all of them directly. Of course, those are just different options, you don’t have to try them all at once, in fact, it’s better not to.

If you try it all simultaneously, first it’s going to be very difficult to make that huge change. Second, even if it works, you don’t know which actions produced the desired results because there are so many variables. If you pick one and try it for 30 days though, you have only one variable and you can be sure that it’s working or not.

So to sum it all up in 3 simple steps:

1. Set goals that are action-oriented and will likely produce the end result that you want.

1. Track your actions every day and see how well you’re doing with the goal that you set.

1. If you’re doing well with your actions but it’s not producing the end result that you want, change your approach and calibrate.

# El trabajo dignifica, pero no a todos

## El trabajo dignifica, pero no a todos

En días pasados, me hice a la tarea de lavar mi vehículo, ya que dejarlo sucio sería fomentar la contaminación visual, aclarando que -entre tantas lluvias y polvo- dejó de ser blanco y pasó a ser gris.

Al salir del establecimiento donde me lo lavan bastante bien, no pasaron más de cinco minutos antes de que un joven -limpia vidrios- se me acercara y al yo decirle que NO, me aventó la esponja que logró llenar todo el vidrio de espuma y agua.

Al seguir diciéndole que NO, el joven de aproximadamente 18 años, se ofendió y me recordó -de una forma no muy bonita- a todos mis antepasados, enfocándose en mi madre.

Este suceso no es la primera vez que me pasa… De hecho, me pasa MUY frecuentemente, en cada semáforo, a cualquier hora del día.

Es más, esto no es algo solamente de la República Dominicana; Esto es algo de gran parte de América Latina y -cada vez con más frecuencia- de los Estados Unidos y de Europa.

Es MUY triste salir a la calle y ver a niños, ancianos y minusválidos pidiendo dinero. Me parte el alma, sobre todo por darme cuenta de que hay mafias que usan a los niños para ganar dinero y porque vivimos en un sistema en donde hay poco espacio para ancianos o para personas con alguna discapacidad ya sea física o mental.

¡Pero!

¿Qué pasa con aquellos adolecentes que en lugar de buscar un trabajo, recurren a querer violentar a quienes transitamos por las calles de la ciudad?

Sé que la situación económica esta MUY difícil.

Sé que las oportunidades son escazas.

Sé que muchos de esos muchachos -como consecuencia de adicción a las drogas- buscan dinero fácil y de forma rápida, para poder satisfacer sus necesidades.

Conozco y entiendo TODAS las razones por las cuales hay un grupo de jóvenes dedicados a limpiar vidrios en la calle, pero jamás comprenderé que alguien quiera ganarse el dinero sorprendiendo e insultando.

Todos los días veo a muchachos vendiendo fruta en la calle en condiciones limitadas.

De igual forma, todos los días veo a jóvenes vendiendo periódicos, accesorios para celulares, dulces y demás productos.

Es más, todos los días veo a jóvenes limpia vidrios que preguntan y al recibir una negativa, continúan su búsqueda de alguna persona que requiera que le limpien el vidrio.

A quienes hacen todo eso para subsistir, les doy un fuerte aplauso, ya que ellos me demuestran que trabajar dignifica… pero solo quienes lo hacen de forma honesta, respetuosa y sin buscar el dinero fácil y a como de lugar.

Todos los días veo jóvenes que hacen lo que pueden para llevar dinero a casa y ayudar a su familia.

Todos los días veo jóvenes que estudian por la mañana y trabajan por la tarde, o viceversa.

Todos los días veo jóvenes con hambre, pero que no se rinden ante las adversidades.

Y -tristemente- todos los días veo a jóvenes que “se la buscan” queriendo saltarse las regalas de la sociedad y -peor aún- que ofenden a quien les decimos “NO”.

Y -aún más triste- MUY frecuentemente veo a personas de nivel “profesional” que “se la buscan” evadiendo impuestos, sin darle a sus trabajadores los derechos que se merecen y lo que la ley les otorga.

Estos últimos son los peores, ya que se esconden detrás de un negocio o de cierto poder para hacer el mal y aprovecharse de los “débiles”.

Definitivamente, ellos –aunque trabajen las 24 horas del día, los 365 días del año- jamás serán personas dignas, por lo que cierro este artículo de la misma forma en como comenzó: EL TRABAJO DIGNIFICA, PERO NO A TODOS.

# 2 Foundational Principles of Personal Productivity, and How to Follow Them

## 2 Foundational Principles of Personal Productivity, and How to Follow Them

### It is simpler than it seems to do well and feel happy, you just have to go back to the basics.

About a year ago, I was traveling with the president of the company I work for. We had met with some high-level personnel at a large customer to finish negotiating a large contract. The day wrapped up, and we found ourselves in a corner booth at a fairly nice restaurant. The server brought us our drinks, and we toasted the closing of the deal. I decided to take the opportunity to extract some sage advice from someone that, to me, seemed to have it all together. So I asked him, point blank:

“What do you think is the key to success?”

He paused and looked down at his glass of wine, allowing a faint, but unmistakable grin to dance across his face. Then he looked up at me, and in the most sincere and assured manner in which I’ve ever seen anyone say anything, he said the following:
> # There are only 2 things you need to do in order to do well in life:
> # - Honor every commitment you make — big or small
> # - Keep your commitments to a minimum

Be absolutely obsessive about those two things, and all else will follow.

This seemed too simple to me. But the more I wade through this life — with obligations to my customers, co-workers, family, and friends — the more I tend to agree with it.

What I have found is that when I feel the best about how I am doing — when I feel most productive — it is because I am confident in my relationships. Those relationships are the ones I have with all of the people in my professional and personal life — including the relationship I have with myself. When the things I am doing are helping to keep the commitments I’ve made to myself and others — even when I don’t get a ton of stuff done — I still feel like I’m doing well. ***I think we underestimate just how much productivity has to do with feeling good about what your’e doing, rather than meeting metrics.***

Doing well really does boil down to these two things. Following them is *simple*, but not at all *easy*. The urge to do #1 can get confused with the urge to say “yes” to a bunch of things — meaning you abandon #2.

You may feel the urge to make people happy, or to help them out, and you should — it is good to help others. However, if you can’t keep the commitment, or if you have to break another commitment in order to keep another, then you’re not really helping much at all.

## Honor Every Commitment

Honor every commitment you make — big or small. This does two things to make you a more responsible and effective person. First, it builds credibility and trust — as a colleague, a friend, a spouse, and whatever else your roles may be. Secondly, it alleviates a lot of emotional and cognitive dissonance, both within yourself, and within your relationships.

Stephen Covey, in his classic book [*The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519)* uses the metaphor of an emotional bank account that is shared by you and anyone you interact with regularly. When you honor a commitment, you make a deposit in that account. When you break a commitment — no matter how small — you make a withdrawal from that account. I have found that often times, the withdrawals from breaking commitments — regardless of how small the commitment seems — are quite large. Unfortunately, the deposits made by keeping subsequent commitments are much smaller in comparison to the withdrawals.

Keeping commitments, big and small, goes beyond commitments to other people. Plenty of people sacrifice their time, resources, and ambitions for the sake of others. This is good, but it can become harmful when you keep those commitments at the cost of another important kind of commitment: **the commitments you make to yourself.**

When you tell yourself you’re going to do something, but then push it aside in favor of other things, you damage your trust in yourself. Yes, you read that correctly; you do have a relationship of trust *with yourself*.

Effective people are effective in large part because they trust that what they set out to do will get done. They believe *in* themselves because they believe themselves. But when you procrastinate — when you keep failing to do what you told yourself you would do — that trust dissolves. It makes it that much more difficult to motivate yourself to meet deadlines you set for yourself when you haven’t been doing it so far. You intuitively sense that you cannot trust yourself, based on your track record of broken commitments.

## Keep Your Commitments to a Minimum

Breaking commitments causes damage to relationships and reputations. Knowing that you will have to break a commitment causes anxiety about that inevitable damage — for both you and the other party. So the best way to prevent that anxiety and damage is to spend time on number 2: minimizing commitments.

The thing is, the work of keeping commitments takes time — *often more time than we initially think*. It also takes up attention, again, often more than we initially think. Both of those things — time and attention — are finite resources. We should *never* give them up freely to just anyone who demands them.
> # Remember: unlike money, you cannot earn more time or attention, so guard them more carefully than you do your money.

This is not to say that you should try to do the fewest things possible, be a flake, and be lazy. In fact, quite the contrary. When you commit to some outcome, you should do all that you can to ensure you bring it about. You should strive to go above and beyond what you promised. Surprise, dazzle, and delight others with what you do. But doing so is only possible *if you carefully guard your commitments*. Having fewer commitments means you have more time and attention to devote to the things you have chosen to do.

Ultimately, this second principle is about maximizing through minimizing — maximizing the *value* of your commitments comes as a result of minimizing the *quantity* of them. This makes perfect sense if you think about it.

Usually, taking on a lot of projects means being tasked with unchallenging and non-value-add work in some portion of those projects. If you get really serious about keeping every commitment, your natural tendency will be to seek out commitments to things that you feel provide a good return on the investment of your time and attention.

Moreover, minimizing your commitments also does another thing to help add to the value you bring to yourself and others: **it makes you more agile**. Agility here is your ability to spontaneously help someone with something — even without being asked. Aside from helping you to be a better person, it also helps you by solidifying your relationships with those around you. As if that weren’t enough, being agile allows you to explore new and interesting opportunities — which is key for personal growth.

One simple way to think about it is this:
> # Essentially, you are your commitments, so just how many things are you trying to be?

Try to be too many things to too many people, and you fall short on most of them. If you really focus on doing a few things *consistently *well for the people in your life, and you will bring real value to those relationships. That value is at the heart of a truly productive life.

## The Action Item: Keep a Commitment Ledger

Now for the takeaway: ***keep a commitment ledger***. It is a simple record of the following:

* what you have committed to

* to whom you’ve committed, and

* when you’ve committed to doing it

If you’re reading this, you probably have a “ to do” list — a list of things that itemize just how busy and stretched thin you are. But how many of those “to dos” represent *actual commitments*? How many do you think you’ll be able to keep? Do you look at your list in this way?

You may not even know: and that is part of the problem.

In order to understand the value or priority of any action or project, you need to be able to understand its underlying commitments — which means understanding to whom you have committed. Projects and actions are things, and they lack value without connection to relationships in your life — whether with other people, or with yourself.

Keeping a commitment ledger is simple. If you have a to-do list or a project register, this ledger can be embedded there. Any time you tell someone that you are going to do something, tag it with something that lets you know that you’ve committed to it. If a date was promised, write that in with it.

An even *more* reliable approach would be for any commitment with a date attached, put that on your calendar as an “all-day” event. I use both Microsoft Outlook and the iCloud calendar. As an added jab to yourself, being each entry on the ledger with (in all caps) “PROMISED:”. It works like a charm. This way when you look at your stuff on tap for the day, the very top of the calendar day will say “PROMISED: email report to Jeff” — or whatever. It’s tough to ignore that. This practice also helps to separate the true commitments I have from other stuff that just needs to be done *at some time.*

Wherever you put them, look at those commitments every day — first thing, if possible — and direct most of your energy toward them. Direct any remaining energy and attention toward making sure you don’t take on any more commitments than you can handle. This is difficult, but doable — if done in the right way.

For any commitments you know you can’t meet, re-negotiate them as soon as possible, and be gracious about it with the person. After all, you made them a promise, so make sure they understand that you are doing this as soon as you could have. The amount of respect that this will earn you (in *most* cases) is valuable enough to pay for any extra time you spend managing your commitment ledger.

In the end, we are only as good a person as the commitments we keep. So if you want to be the best person you can, guard your commitments like you guard priceless heirlooms. They are among the most valuable things on which you can spend your time and attention.

# Are You Considering Intermittent Fasting?

## A lot of our readers have been expressing an interest in what’s called intermittent fasting.

There are two common forms of fasting. One, called 5:2, has you eat normally five days of the week and then fast for two more. The other, 16:8, has you restrict your daily eating to an 8 hour window (with the other 16 hours considered your fast).

I’ve been reaching out to experts and hard-core self-experimenters in order to gather as much information as possible for you. If you are interested in trying fasting — then we have all the information you need below.

## Does Fasting Work?

For some reason, I always want to hear from real people first. Real people have practical wisdom that often matters the most. (Both of these articles were written for Medium’s Membership program):

* [Dave Wentworth](https://twitter.com/davewent) gives us [How I Lost 50 Pounds on a 5:2 Fast (And Kept It Off)](https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-anti-diet-that-changed-my-life-forever-d4b0923aba0d). That article isn’t just a brag — Dave has tons of practical advice.

* [Mark Moschel](https://twitter.com/MarkMoschel) [tracked his energy levels while he fasted](https://betterhumans.coach.me/fasting-and-ketones-data-from-3-days-with-no-food-only-wine-a327c329ae3f). This was a big fear of mine — fasting might work, but it would destroy my productivity. Mark found that his energy levels actually went up as he got deeper into his fast.

## What do the experts say?

We’ve been bringing in more world-class experts to write for Better Humans. For the topic of Fasting, [Dr. Jason Fung](https://twitter.com/drjasonfung) contributed four articles.

* [The Science of Why Caloric Restriction Fails](https://betterhumans.coach.me/why-caloric-restriction-fails-9dc18fe9cf23). The reason is that your resting metabolic rate drops. Important to note that fasting is different than calorie counting.

* [Why Fasting Succeeds Where Caloric Restriction Fails](https://betterhumans.coach.me/why-caloric-restriction-fails-part-2-ec0c0c337649). This is the article where fasting actually clicked for me. Losing weight means burning fat. That only happens when you’re fasting.

* [What is the Difference Between Fasting and Caloric Restriction?](https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-difference-between-fasting-and-caloric-restriction-f93bb44a0534) More science. Dr. Fung is so good at covering the scientific research behind every single aspect and concern.

* [How to Conquer Food Cravings](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-conquer-food-cravings-a3782bcb99c). Hint: fasting helps. Sugar doesn’t.

If you use this information to try fasting, please share your experience in the responses below.

And if you want us to do more research on fasting, let us know that too.

In service,

# The Camel and the Straw

## Photography by David Yarde (http://davidyarde.com/photography/)

We’re all familiar with the story of how the camel was loaded with supplies and other necessary traveling equipment, but it wasn’t until a simple piece of straw landed on top did every go awry.

Emotionally, mentally, physically and spiritually we are much like that camel. We’re burdened with so many things and no matter how much we try to get ahead, there’s always that one little thing that just brings everything down.

Some will say that it’s up to us as individuals to choose how we feel it respond to things, but that can be especially difficult when it feels as if you’re on an island that is shrinking out in the middle of the ocean with no one around. It can become a battle against one’s self that will often lead down some interesting paths.

Many like myself will simply internalize it, hoping the events will simply be forgotten by my mind and when that doesn’t resolve things, jumping into work usually does because in that moment the only thing we’ve tied our self-worth to is how well we can be at our jobs.

## Finding your true value

![Photography by David Yarde ([http://davidyarde.com/photography/](http://davidyarde.com/photography/))](1*Dvqv9dY9Kx5pMFuS12Px3w.jpeg)*Photography by David Yarde ([http://davidyarde.com/photography/](http://davidyarde.com/photography/))*

No matter how well we are ranked on annual reviews or the lack thereof, at the end of it all, we aren’t our job titles.

Now there isn’t anything wrong with a job you clock in, work on a bunch of tasks, attend ego filled meetings and then rush home. ***There is something wrong when we feel as if this is how life should be.***

We each have the power to do so much towards making our environments better places, yet all we seem to find comfort in doing is trying to climb the totem pole of fame and fortune. Day in and out, we repeat the same routines and asking the same questions. Neglecting to see that most times we already have the answer.

Many of us lock away talents and skills that can brighten their part of the world, due to fear, procrastination and allowing others to make them believe whatever they do will fail, causing them to live life looking back with regret.

Truth is, not everyone will be as supportive as they swear they’ll be, especially when things aren’t always immediately benefiting them. The thing is, you only owe it to yourself to keep pushing forward. Otherwise, you will only be known for giving up.

**You aren’t your job, degree, or whatever position in life you currently hold.** Those things are only but a result of what you’ve done or can do.

It may be hard to do with everything that is going on in life but never forget who you are beneath it all.

## The silver lining

Bad things happen. It doesn’t matter who you are or what you do. In most cases there is a silver lining that tends to get overlooked.

Recently, I had the luck to experience a flat tire. I couldn’t help but get upset in the moment. A myriad of questions ran through my mind. I wanted to understand why it have to happen at that moment, why did it happen when my entire family was with me, why was it so hot.

The noise from the questions kept growing louder and my frustration with my lack of ability to unscrew the bolts on wheel did too.

I was so caught up in feeling like everything was bad and trying desperately to get the bolts loose that I didn’t even notice a truck pull up behind me.

Need a hand? Was what pierced through the noise. Within minutes my roadblock was cleared, I couldn’t stop saying thank you to this stranger that stopped to help. The whole experience was over so quickly that I didn’t even get a chance to get his name.

As the rest of my day continued, I couldn’t help but think about how much I have to be thankful for. That moment was necessary for helping me redirect my focus to what was truly important.

**Simply because bad things happen doesn’t mean you get to think your life is all bad.** Taking time to slow down can actually help you speed things up. In each experience, the thing that matters most is how we respond to it.

Whenever I come across one of these unexpected treasures, my mind usually yells out PLOT TWIST. I tend to find hope and a renewed sense of strength to carry on by allowing myself to take a moment and appreciate the fact that I’m even able to go through whatever the experience is, that no matter how bad the current experience may be, I have a whole lot more to be thankful for.

It can be tough to be happy in the midst of a storm but imagine just how much stronger you’ll be once you get through it.

## The phoenix in each of us

We all fight our own unique battles. Each one challenging us to become better, to be stronger.

Yet, even with the best outlook towards things, there are times when things will still fall apart. These things can come in the form of depression, discouragement from others, or even self-doubt.

What we don’t see is the fire burning inside, the one that drives us onward and upward no matter how tough the path may be. Our will to succeed, to improve the world around us and to stand for what’s right.

It’s the fire that rebuilds and rises from the ashes of the pain, disappointment, betrayal and empty promises and guides us to discovering our creative power and the limitless possibilities for creating more good that this discovery brings to our lives.

Sure, you may not currently be in the ideal place in life you’d be, but you are exactly where your story needs to be and it’s a place you won’t always be unless you choose to not continue moving forward.

The straw may have broken you yesterday but only to allow you to be even stronger today.

# How to be a pro-athlete with your feelings

## 

The idea of ‘Emotional intelligence’ and ‘Emotional resilience’ have been hot topics lately. Studies show that those who are emotionally ’smart’, are headhunted for jobs, great in relationships and more apt at handling life’s curve-balls. So, what exactly does it mean?

### **The Art of Emotional Mastery**

There is a lot more to harnessing your feelings than simply controlling them; the actress can shed a tear on cue; the interrogator can read the anger of his suspect and the negotiator can hide his fear behind a poker-face. These are three very distinct emotional skills, which, when used appropriately, open up three very different worlds of opportunity.

![There’s more to emotions than crying.](1*4TVIGmT2UQ0ZfbeOCnDMNg.gif)*There’s more to emotions than crying.*

Emotional mastery, then, is not a singular ability, it’s a complex art.

### **Training Your Feelings**

It is helpful to think about your feelings in the same way as you do about physical sport: The gymnast, the weight-lifter and swimmer, may all be athletic, but each of them has a *unique combination of skills* to win at their game.
Becoming a pro-athlete with your feelings is not much different: Depending on your temperament, your career and relationships, you need to develop your emotional athleticism in a specific way:

*The Working Mother*
You rush through the front-door at the end of the day, your head still juggling figures for tomorrow’s deadline, the cellphone pinched in your neck, and grocery-bags dangling in your hand. As you lift your head, you see your seven-year-old, crouched on the step, glaring up at you through his teary, puppy-dog eyes.

This is the moment where two worlds collide: Your son is obviously in need of a mother. Whatever the reason; comfort and emotional support are highest on his priority list. However, your mental space is just not quite in the right gear to meet him there. You love him enough to risk your life, but making the switch from the multitasking, career-driven head-space to the warm, loving arms of ‘mommy’, requires more than love:

**It requires skill.**

*The Businessman*
 “Three million?” as the client says these words, you feel cold chills running down your back. Now is not the time. You knew they had a budget, but this is way above your expectations. His eyes look across the table in a confused expression. His pen hangs 11 millimeters above the paper. When that signature is made, the deal is sealed.
 “Mister Johnson, are you okay?”

If they see how nervous you are now, they could reconsider. You could pass up the biggest break of your career. Hiding your nerves in this situation, is not a nice-to-have:

**It’s a deal-breaker.**

![](1*UCttLdk-yuRlECICdY4iEw.gif)

*The Lover*
 “I just can’t take it anymore! What do you actually feel?! Do you even care what just happened?!”
She runs off, and slams the door behind her. You are left in the cold. You know that you must’ve said something wrong. You thought it was a lovely restaurant, and you both had a great time. But, by the time you got to the car, you realised that your girl hasn’t said anything since you ordered the dessert. When you think back, you realise she was awfully quiet in the car as well, but it didn’t bother you at the time — you were just zoning out, thinking about…well, nothing, really.

And then, suddenly, she snaps. You missed a whole chapter. You didn’t pick up the cues, and you have no idea where you went wrong. Reading her emotions won’t just make you a better lover:

**It can save your relationship.**

### **Training For the Game of Life**

The skills you need to be a good athlete, are unique to each sport, but they can be trained individually. Skills such as:

* strength

* agility

* co-ordination

* balance

* endurance

* fitness

Emotional athleticism is not much different. Skills that make up the pro’s in this game, could include:

* articulation

* observation

* strength

* sensitivity

* expression

* empathy

* control

* flexibility

So, in order to train yourself for the game of life, it helps to know exactly what kind of emotional skills you are training for.

### Two skills to try:

*1 Articulation:*
Set your timer for 1 minute, and write down as many emotions as you can. No cheating!
How many words did you get? Depending on your personality, linguistic skill and even your gender, you could have anything between 4 and 40 words.
The higher you score, the more emotionally articulate you are. This skill is extremely helpful when trying to express how you feel, and people with this ability are usually more apt at having a civil argument.
Those with fewer words in their vocabulary, tend to snap more easily, since they can’t adequately express themselves.

*2. Observation:
*To improve your emotional observation skills, you can try the following exercise:
Switch on a series or movie that you haven’t watched before, and pay only attention to the different emotions you can see. A drama, with many close-ups of the faces is often a good choice, as the emotions are more subtle. Pay attention not just to what emotion you see, but *why* you think the actor is feeling that way. Is it in the raise of an eyebrow, the twitch of a lip, or a subtle shift in the eye-lid? This exercise can also be tried in public- just be careful of staring at strangers!

The art of spotting subtle expressions can save you from MANY arguments in a relationship. By simply noticing, and giving your partner feedback on the emotions you see, you show them you care, and that you *see *them.

# Relation In Space&#58; The Artist Is Present.

## Relation In Space: The Artist Is Present.

### Heartbreak is Mandatory

![](0*zolRbdzhG_4Hi3pH.jpeg)

## **Repeat after me: “Living like Marina’s first performance…”**

## Each new day is your first new performance.

Heartbreak is mandatory; you simply must have your hopes and heart broken (by people, places, things, yourself). This happens anyhow—but each and every time, this needs to happen—

Not just once. Repeatedly.

Breaking “patterns” is a myth. Patterns will repeat, and need to repeat by necessity. Everything is a message.

Letdowns, disappointments, hurdles and betrayals are not just the stuff of reality TV or soap operas.

This is the stuff of marrow. Substance.

You.

Nothing makes you feel more present, more *immediacy-immediately*, than a surface wound, or deeper.

Presence.

Change forces you to effect momentum.

Wounding forces immediate change.

You are forced to mitigate, mediate, make it to the next moment.

You are forced to decide.

Move.

You are forced to effect momentum, even if that decision’s just to keep breathing through the nanoseconds or to let your bodysoul tell you what you’re supposed to do.

Next.

You get “hurt,” and you are forced to effect momentum.

Without momentum, your soul dies.

If you’re alive and your soul’s dead, you’re a zombie.

Being zombified? Cool in theory, hell in practice.

Live the moments of your life like Marina Abramović’s art installations.

Marina does not rehearse.

She does indeed prepare, but she does not rehearse.

She has her basic vision, then she just shows up.

No rehearsal… just performance and endurance.

You show up at the exhibit for the duration. You endure.Joy may show up, and pain may show up. Everything is relevant.

When it’s done, you call it Good, Right & Perfect.

Then you move on.

The exhibit might repeat in a new city, time, place or space.

Or, it might not.

Then you move on, and it begins again.

Or it might not.

Namaste,

Jianda

# How to Put Pen to Paper and Get Things Done

## These journaling and self-awareness techniques give you instant clarity on goals and how you’re spending your time

Writing things down, sketching them out, and getting them out of your head and onto paper can be immensely helpful — especially if you need to clarify your goals, set priorities, or learn how to manage your time so you can meet the goals you do set.

For this weekend, we have three journaling and charting articles that show you exactly which steps to take for an organized approach to getting the clarity you need. The good news: you can do these electronically, too. But we find it very satisfying — and enjoyable! — to pull out the paper and pens and get to work.

*PSSST — Quick note before we get to the articles. Have you become an expert on some behavior change by doing it yourself? Are you a self-experimenter or the inventor of a kick-ass productivity technique? If so, maybe you should [write for Better Humans](https://betterhumans.coach.me/write-for-better-humans-4c6c9884fc08)! We pay $500 for great articles from authors who know how to write an empathic tutorial. [Get more details about what we’re looking for here](https://betterhumans.coach.me/write-for-better-humans-4c6c9884fc08)!*

### How to create your own habit dashboard that motivates you to stick to any habit

Highly successful people share one common trait that might, at first, surprise you: consistency. Particularly, consistency in taking regular, small actions that, with time, get them to their goals. Consistency has always been a challenge for me. Despite defining clear goals for myself, I have always struggled to create the habits that would lead me to fulfill them. Ultimately, I created a new journaling habit designed specifically to support my consistency in working on new habits. In this article, I’ll show you how you can use this same approach to work on your own goals.

# 30 days of mindfulness

## Imagine a guy sitting on a chair with his eyes closed, EEG on his head, heart rate monitor on his chest, an activity tracker on his wrist and headphones in his ears.

That’s me meditating…

The idea is simple — to see what is happening, what is changing and how. Every single day I measure my sleep, steps taken, distance, heart rate, workouts, medicines, supplements, mood, brainwaves and few other things.

First of all — [after first 10 free days of Headspace Take10 I could notice improvements in Lumosity brain training app](https://medium.com/better-humans/so-does-meditation-really-work-3e3ef6f380f5). What I can say after 30 days of doing it? My heart rate variability is getting better, my resting heart rate lowered to below 60 and thanks to my EEG now I can see that after 20 days I am able to stay calm longer.

What’s next? I want to be able to control my brainwaves (like increasing Theta and Alpha while lowering others etc). Comparing my brainwaves while doing some simple task after a coffee, beer or bulletproof coffee would be cool too.

I am also keeping my Headspace every single day. Sometimes it’s not easy to find some time but it’s definitely doable.

# This is How to Stop Sucking at Your Habits

## This is How to Stop Sucking at Your Habits

In 1995, film studio Pixar released Toy Story — the first-ever computer-animated feature film.

Since then, the studio has produced 16 more movies, including titles like A Bug’s Life, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, and WALL-E.

This list of blockbusters has earned Pixar sixteen Academy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, eleven Grammy Awards and a bunch of other awards and acknowledgments (1).

There is a lot we can learn from how they go about creating their exceptional movies.

### From Suck to Unsuck

It’s tempting to think brilliant companies like Pixar always know exactly what to do next.

Presumably, their workflow looks something like this:

1. One of their genius employees comes up with a brilliant idea.

1. The genius employee explains the brilliant idea to the rest of the uber-talented team.

1. The uber-talented team executes flawlessly to turn the genius employee’s brilliant idea into an amazing blockbuster movie.

But in reality, that’s not at all how it works.

The truth is that each of Pixar’s movies goes through a process of relentless iteration before it’s finished.

Sure, an initial idea gets the project moving, but it will change many times before the film is released.

In fact, Pixar* assumes* that the first versions of their movies are going to suck.

And as a result, they are willing to tweak everything about it until it doesn’t anymore.

Their process is all about **going from suck to unsuck (2).**

### A Mountain of Storyboards

For each movie that they create, Pixar uses thousands of ‘storyboards.’

These are hand-drawn comic book versions of the film that contains ideas for the characters and actions they take in each scene.

The people working on the project come up with a huge number of these ideas, most of which are never used in the final product.

And the number of storyboards they use increases for each successful movie they release. So far, they’ve created:

* 27,565 storyboards for A Bug’s Life

* 43,536 for Finding Nemo

* 69,562 for Ratatouille

* 98,173 for WALL-E.

Clearly, Pixar has no intention of slowing down their iterations.

And neither should you.

### How Good Intentions Fizzle Out

We all seem to have this tendency to think that somehow our new habit will work out pretty much exactly they way we imagine.

If we just come up with a solid enough plan, we should be able to follow through without major problems.

And that might be the case for a week or two. But then it turns out that our plan has a hole or two (or a hundred).

Perhaps we notice that we don’t have enough energy to show up at the gym after work consistently. Or that the book we planned to read is boring. Or that there just isn’t enough time to prepare the healthy food we’ve been planning.

And so our good intentions fizzle out, and we quit.

### Always Be Creating Storyboards

If you can relate to this, the problem isn’t that you’re lazy or lack [willpower](http://www.selfication.com/the-science-of-willpower/).

The problem is that **you rely too much on the first version of your plan**.

You heavily overestimate your ability to predict every obstacle that will show up in your way.

As a result, each time your run into a setback, you’ll perceive it as a failure and get discouraged.

And here’s why Pixar’s approach is so powerful.

Instead of thinking of your first plan as your definitive strategy, it becomes your first [shitty first draft](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-overcome-perfection/).

You’ll work under the assumption that it’s going to have plenty of holes.

And this approach allows you to face setbacks without getting discouraged.

You know that your plan is a work in progress so every time you run into an obstacle, you simply create a new ‘storyboard.’

### How to Stop Sucking At Your Habits

If you struggle with creating and sustaining healthy habits, you need to [change your mindset](http://www.selfication.com/the-tortoise-mindset/) about it.

Just because you’ve failed a lot in the past, that doesn’t mean you’re a fail*ure*. It just means you’ve created a lot of storyboards.

And that’s a good thing because it means you have a lot of insights into what haven’t worked in the past.

Now all you have to do is create a new storyboard and try again. If that doesn’t work, you create a new one and try again. And again. And again.

Constantly refine your habit by using strategies like [creating a trigger](http://www.selfication.com/achieve-your-goals/), [rewarding small wins](http://www.selfication.com/the-power-of-small-wins/), [raising the stakes](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-stick-to-your-goals/), [shaping your environment](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-change-your-habits/), and [using accountability](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-use-accountability/).

[Conduct a weekly review](http://www.selfication.com/weekly-planning/) to [track your progress and readjust your approach](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-reach-your-goals/).

### Build Your Own Mountain of Storyboards

Pixar was willing to make 98,173 storyboards to create WALL-E. And they’ll continue to make even more for their future films.

They don’t waste their time worrying about setbacks. And neither should you.

The question isn’t if you have what it takes.

The question is **how many storyboards are you willing to create?**

As long as you do not stop, you are succeeding.

What storyboard will you create next?

# This Is How to Develop Your Brain For Maximum Performance

## This Is How to Develop Your Brain For Maximum Performance

This post was sparked by an observation. [Science is failing to validate brain-training games](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/brain-training-doesn-t-make-you-smarter/). At the same time, [science is making meditation seem like the solution for practically every performance goal](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/feeling-it/201309/20-scientific-reasons-start-meditating-today).

The benefits of meditation range from [pain management](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/04/treating-chronic-pain-with-meditation/284182/), [to overcoming procrastination](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-overcome-procrastination-b8118060298d#.kawo32zci),[ to winning NBA championships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCR7OfRuQd4).

If you’ve lost faith in brain training games, then what do you make of meditation?

Let me frame it for you. There are three approaches to developing brain performance:

1. **Upgrade brain power**. Your brain runs faster, makes more connections, holds more information in working memory.

1. **Remove obstructions**. Put distracting thoughts, interruptions and poor health in the trash bin.

1. **Add skills and strategies**. Your brain works smarter, rather than harder — using tricks, frameworks, and habits to do more with less.

## Meditation is the ultimate brain training game

Here’s why I think brain training games are failing and meditation is succeeding.

Brain training games tackle raw horsepower. That’s their number one goal. This turns out to be the slowest and least useful approach to developing brain performance.

Even meditation, which has been shown to change the structure of your brain, takes a full eight weeks to get started.

Meanwhile, meditation is able to improve your performance within a single sitting through approaches #2 and #3.

Meditation calms your mind and body, helping lower anxiety and reduce distracting thoughts. That anxiety and those distracting thoughts were obstructing your brain’s performance.

In addition, meditation can be used as a skill. I’ve talked about this other places as the [Awareness-Focus Loop](https://betterhumans.coach.me/this-meditation-exercise-builds-mental-muscle-and-cures-procrastination-2f15faade9f3#.2468u8fz6). Becoming aware of your subconscious thoughts and feeling is a skill. Practicing this skill lets your rational brain take control from situations that had been controlled by your subconscious.

All of this is to say that you should drop the idea that upgrading your brain is the same as upgrading your computer. You don’t just add RAM, hard drive storage and swap in a new CPU.

Rather, you should consider upgrading your brain like upgrading the software.

You make your computer reach optimal performance by removing bloated software, adware, and unnecessary background processes.

Then, you make your computer more useful by adding better software.

It’s basically the same with your brain.

So, meditate, obviously. And here are some other ideas broken out by approach.

## Approach #1: Upgrade Brain Power

Skip it. The other two approaches are so much better.

## Approach #2: Remove Obstructions

In addition to meditation, these are the most common strategies letting your brain reach its natural peak state.

* Get enough sleep. [Sleep deprivation reduces working memory by 38% among a host of other cognitive obstructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_sleep_deprivation_on_cognitive_performance#Error_correction).

* Practice single-tasking. Multi-tasking interrupts the neural growth responsible for long-term learning and also prevents you from getting into a flow state.

* Remove interruptions. Turn off your phone, close your email, turn off notifications, close your door.

* Eat healthy. High or low blood sugar both trip up your cognitive processes.

* Build habits and routines. These remove cognitive load from your brain so that you can fully harness your [cognitive budget](https://betterhumans.coach.me/superhuman-cognitive-stamina-9c8cab847d9e).

## Approach #3: Add skills and strategies

Again, looking beyond meditation, these are ways to upgrade the software your brain runs.

* Note your hidden biases. These are patterns that produce bad results. [Buster Benson](https://twitter.com/buster) has the definitive [Cognitive Bias Cheat Sheet](https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18). Memorize it.

* Develop and apply mental models. A model lets you simplify a subject that is too big to fit in your own brain. These are the essence of upgrading your brain by upgrading your software. Start with [Gabriel Weinberg](https://twitter.com/yegg)’s [Useful Mental Models](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d#.7qu6vl3pm).

* Build a prioritization habit so that your brain power is going toward work that matters. There’s quite a bit that goes into becoming a prioritization master including [estimation, measurement and adherence](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-be-a-prioritization-master-and-accomplish-massive-goals-9a4c0ddb2c2#.vrutbr1nk).

* Tap into your subconscious for improved creativity. Try [this hack for loading hard problems into your subconscious and then capturing them in your morning journal](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-get-more-creativity-from-your-morning-pages-practice-27684106268d#.nxfdfcpq1).

* Learn. Obviously. Always Be Learning. That’s the fundamental performance upgrade and we are amazingly lucky to have brains that are meant for learning.
> The competent [person] is fully aware of the strictly limited size of their own skull; therefore they approach the task in full humility. ~ Edsger W. Dijkstra

# Essential 8&#58; Eight “Unique” Superfoods & Supplements For Performance and Endurance

## Essential 8: Eight “Unique” Superfoods & Supplements For Performance and Endurance

Athletes are constantly told what to eat, what to drink, how to train, and what supplements to take. With all the conflicting information in the media, it is often impossible to weed through the hype and get to the facts. While eating REAL food can provide you with everything you need, sometimes athletes need more than the average couch potato since they are often pushing their bodies day in and day out. Even beginner runners and/or fitness enthusiasts could use the boost of extra nutrition to help their bodies adapt to the new stresses produced by exercise. So if you are looking for that extra edge in performance or just some help with recovery, here are eight valuable supplements that you can easily add to your diet.

**1)** **Creatine**

[Creatine](http://www.livestrong.com/article/288618-creatine-muscle-recovery/) is one of the most proven performance enhancing supplements. Although endurance athletes won’t benefit as much from [creatine](http://www.bengreenfieldfitness.com/2015/05/how-to-maximize-the-effects-of-training/) compared to a strength or power athlete, there are studies that prove enhanced performance for endurance, muscle growth, and regenerated ATP. This fast ATP regeneration leads to a higher level of performance in your next workout and a quicker recovery. Try taking 5g of NOW Foods Creatine per day, no need to do the “loading” cycle unless you are a strength athlete.

**2)** **Beta-Alanine**

[Beta-Alanine](http://breakingmuscle.com/health-medicine/beta-alanine-supplementation-increases-endurance) can help strength and enhance endurance. It buffers acid buildup in muscles, this allows them to contract with more power and last longer.* [*Beta-Alanine](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/beta-alanine-uses-and-risks) also helps to generate nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is beneficial for both cardiovascular health and function by increasing blood flow. Beta-Alanine keeps muscle pH levels in balance, reducing muscle fatigue. Less fatigue means you can train harder and longer which means achieving your fitness goals faster! Try taking ½ tsp (2.0g) of NOW Foods Beta Alanine per day, you may feel a tingly feeling the first week of using when you take it but that is completely normal and will end within a few days.

**3)** **D-Ribose**

[D-Ribose](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-827-RIBOSE.aspx?activeIngredientId=827&activeIngredientName=RIBOSE) is used to improve athletic performance and the ability to exercise by boosting muscle energy. Studies have shown that D- ribose prevents muscle fatigue and provides extra energy to the heart during exercise in people. By supplementing with [D-Ribose](http://www.drpasswater.com/nutrition_library/ribose.html) you can also replenish energy more quickly than just diet alone, and since it supports protein synthesis, it helps your muscles repair more quickly. Try taking 5g or one scoop of NOW Foods D-Ribose per day.

**4)** **L-Glutamine**

[L-Glutamine](http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/sportsnutrition/a/Glutamine.htm) prevents muscle breakdown and improves immune system functioning. Several clinical studies have found that glutamine can boost the immune system reducing the risk of illness and infection in endurance athletes during extreme training or competition. Research has also found that glutamine supplements can aid in endurance and help maintain muscle mass by preventing protein breakdown and improving glycogen synthesis keeping muscle glycogen stores full. Take 1TSP (5g) of NOW Foods L-Glutamine one to two times daily.

**5)** **Chia Seeds**

[Chia seeds](http://www.ultra-running-insights.com/chia-seeds.html) are a super food that contains a high amount of fiber, antioxidants, and are loaded with calcium, iron, and protein. They also contain a high amount of omega-3 fatty acids. The seeds have the ability to absorb more than nine times their weight in water, allowing athletes a more prolonged hydration. Since the seeds retain moisture they can regulate the body’s absorption of nutrients. Many endurance athletes that regularly consume chia say they don’t suffer from sugar crashes and decreasing performance. [Chia’s](http://www.cnbc.com/id/37831650) slow conversion creates endurance by creating a longer duration in the fueling effects of carbohydrates. Add 2 TBSP of NOW Foods Chia seeds to your morning smoothie or oatmeal.

**6)** **Spirulina Powder**

[Spirulina](http://www.runnersworld.com/nutrition-runners/fueling-runner-spirulina-and-chia?page=single) is an algae that is rich in nutrients like protein, B-complex vitamins, beta-carotene, zinc, chlorophyll, the essential fatty acid GLA, and phytonutrients. In a study testing runners’ performance in a two hour exhaustion test using a placebo and then spriulina, they were able to run an average of 30 percent longer after having been supplemented with [spirulina](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010119). An increase in fat oxidation and decrease in carbohydrate oxidation was also noted. This suggests that spirulina supports the body’s ability to preserve glycogen stores and utilize fat for energy more efficiently. Spirulina also helped with the runners recovery by reducing oxidative damage and promoted antioxidant activity after exercise. Add ½–1 TSP (2g-4g) of NOW Foods Spirulina to your morning smoothie or protein shake.

**7)** **Whey Protein**

Serious endurance athletes need considerable amounts of protein, far above the normal adult RDA. Protein deficiency will cancel the beneficial effects of your workouts causing fatigue, lethargy, anemia, and possibly even more severe disorders. Protein is needed for maintenance, repair, and growth of lean muscle mass, as well as contributing to healthy immune system function. [Whey protein](http://www.hammernutrition.com/knowledge/the-importance-of-protein-for-endurance-athletes.1276.html) has the highest biological value of any protein source. It is one of the most rapidly absorbed proteins, perfect for post–workout nutrition. Whey protein’s amino acid profile contains the highest percentage of essential amino acids, including BCAAs leucine, isoleucine, and valine, the most important for muscle tissue repair. Research shows that whey protein helps improve stamina and race time, speeds recovery, and may even protect the body from succumbing to a run-down immune system. Add 1 scoop a day of NOW Foods vanilla, chocolate or unflavored whey protein to a shake or smoothie or mix into your oatmeal.

**8)** **Flax Oil or Flax Seeds**

Flax contains multitude of Omega-3 fatty acids, “good” fats which have been shown to improve sensitivity to insulin and glucose metabolism. [Flax](http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/fueling-runner-flaxseed?page=single) can also reduce inflammatory response in conditions such as osteoarthritis and the muscular inflammatory response after a hard workout. Some studies are even investigating if the omega-3 in flax and other foods can increase blood flow and VO2 max. It’s been stated that flax oil improves athletes’ response times and recovery times, as it’s beneficial to muscle health. Flax also promotes brain, eyes, and digestive health. In addition, it may help fight various conditions such as diabetes and diseases such as breast cancer. So this is one that should be in every athlete’s fridge. Add 2 TBSP of NOW Foods Flax to your morning smoothie, mix into a muffin mix or oatmeal.

**ESSENTIAL EIGHT SMOOTHIE**

1 banana

1 avocado

2 cups spinach

1 green apple

1 cup Plain Greek yogurt

1 tsp spirulina

1 Tbsp flax seeds

2 tbsp chia seeds

1 scoop whey protein powder

1 tsp. L-Glutamine

½ tsp. Beta Alanine

1 scoop D-Ribose

1 tsp Creatine

# How to Become a Coach and Change the World

## How to Become a Coach and Change the World

*And make some money along the way.*

Coaching is the secret weapon of elite performers. Look behind the scenes of any successful person — business, media, sports, music — and you’ll find a team of people who helped them reach the top.

The coaching industry is surprisingly large: nine billion dollars per year. But the top coaches are rare and reserved for the already rich-and-famous. A top coach is sort of like a private jet. Great to have, but completely inaccessible to most people.

Here’s where you come in.

We want everyone in the world to have a great coach and that means we need more great coaches.

You may already think of yourself as a coach. That’s great — we can make you better.

Or you may not yet think of yourself as a coach. That’s also great — we can train you to become a top coach.

## You could be a top coach if…

Here’s a story about why you might be a top coach.

Our first wave of coaches were all recruited from within our original goal-tracking community (Coach.me has a long history and started with a large community of goal trackers).

Our top coach in 2015 had never coached before. He is a Boston-based CTO with a 600 day streak of Inbox Zero who coaches business productivity. His clients more than 200 clients have stuck with their goals three times longer than our average coach.

That’s a lesson for everyone — with practice and hard work, you can turn yourself into an amazing coach. If you’re a new coach, we can train you to be great. If you’ve coached before, we’ll have some important tips for you as well (plus a ton of tools).

## The key tools are…

Our coaching platform offers two things that have never been available before.

The first is a cutting edge **Digital Coaching Certification** program based on real lessons from the first people to ever successfully coach online. This is the first and only certification for the new realm of digital coaching. And, as far as I can tell, it’s the only coaching certification anywhere that is based on measuring exactly what works for clients.

The second, is we’re opening our **full stack coaching platform**. Our platform gives you a profile page, coaching tools, a turn-key billing system, and built-in client management and acquisition.

These tools help any type of coach — you could be offering phone sessions, digital chat coaching, or even courses.

With these key tools, you can be open for business in very short order.

## First of its kind certification

Digital coaching is a new branch of coaching.

Traditional coaching happens face to face. Sometimes traditional coaches use Skype or the phone. But that’s not an innovation that changes the nature of their coaching.

Digital coaching happens via text messaging, email and chat. That fundamentally changes the nature of how you coach.

Digital is different. You don’t have to say that it’s a better than face-to-face, although it clearly has some advantages.

* It’s location independent. Clients can access the best coaches in the world no matter where they live.

* It’s action oriented. Short, asynchronous messages reframe the coaching away from weekly strategy and toward daily action.

* It’s scalable. We’ve seen coaches give personal coaching to a hundred people at a time.

* It’s measurable. That’s a huge step toward meritocracy and the ability to get paid based on results.

Digital coaching needs different training because it is radically different than traditional coaching.

We’re offering open sourced training materials and a free Digital Coaching Certification. This is the first and only certification for this branch of coaching.

The part of the certification that we’re most proud of is that it’s based on real data. We can see which coaches are succeeding and which aren’t. That lets us build training that is literally cutting edge.

## Full stack, coaching platform

From a coaching perspective, the Coach.me platform does everything for you.

We host your profile. We provide tools for all three of the major coaching services (chat, calls, plans). We handle billing and subscriptions. We even bring you customers.

That’s the full stack.

Chat is the dominant category for digital coaching.

We also make it easy for clients to schedule phone or video chats for those times when you want to take a deep dive.

Finally, we offer a Plans feature for hosting courses or training plans. Imagine you’re a running coach and you want to hand out a training schedule for the next month.

## Top questions, i.e. how much money?

We aim to help a range of coaches, from people wanting a small side business, through people who aspire to $50k annual salaries, all the way up to the elite end of the freelance economy where people are making $100k to $250k per year.

For everyone else, here is a[ guide for understanding the business side of coaching](http://training.coach.me/article/171-business-of-coaching) and planning for how to make it part of your personal income.

You’re probably also wondering how payments work.

Our membership covers access to our tools and training. Beyond that, we just collect a small fee to cover bank processing and support. So if you use Coach.me for billing with your own clients, the price is 5% + $0.30/charge.

Beyond that, and this is probably the most powerful part of coaching membership, you can join the Coach.me affiliate network. We share revenue with people who coach on our platform (especially if we brought you the client). The default is 50/50, and we pay referral and affiliate bonuses up to 40%. [Here is the full schedule for revenue sharing](http://training.coach.me/article/123-how-does-payment-work).

## How to get started

If you want to try your hand at coaching, here is the first step is to become a member of our Coaching Community. The price is fair and I’m going to give you a 15% promo code because you read this entire post.

Join: [coach.me/apply](http://coach.me/apply)
Promo: NEWCOACH

Here are some of the areas that the world needs more coaches for:

* Business coaches that can coach staff and individual contributors on how to be entrepreneurial at work.

* Marketing coaches that can help entrepreneurs build their business (and increase their revenue).

* Athletic coaches who have experience at the high school level at minimum. We want to see your training plans.

* Diet coaches who want to coach hyper-specific diets: South Beach, Paleo, Bulletproof, etc. The world has plenty of generic diet coaches but not enough specific ones.

* Meditation coaches who can record guided meditations. [Here is one of my favorites from an author on meditation for lawyers](https://www.coach.me/plans/367825-20-day-mindful-pause-meditation/).

* Music coaches who can help give direction and guidance.

That’s just the tip of the iceberg.

Good luck!

# How To Reject Media Addiction And Get Back To Productivity

## How To Reject Media Addiction And Get Back To Productivity

Media addiction is when you check the same media sites over and over again regardless if any information is new. I’m talking about sites like Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Medium and wherever your favorite news happens to come from.

Recently, a lot of people got sucked even deeper into media addiction because of politics. My friends in media are saying that their page views are soaring.

But, to be honest, I know most people a fairly serious media addiction long before politics got so heated.

So take back your life. Here are the steps.

## #1. Set a media consumption budget

Did your parents ever limit your TV? I had one show I could watch every night and I thought very hard about making the best use of that slot.

You need to set a similar rule for your media consumption as an adult. How many minutes per day do you want to spend? What device are you going to use? When are you going to do this?

Most people would be best with two blocks of time:

1. Right before lunch. You’re energy has probably wained already so you aren’t wasting productive time. Plus, postponing your first media binge until mid-day will allow you at least an entire morning of productivity.

1. Right after work. You’re transitioning out of work and maybe you want to read things that you can discuss with your family. If you wait too late in the day, you will have trouble sleeping.

## #2. Install BlockSite on your main work browser

Addictive web browsing has no place at work. There’s a great Chrome Extension that you can configure to block all of your favorite time wasters: [download and try BlockSite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en).

By default, BlockSite will tell you that the site you’re trying to reach has been blocked (by you) and then shame you by telling you how many times you habitually tried to visit the site anyway.

For advanced users, try setting BlockSite’s redirect feature. You can use this to set a healthier, alternative website. Then BlockSite will send you their instead.

I have my BlockSite redirect send me to my Trello todo list as a reminder of what I’m really supposed to be doing.

Here are the sites on my block list:
> espn.go.com; news.ycombinator.com; huffingtonpost.com; sfgate.com; boingboing.net; facebook.com; politico.com; fivethirtyeight.com; nytimes.com; twitter.com; washingtonpost.com; realclearpolitics.com; breitbart.com; reddit.com; cnn.com; abcnews.com; nbcnews.com; foxnews.com; news.bbc.co.uk; usatoday.com; wsj.com.

With Blocksite, you’ll end up checking these sites either on your phone or at home in a non-work browser.

For people who carry their laptops everywhere, the alternative trick is to have a work browser that’s configured for productivity and then a personal browser that’s more liberally calibrated for leisure. Chrome lets you do this by [setting multiple personas](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

## #3. Move replacement habits onto the home screen of your phone.

Bad habits are hard to break. The easiest path is to replace them with stronger positive habits. This is a fundamental strategy for behavior augmentation.

For most people, the obvious replacement habits are meditation, books and podcasts.

Surfing the web is like a slot machine: mindless, useless and addictive.

But deep media experiences like reading a book or listening to a podcast produce long term learning and satisfaction. This is what you should be doing instead.

Here’s my home screen with the default Apple podcasts app, Kindle and [Calm for guided meditation](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm-meditation-techniques/id571800810?mt=8).

![](1*HpU1oIUyGFp0J3YDE6hI_w.png)

*Aside: I’ve been testing behavior design in phone backgrounds. The combination of Red + “Focus” Mantra is intentional design for my subconscious.*

## #4. Move or delete Facebook, Twitter and your web browser.

I deleted Facebook.

I moved Twitter into a folder on my second screen called Leisure. Not only is Twitter in a Folder, but it’s in the second screen of that folder.

This burying strategy means addictive apps are out of view and at least three taps away. That helps break addictive, mindless habits.

This is my second screen — all addictive apps are deeply hidden.

![](1*MlJv3mld1XnQ0Xvy-swdhw.png)

## #5. Remove the web browser from your phone

How badly do you want to be productive? If you do this, please tell me because it’s the most extreme step.

First of all, the default browser on iOS is Safari and you can’t uninstall it. BUT… you can turn on parental control and block access to it. That’s what I did.

Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Restrictions. Type in your passcode and remove access. There are lots of options to remove from your life in there.

Then when I absolutely need to use a web browser I install the Chrome app. When I’m done, I delete the app.

[Here’s how to do this same thing in Android](https://datarecovery.wondershare.com/delete/remove-google-chrome-device.html#android).

## Bonus: Be on the lookout for write-only versions of your favorite social media.

I’ve started tweeting from Twitter’s [Engage app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter-engage/id1116850120?mt=8). Consider writing blog posts in an app like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/).

# How to save your team from meeting misery

## How to save your team from meeting misery

![](1*BgXuxd1zBfcpMKyIOyQzZA.png)

It’s common to hear people say that meetings are a “waste of time“, but this is an overcorrection.

**Meetings aren’t inherently bad.**
> # Bad meetings are bad. Good meetings are good.

Bad meetings are miserable. You can turn the dial down on meeting misery if you give these three things to meeting invitees.

### (Obvious, but) first ask “does it really require a meeting?”

There are many modes of communication available. Watercooler chats to email to IM to meetings and so on. A meeting isn’t always the right mode to use. Meetings tend to be the superior choice when everyone needs to hear the same information at once, or when you want to minimize the back and forth, or make a decision as a group.

## 1. Give them information…

### Write a GAP agenda and send ahead of time…

The GAP stands for Goal, Agenda and Preparation.

The GAP agenda is brilliant for two reasons. Yes, it communicate clearly to the attendees, but has the added value of forcing the meeting host to get clear ahead of time as well. (I came across this idea via the clever [Coach.me](https://medium.com/u/61a38b54a13a) gang led by [Tony Stubblebine](https://twitter.com/tonystubblebine). They’ve even [written a book about it all now called Meeting Mastery](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FT6VNOG/?ref=idea_lv_dp_ov_d) (coauthors [Alicia Liu](https://twitter.com/aliciatweet) [Terrie Schweitzer](https://twitter.com/terrie))).

### G is for Goal

What is the goal that if achieved, the meeting will have been successful? (Bonus points for [S.M.A.R.T. goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) of course.)

### A is for Agenda

If you are going to ask people for their time, what are you asking them to spend it on? Tell them with an agenda. (Bonus points for noting owners and time blocks if appropriate). You can then use the agenda to [timebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) the meeting.

Personally I prefer to be not super rigid in keeping to the agenda (**some** tangents are valuable). However I’ve found a lot of value in being super rigid about always *creating* an agenda.

### P is for Preparation

What preparation will make the meeting successful? When they join the meeting, should they have already reviewed something? Do they need to have collected information from someone inside or outside the company? Let people know what is expected to be done ahead of time.

## 2. Give them warning…

### Get meetings on calendars ahead of time…

Respect people’s work and time. Give them warning when you want their time by putting things in their calendar.

Avoid last minute unplanned (and thus unexpected) meetings if possible with the “makers”. ([Timebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) it the meeting tightly. Even consider if it can be held standing up which tends to speed things up).

Try to hold meetings early or late in the date. This allows the “makers” to still access large enough chunks of time to get real work done.

[This classic post](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) by [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg) summed up the rationale for protecting the makers time well —
> “There are two types of schedule, which I’ll call the manager’s schedule and the maker’s schedule. … Most powerful people are on the manager’s schedule. It’s the schedule of command. But there’s another way of using time that’s common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can’t write or program well in units of an hour. That’s barely enough time to get started.
> When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in”.

Keep this in mind when inviting your “makers” to meetings.

## 3. Give them freedom…

### Use the optional flag judiciously…

Carefully consider if each attendee is “required” or “optional”. Give people freedom to choose if they need to be there by flagging them as optional.

# WIP #2&#58; Launched Coaching Memberships

## WIP 2: Launched Coaching Memberships

*Some behind the scenes talk about [Coach.me](http://coach.me) and the tools we’re building to build Better Humans.*

Continuing on with the rebirth of the release note ([more explanation here](https://betterhumans.coach.me/wip-return-of-the-release-note-e06d332e029b#.gq14h046m)).

If you don’t mind, I think these will be more product journal-y, i.e. I want to talk about the grey area of building products and communities. (Hence the name, Work-in-Progress).

We launched [coaching memberships](http://coach.me/apply) a few weeks ago. [Landing page here](http://coach.me/apply) and [webinar here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI43yxeQHCs). The services we provide come from a few thousand coaches. The membership program is for those coaches — so basically the back-office for what consumers see in the Coach.me apps.

What the membership program really got me thinking about was what is a coach.

That question gets especially tricky for us because we priced the opening of the membership program at $99. The implication for some people seems to be “I can be a coach for $99.”

So, let’s start with what we think about the profession of coaching.

### What is a great coach?

Coaching is an elite profession on par with lawyers, doctors and astronauts.

Consider what goes into being a great coach:

1. You need to be a great person. Having done significant work on yourself, you are not at risk of projecting your own insecurities and anxieties onto the client.

1. You need to be a psychological master. The job of the coach is to facilitate a change in the client. You don’t merely give advice, instead you orchestrate a series of moves to bring the client through a change.

1. You need to be a subject matter expert. The best coaches specialize because specialization let’s them refine their wisdom.

1. You need to develop incredible emotional intelligence. Every client is different and a great coach needs to be able to hear and relate to every single one.

1. You need to be a great marketer. Surprise — most coaches never get told this. You are a sole-proprietor which means you need to generate your own business.

That is a very, very high bar.

### How much would you pay to be an elite coach?

So, obviously, $99 is way too little to pay to be a be an elite coach. Imagine if your lawyer told you they got their law degree for $99 from lawyer.me?

And in fact, you absolutely don’t pay us that membership fee and then flip a switch to reach that elite level of coaching.

The price you pay to be a great coach is in time.

Great coaches invest in themselves so that they are healthy and whole human beings. They invest in life long learning. They invest in understanding a specific subject. They invest in time in understanding people. They invest in developing a brand and reputation.

So, I would say that right now, the top coaches on our platform are investing thousands of dollars of their own time. At minimum.

### One More Thing

I’m a big fan of this [Michael Dearing talk on pricing](https://www.heavybit.com/library/video/harrison-metals-michael-dearing-on-pricing/), which I affectionately refer to as the $260 toaster talk.

What would you pay for the world’s greatest toaster? As Michael tells the story of this toaster, your opinion of its value will go up and up.

I always underprice all of my work, which is probably a symptom of not being very good at telling the story.

When I put together the webinar for our membership program I realized that we were solving nine of the hardest problems that professional coaches face.

Truly, if we can put a coach on the path of becoming an elite professional on the order of a brain surgeon or trial lawyer, then I will have to get better at telling the $100k version of our story.

# An Antidote To Self Pity

## 

I got bad news this morning. I missed an opportunity because someone hadn’t heard from me and went with another person.

**But I had responded immediately! **The email did not arrive (or she missed it).

I had done everything right.
It’s not fair.
It’s not my fault.

I’m feeling disappointed, and helpless, and sorry for myself.

I’m telling myself, “It’s the universe telling you it wasn’t meant to be.”
“It wasn’t a good fit.”
“Let it go.”

I’m searching for where I screwed up– what I could have done differently.

Should I have followed up sooner? Perhaps, but the potential client was traveling and I had the impression the project wasn’t urgent.

I didn’t want to seem pushy.

### 3 Takeaways from this Life Lemon

**1. Turn up the “She’d be happy to hear from me” meter.** Believe that an inquiry from me is not an intrusion. It could be a useful reminder, a pleasant show of interest, or simply neutral. All are more likely than an annoyance.

**2. Improve my system for evaluating potential projects.** I was kinda waiting to see what might develop with this opportunity– open to, but not creating scenarios of how we might work together. Maybe the fact that I wasn’t actively generating ideas should have signaled me to turn up the energy or turn it off.

**3. Tweak my follow-up system.** [I have a good CRM](http://contactually.com) that I don’t use as effectively as I could. It gives me reminders that I sometimes ignore. And any database is only as good as the data you put in. I could have checked in with the client sooner.

So in conclusion, fault, schmault. Like most things in life I can learn from this, and insight is an antidote to self-pity.

# Motivation Monday&#58; Three Ways To Increase Your Happiness and Success Through Altruism

## Motivation Monday: Three Ways To Increase Your Happiness and Success Through Altruism

This is meant to be an intentionally timely message. Global politics are reaching a divisive peak and we’ve got Thanksgiving coming up.

So… are you going to eat the negativity pie that the media serves up to you or are you going to take control of your own happiness and success?

I’m recommending taking control.

And in that vein, I have three links to motivate you today to increase your happiness and satisfaction through gratitude, positivity and altruism.

[Altruism as a Path to Happiness](https://betterhumans.coach.me/altruism-as-a-path-to-happiness-c8797ea500f3#.qm166bgwk)
> Isolation can turn us into neurotic addicts. The classic addiction experiment story goes like this: put a rat in a cage and give it two water bottles, one laced with an addictive substance. Soon the rat is emptying the doped water bottle. Because the substance is irresistible. Right? Right. *War on drugs!*
> But what if you do the same experiment with a group of rats, and give them a nice rat environment to live in all together — call it “Rat Park” maybe. Guess what?

[How Good People Attract Success](https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-power-of-altruism-how-good-people-attract-success-5a497a763b37#.86wwwyanv)
> Collins lays out two types of leaders.
> One is a fox, constantly executing tricky plays that lead to immediate results. The other is a hedgehog, constantly picking their head up to see the big picture.
> Hedgehogs always won over the long run. In the short run, foxes would sometimes win, but then over the long run they’d crash and burn.

[Seven New Goals People Are Going to Be Trying for New Years](https://betterhumans.coach.me/seven-new-goals-people-are-going-to-be-trying-for-new-years-1acca27d9413#.ui3dj32p8)

In the Coach goal rankings, people are moving hard toward gratitude practices:
> Maybe that means we live in dark times and people are looking for a silver lining. That’s why I picked up my first gratitude practice — to combat stress and anxiety. Or it means we live in a golden age of leisure and people are celebrating. (Or both, we live in a great time, but people have been convinced otherwise and are freaking out.)
> [Write Three Positive Things About Today](http://coach.me/plans/1090) jumped +24 spots to #10 and [Affirmations](http://coach.me/plans/18966) jumped +85 to #28.

What is something you’re grateful for today? What is a small kindness you can do for someone around you?

What is an act of empathy that you can practice? Tomorrow, after you vote (if you are in the US), can you embrace someone who voted differently?

# Trippin’ on Dharma

## Trippin’ on Dharma

### pursue or be pursued — either way your dharma will find you

I’ve been trippin’ on dharma lately. Well, definitely pondering it quite a bit. It is a word I like, am familiar with. I brushed up against this word when I studied yoga and meditation as a sixteen year old and throughout the years studying holistic nutrition. I never really focused on the meaning because, although having much admiration, I am not familiar with the tenets of Buddhism. I came across the word again recently after listening to “Making the Shift” by Dr. Wayne Dyer. He speaks at length about our dharma or purpose. He tells us that we all have a purpose we must discover and then follow. Either wake up to your purpose, and begin to pursue your dharma or it will find you and make you be the human you were meant to be. If you choose to ignore the signs, you will be left with a feeling of unease, anger, depression, obsessions, compulsions and a life less lived.

After listening for twelve hours or so to Dr. Dyer’s deeply persuasive voice, I was fascinated, intrigued but a little wary of this ancient eastern concept. I do, kind of believe that we may just have a purpose that was decided for us long ago, something we are just meant to be.

It could be possible.
Way back in time, when I was a little girl of six, I started Catholic school and while learning about Jesus and the early Christians, I decided that I was put here on this earth to help the needy and follow the path of kindness, mercy and suffering that those same Christians did. This conviction translated itself into allowing the boys at school to ‘capture me’ and put my head in hole dug in the ground as a means of punishing the enemy and girls were always the enemy at that time. My older brother put an end to their antics pretty quickly and my sister asked why I would ever allow myself be caught, which of course I had allowed. When I explained that I was training myself to endure pain and be a martyr like the early Christians, she told me not to be so silly because there no longer existed the need for martyrs as we weren’t being persecuted anymore. I was relieved — it did seem to be a short and brutal existence but left me at a loss as to my purpose. So at six and a half, I decided to become a nun. Shortly after that, I left my religious aspirations behind, deciding to be a nurse and then something else and so on. I have to say, I was never without a purpose.

It starts young, this dharma, when you think of it. Now, as an adult, I am amazed that I was willing to accept such bloody-mindedness at such a young age. But that aside, I have always wanted to be something. Whenever an adult asked, I had an answer to that question, ‘What do you want to be when…’

Definitely my mother influenced me in a spiritual sense by teaching me yoga which led me to study and then teach meditation in high school. It was an unusual calling at the time. So was my dharma trying to tell me something?
I have tripped my way through my career life like I was perpetually asking a question and never finding an answer. I have been a costume designer, an actor, an event planner, a retail sales person, a singer, a songwriter. Always changing, always reaching for something. I have loved each and every one. Sometimes I get a bit envious of people who decide what they are at a young age and just do it. They get early retirement and have fantastic pensions or whatever it brings them.

But none of that matters in the face of the longest and truly rewarding career I have had as a Holistic Nutritional Practitioner. It speaks to me. I can help people and be creative at the same time. So many people in holistic nutrition and the wellness community have come from an arts background, so there must be something about the creativity of it that rings true for many.
Every time I venture into a new fascination or distraction I come back to this career. It has been a big year of changes for me, and now, maybe because of that or listening to Making The Shift, I am starting accept and live in my dharma — to help others, to get the word out, to help heal personally, communally, and globally — as much as I can.

# 3 Eating Tips for Eating Less

## Ah the holiday season is here. Actually, it’s been here since the end of October when Halloween candy began to arrive in small packages. The season of eating continued as the shelves in our refrigerator were first filled by a Thanksgiving meal and then its leftovers. Finally we have the build up of Christmas cookies.

At our house we have a cookie making day where friends and family come over, our oven gets put through its paces, and cookies cover every inch of the ping pong table. In past years, I would will myself to only a few cookies each day, but by lunch brokered a negotiation between my brain and stomach to only three (okay, four) cookies for each meal. This year I’m using the power of psychology to help me out, and taking three things I learned from [Brian Wansink’s Mindless Eating](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553384481/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0553384481&linkCode=as2&tag=miksblo09-20&linkId=DR2MOVXJH2XPUMXF) to eat fewer cookies and you can too.

**Step 1: Put the cookies in an opaque container, out of sight, and stacked under something**. We have an orange plastic container in our pantry with two cans of soup stacked on top. In one of Wansink’s experiments he gave secretaries in an office building a dish of chocolates. Half the glass dishes were clear and half were white. Wansink found that the secretaries with the clear dishes ate 71% more than the ones with the white dishes. Out of sight, out of mind, off the hips.

**Step 2: Eat only one kind of cookie each meal/day/week**. We love variety. Sweet and Salty. Love and Drama. Milk and cookies. That last one will probably result in more cookies consumed than if you had them without milk. Cookies and milk means we get the crunch and gooyness in the same bite. Knowing we eat more when there is variety can be flipped on its head to help us eat less when there isn’t. Without variety we reach satiety more quickly — and it’s not just for taste but color too. Wansink writes that even variety in the color of M&M’s result in people eating more. Choose one type of dessert this season and you’ll likely eat less.

**Step 3: Get the smallest plate you can and one for each cookie.** Wansink has found that a lot of our eating indicators come from the environment around us rather than in us. We don’t stop when we are full, we stop when the plate of grandma’s meatball marinara is so clean it can go back in the cupboard. If you choose smaller dishes and put one cookie on each you’ll be doing two things. First, the cookie will appear to be more food on a smaller plate than a larger one. In Mindless Eating the example is ice cream rather than cookies, but the proof is in the (pudding) bowls. People given bigger bowls at an all you can eat ice cream social, ate 31% more than their peers who had bowls half the size. Second, leaving your plates in front of you will be a cue to how much you’ve eaten. Wansink tested this at a Super Bowl party and found that people who sat at tables that weren’t regularly cleared away, ate 28% less because their stacks of dirty dishes reminded them of how much they had already eaten.

Those are your three steps for fewer holiday cookies, or any other food this year. Keep food hidden, eat the same thing, and do so on small plates which you leave on the table. Wansink points out in the book that you probably won’t even notice that you’re eating slightly less.

Happy Holidays, and don’t forget cookies for the big guy, he’s one who’s not watching what he eats.

# There’s an App for That&#58; Cancer in the Modern Age

## When I was diagnosed with cancer on the last day of June, I had no idea of the tidal wave coming my way. I read a lot of biographies and memoirs, and I had read a number of them written by people who had dealt with cancer in their own lives. (I know, he’s a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad man, but Lance Armstrong’s It’s Not About the Bike is still a powerful book that details how awful cancer is—how it affects you and your family, and how to soldier through to the other side.) But, when YOU have cancer, when Cancer with a capital C, has you in its uniquely personal grasp, it doesn’t let go until it’s finished with you. You have to find your own way through diagnosis, treatment, and the world after.

It was obvious to me pretty quickly that when you have Cancer suddenly the control you had in your life is gone. People do things TO you. They take your blood, they take your tissue, they take your picture. A hospital file photo so they know it’s you when you show up for surgery. X-rays. MRIs. In my case, a picture of my breasts before I had my mastectomy. I suddenly travelled in a pack: an oncologist and her nurse, the surgeon and his two nurses, the plastic surgeon and his nurse and his receptionist. I had my own nurse advocate. An occupational therapist. A radiologist and her nurse (who I didn’t end up needing and only saw once). I felt like I had been flash-mobbed by Cancer. A flash-mob is fun and exciting if it’s how your boyfriend proposes to you. It is not fun and exciting if it’s how Cancer cuts you from the herd.

I was lucky. I had a wonderful support system. Family. Work. Friends. Neighbors. They all rallied around me. Made me food. Sent me cards. Emailed me. Mowed my lawn. But when you are alone in the dark, at night, with Cancer, you have only yourself to rely on. And that is where the apps come in.

If you search “cancer” apps on your phone, you get a weird assortment. Cancer prevention apps. Diagnostic apps. Medical-jargon-your-doctor-will-use translation apps. And a number of horoscope apps. At first this baffled me. Did my horoscope for June tell me I would get cancer? And then it occurred to me that Cancer is a sign of the Zodiac. Ah yes, THAT Cancer. But those were not the apps that helped me. The apps that helped me were already on my phone. There are two of them: Lift and Headspace.

I came to Lift through Tim Ferriss. He started a challenge there for the Slow-Carb diet, and talked about how Lift was a great way to track your habits daily. For those of us trying to hack our way to healthy, this app is a gem. Once I started to use it, I accomplished a number of things I would never have even attempted. I tracked my weight daily for almost two years. I did a 10K squat challenge TWICE, once using a kettle bell. That’s quite an accomplishment for a woman in her fifties with bad knees.

One of the nice things about Lift, is while you are working on daily habits that you really want to acquire, like brushing your teeth, you get to noodle around in the list of habits other people are trying to see what they are habitting. That’s how I found meditation.

I had always wanted to learn to meditate. I had gone on a silent retreat where I first learned to sit in silence. I had a tendency to use the quiet space to think about my grocery list. Helpful, but not restorative. Then we learned walking meditation. I loved the pace and cadence, but found that it didn’t translate to home where I had to step over Legos and Barbies, or to my hilly neighborhood without sidewalks. I would come back to meditation periodically, but I just couldn’t establish a practice. So I decided to try this as a daily habit on Lift. But the problem was that even though I had read books about meditation and been on a retreat, I could not sit in silence myself and feel that I accomplished anything useful. I had to find a guided meditation system to tap into.

I tried a very popular on-line, calm-life, guru. I have no idea whether or not his meditations worked because I couldn’t stand the sound of his voice. It had a nasal quality, and grated on my nerves. I couldn’t really follow his path if I wanted to throw him off of it. I tried several other meditation apps. I discovered that I preferred the sound of someone talking. No bells, chimes, waves, water dripping, or chants. I found background noises distracting. The sound of waves made me wish I was at the beach. It was at this point of frustration, after several weeks of searching, that I found Headspace.

Headspace had three things going for it right away. First, I could try it for ten days for free before committing to a subscription. Second, it had levels of progression that started with Take-10: ten minutes a day of starting to learn how to meditate and sitting still. And third, Headspace meditations are voiced by Andy Puddicomb. Andy used to be a Buddhist monk, and he’s British. His voice is calm, with no annoying qualities—just this pleasant accent. I fell in love with the Headspace site, how it instructed me, and with Andy’s calm voice.

I subscribed to Headspace for two months. Times were tight at our house since my husband was out of work and we had two children in college, so I let my subscription go. For two and a half months, I though about Headspace every day, missing the calm of Andy’s voice. My brother sent us some money that fall to tide us over, and once we’d paid some bills, I subscribed to a whole year of Headspace. It was like coming home.

Which brings me to the end of June and Cancer. People write about how they receive a cancer diagnosis and their world turns upside down. Or time stops. Or they reevaluate their priorities. Or . . . whatever. I was really worried more about my husband and my two children. I think the diagnosis freaked them out more than it did me. I was also worried, in June, about getting better in time to return to work for the holiday season—I am an assistant store manager in a Big Box, and it would be hard on my co-workers to have to get through the holidays without me.

So I was determined that, while I had a team of people to take care of me medically, I would take care of my mental and physical progress. I stuck to my regular morning routine as much as possible: get up, make coffee, meditate, and get ready for the day. I don’t remember which Headspace pack I was doing when I got my diagnosis, but I switched pretty quickly to Stress. A lot of things were changing quickly, but the coffee pot still perked every morning, and Andy’s voice kept guiding me on.

That makes this stage of my life sound more calm than it was. There’s a term, “monkey mind,” that describes how our brains leap all about, full of thoughts and distractions. Whatever rhythm I had achieved maintaining my meditation practice over the course of a year was blown to pieces. I didn’t have monkey mind. I had an entire monkey house my brain—swinging simians, boisterous baboons, anxious apes. I couldn’t turn them off. The whole extended procedure of diagnosing my cancer and deciding on a treatment plan was like throwing bananas into the monkey house. Surgery? Lumpectomy? Mastectomy? Radiation? Chemo? Medical leave? Every question begat more questions, and more decisions I had to make. Suddenly the twenty minutes guided mediation felt like it was two hours long. I dropped down to ten minutes, and kept at it every day. Use Headspace, check it off on Lift along with the other habits I had laid out for myself. These two apps provided a scaffolding for my survival.

The day of my surgery, I got up early—no coffee allowed—and meditated, by this time having moved on to the Anxiety session. It made me a little less anxious, and I went off to the hospital with my overnight bag and my phone. The next morning after my surgery, feeling like I had been chomped on by a Sharknado, I fired up Headspace for the next session of Anxiety. I fell back into a drug-induced sleep half-way through. (Andy’s voice is so calming, that, although I have used the single session on Sleep when I couldn’t fall asleep, I have never heard it finish.) I continued to meditate every day for ten minutes. Was I always awake those entire ten minutes? No. Did I always reach a state of calm, peacefulness? No. But it was vitally important that in those days when I seemed to have little control over my life, where I felt like absolute shit, that I continued to try and meditate. I needed it more than I had on all those quiet, early mornings in the house, before Cancer came to be my roommate.

I still had many things I was anxious about. My incision didn’t heal properly, and I had to go back into surgery for a “wound revision.” I was still taking lots of pain meds, and I felt like they messed with my head. But Andy was there, with his calm voice, day after day, not judging me when I sometimes had to restart the session three times to make it all the way through.

And very shortly after I got out of the hospital, I realized that I would have to change my habits—or rather, they had been changed for me—and I had to reevaluate my Lift list. I had a number of habits that I had very long streaks with—such as checking my weight every day, doing good deeds for others, and exercising. Laying in bed the morning after surgery, very few of these habits seemed relevant to me. So I pared things way down.

My meditation habit stayed on Lift—I knew I had to keep taking care of my inner self—and the next one I added two days later was “Exercise for five minutes.” I knew that to feel better, I had to keep moving and not just lay in bed all day. Much of my “exercise” those first weeks consisted of walking around the dining room table for five minutes. Eventually I could go up and down the basement stairs very slowly for five minutes. Finally, I could walk around the house outside for five minutes. My whole world was locked in slow-motion. I only had one speed.

I made myself do those five minutes every day, every when it was four minutes too long. In my job at the Big Box retailer I walk three miles on a slow day, and fourteen on a really busy day (think Black Friday), so I had a long way to progress from three times around the dining room table. I would get ready for bed, and check off my meditation habit, and there it would be: Exercise for Five Minutes. My whole body was stiffening from so much time spent in bed, that I also began to do light yoga and lift light weights. It was grueling. My family and friends were the opposition. “Don’t do too much,” they said. “You need to take it easy and rest,” they said, but I knew the opposite was true. I had to keep pushing and moving and mediating to get back to where I felt myself again.

I am lucky. I did not have to have radiation, and I did not have to have chemotherapy. Both of those were huge factors in my ability to get back to actually working out again (I love spinning), and to go back to work (half-time at first). I am to a point now where doctor’s visits and cancer treatment are not the focal point of my day-to-day existence. It was a wonderful feeling the first time I could sit upright in a chair for the entire ten minutes of the Headspace meditation. I have now worked my way back up to fifteen minutes.

Could I have survived cancer without meditation? Certainly. But meditating daily with Headspace helped me deal with cancer emotionally—an arena that was never addressed by any of my care caregivers except my family’s general practitioner. Lift helped me get back to the habits I had been working on before I was diagnosed with Cancer. I needed to follow the doctors’ orders, take my medicines, get plenty of rest. It was necessary to write my own prescription for inner care. As it turns out that there are apps for that.

# It’s Time We Start Thinking of Earth As a Trust Fund

## Here’s how we make sure it doesn’t run out.

When I was in high school, I had a friend that came from a wealthy east coast family. Paul was 21 years old. He lived in a modest 4 bedroom house and drove a new Ford Mustang. Paul always dressed nicely, but never extravagantly. He went on a few vacations throughout the years to Hawaii and Mexico, but spent most of his time locally. He had hobbies that weren't cheap, but they weren't ridiculously expensive — skiing and golf. Interestingly, Paul did not have a full time job, yet he was never concerned about money.

When Paul was 18, he was given access to a trust fund worth five million bucks. After taxes and management fees, Paul received about $300,000 a year from the corresponding interest and investments. He took 5% and put it right back in the fund to offset inflation, and spent no more than the remaining $285,000 annually. Not a bad income. Paul could live comfortably for the rest of his life, so long as he maintained the lump sum in his fund. He realized the importance of protecting the resource that unconditionally provided for him.

Paul had an younger brother named James, who lived quite the lavish lifestyle. He drove a brand new yellow Ferrari, and was always dressed his best in custom tailored suits from Italy. James built a custom 6 bedroom mansion right on the golf course and spared no expense in doing so. He was notoriously generous with his money, and was known for picking up the tab whenever going out with friends. He wrote sizable donation checks to his favorite causes and charities, and the nicest country club in town appeared to be his home away from home. James had a lifestyle that was like a rap music video playing 24/7.

How was James able to afford such a lavish stylish compared to his older brother? He *couldn’t* afford it. He was an idiot. He made poor financial decisions that benefited him only in the short run. James and Paul had the exact same trust funds, yet James consumed at a rate 10X what his brother did.

That was fifteen years ago. Where are they now? Paul has a couple kids and a wife, but his lifestyle is still mostly the same — comfortable but not outrageous. And what about James? What kind of exotic car is he driving now?

James drives a 1992 Toyota Tercel. He is a waiter at an Applebee’s and lives in a 1 bedroom apartment. After James blew through his fund in a few years, the checks stopped showing up. The Ferrari was repossessed and he had to offload his house in a short sale.

The Earth is full of tremendous resources, and *everything* that we consume — our food, our cars, our houses, our toys — comes from it. I don’t need to remind you that houses are built from trees, cars are built from iron ore, and even the device you are reading this on was made mostly from materials mined from the ground.

The earth may seem to have infinite resources, but it doesn’t. The earth can provide unfathomable amounts of raw materials to us, we just have to let them replenish. But we don’t.

Instead, we are blowing through our proverbial piggy bank like James blew through his trust fund. $5,000,000 seems like it can buy an awful lot of expensive things until it can’t anymore. The seemingly bottomless pit isn’t so bottomless. It has a hard floor, and it really hurts when you hit it.
> # If the Earth is our bank account, we are pulling out cash like a trust fund baby hooked on cocaine, with a shopping addiction, who has an ATM right across the street.

We are chipping away at our resource base at an alarming rate. In the past twelve months we have consumed the resources that it took the planet about eighteen months to produce. Every forest we clear cut, every oil field we drill, every ocean we overfish, we are setting ourselves up for disaster. The more that we pull out, the less that can be replenished.

If all of the world’s 7 billion people consumed as much as an average American, it would take the resources of between **5–8 Earths** to sustainably support it all. Even at the current global rate of consumption, we need between 2 -3 Earths to keep the party going.

It’s not only the *consumption* that’s a problem, it’s the *destruction*. We are burning the candle on both ends. We put a tremendous strain on our Earth while simultaneously expecting it to provide more for us. Since we’ve polluted our air, water, and land, the Earth does not replenish resources at the same rate it did two hundred years ago. It’s like we are expecting our horse to win the Kentucky Derby after we have starved it for 2 weeks.
> # We are feverishly swiping our debit cards while simultaneously throwing molotov cocktails at the bank’s front door.

California is famous for movie stars, tech startups, and beautiful beaches. Recently, the Golden State has also become famous for something not quite as glamourous — epic drought. We’ve placed huge burdens on the water resources of the region, and with abnormally lower rainfall to replenish our reservoirs, we turn to our aquifers.

![](1*8ZiClFbWvwVMqgMBUG-GOw.jpeg)

Aquifers have a particular *recharge rate* — the rate at which new, fresh water flows in. If we pump out water at or below the recharge rate, we can continue to tap into the resource indefinitely.

Perhaps due to lack of accountability, or convenience, or even macroeconomics, we continue to consume more of this resource each and every year. We’ve pulled so much water out of the ground that one part of the San Joaquin Valley has even sunk by 28 feet over the last century. While our initial consumption rate was probably less than the recharge rate, it crept up year after year and now far exceeds it. At some point, an adjustment is inevitable. When the wells dry up, we can only use what falls from the sky. Right now, that isn’t much. California has seen record low rainfall totals over the last few seasons.

Our global consumption habits are self destructive and won’t last indefinitely. We can’t go on forever like this. One day, the money will run out. One day, the man at the the Gucci store will tell us that our card has been declined. One day, we’ll have to downgrade to the Toyota Tercel and close our eyes to pretend we are still in the custom suede seats of the Ferrari. Unless we stop spending so damn much.

If we don’t stop the hemorrhaging soon enough, our resource stock will continue to shrink and can only replenish at an increasingly *slower* rate. As a society, we have to ask ourselves an important question. Do we want to live it up for a few years, and then have it all come crashing down? Or do we want to live a bit more modestly, but have it last indefinitely?

I wonder if I’ll ever get the chance to catch up with James. I would ask him why he had not stopped spending sooner. I would ask him if he saw the likelihood of a zero balance before it actually happened. Did he really think it would last forever? If he cut his cards with even $1,000,000 in the bank, at least he will still be making enough interest to live comfortably. It would take him decades of controlled spending to get back up to $5,000,000, but he could have done it.

Paul was smart with his money, yet he still lived a great life. He wasn’t any less happy than his younger brother, even though his car wasn’t as nice and his house was smaller. Today, Paul is far better off than James. He made a very small sacrifice to gain a very large benefit, and it has paid off.

Our planet may not have $5,000,000 in the bank anymore, but perhaps we have $3,000,000. The interest from this amount is still significant. If we make a change now, we can save ourselves from the fate of James. Let’s learn from Paul. Let’s use less resources, and let’s start today.

# 14 Good Habits You Should Instantly Pick Up From The Minions (Featuring Animated GIFs)

## 14 Good Habits You Should Instantly Pick Up From The Minions (Featuring Animated GIFs)

*Minions* is the third installment in the *Despicable Me* series.

If you haven’t seen or heard about the movie, you should. Because *Minions* is the **10th highest grossing movie of all time.**

![](1*owbAr2p5f1Xji-ySWkqpOA.png)

Do you know how hard it is for the third movie in a trilogy to outshine its predecessors?

It’s the reason why Avengers 2 is behind Avengers and why [the first of the Hobbit movies was the most successful](http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Peter-Jacksons-Lord-of-the-Rings#tab=summary) of them all.

So how do you go from not being on that list with the first movie, to spot number 26 with the second, to the top 10?

**You double down on what works.**

Even though the first movie focused on super villain Gru, who is out to steal the moon, the true stars were his dedicated, squeaking, overly enthusiastic servants — **the Minions**.

After playing only a minor role in the first movie, their air time increased significantly in the second, and now they’ve got their own movie.

I recently watched the movie and re-watched the older ones, only to find myself laughing even harder.

It struck me that what makes us love them so much is not just how funny they are.

More than that, **they have a few really good habits**, that we could all use some more of.

Let’s be honest.

Secretly, we all wish our life was more like the life of a minion, and it’s probably for the following reasons.

## 1. They have fun. Always.

![](1*FK-uB2VsNMg3uyThIKljzA.gif)

Even though Minions probably have no age and live forever, they often behave like kids and **have fun**. All. The. Time.

They hear the word “butt” and laugh their own off. If you’re over 10 years old, chances are, you should laugh a bit more too.

![](1*3HSBgDS96xyxyME2-2dezw.gif)

Did you know that [kids laugh 300 times per day, on average](http://www.aath.org/do-children-laugh-much-more-often-than-adults-do)? Adults: less than 20 times. No wonder kids are happier!

So don’t look for the reason or the sense in everything, instead **spot the fun in everyday situations**. There’s always something to laugh about!

![](1*Fk2C5L_yAVXVy3uvsp0jbg.gif)

## 2. They keep their cool.

![](1*N5ttAciKYQ7sOgKnUydSVg.gif)

When new problems turn up, the Minions rally. Instead of running around with their arms flailing, they get together, calm down one another, and see how they can handle the situation and get their boss out of trouble.

![](1*sTYNbivIiLGPS9GVNYnahQ.gif)

So the next time you’re on the edge of a panic attack because your about to miss a deadline, **keep your cool. **It’s not a literal deadline. No one’s going to die.

Adopt the mantra: Pause. Breathe. Think. Act.

Give yourself a break so you can observe your feelings, but not act on them. Just ask yourself: What would King Bob do?

![](1*NPvdf9AiDBquKTLmmqKa1g.gif)

## 3. They dance. A lot.

![](1*jojRe723UuPzv7NKAiqEEQ.gif)

For Minions, dance parties are much more the norm, rather than the exception. They take even the slightest music reference or cause to celebrate and turn it into a full-fledged disco session.

![](1*EyvkK5tthsLSPrZk6UNi7w.gif)

Well, they’ve got it right. [Dancing reduces stress](http://www.the-standard.org/life/dancing-boosts-health-relieves-stress/article_63b27627-c2cc-59cd-832c-14c8a2319487.html), as it releases endorphins and is an activity connected to **strong positive emotions**.

So the next time your partner sends you a sweet text, or the [vending machine just re-stacked your favorite snack](https://medium.com/better-humans/the-barack-obama-willpower-hack-1780c5f6e493), don’t be afraid to [do a few spins](https://medium.com/better-humans/you-have-to-make-yourself-the-only-person-who-can-control-your-dreams-a-how-to-ade1197c200#.kav29dysy) — even if you have to ride the elevator, [just for that](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-03/18/17/enhanced/webdr02/anigif_enhanced-18467-1426712634-22.gif).

![](1*FuMp89nWn2UHJWX6ubbk1w.gif)

## 4. They never give up.

![](1*KwKdr7FA2m1TRQCXUDZWLg.gif)

Even when things look bleak, and everything goes wrong, Minions just never give up. They persist, because when it’s not right, it’s not over.

![](1*F2Ef939Vo3swRclkwcuESg.gif)

So even when you have a bad day and Murphy’s Law holds true once again, don’t give up. **Show up anyway. **Eventually, everything will be alright.

![](1*TqiNSnx_dARCYXinjhnmYg.gif)

## 5. They stay curious.

![](1*aabrlv6CEJQdZY4TKGd2Zw.gif)

Minions are never afraid to try something new. They love it! That’s why they charge right into new adventures, even when they have no clue what they’re doing. It also means they’re never worried about asking stupid questions.

![](1*hEkNIlIA4eC15ZtJar2fvA.gif)

They ask them anyway, and so should you. In 99% of all cases, a “No” is the worst thing that can happen, so **what’s stopping you?**

![](1*TzvC-uea5mKn12bGCCKWBg.gif)

## 6. They show their feelings.

Minions want to be appreciated. And they show it.

![](1*y0AzZNQqx66m6gvJT7sfnQ.gif)

Even more importantly though, they also show when they appreciate someone. When’s the last time you hugged your best friend, just because?

Don’t just feel, **share your feelings with the world**. Which brings me to…

![](1*79oH9llgWPFBE94NWIBddA.gif)

## 7. They don’t bottle up their anger.

When Minions are pissed off, they’re pissed off. And they’re not afraid to express it. Sometimes even with their fists.

![](1*8aCRistPkV8gwoJUNZqjJw.gif)

The next time you’re angry about something, don’t bottle it up inside until you explode and it gets ugly.

Address problems right away. Talk about things. **Communicate**. That doesn’t mean you should punch someone in the face right away.

Although sometimes you might have to.

![](1*9B1Cfc9CtrSJ4ezK-cZ0Cg.png)

## 8. They get excited about everything. Like, seriously excited.

![](1*fhVjrV9uv3w7a1EVDrA7-w.gif)

It doesn’t matter whether you tell a Minion that he or she (do they have genders?) just got a raise, or that the sun is shining.

These guys get **seriously excited about anything that’s even remotely positive.**

![](1*-5YfbREVYfnbQ6jJNzLp4w.gif)

Imagine you got as excited about the little things in your life as they do. Guess what: You can!

Try this: Instead of saying “I *have to* work out today.” say “I *get to* work out today.”

Changing this one word will put a spin of gratitude on everything you do.

![](1*OHbiWPe7JSQC79bOe2P4Hg.gif)

## 9. They eat bananas. Lots of them.

![](1*Q2ZmcWAVHt2ywyiUMwy2Tg.gif)

I don’t think I need to say anything else, do I? Fruits are good for you. So…

Banana?

[Bananaaaaaaaaaa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCkerYMffMo)!

![](1*oyGqUc_V-mhJBBs5RWXN1Q.gif)

## 10. They are not afraid to make mistakes.

![](1*lvzUVaPw6PjQoJxz83oW5w.gif)

Minions are not only curious, they also don’t care if they don’t get it right the first time. Their curiosity makes sure they keep learning and their persistence makes up for what goes wrong.

Don’t hold back on whatever it is you do today, **give it all you’ve got!** Even if it means you might have to start from scratch again.

![](1*pUAESgHEFtt1KZo3tbNChg.gif)

## 11. They make the best of everything.

![](1*tmBd5z8tK7SZyP9avdIGFQ.gif)
> # *Things turn out the best for those who make the best of how things turn out. — John Wooden*

Minions sure fall into this category of people and you should too. Instead of crying, complaining and worrying over what went wrong, **just make the best of today**.

![](1*EmTDpetCRWaJPv8iGMWAag.gif)

## 12. They don’t take themselves too seriously.

![](1*J3DPT8O3wt40wj2tW9rn3g.gif)

If you want to find the fun in everything you do in your life, you first have to **stop being so serious.**

So what if someone makes an occasional joke at your expense? You can lift your finger and point it at them — **or you can just laugh with them.**

What do you think is better for you, in the long run?

![](1*7LpwiMX5DesrciM5wxjVLQ.gif)

## 13. They look out for one another.

![](1*usGg1w_q0_o8i_FGuoBYCA.gif)

Even though there’s a good-hearted competition among Minions, when it gets serious, they always watch out for one another.

So whenever you get a chance to help someone, do it!

Even if it means going a little out of your own way, it’s incredibly rewarding. A little gesture of kindness goes a long way.

![](1*p2vMEfrJF_jN89LCT5vmPQ.gif)

## 14. They start before they’re ready.

![](1*PfngQhBZbvT4HYDUbuFddA.gif)

Lastly, like all the greats, Minions start before they’re ready. They don’t wait for the perfect moment, or until they have all the information they need, because **there is no such thing.**

They just start. Even if it means breaking a guitar or two.

![](1*KB3vkT5_NG5kWRDoFuuhDw.gif)

## Your turn!

Time to honor your inner Minion.

Giggle, giddy up and go on an adventure.

You can be an adult, or you can be a Minion.

The choice is yours.

I hope this article made you laugh and I leave while wondering: “Which one are you going to pick?”

# Believe in yourself

## Believe in yourself

### Letter to a daughter on the verge of college

Dear Roz,

I remember the day you were born - I hadn’t shaved for a few days and then didn’t sleep for the next few. Uncle Steve, not sure what the right thing to do had brought us one of those huge Palo Alto pizzas, and all of us had a good laugh even as we gobbled it down. A photo from when you were a week old shows an unshaven and sleep-deprived me holding an unbelievably tiny you in my hand.

A few months before you were born Uncle Dennis and I began training for the Bay to Breakers. I’d never run more than three miles and a month after you were born, I finished the Bay to Breakers in little over an hour. The photo from the finish line, shows a slim fellow in good shape grinning in delight. Seems like someone else altogether. So you’d begun changing my life even before you were born.

Now as you head out to college, I sense a similar life-changing event ahead of both of us. One of the many advantages of growing old is you get a chance to reflect and if you’re lucky learn from your mistakes.So as you set out for college, here are a few things I’ve learned, that hopefully prove useful to you.

**Believe in yourself** Every freshman, not just someone who travels 10,000 miles away from home, as you will, is plagued by a million doubts. Will I make friends? Will college be like high school? God no! What if I’m not able to cope? What if I’m home sick? Yes, you will make friends and yes you’ll be homesick and sure some courses will be tough and there will be days when you feel so lonely. But there will be other days, when you will be on fire, you will scintillate, you’ll be right on the money and you’ll wonder who the stranger in the mirror is — who’s charming, cool and composed. The way to get through the lows and the highs — is to believe in yourself — to know that you are capable of this and more. When you taught those autistic kids to paint — that was you. When you had that first art exhibition and sold your manga paintings, when you played soccer with the boys and kicked butt, when you topped economics and scored straight As (while feeling scared you’d fail) — that was all you. So believe in yourself at all times — there’s nothing you can’t get achieve if you set your mind to it.

**Learn by trying lots of things** Funnily, I still believe the reason we go to college (or school) is to learn how best to learn. Sure what you learn is important, but not nearly as much as knowing how you learn and how you *can* learn. So try a lot of things — audit a Japanese class, take that math class which scares you, join that *a cappella *group, try out for the soccer team. Learning happens just as much outside your classroom. Sure it’s good to stay focused and meet the requirements — that’s what your academic counselor and advisors are there to guide you (not to mention your mom and me :) If nothing else, you’ll learn how best to manage your time and to keep your head above water, most likely after you’ve swallowed a whole lot of it!

**Keep a journal **It’s amazing how easily we forget things. Keeping a journal makes it a whole lot easier to both believe in yourself and to keep track of what you’ve learned. And it may improve your writing to boot and it’s great fun to go back even a couple of weeks later, let alone at the end of the semester or the year to read what you’ve written. The bad times don’t last, the scary stuff is no longer as scary and doggone it, you’ve tried a whole lot of things and learned some to boot.

**Help others **One of the best ways to learn, make friends and overcome or get past issues we have is by helping others. You are naturally geared to do this — and maybe at times your mom and I have both said, take care of yourself first. That’s still true — if you’re sick or behind on your homework or haven’t eaten it’s hard to pay attention or help someone else. But it’s easy to get caught up with all the challenges you’re facing and drown in your own fears or worse yet feel sorry for yourself. So whether it’s helping your room mate with laundry or volunteering in the community, make time or find the opportunity to help others and you’ll find the world is suddenly a much better place.

**Have fun **Sometimes it will seem like everyone else just gets it and it’s easy for them while you’re struggling. If so see point #1 above. Even if we weren’t Indian, it’s all too easy to get caught up with school work, studying, grades and all that serious stuff. What’s the point of going to college if you don’t have fun? So don’t forget to have fun. Preferably loads of it. Some of the time fun happens and other times you’ve gotta make sure that you are doing things that are fun. Like with meals, no one else is going to ask you did you eat (now that you’re too far for your mom or me to nag you) — no one’s going to nag you to have fun. So it’s your job — to have plenty of fun.

love,
Dad

ps. Call your mom and write your dad

# How to be Patient

## How to be Patient

There is a little voice inside my head that whispers “*Faster, hurry up now, come on, everyone else is way ahead of you, get it together now, let’s go, no time to waste, why can’t you get this done already?*”

Patience is not what I’m best at.

For most of my life, I thought that patience was the same as waiting passively.

Patience felt powerless. Like giving up.

It also felt restless, itchy, and like being tied up when you wanted to run.

And then one day I asked myself, “What is Patience really about? What does it look like? How would you describe Patience to someone who didn’t know the word?”

And it occured to me that patience was really about *being kind* with the distance between where I was and where I wanted to be. It was about *choosing* to be kind with myself and others when I felt irritated and pushy about things not unfolding along my preferred timeline.

In this light, Patience didn’t feel so passive or powerless. It didn’t feel like confinement.

In this light, Patience felt like Strength, and Action.

Sometimes life takes its own time with things.

There is a distance between how things are now, and how you would like them to be.

How do you handle the gap?

Can you be kind?

You can still do all the other things — walk fast, set aggressive deadlines, send follow up emails, and the like.

Just do it in a kind way. Be relaxed about it, instead of tense and pushy and mean.

That’s how to be Patient.

# Keyless fingerprint door concept

## Keyless fingerprint door concept

### Your hand is the key you never lose!

I had this idea a long time ago, a door that opens when you touch it. it scans your hand for matching fingerprints. It’s very secure and concenient. no more keys!

the reason I decided to write about this concept was all those smartphone paired locks.Natural interfaces come with no extra. A fingerprint door lock does not need any key or phone. just bring your hands :)

![Touch area is finger print scanner. no door handle!](0*bQsNNjAIcOHiQHqh.png)*Touch area is finger print scanner. no door handle!*

In the picture above, the large area on the door can be touched. touch sensor wakes up fingerprint scanner. It scans your hand and door opens.there is no door handle. just touch and push the door.

Commercial fingerprint scanners are usually small and expensive. Having a sensor this big should be very expensive.

What if I add a door handle and integrate the fingerprint scanner into it? that would be easier to install and cheaper to make. This one is technically a bit closer to reality.

## How does it work though?

the door handle version is really simple. it works like a conventional scanner. a laser beam moves accross the handle to scan your palm/fingers. reflection of the laser beam bounces back to a image sensor via a mirror.

![Fingerprint door integrated in a handle](0*wdXxmhaeA6hRCT3c.png)*Fingerprint door integrated in a handle*

It all happens in less than a second.when you touch the handle, scanner wakes up and moves accross the handle (don’t mind my drawing skills. imagine an even width handle). It sends data for comparison during the scan. when a match found, it stops the scan and unlocks the door.

## Why bother?

### Security

Your hand is the most secure key of all time. you never lose it. You can control door access securly. You can see a log of who came in. there is no easy way of forging someone else’s hand. if your prints are logged, you did unlock the door.

### Convenience

You don’t have to think about it. just grab the handle and open the door. Users don’t need any training. Anyone 2+ age knows how to open a door. Just ask them to touch the handle for initial scan. From that point forward you can control their access to your door.

### Energy Saving and Automation

This is a smart door. it can identify individuals coming though.With an API you can do all sort of cool stuff. Like Saving energy by turning air condition off, etc. Because it knows who came in, it can be used for automation as well. For instance, with a bit of extra hardware in the house, I can define *turn TV ON when I arrive*. when combine it with a home automation, possibilities are endless.

Best interface design is the one you don’t have to think about. It’s natural.

UPDATE: I’m glad someone build the door handle concept. you can find it [here](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ultraloq-fingerprint-fob-bluetooth-smart-lock#/)

# Writing Made Easy(er)&#58; Your guide to crushing NaNoWriMo

## 

“I’ll just be here waiting for you to get back with some awesome writing on your mind… :)”

That’s what was written on the page before I started this article. It was today’s medicine, the way to try to assert a little bit of dominance over the blank page, my statement that I had at least that little bit of control — that I wouldn’t give the blank page the satisfaction of seeing me turn my back on it without at least smudging its pristine whiteness with a tiny bit of mediocre writing.

Hi, I’m Luís. I’m a writer, I’m a coach, and funnily enough, I’m a writing coach.

Writing is hard. I should know. I’ve been doing it since I was 14. I started writing about animé and manga. I started writing on forums, and my subject of choice slowly shifted from japanese stuff to video games. I was good enough that I got invited to write for some early gaming “websites”. Later, I got into med school, and I started writing about health, but never really stopped with video games. In fact, my video game writing helped out with college bills.

Finally, I started developing an interest in personal development and coaching, and eventually, as I took my first coaching course, I had already written several articles about the subject.

I eventually wrote a fantasy novel (I’d link to it, but, you know, it’s in Portuguese), and after it was published, people started commenting on how easy writing came to me. If only they knew.

Earlier this year, due to both burnout and the feeling that I was under-exploring my other passions, I decided to take a break from being a dental surgeon. This was greeted with some worry from friends and family, of course, but they relented somewhat when they noticed I wasn’t starving. I had taken to writing to pay the bills.

Guess what? It’s actually harder to write when you rely on it to put food in the table.

But I wouldn’t trade it for the world.

I know a lot of people struggle with writing. I know a lot of writers, both professional and amateur, that struggle with writing.

Maybe there are some blessed writers out there that don’t agonize over the blog post that’s due tomorrow and has gone through five drafts and still doesn’t feel right. If there are, I haven’t met them. The rest of us… Yeah. Writing is hard. Don’t worry. You’re not alone. It’s ok.

As I look back over the last page, I realize I am probably coming across as whiny. Nothing could be further from the truth. When I wonder what I would do if I lost the use of my hands, the first thought that comes to mind is if I would be able to write with my feet. Or my tongue. Or dictate to software. I love writing. After doing so much of it and with a generally positive reception, I’d even risk saying I have some small talent for it. But I won’t say it comes easily.

Writing a novel, in particular, is incredibly hard. And incredibly rewarding. As it happens, November is National Novel Writing Month ( NaNoWriMo ) in the U.S., and I know that several of my fellow writers are taking up the challenge.

My own novel started as a NaNoWriMo project, so I feel like now is the best time to give something back. What follows are, in no particular order, some tactics I use to get myself to write every day.

![](1*kb22sHgGmDyx4hfITg1wVg.jpeg)

### Decide on a writing goal

I said I would list these in no particular order, but if pressed, I’d say this is the most important thing. Anticlimactic to start with the best, isn’t it? But I aim to be useful. If your computer crashes and burns right now, you’ll have been left with the most important bit.

The goal can be either a word count or a set time. Both work great, and I’ve used them both, though I prefer the later. My problem with the word count is that on great days I finish it too quickly and then I feel like I’m cheating myself if I don’t stop, even though I feel I’m on a streak, and on bad days I keep stressing out because I’ll either have to break my promised word count or be late for appointments.

With the timer, there’s no remorse. I know the time I have allotted, and I know that my job is to sit in front of the page for that period of time. Writing is entirely optional, but I’m not allowed to do anything else. No, no polishing the white tennis shoe. No, no checking facebook or twitter. No, no research! Just write it wrong and correct when revising.

Writer’s block can’t survive an encounter with boredom.

My recommendation is: try both approaches and figure out what works best for you.

![](1*v2tol-X69LO3CzhSA1d-nA.jpeg)

### Write Anything, And Never Get Up Without Writing Something

See the top of this article? That’s legit. That’s exactly what I did — things were bad, so I decided to go do some cycling and take a warm shower (read below), but I would not allow the white page to sit there taunting me.

When you don’t know what to write, write anything. Write a conversation with the page, write what you had for lunch, write your to-do list for tomorrow… Just let the words flow.

Nine times out of ten, you’ll pick up the groove and pressed on. The one time out of ten? At least you’ll have written something. You didn’t give up. You’re a *writer*. Take THAT, blank page!

![](1*zHElUUZQ106bl7PbDpYApw.jpeg)

### Move Your Body

The best and quickest way to charge up your creativity is to get up — stand up straight as an arrow — and walk away. Open your arms, stretch, shadow-punch the air a couple of times.

If you can, go hit a punching bag, or kick a soccer ball against a wall. Go out for a run. Failing all that, go play the Wii.

Sometimes we stress ourselves out, or we place too much pressure on ourselves, or maybe we’re just mad at the world in general or a specific part of it. Whatever the reason, stuff is happening inside our brain — chemical stuff, emotional stuff, the works — that doesn’t let us focus on writing.

Physical exercise works wonders. It cleanses your brain chemistry and has your body produce focus-boosting substances. It will also force you to breathe deeper and longer, further oxygenating your brain cells.

Take care of your body and it will take care of your writing.

![](1*2bIEmWqUoL6KX5kADe0EQA.jpeg)

### Or, You Know, Relax and Have A Drink

Now, I wouldn’t suggest you develop a coffee habit — or even worse, a drinking habit — as a way to facilitate your writing. But if you already enjoy a nice cup of coffee and / or a vintage glass of wine, it will likely pay off to make it part of your writing ritual.

I know many writers that use a glass of Port to take the edge off their after-dinner writing sessions, and I know even more that feel that the world is a completely different place depending on whether or not they have their cup of coffee when they sit down to write in the morning.

Me? I’ll have my coffee in the morning, my tea in the afternoon, and my Muscat in the evenings. You won’t see me in front of the page without a drink.

![](1*eV3vCwA1s8L1d61FTjgj1w.jpeg)

### Feed Your Mind Good Stuff

Inspiration won’t sprout from a barren mind. Reading a book, either a new one or an old favorite, is sure to help if the creative juices aren’t flowing. But that’s not the only thing that goes.

Feed your mind lots of diferent good stuff. Go watch a stand up comedy show. Play some video games. Go out to the movies. Sit through a lecture about a subject you don’t understand, and try to pay attention, to unravel that weird, alien concept you are paying witness to.

You don’t know where your next idea will come from, but it will likely be from a wonderful and strange mix of a physics lecture, a World of Warcraft quest, and a Danny DeVito scene.

![](1*vTcgFe6XN2R51ifkQGTBVg.jpeg)

### Bonus Material

Stephen King’s “[On Writing](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B000FC0SIM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1446562912&sr=1-1&keywords=stephen+king+oN+writing)” and Ann Pratchett’s “[The Getaway Car](http://www.amazon.com/The-Getaway-Car-Practical-Writing-ebook/dp/B005JEXTBO)” have been of tremendous importance to my craft. You will find therein amazing advice from legendary writers. You won’t — and should not — follow all of it, but you are sure to come into important insights of your own as you read them.

Setting a goal, keeping to it — that’s where the writing magic is born.

# Do you know you are Beautiful?

## Do you know you are Beautiful?

Have you seen those Dove commercials? The ones promoting beauty in all forms. How about the one with the beauty bar and the ladies who avoid mirrors for 7 days. To come back to their own reflection and see whatever difference there is. There is much more to see in the meaning of that thought though. How we look into the mirror and tend to breakdown the reflection into pieces to be fixed. We look to our wrinkles, scars, stretch-marks, the hair on our arms, how short or long our eyelashes are, the pimple coming in, as things that must be wrong with us. That these parts of our body are something “wrong” that we need to change. It’s okay to want to deal with that pimple, it sucks, but it’s in your life for the short-term at the very least. The scar might be from a fall you took as a child, the chicken pox that you scratched[I have that beside my eyebrow plus few from my cat]. The stretch-marks may be from pregnancy or if you’re like me, weight gain and loss and then stuck with me from my childhood years :P

Do people like to hear the truth? The filthy and not so pretty parts? Sometimes, though as a society we do often like to sweep those truths under the rug. We like our photoshop[heck, I like it too!] We love our reality TV and the people who are perceived as so very perfect. But you know what, there are many who actually do prefer the not so pretty side. To know that they are not alone. That those scars and everything else I wrote above are the norm and not the exception!

As asked in the title. Do you know you are beautiful? I don’t always, I will be frank. I’ve had many a man…or boy[how ever you’d like to perceive them] tell me that I am perfect just as I am and then some who might say I have a pretty face but that they could never love the body that goes with it. I’m curvy — I’m fat — I’m overweight[though overweight of what exactly? I do not know] I have a pretty smile and a nice butt. What of those stretch-marks though and that tummy that isn’t even nearly flat. Are these things I can smile or cry about? I’ve done both, usually in the company of myself. I sometimes will believe I am ugly and hate on every inch of myself, the parts I can see and the ones hidden from my view.

I will go back to it again. Do….you…know…that…you…are…beautiful? Because even with my down days I sure do now. I know that the things that make up my body and how it looks are amazing. Every little bit of it tells my story — where I have come from and what my life has entailed. The colour of my eyes, the length of my lashes, the amount of hair on my arms — these things come from my parents and my grandparents and their parents and so on. They have been passed down in genes and moulded over time, they have possibly be dormant for years and I could be the first to have that in the last 5 generations. These things that I may wish to hide are precious and they are me. I am so darn lucky to have them so that I may show the world the unique person that is me. Just as you are and can. Your natural curls or thin lips, these qualities of your body are yours to own.

I can write it a thousand times and you still might not believe it to be true but it really is. I don’t want you to think of beauty as a perfect skin, silky hair thing. Beauty is you. It is who you are when you wakeup — It is who you are when you take your makeup off or put it on. Beauty is you if you just believe it and trust in yourself. You are not stuck up to love yourself, you are powerful and amazing. I hope that you can see that. That one day, maybe not today, that you can look in the mirror and not breakdown the imperfections to things for fixing. That you can see them as they truly are, the story of you. The you built over time the one the is worth loving no matter what.

Because you know what? Darlin….I know you are beautiful even if you don’t realize it yet.

# Make Your Day More Productive and Less Stressful

## Here’s how setting priorities for your day can make your day MORE productive and LESS stressful.

![Actual Screenshot of My Asana Progress Chart at the End of a Recent More Productive and Less Stressful Day](1*_Eq1OKxKSDiUL-YfEbxldA.png)*Actual Screenshot of My Asana Progress Chart at the End of a Recent More Productive and Less Stressful Day*

Most people think making their day more productive also means ADDING stress to the day. That doesn’t have to be the case. By setting priorities for your day, you can actually become MORE PRODUCTIVE and LESS STRESSED at the same time.

Setting priorities for your day allows you to -

1 — Determine your most important tasks (MIT’s) that need to get done that day

2 — Set realistic expectations for what you can accomplish in a day

3 — Stay focused throughout the day

4 — Stay motivated throughout the day

5 — Enjoy a feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day

6 — Rest and recharge

### Determine Your Most Important Tasks (MIT’s)

I’m a big fan of Zen Habits and thought I’d let them [take the lead on describing why determining you MIT’s is important](http://zenhabits.net/unprocrastination-mits/)—

“In the context of procrastination, it’s easy to put off doing important things by doing a lot of smaller tasks, or incoming tasks that might seem urgent. But that means the important stuff gets pushed back.

Picking an (MIT) means part of your job is done: you know what you should be working on, and you know that if you’re not working on it, you’re procrastinating. So then all you have to do is start (we’ll get to that next week).

Picking out an (MIT) means you have thought through your priorities, and you know what makes the biggest difference in your work and life in general.

It’s also a rewarding way to start your day — pick a Most Important Task, and get it done!”

### Set Realistic Expectations

I don’t know about you, but I always seem to set unrealistic expectations for myself, when it comes to thinking about how much I can get done in the day. In the morning, the day’s potential seems limitless.

However, as the day progresses, the reality of time begins to emerge. As a result, I always find myself feeling like I’m falling behind where I should be, which results in stress piling up throughout the day.

I’ve come to the conclusion that setting a maximum of 3–6 priorities for the day is the right number of tasks we can realistically expect to accomplish in a day.

3 work MIT’s and 3 administrative or personal MIT’s seems to be the right mix, to match the level of effort required to get the tasks done and the amount of time and brainpower available to us each day.

(BTW, since reading [Your Brain at Work](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6899290-your-brain-at-work), by David Rock, I truly believe that we only have a finite amount of brain processing power available to us at any given time and that it needs to be recharged on a regular basis.

David also [suggests that it’s important to reserve time to set priorities](http://fortune.com/2015/06/30/ryan-smith-productivity/), to maximize the brain power processing resources available to us.)

### Stay focused throughout the day

OK, so that’s all neat and tidy right?

How about when the distractions of the day start to hit fast and furiously and the day starts going off the rails…THEN WHAT?

Well, I’m glad you asked :)

When that happens, which it does and will, come back to your list and bring your focus back to your priorities.

You may be surprised at first how difficult, yet at the same time rewarding, returning to your list of priorities really is. Your list of priorities quickly become the anchor in the storm of your tumultuous day.

### Stay Motivated Throughout the Day

You know, there’s something intrinsically satisfying about the simple act of checking off an MIT from your list of priorities as you complete it. Doing this simple act helps you stay motivated throughout the day by giving you -

* A boost of endorphins

* The satisfaction of getting something accomplished

* The motivation to move on to the next task, unless that WAS your last task

### Feel Accomplished at the End of the Day

You know that nagging feeling that starts to emerge as the end of the day approaches? The one that says you haven’t gotten nearly enough done today and now the day’s almost over?

The satisfaction of having completed (or even having ALMOST completed) your list of priorities chases that feeling away. You can now rest in the satisfaction that you’ve accomplished your most important tasks for the day.

### I’m Done, Now What?! — Rest and Recharge

Wow! You’ve completed your list of most important tasks and it’s not even the end of the work day yet?

Fantastic :)

What do you do now with that restless feeling that tells you should do more…moRE…MORE?

RESIST IT!

Go do something to reduce your stress even further and increase your well-being like -

* Exercise

* Meditate

* Spend time with the important people in your life

You’ll now be able to do these things AND be present as you do them, since you can rest in the assurance that -

* Your MIT’s for the day are completed

* You’ll be setting tomorrow’s priorities tomorrow

This is so much more rewarding than -

* Constantly beating yourself up about not getting enough done during the day

* Fighting the urge to do more

* Worrying about what needs to be done tomorrow

# A Scientific Method to Your Madness

## Using trial and error to be more effective and efficient

![](1*18WX8gx1de8m5dJOx6vXKA.jpeg)

It happened again!

Despite all my planning and preparation the prior weekend, I sat stewing in my impending tardiness, frustrated with the car in front of me. If it’d just inch up, I could make my meeting on time. Frantic as I pulled into a parking spot, I quickly glanced at the 08:56am on the dashboard.

I shoved my notepads and cords into my bag and watched sticky notes tumble to the floor as I pushed the car door open and scurried past the payment kiosk.

Simultaneously, I felt guilty about not paying and slightly anxious about becoming a meter-maid success. *It’s just a short meeting.*

*I’ll be quick!* I reasoned. *I’ll put extra time on the ticket and leave it for the next person.*

My eyes glanced impatiently around my make-shift office space as my computer warmed up. Working remotely was often a risk. *Will it be too loud? Do I have my headset? Will there be an outlet?*

Quickly bypassing a pop-up notification to update my operating system, I watched the icon bounce with bated breath. My fingers flew across the keyboard and in seconds, a grey profile avatar sat quiet in the corner of the screen. My eyes darted to the clock. 9:02am. Mentally I clocked in.

“If you’re on time, you’re late!” the stern voice of my German college professor echoed through my mind before I heard an internal voice state with conviction,* 9:02 is more punctual than last week’s 9:06. Huzzah!*

At 9:04am, I sent a quick welcoming email and a follow-up confirmation message to an empty chat.* I’m here!* I felt my shoulders slightly melt with relief; I’d made contact. Absentmindedly scrolling through emails awaiting response, I waited. At 9:09am, I chose to switch gears to tackling administrative tasks. Definitely not my preferred element of working independently, but a necessary part of maintaining my business. I logged into my new scheduling software and felt my throat tighten. A blank calendar stared back at me.

No meeting at 9am. Navigating through the unfamiliar site, I found my 9am appointment on the schedule for **next** Monday. In a rush of surprise, frustration, relief and confusion, I instantly regretted the hasty email and Skype message. I mentally shook my fist at cars who’d inched through traffic. I scowled at the vision of my morning Self rolling underneath covers, snoozing and shoving my phone under my pillow.

![[http://www.imgion.com/monday-garfield/](http://www.imgion.com/monday-garfield/)](1*xWNi2i1KFkAaCZebzRqgtQ.jpeg)*[http://www.imgion.com/monday-garfield/](http://www.imgion.com/monday-garfield/)*

Deflated, I returned to my hastily-parked car to find a canary-colored ticket silently tweeting about my civil violation.

Monday — 2.

Makeda — 0.

~~~~

Ah, the incredibly steep learning curve of transitioning from an employee to a self-managed freelancer.

Remember the last time you started your day with an ultimate intention of completing your most important tasks? You planned to be at work on time and prepared. Somewhere along the way, your focus and attention were swept up by a whirlwind of events. The next thing you knew, you’re moments before a deadline, stressed and unprepared. Worse, the week is over and you’re not sure what happened or what’s next.

This is both a gift and a curse of being self-employed. You are free to pursue your ideas and create what you can, often operating on your own terms. It also means you are your own boss (which can mean financial analyst, bookkeeper, and HR manager all in one). The external deadlines, monthly reviews and performance evaluations — typically set by a manager — are now absent, leaving you with rose-colored glasses about how effectively you work.

Once you step into the world around you (digitally or physically), you are inundated with tasks, messages and content. Yes, you can handle it…often to a manageable extent. But building proficient and effective management systems for your business can often feel like drudgery.

How can you manage the whirlwind? What makes you an effective manager AND an efficient employee? Why is it so hard to do daily?

Thwarted efforts due to ineffective habits are enough to drive one mad.

## Insert the Scientific Method

Even in a digital era of the 21st century, a process from ancient times serves as an effective tool in approaching undesirable outcomes. The Scientific Method (yes, a la high school Chemistry) allows you to analyze the outcome in two important steps:

1. asking an important question about current outcomes, and

1. experimenting with small measurable actions that can make a big difference.

There’s infinite hope embedded in this approach. Any one of your mishmash of mishaps can be transformed into a variable that leads to discovering new ways of operating. New observations or understandings may now conflict with your longest-standing theories.

I get it. No one likes being wrong.

“I was born late — it runs in my family.” While default explanations (read: excuses) can offer brief internal validation and appease the newly acquainted, they’re not very effective in building an independent initiative.** **Simply convincing yourself that you are, in fact, able to manage the multitude of daily tasks necessary in building a successful business won’t help either.

### Let’s consider a common challenge.

**Observation**: I have a lot of things on my To-Do list. Many days, I try to complete the items on my calendar, but I get distracted by devices, frustrated with my limited progress, and burnt out staring at a screen all day.

**Question**: Why can’t I just sit down and do what’s on my schedule?

**Do Background Research**: The last time I sat down to work, I

* scrolled through FB/Instagram, watched a few videos (some related, most unrelated).

* forgot to pack my lunch so I walked to the cafe. I checked my email on my phone while I waited, a notification popping up from an elementary school friend. I proceeded to scroll through 9 months of her recent photos. ***sigh***

**Hypothesis**: I predict that if I close all other browsers immediately before beginning my work session, I will complete 80% of the tasks on my to-do list this week.

![](1*l354dBJBk0qegIt80SXI4Q.jpeg)

**Method**: This week, I will put a sticky note on my computer trackpad with a reminder to close ***all*** other tabs.

(Or: Set a recurring pop-up alarm from my online calendar to focus. Hire a coach and send them a message at the beginning of my daily work session.)

**Results**: I successfully remembered to close ***all*** other tabs 4 times during the week. I made progress on multiple projects.

**Discussion**: Am I done with everything? Not completely.

Am I 100% ready? No.

I have, however, made progress. And I feel awesome about doing what I said I’d do. I feel like a BOSS. Ah yes. I AM my boss.

I was so relieved when I found Coach.me (then Lift). I was not alone! OK. I *was* alone in the cafe, kitchen, library. However, tapping into an online platform specifically geared toward getting stuff DONE was a game changer. It actually made it a game. While I’m not expecting a celebration for flossing today, a community’s props for tiny personal milestones is often enough to send sufficient dopamine to pump me up for my next task.

I’ll take it.

## Test it out.

### Turn your question into theory.

What can you do just a little differently this week?

Experiment! Try something small.

One small shift can make a big difference in the way you work.

# Budget Friendly Fitness

## 

The economy is taking a toll on everyone these days so while your wallet may be “unhealthy” it is important to keep the mind and body healthy through these tough times… with exercise. Exercise will reduce your stress, help you manage your weight, strengthen your heart and lungs, combat chronic disease therefore eliminating expensive medical bills, and promote better sleep just to name a few benefits. Here are 5 surefire ways to “recession proof” your workouts.

**1) Transform Household Items into Gym Equipment**

· Canned Goods can serve as hand weights

· Water or Milk bottles can be filled with water or sand for dumbbells

· Stairs or step stools can be used to build strong legs

· Chairs can be used for tricep dips or inclined push-ups

· Paper Plates can be used to help you slide on carpet so you can do a sliding lunge or try to simulate skating to work your butt and thighs

· Walls can be used for wall sits

· Bodyweight can be used for any number of exercises squats, push-ups, mountain climbers, lunges, jumping jacks, burpees, all corework

**2) Splurge on Equipment**

If you have a few extra dollars to spend, here are a few items that will give you the most benefits for the least amount of money.

· A Dumbbell set with a realistic range of what you can lift (5–30lbs for women, 10–50lbs for men)

· Weight Bench (adjustable that can go flat, inclined, or declined)- buy used or check our listings in the local newspaper or online

· Kettlebells

· Resistant Bands- stretchy tubes that offer weight-like resistance when you pull them.

· Jump Rope- an excellent cardiovascular workout

· Instructional DVDs (or get at your local library for free)- create the feel of an aerobic or strength class

· Stability Ball- great for balance and core stability, can also double as a bench

· Medicine Balls

When starting a workout program, you may have a hard time figuring out what exercises you should do especially with no personal trainer or equipment. However, it is very simple. Make sure you target all your major muscle groups(quads, hamstrings, glutes, back, chest, biceps, triceps, shoulders, and core) at least once a week 2–3x would be optimal. This may seem like a lot of muscles to hit but there are many exercises that target more than one group. For example squats and lunges will hit all the muscles in the legs and they can all be done in your living room. If you are short on time, try combining two arm exercises into one for example do a bicep curl and then push the weights up and overhead for a shoulder press. And don’t forget about aerobic exercise 30–60 minutes 3–5 times a week whether it is walking, biking, jogging, climbing your stairs etc. anything that gets your heart rate up.

**3) Invest in a Gym or Personal Trainer**

This may seem counterintuitive when trying to save money but if you have a membership to a gym or a standing appointment with a personal trainer, you will be less likely to skip out on your workouts. You will also have extra motivation to get through your workouts especially if you find a gym buddy or have a personal trainer holding you accountable.

**4) Use the Internet**

If you need someone to help you set fitness goals and force you to workout but absolutely cannot afford that gym membership or personal trainer the computer can be a very useful tool. You can find all kinds of free workout plans and exercise-tracking tools on many websites. You can use them to create and maintain a training routine, keep track of your progress, and if you need encouragement you can share your plans with friends, family, or fellow exercisers.

For how-to instructions for specific exercises, check out WebMD’s fitness slideshow, youtube, or google the exercise under images.

One word of warning when using the internet, be careful who you take advice from. Make sure the instructor or demonstrator is certified by a reputable fitness company or organization.

**5) Everyday Opportunities**

Activities that you may take for granted can quickly turn into a part of your exercise routine.

· Move: Take a walk every day whether it is around the neighborhood or to run your errands. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park further away from all your destinations

· Household Chores: Mow the lawn, weed the garden, rake leaves, shovel snow or if you are indoors vaccum the entire house or scrub the floors just get your heart rate up.

· Play: If you have children, don’t watch them play join in! Tag, kickball, biking, dancing, baseball….

· Watching TV: Take each commercial break as an exercise break. Do crunches, squats, push-ups etc. for the entire commercial break

As you can see leading a healthy life is not only easy, but affordable!

# How to Get Over The Habit Hump

## image credit

Do you often run out of motivation when trying to build new habits like meditation, exercise, or quitting sugar? Maybe you do alright for a week or two but then it gets harder and harder and you begin to cheat more often until eventually, you quit completely.

For some habits though, you’ve probably had the opposite experience — sure it was hard in the beginning but eventually, you got the hang of it and maintaining it wasn’t that hard.

So what’s the difference in both cases? Why is it sometimes so difficult to get over that “hump” to where the habit becomes easier and eventually automatic?

## The Hump

What’s the hump? It’s the point where working on the habit turns from a struggle to a more pleasant activity. Usually, that moment comes when we start seeing positive results from the habit.

![](0*kc7unPzSGVW5eIQl.)

When we first start, it usually feels easy for a couple of days. We have just set the new goal and we’re feeling motivated. We can see the better future and how we’re going to achieve it.

But after a few days, it starts to get a little harder. The amount of effort we have to put in increases significantly.

Practically that might mean that we don’t feel like going to the gym, we’re not in the mood for meditation, or we start to get cravings for junky foods. The more time we keep working on it the harder it becomes and the less motivation we have to continue. This is “the hump” that we have to overcome with each new habit that we’re building.

Overcoming that initial resistance feels like trying to climb a very steep mountain. We keep climbing but we can’t see the peak yet. We’re on the side of the mountain so we don’t have a good view of our progress. We keep grinding but it doesn’t feel like we’re moving at all.

That’s one of the hardest periods to overcome. That’s where most people give up — before they even see any results.

## Getting to the Results

What happens if we don’t give up though? What if we keep pushing through the resistance and keep climbing the mountain?

We eventually get to see a positive result from our effort. For example, you glance in the mirror and you notice for the first time that you have more muscle definition. You put on a pair of pants and you feel that they’re looser than before. You are in the middle of an argument but instead of blowing up and getting mad, you stop your default reaction and mindfully resolve the conflict.

That first moment of seeing the results of our labor is critical. It’s like climbing a mountain for weeks and suddenly catching a glimpse of the peak. This is usually the moment where we feel a huge rush of motivation and we want to keep going. This is the moment when the resistance starts to drop, instead of continuing to build up.

## Motivation

Another way of looking at “the hump” is through our motivation levels.

When we first start, naturally we’re pumped and the motivation is very high. But the longer we keep going without seeing any positive results, the more the motivation starts to wane.

![](0*t8nPRjxUzb8net17.)

Most of the time we don’t have enough natural motivation to get to the point where we see results. Then we quit and feel disappointed in ourselves.

In a few months, we get some initial motivation to try again, but that runs out pretty quickly too and it turns into the same pattern.

I was in a similar cycle for a lot of years trying to build some muscle mass (I’m naturally a skinny guy). I always started with a lot of motivation, going to the gym every day and trying to improve my diet. I did really well for a month or so but that wasn’t enough time to see any results and eventually lost the motivation and stopped going to the gym.

Then a year or so later I would get the same impulse to go and improve my body again, and the cycle would repeat.

Only last year, when I decided to really push myself and find accountability to help me on the way, did I manage to get to the “results point”. I still remember the first time I saw a noticeable improvement in the mirror. And that moment from seeing the result and feeling like I’m in control is still keeping me going today.

Here’s the important part: it’s not about knowing it intellectually, it’s about FEELING it experientially.

Everybody knows that if you lift weights, eventually your muscles will grow and you will get stronger. If you have a good diet you will lose fat. If you practice meditation you will be more mindful. But knowing it intellectually does nothing for your motivation. The motivation comes only when you see and feel the manifested result.

## Feeling in Control

The moment where we see actual results is also the moment when we realize that what we’re doing is actually working.

When we start doing a new habit like a new diet, new type of meditation, or exercise we believe that is going to get us to the goal we want. But there is no way to know for sure if that path is going to take us to our goal.

Maybe we follow a diet 100% of the time and it does nothing for us. Maybe the type of meditation just ends up being a waste of time. Maybe we follow the wrong exercise plan and we end up injured.

Until we see a real positive result in our life that uncertainty is always going to be there, and it’s going to increase. The constant doubt keeps coming in the form of questions like, “Why am I doing this in the first place? Am I doing it right? Is this the right strategy? What if there was an easier way?”

All of that changes when we feel and see the positive results. At that point instead of taking shots in the dark, we know that the strategy we’re using is bringing us measurable results. We know it’s working. And we know if we keep doing it, it’s going to keep working. That’s when we start feeling in control of our goals.

The feeling of control is what keeps us motivated to continue. Can you FEEL the difference between walking on a path that you KNOW is going to take you to your goal, versus one that *might* take you there?

## Getting Over the Hump

So what can we do to boost our motivation so it lasts long enough until we start feeling the positive results? How can we keep going through the resistance for long enough to get over the hump and start feeling in control?

### Get a Mentor

One of the most important things is to get a realistic view of how long it usually takes to get to the “results point”. In most cases, we vastly underestimate what it takes. We don’t see all the potential challenges along the way and we assume that the path will be smooth.

Getting a mentor who has already experienced some of the results is a great way to start. That’s much easier than it sounds. Say you’re trying to build more muscle — you don’t have to talk to Mr. Olympia to get some feedback. Just talk to a guy who looks a bit more ripped than you do. Even if he’s a terrible teacher, he will have a better idea of how long it will take you and what the path looks like because he’s already been there.

Don’t limit yourself to just one mentor — the more feedback you get from different sources the more accurate your “map” will be.

### Notice the Secondary Positive Results

Often we focus only on the big outcome that we want, like lose 30 pounds, and that becomes our only measure. So we exercise every day and eat a healthy diet for a few weeks but the scale isn’t budging and we feel terrible about it.

But what about all the other small results that come from improving the diet? Even if you didn’t lose any weight, did you notice anything else improving?

Maybe your energy levels increased. Maybe your skin looks more clear. Maybe you don’t feel sleepy in the afternoon anymore. All of these are smaller results that can help us stay motivated and keep up the good habit until we start seeing the “main results.”

![](0*Zxr8CWqy3dQepOC9.)

Feeling even a little bit of motivation from each secondary result will help to go through the resistance longer. Maybe even long enough to get to the big result that you want.

### Keep adjusting your strategy

As we said, most things that we try won’t work. We always start by trying a bunch of strategies and action steps, but we have no guarantee that they’ll produce the desired results.

If you’ve picked the wrong strategy, no matter for how long you keep extending the motivation and look for the “results point”, it’s not going to happen.

That’s why we have to constantly adjust and tweak our strategy to get to the goal. If something doesn’t work, try approaching it from a different angle.

In my muscle gaining example, I was missing a critical piece — getting enough calories. In order for your muscles to grow, you need to supply them with enough raw materials. So as long as I was missing that piece I was never going to reach the “results point”.

Only after experimenting a lot with different diets and eating schedules I started seeing positive results.

No matter what the goal or habit you’re working on is, you can be sure that there is a path to get you there. Just like climbing any mountain, you can be sure that there is a way to get to the top.

We just have to keep looking for the right path and keep working through the resistance until we catch a glimpse of the peak.

# Firefox vs. Chrome&#58; Which Browser Will Make You The Most Productive?

## Firefox vs. Chrome: Which Browser Will Make You The Most Productive?

If you open 500 web pages a day and lose two seconds every time one loads, that’s almost 17 minutes down the drain.

That may not sound so bad, but let’s factor in [mental switching cost](https://betterhumans.coach.me/this-is-the-best-way-to-focus-backed-by-research-5ae6a130f019). Because what do you do in those two seconds? You think of something else. Or open another tab. And that can easily derail your work in that original tab for 20 minutes.

Clearly, browsing speed matters. It’s what has dominated [comparisons](http://mashable.com/2017/11/15/google-chrome-vs-firefox-quantum/#pH3bkPmi0aqg) between [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) so far. That said, it’s not the only aspect that matters when choosing a browser that’ll help you — or keep you from — doing your best work.

Hence, here’s a short, subjective comparison of the two in four aspects: speed, simplicity, usefulness and synchronicity. I’m a long-time Chrome user, but [have spent the past three weeks using Firefox](https://medium.com/@ngoeke/how-to-set-up-firefox-for-simple-productivity-7cd3e87aa3f0) to see how it feels.

Let’s find out which one works best for work!

## 1. Speed

If it’s named Firefox Quantum, it better be fast — and it is. Firefox wins the speed game, hands down. That shouldn’t be a big surprise, as [performance was the team’s main concern](https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/a-quantum-achievement-d7aa759a0ccb).

Yes, [speed depends on the task](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/firefox-quantum-vs-chrome), but in general, for loading web pages, I immediately noticed Firefox being way faster. More often than in Chrome, they appear in one drop, rather than piece by piece.

It also seems to use slightly less RAM for normal browsing. Under high stress, like playing video for a long time, my [Macbook](https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-set-up-your-mac-for-focused-work-ab3565750059) seems to breathe less heavily in Chrome.

## Score: Firefox ★★★★★ || Chrome ★★★✩✩

## 2. Simplicity

Firefox is also wonderfully simple. It reminds me of an Apple product, because it’s so intuitive. For example, you can just drop any page on the home icon to the left of the URL bar and it’ll instantly become your new home page.

![](1*CQfJ4-_70P1QlM5QxmnnGA.png)

There are just four categories of settings and lots of features like taking screenshots, saving pages to Pocket or sharing links via email are built-in.

When you open the settings in Chrome, the first thing you see is a search bar, just for the settings section, which is revealing in itself. Scroll down to ‘Advanced’ and the party really gets going.

Accessibility features, hardware acceleration, prediction features, most people don’t need these things and only end up breaking stuff by touching the wrong knobs.

## Score: Firefox ★★★★★ || Chrome ★★★★✩

## 3. Usefulness

When it comes to utility, however, the tables quickly turn. Because it’s so customizable, Chrome feels almost limitless.

The selection of Firefox Add-Ons pales in comparison to Chrome’s 50,000+ extensions. Besides designing your toolbar, picking a theme and pinning a few functions to your Overflow menu, there’s not much you can do.

In Chrome you can adapt *anything* to *your* needs. Show LinkedIn profiles in Gmail? [Check](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rapportive/hihakjfhbmlmjdnnhegiciffjplmdhin). Customize Bitcoin trading charts? [Check](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bittrex-enhanced/opefelljddckamffnphohkknfgbdnham). Figure out hex color codes on any page? [Check](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg).

Even among Swiss Army knives, there are simple ones, and, well…

![](1*l1L_8KLmPUhDHVcnzjtmYQ.png)

![Images from Amazon](1*iZXuniWImDVrY7U2INd_nQ.png)*Images from Amazon*

## Score: Firefox ★★★✩✩ || Chrome ★★★★★

## 4. Synchronicity

First, what do I mean by synchronicity? Today, we all have 257 different accounts on different sites. While all browsers enable you to save passwords and login data, some make that easier than others.

I found that Firefox kicks me out of accounts more frequently than Chrome. Plus, since Chrome is a Google product, everything linked to your Google account, which, for me, is most things, works seamlessly.

Both browsers enable you to sync your work to other devices and pick up where you left off, but when it comes to how ‘plugged in’ you are, Chrome has a slight edge — no pun intended.

## Score: Firefox ★★★★✩ || Chrome ★★★★★

## The Verdict

If you use your computer like me — excessively — switch tasks a lot and need more of a powerhouse, rather than a browser that’s *just* fast, Chrome is your obvious choice. You can customize it ad infinitem and switch between your marketing hat, artist hat and dad-really-needs-to-watch-some-Netflix-now hat in seconds.

Firefox, on the other hand, does one thing and it does it extremely well: allow you to zip around the web at lightning speed. If you’re a trader, researcher, or writer who doesn’t use a lot of media, this browser is perfect for you. You can configure a simple productivity setup in a few clicks, use the built-in tools for the rest, and off you go.

The most interesting idea I’ve had in the past three weeks however, is this:
> # Use different browsers for different work.

Why not do your trading in Firefox, while writing in Chrome? Use one for surfing, one for managing your website. Strip Firefox naked and just read, then customize Chrome to the brim and go on a coding spree.

In the end, all browsers are just tools and we should never let politics, opinions, or taste get in the way of using the right one.

Chrome is an RV, Firefox is a Model S. Both will get you across the whole country, but which one you get into should depend entirely on why you want to go in the first place.

# How to Leverage the Power of Curiosity to Build Relationships and Generate Breakthrough…

## Photo by Dmitry Ratushny on Unsplash.

Somewhere along the line, the concept of “curiosity” got a bad rap. For example, you’ve probably heard the famous saying, **“Curiosity killed the cat.” **Judging by that belief, curiosity’s bad thing; something to be avoided.

The problem is, “curiosity killed the cat” is only half the saying. When you trace it back to it’s origins, you’ll find it actually says something to the effect of …

**Curiosity killed the cat, but *satisfaction brought it back*.**

Here at Mindmaven, we believe curiosity is one of the most powerful concepts in relationship marketing and network management. In fact, it’s the foundation of almost everything we teach our clients.

In this article, I’m going to dive into why I believe curiosity is such a powerful trait. But beyond that, I’m also going to teach you three ways to boost your natural curiosity and become a more curious person.

Let’s get started.

## Curiosity: The Most Powerful Word in Relationship Marketing

So why’s curiosity so important?

First and foremost, **curious people are intrigued by new and different ideas. **They’re fascinated in how things work, and by truly understanding situations and people.

As a result, curious people tend to be open-minded people; and only someone with a truly open mind can fully generate and leverage breakthrough opportunities from their network.

Think about it: When you’re curious, you ask questions. And **by asking questions, you become the leader of a conversation.** You can move it in practically any direction, while still providing an exceptional experience to the person you’re talking with.

After all, when you’re the one asking questions, you’re only taking up around 20% of the “talking time,” while the other person — who is *answering* your questions — takes up *80%* of the “talking time.”

And here’s the kicker: Research has shown that **people who talk for 50% of the conversation or more have a much higher propensity of reporting a positive experience about not only the meeting, but about you as well.**

When you’re curious, you [actively listen to the other person](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/active-listening/); and **nothing builds trust and deepens relationships quite as effectively as allowing the other person to feel truly heard and valued**.

## Three Ways to Send Your Curiosity Through the Roof

Alright, so we’ve covered why curiosity is valuable; but let’s recap the three primary benefits of practicing curiosity:

* You make the other person feel heard and valued.

* By making the other person feel heard and valued, you deepen the relationship and build trust, and

* By deepening the relationship and building trust, you increase the likelihood of generating the breakthrough opportunities you need from your network to reach your fullest potential.

But some of you might be thinking, “I’m just not a curious person by nature.” To that, I say “BS.”

**Humans are, by their very nature, curious creatures.** For proof, look no further than children: Kids have an *insatiable* need to understand how things work. Anyone who has ever heard a 2-year-old ask “Why?” (for the 15th time in a row) can attest to that.

Curiosity is built into us but, so often, we lose our natural curiosity as we become adults. Societal expectations teach us to limit questions and accept things as they are.

The good news is, **that child-like curiosity is *still in you***; it just needs to be rekindled. And with that in mind, here’s three ways to send your natural curiosity through the roof.

## #1: Create Awareness When You Notice Something of Interest

To some extent, curiosity happens on a daily basis. It’s that small spark in your mind that comes to life when you find something interesting, or when you start to ask, “Why?”

But if — like many people — you don’t feed that spark, it’ll never become a fire.

So here’s my first tip: Any time you notice that small spark, consciously label those thoughts as “Curiosity.” This label will become a trigger and, anytime you notice it, develop a habit of [asking yourself one or two questions that dig a little deeper](http://www.mindmaven.com/blog/9-ways-to-connect-with-anyone/).

For example, if you feel that spark in the middle of a conversation, you might ask questions like …

* “What do you mean by that?”

* “What makes you say that?”

* “What experience led you to believe this?”

These questions allow you to drill deeper into the topic at hand and create that sense of satisfaction that “brings the cat back.”

## #2: Celebrate Your Curiosity

Any time you make an entertaining or valuable discovery as a result of your curiosity, celebrate it! Appreciate the fact that you only discovered this as a result of asking questions and feeding your curiosity.

Keep in mind, this celebration doesn’t need to be anything major. Simply **taking the time to acknowledge and appreciate the full extent of the discovery is all it takes**.

By doing so, you start to undo the damage done by a world that tries to dampen curiosity in favor of quiet obedience. By celebrating these small victories, you’ll find it easier to tap into and leverage your curiosity throughout your day-to-day life.

## #3: Practice Proactive Curiosity

Even without the wealth of scientific studies to back this statement, I’d be 100% confident in saying that **those who are proactive in life tend to be much more successful than those who are reactive**.

I’ve simply seen the positive effects of proactivity — and the negative effects of reactivity — in life too many times to deny it. And that’s why I highly recommend practicing proactive curiosity.

So what is proactive curiosity? In a nutshell, it means **picking a topic you’re genuinely interested in and proactively seeking knowledge related to that topic.**

This can be done in a personal and/or professional setting, but let me give you an example of how you might practice this in your career.
> Let’s say you’re curious about how the recruiting process works for the types of clients you serve. Now, you aren’t a recruiter so this knowledge isn’t directly applicable to your industry. But by understanding more about their recruiting process, you may uncover ways you can better serve them. In fact, you may even find ways you can improve your own recruiting process.
> So with that topic in mind, you actively seek opportunities to ask questions related to recruiting as you talk to clients and other connections. If you’re persistent enough in practicing this curiosity, you’ll probably uncover information that will lead to powerful opportunities you wouldn’t otherwise have experienced.

Of course, that’s just one example and the sky’s the limit in terms of what you could choose to be curious about. For example, maybe you want to learn …

* The productivity hacks of successful CEOs,

* How to effectively work with an assistant, or even

* Unconventional ways to improve your golf game.

Once you’ve chosen a topic, use any and all relevant interactions to ask questions to help you satisfy your curiosity. For example: If you went with the productivity hacks topic and you knew you were about to meet with a CEO, you could come up with a handful of questions to ask in advance and guide the conversation using them.

**The topic itself doesn’t matter, as long as it’s something you’re *genuinely* interested in.** That’s the key: If you aren’t truly interested in the topic, it’s going to be very hard to cultivate a lasting curiosity.

Moreover, the person you’re conversing with will probably be able to tell if you don’t actually care about the topic you’re asking about. And the moment they realize you’re just placating them or feigning interest, you’ll actually do more harm than good to the relationship.

## Curiosity is the Key to Long-Term Growth

Remember: Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.

**Curiosity, in and of itself, isn’t going to do you any good.** But when you leverage that curiosity to create satisfaction — both for you and within your relationships — you’ll find yourself not only building deeper, more meaningful relationships … You’ll probably find yourself generating breakthrough opportunities within your life and business as a result.

All because you paused and took the time to ask “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “how,” and, perhaps most importantly, “why.”

Whether your building relationships or a business, curiosity is one of the most powerful tools you have at your disposal. Don’t be afraid to use it.

# Why Being a Rebel is Good for Your Creativity

## 

**​It’s a worrying trend. I’m noticing that artists and creative people aren’t rebellious enough.**

We keep thinking there’s a right way of doing things. That’s why so many of us are getting stuck.

I’m betting you’ve read those blog posts and how to books that say you ‘should’:

* get up early to do your creative work before anything else (Instead of doing it in the evening when you really enjoy it.)

* treat your creative work like a ‘9–5’. (Put on a suit and commute, anyone?)

* work for 7 hours a day in the studio or you can’t call yourself an artist. (So you’ve got a PA to go out and buy your paint and do your marketing, right?)

*But as long as you’re listening to what everyone else says your art life should look like, you’re not listening to your own inner voice.*

*And you know what? You can’t make art without listening to your inner voice*

Not paying attention to your inner voice makes it impossible to know what you want to create. Or to create in a way that is uniquely yours.

What’s more, not listening to your inner voice makes you a prime candidate for creative block. Because you know who will show up if you don’t check in with your inner voice, don’t you?

The Inner Critic.

And you can bet he’ll be spouting that list of ‘shoulds’ when he shows.
​

### How to be a More Rebellious Artist

So I want to tell you the same thing that I tell my coaching clients when they ask what’s the best time of the day for them to do their practice.

Or how long they should spend in their studio every day.

Or — heavens! — whether they should start making large oil paintings instead of those tiny pencil sketches they love, because that’s what ‘real artists’ do

*My answer is always the same: There are NO rules. What do **YOU** want to do?*

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that painting at dawn isn’t a great idea. Or that being serious about your business isn’t important. Or that it spending more hours on your art won’t move you ahead quicker.

But please listen to your inner voice about what’s viable for you now; what will work with your timetable, your skillset, your personal ambitions.

The sooner you throw out the ‘shoulds’, the sooner you can begin to shape your art and your creative life into what you really want it to be.

Maybe you could begin this week by writing to this journal prompt:

* How did I break the rules in my creative work this week?

* How will I break them next week?

# Synergy&#58; How to Achieve Your Goals in Half the Time

## 

The typical advice when trying to build a new habit or achieve a goal is to do it one at a time. It’s good advice considering that building habits takes willpower. The more you spread out that willpower the less chance you have in succeeding. However, after working on many different habits myself, I’ve noticed some habits are easier when done simultaneously.

## Synergy

The definition of synergy is a creation of a whole that is bigger than the sum of its parts. In other words, sometimes 1+1 doesn’t equal 2 but 5.

Similarly, sometimes working on two habits simultaneously will get you better results — synergy. Other times, the effect is exactly the opposite — discord, because one of the habits makes it difficult to do the other one.

My main goal this year is to work on gaining more muscle mass and reducing body fat. To get there, one of the habits I’m working on is eating healthy and eating a lot. I started doing it earlier this year, but a month later I also decided to get braces to fix a crooked tooth problem. Anyone who’s had braces knows that eating is a pain in the ass. Food gets stuck and you have to clean your teeth all the time. In hindsight, getting the braces at that time was a terrible choice since it made my other goal harder. This is a great example of discord.

Another big goal of mine this year was working on quitting my job and doing my business full-time. That turned out to be very synergistic with the new exercise habit since now I can set my own work schedule. I can do my workouts whenever I want without rushing. Doing that when I had a full-time job and running a side business would have been difficult.

Since I work with clients on goals and habits all the time, both of these examples above got me thinking what habits and goals are synergistic with each other and what are some of the discords that we should avoid. Let’s look at a few common habits and how we can combine them.

## Exercise

Any type of exercise is going to require extra time. Even if it’s just a short jog in the park you have to set aside the time for it. If you’re currently working on another goal that is taking a huge amount of time, like a work project, it’s probably not the best time to start your exercise. If the time you spend exercising comes from cutting your sleep, for example, it’s a terrible idea. Your body needs even more sleep to recover and renew your muscles after a workout.

On the other hand, if you combine improving your sleep with working out, it’s going to make your recovery faster. Because of that synergy, maintaining the workout habit is going to be easier too.

Another big discord with exercising is currently having an injury. Earlier this year I injured my back and that made it more difficult to do my workouts. I had to be very careful, have perfect form, and make sure I don’t put any weight on the injured part. Again, in hindsight, it would have been easier to let the injury heal for a few months and then start the exercise program.

## Diet

Eating healthier foods will help you do better with just about everything in your life — exercise, focus, productivity, etc. However, having a healthy diet usually costs more.

Many times I’ve started a healthier diet without thinking about if I can afford it and it ended up taking way too many resources.

A great habit to do alongside the healthy eating is budgeting. Creating a simple budget of how you’re spending your money is a great way to make sure you have enough to invest in your new diet.

A big discord with healthy eating is the people and environment around you. It’s much easier to stick to your healthy diet if the people around you are doing it too. So if you’re planning to take a vacation and go see your family for a month, and they’re not big on healthy eating, it’s probably not the best time. Even if you have very strong willpower you’ll constantly be tempted by the people around you. You’ll be better off waiting for a time when your environment will be more supportive.

## Reading / Learning

To some reading and learning is enjoyable and comes naturally. Others have to work hard to do the habit consistently and continue growing.

One of the best ways to do your reading consistently is to set aside a period of the day that is dedicated only for that. Since life is so dynamic nowadays, that’s easier said than done. For me, the best time to read is in the evening before going to sleep. It’s a great habit to wind down, relax your mind, and get ready for sleep. At the same time, you’re staying away from bad habits for sleep like watching TV or browsing the internet. Doing both the reading and “no screens at night” habit is actually easier than doing them separately.

A great example of discord is the new season of your favorite TV show just coming out. You’ll be so tempted to watch it every night that the reading/learning habit will always be a second priority.

## Waking Up Early

Getting out of bed in the morning as a night owl is hard, especially in the beginning. So to be successful we have to do anything we can to make getting out of bed in the morning and staying out easier.

One of the most effective things to stay out of bed is to go outside as soon as you wake up — also a great opportunity to get some exercise and get your heart rate up. True, you need extra discipline to work out, but at least you won’t be tempted to go back to bed. Even if it’s just a simple walk in the park, it makes the early rising much easier.

On the other hand, if you try to start meditation after waking up, you’ll find a lot of discord. Your mind will be foggy because of the grogginess and you’ll be tempted to just nod off and go back to sleep.

There are countless examples of discord and synergy. The ones above are just to get you thinking in that direction.

The best way to find out if two habits or goals are good together is to figure out what are the resources that you’ll need.

For example, one basic resource is time. If both new goals require extra time, they’re not a good match. On the other hand, if one of the goals frees up extra time for the other, they are synergistic.

# The Stoic’s Complete Guide to Keeping Your Cool When All Else Goes to Hell

## The Stoic’s Complete Guide to Keeping Your Cool When All Else Goes to Hell

### Relax, Dude.

The barrel of the handgun was about a foot away, pointed directly at my head.

Just a few seconds earlier, I had been sitting in my car about to drive home after an evening workout at a local park in Mountain View, CA. Out of nowhere, a truck came screeching up next to me. Before I could react, I was blinded by a flashlight and the pistol started slamming repeatedly against my driver’s side window.

“Don’t move, don’t move, where’s your wallet? WHERE’S YOUR WALLET?!?!”

Damn it. Not again.

I knew the answer, of course. It was sitting in plain sight, less than a foot away in the passenger seat along with my laptop and phone. In other words, they had caught me with my pants down.

Stuck with little other option, I said the only thing that you can in a situation like that.

“Why the hell would I bring my wallet to a park?” (with a tinge of sarcasm, for good measure).

Silence.

The pause lasted for what felt like eternity. So long, in fact, that I actually started to feel kind of awkward. For an moment, I even considered saying something else to fill the void — “So…uh…beautiful evening, huh?”

In reality, the pause was probably just a second — maybe two. Screeching tires. They were gone.

### **WELCOME TO EARTH**

**If there’s one certainty about life it’s that life is uncertain.**

Unexpected things happen…all the time.

![](0*A0XzL6tNNllv-zkf.jpeg)

From the annoyances of day-to-day inconveniences to life-changing altercations, it’s simply an unescapable part of the human experience.

In-fact, ever since I left home for college it seems as if almost every year brings with it at least one potentially life threatening event — despite whatever precautions I take to avoid such situations (such as choosing to workout in upscale neighborhoods — not what most would consider a risky place to exercise.)

For instance, just a year before this summer’s incident in California, I was [**stranded in the Sahara Desert surrounded by a bunch of Middle Eastern men with automatic weapons](https://medium.com/@grahammumm/turning-simple-vacations-into-epic-adventures-2114b06fee58). **A year prior to that, **I was running for my life from a mob boss and his cohorts in Eastern Europe. **Before that, I was hit in the back of the head with a brick and mugged by a Mexican gang in downtown Kansas City. Before that…well, you get the point.

Now while most people (hopefully) won’t have to deal with situations this severe, these events, large or small, essentially affect us in the same way.

**Namely, leaving us to deal with uncontrollable feelings of anxiety, anger, and/or fear that naturally follow.**

From problems or disappointments in our careers and relationships to losing loved ones and even the stress and chaos that arise in everyday life, most of us simply don’t know how to deal with the inevitable calamities that Lady Fortune throws our way.

![Auschwitz at sunset.](0*fyuJXngAaHyYKPSp.jpeg)*Auschwitz at sunset.*

Left vulnerable and distressed, we become quickly overwhelmed by our emotions. We let them consume us. We become fearful. We hide. We stop taking chances and shy away from opportunities. Our perceptions become cluttered. **Small risks suddenly appear lethal. **We close ourselves off. We overcompensate to protect ourselves. We refuse to give people a chance — pushing them away. We procrastinate and fail to make the moves we need to get where we want to be. We don’t embrace our failures and learn what we can from them, we cower in fear. **We overanalyze and over-rationalize, trying our hardest to to protect ourselves, to never let “it” happen again. In doing so, we deny ourselves many of the best opportunities that come our way.**

To a certain extent, our ability to deal with the failures, setbacks, and crisis that come our way dictate the quality and enjoyment we have in our lives (i.e. living in a fearful, emotional state is hell).

I wasn’t looking for trouble this summer, I was actually in a really nice area working out at a neighborhood park. Does this mean I won’t ever workout at a park again? Or even that particular place? Hell no. Already been back.

It’s not that I wasn’t scared or aware of the danger to my person and property, it’s that I refuse to let the emotional aftermath rule my life. I forced myself to view the situation logically, made some simple adjustments to protect myself in case that were ever to happen again (decoy wallet, no electronics, different parking), and got on with my life. That’s really all you can do — learn as best you can but otherwise keep living your life as if it had never happened.

### **BUFFER**

While you will never be able to predict the future events of your life with any real precision, there are ways you can prepare for and/or reduce the amount of suffering, stress, and/or worry that commonly follow undesirable events — regardless of severity, I might add. **Our power, therefore, doesn’t come from our ability to avoid these unpleasantries (impossible & often undesirable —to a certain point, volatility is beneficial for us), but from our ability to control how we respond.**

**In this way, our focus should not be on prevention, but on reducing the potential IMPACT that these inevitable events can have on our lives — minimizing our negative exposure while still enjoying the best of life.**

### **Masters of the Universe**

When it comes to matters of downside protection, there are simply no greater role models than the classic practitioners of Stoicism (okay, perhaps [**Nassim Nicolas Taleb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4MhC5tcEv0)**). From the journals of the [**Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679642609/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0679642609&linkCode=as2&tag=undeflivin-20) **to the [**letters of Seneca](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140442103/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0140442103&linkCode=as2&tag=undeflivin-20) **and the [**example set by Cato](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DPNUHFC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00DPNUHFC&linkCode=as2&tag=undeflivin-20)**, **the Stoics were masters of living a life that maximized their potential upsides and enjoyment of life while reducing the impact of the undesired.**

The Stoics understood better than most that much of what happens *to *us in this world is simply unpredictable, and that ultimately, the only power we have is in how we think and act. **They knew that only by focusing inward and through continual self-improvement could one enjoy the best life has to offer while reducing the impact of the worst.**

For all we know, any second an astroid could wipe out billions of people and send humanity back to the stone age. An earthquake could hit San Francisco and destroy everything you own. You could lose the cushy job you’ve had for decades. The guy you want to marry could leave unexpectedly. Your dog could take a dump in your shoe. Whatever.

![Who me?](0*6zTKoqTRjIhPx7op.jpeg)*Who me?*

**Shit happens — sometimes literally. We can’t prevent it, but by adopting a Stoic mindset we can eliminate much of the pain and suffering associated with the unexpected and unfortunate events in our lives.**

### **#1 — REALIZE THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS FATE**

**What you did yesterday does not dictate who you become today. Where you are now is not where you are destined to be.**

Fate is an illusion. Whether good or bad, it’s the choices you’ve made on a daily bases, including the opportunities you decide to pursue or ignore, that have brought you to this day.**This means that the moments that are passing by right now are the very same ones that you’ll be looking back on tomorrow — the very same ones that accumulate to create the future you.**

The opportunity to create your future and become the person you dream is passing by with each second. Every instant, a chance where you could turn it all around, take that first step, begin fresh, start building a better everything.

The truth is that we all have the ability to change into the person we dream of any time we like, but that time has to be right now. Not later, not sometime — right now.
> “There isn’t a single thing in this world that’s made better by starting tomorrow.” — [**Julien Smith](http://inoveryourhead.net/life-doesnt-begin-tomorrow/)**

**Every single second you’re alive is a chance to take that first step towards a new goal, a new job, a new life, a new partner, a new city, a new you. Once you stop trying to convince yourself that you’ll never recover, that you’ll surely fail, that “you should feel grateful for having a job, a girlfriend, a wife, a (fill in the blank) — in other words, settling — you’re free to live the life you want. Free to become the person you really are.**

On a similar note, “success” is something you must define for yourself. No one, especially popular culture, should do it for you. All too often, people spend their entire life pursuing someone else’s dream only to finally “arrive” and feel completely empty and lost. There was nothing there they really valued after all.

![Money is an enabler, not an end in and of itself.](0*x72_KZaU8zKykFO5.jpeg)*Money is an enabler, not an end in and of itself.*

To close this point, here’s a few words by [**Nassim Nicolas Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/)**, the best example I know of a modern day Stoic. He also the author of the [**best book I’ve ever read](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400067820/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1400067820&linkCode=as2&tag=undeflivin-20).**
> “Missing a train is only painful if you run after it. Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking. You stand above the rat race and the pecking order not outside of it, if you do so by choice.”
> “Quitting a high-paying position, if it is your decision, will seem a better payoff than the utility of the money involved. You have far more control over your life if you decide on your criterion by yourself. It is more difficult to be a loser in a game you set up yourself.”

Reflect on what really makes you happy. Define your perfect reality. And take that first step.

**Remember, your future is not set in stone. You can do or be whatever you like. All you have to do is chose yourself.**

### **#2 — FOCUS ON THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE, BECOME INDIFFERENT TO THE REST**

Understand two things:

**-The universe is indifferent to your existence and operates entirely without your consent.**

**-99.999%+ of the people on this planet don’t even care that you’re alive.**

The obvious takeaway being that there’s a lot going on that we can’t control —including what everyone else thinks about you — so stop caring so much.
> “There are things over which we have complete control, things over which we have no control at all, and things over which we have some but not complete control. Each of the ‘things’ we encounter in life will fall into one and only one of these three categories.” **-A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy**

![Haters gonna hate](0*pE-xqvTCNs1_POTt.jpeg)*Haters gonna hate*

There are things in life we have absolutely no control over: our genetic predisposition, the amount of wealth we are born into, our ethnic background, the opinions other people form about us, etc…

Take, for instance, height. No matter how hard you’d like it, wishing you were taller or shorter is a complete waste of time. There is literally nothing positive that can come from contemplating such externalities — they are simply beyond control (unless you book a stay with Mr. [**Procrustes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes)**). Worrying about such things leaves us with nothing more than insecurities and the inner torment, frustration, and anxiety that come with it.

This includes, above all else, trying to meet or adapt to the expectations or desires others. It’s a hopeless battle, one that you are surely bound to lose.

This includes succumbing to outside praises and adoration.
> “when others praise us, the proper response is to laugh at them. (But not out loud!)” ***-A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy***

**Instead, keep your attention focused on your own concerns — let others worry about their own business. Focus on improving and living true to yourself, and eventually, you will become impervious to coercion.**
> “When we seek social status, we give other people power over us: We have to do things calculated to make them admire us, and we have to refrain from doing things that will trigger their disfavor. We will, says Epictetus, have enslaved ourselves.”***-A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy***

Ultimately, the only thing we can control is how we act. When faced with external circumstances that are beyond our control, we are faced with a simple choice — we can either resent it or accept it.

**It is how we we think about and interpret events (the emotions we attach to them), not the events themselves (naturally neutral), that result in an aftermath of relative peace or one of fear, discomfort, and depression.**

Finally, a brief word on blame.
> “An uneducated person accuses others when he is doing badly; a partly educated person accuses himself; an educated person accuses neither someone else nor himself”-Epicticus

# Learning by copying

## Learning by copying

### Taking apart someone else’s work as practice

To become a musician, you are taught to play music someone else made and improve your skill by continuing to find other music to copy. Amateur musicians sometimes do this for years before deciding to make their own original music. There’s even sheet music written for you to use to mimmick an original song exactly.

I learned to program HTML and CSS because of the View Source browser feature. It’s the sheet music to programming a static website. I learned to design the same way. I started out as a kid, making my own video game fan sites for fun. I would take photos and graphics from other sites and edit them until I had something I liked. I would do this over and over, staying up many late nights tweaking graphics and code. I didn’t know it then, but the time I was spending was all the practice I needed for when I later decided to build websites professionally.

Throughout the years I’ve realized that I still essentially do the same thing whenever their is a new technique I want to try out. I pick a personal project and try out the new concept while in the process understanding how it works and later applying it to client projects.

Recently, I wanted to learn some new programming skills. I decided to use [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/) since I liked their approach to learning how to program: learn a little, code a little, learn some more, code some more. You are encouraged to copy the code from the slides presented at the beginning. And as you do that, you start applying what you’ve learned and write your own code for the example programs given, each getting more difficult along the way.

The View Source method can even be applied to web application code like PHP or Ruby on Rails since many projects are available online as open-sourced code. If you want to program your own blog tool, download the entire WordPress source code and take it apart. As you improve your skills, you can even become a part of an open-source project yourself as a way to continue practicing.

# Reshaping Habit&#58; How Top Poker Players Improve their Game

## Reshaping Habit: How Top Poker Players Improve Their Game

### Humans seem hard-wired to seek credit and deflect blame. Instead, congratulate yourself for leveraging a learning opportunity others will miss.

![Photo [Credit:ivanmateev](https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/ivanmateev?mediatype=photography)](1*xhkGflWZiIp7Hz7f6oZ0kw.jpeg)*Photo [Credit:ivanmateev](https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/ivanmateev?mediatype=photography)*

Phil Ivey is one of those guys who can easily admit when he could have done better. Ivey is one of the world’s best poker players, a player almost universally admired by other professional poker players for his exceptional skill and confidence in his game. Starting in his early twenties, he built a reputation as a top cash-game player, a top tournament player, a top heads-up player, a top mixed-game player — a top player in every form and format of poker. In a profession where, as I’ve explained, most people are awash in self-serving bias, Phil Ivey is an exception.

In 2004, my brother provided televised final-table commentary for a tournament in which Phil Ivey smoked a star-studded final table. After his win, the two of them went to a restaurant for dinner, during which Ivey deconstructed every potential playing error he thought he might have made on the way to victory, asking my brother’s opinion about each strategic decision. A more run-of-the-mill player might have spent the time talking about how great they played, relishing the victory. Not Ivey. For him, the opportunity to learn from his mistakes was much more important than treating that dinner as a self-satisfying celebration. He earned a half-million dollars and won a lengthy poker tournament over the world-class competition, but all he wanted to do was discuss with a fellow pro where he might have made better decisions.

I heard an identical story secondhand about Ivey at another otherwise celebratory dinner following one of his now ten World Series of Poker victories. Again, from what I understand, he spent the evening discussing in intricate detail with some other pros the points in hands where he could have made better decisions. Phil Ivey, clearly, has different habits than most poker players — and most people in any endeavor — in how he fields his outcomes.

Habits operate in a neurological loop consisting of three parts: the cue, the routine, and the reward. A habit could involve eating cookies: the cue might be hunger, the routine going to the pantry and grabbing a cookie, and the reward a sugar high. Or, in poker, the cue might be winning a hand, the routine taking credit for it, the reward a boost to our ego. Charles Duhigg, in *The Power of Habit*, offers the golden rule of habit change — that the best way to deal with a habit is to respect the habit loop: “to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine.”

When we have a good outcome, it cues the routine of crediting the result to our awesome decision-making, delivering the reward of a positive update to our self-narrative. A bad outcome cues the routine of off-loading responsibility for the result, delivering the reward of avoiding a negative self-narrative update. With the same cues, we flip the routine for the outcomes of peers, but the reward is the same — feeling good about ourselves.

The good news is that we can work to change this habit of mind by substituting what makes us feel good. The golden rule of habit change says we don’t have to give up the reward of a positive update to our narrative, nor should we. Duhigg recognizes that respecting the habit loop means respecting the way our brain is built.

Our brain is built to seek positive self-image updates. It is also built to view ourselves in competition with our peers. We can’t install new hardware. Working with the way our brains are built in reshaping habit has a higher chance of success than working against it. Better to change the part that is more plastic: the routine of what gives us a good feeling in our narrative and the features by which we compare ourselves to others.

At least as far back as Pavlov, behavioral researchers* have recognized the power of substitution in physiological loops. In his famous experiments, his colleague noticed that dogs salivated when they were about to be fed. Because they associated a particular technician with food, the presence of the technician triggered the dog’s salivation response. Pavlov discovered the dogs could learn to associate just about any stimulus with food, including his famous bell, triggering the salivary response.

(*Note: Ivan Pavlov’s work was so revolutionary that “behavioral research” as we commonly understand it didn’t even exist. Pavlov was a physician and physiologist, researching the canine digestive system.)

We can work to change the bell we ring, substituting what makes us salivate. We can work to get the reward of feeling good about ourselves from being a good credit-giver, a good mistake-admitter, a good finder-of-mistakes-in-good-outcomes, a good learner, and (as a result) a good decision-maker. Instead of feeling bad when we have to admit a mistake, what if the bad feeling came from the thought that we might be missing a learning opportunity just to avoid blame? Or that we might be basking in the credit of a good result instead of, like Phil Ivey, recognizing where we could have done better? If we work toward that, we can transform the unproductive habits of mind, of self-serving bias and motivated reasoning, into productive ones. If we put in the work to practice this routine, we can field more of our outcomes in an open-minded, more objective way, motivated by accuracy and truth-seeking to drive learning. The habit of mind will change, and our decision-making will better align with executing on our long-term goals.

There are people who, like Phil Ivey, have substituted the routine of truth-seeking for the outcome-oriented instinct to focus on seeking credit and avoiding blame. When we look at the people performing at the highest level of their chosen field, we find that the self-serving bias that interferes with learning often recedes and even disappears. The people with the most legitimate claim to a bulletproof self-narrative have developed habits around accurate self-critique.

In sports, the athletes at the top of the game look at outcomes to spur further improvement. American soccer great Mia Hamm said, “many people say I’m the best women’s soccer player in the world. I don’t think so. And because of that, someday I just might be.” Such quotes can be discounted as a polite way of dealing with the media. There are plenty of contrary examples burned in our consciousness, like John McEnroe arguing line calls or golf pros who have turned missed putts into a ritual of staring at the offending line of the putt and tapping down phantom spike marks. Those aren’t anything more than performance tics. It’s practically a ritual on the PGA tour that if a player misses a makeable putt, he has to stare at the green like it was somehow at fault. What you don’t see are practice rituals like Phil Mickelson’s, in which he places ten balls in a circle, three feet from the hole. He has to sink all ten, and then repeat the process *nine more times*. Players of Phil Mickelson’s caliber couldn’t engage in such a demanding regimen if they actually assigned much blame to spike marks.

Changing the routine is hard and takes work. But we can leverage our natural tendency to derive some of our self-esteem by how we compare to our peers. Just as Duhigg recommends respecting the habit loop, we can also respect that we are built for competition and that our self-narrative doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Keep the reward of feeling like we are doing well compared to our peers, but change the features by which we compare ourselves: be a better credit-giver than your peers, more willing than others to admit mistakes, more willing to explore possible reasons for an outcome with an open mind, even, and especially, if that might cast you in a bad light or shine a good light on someone else. In this way, we can feel that we are doing well by comparison because we are doing something unusual and hard that most people don’t do. That makes us feel exceptional.

Once we start listening for it, we hear a chorus out in the world like I heard during breaks in poker tournaments: “things are going great because I’m making such good decisions”; “things went poorly because I got so unlucky.” That’s what the lawyer heard from his senior partner in each evening’s postmortem of the trial. That’s what we heard from Chris Christie in the 2016 Republican presidential debate. That’s what I heard in every poker room I was ever in. There were times, and there still are, when I’m part of that chorus. Increasingly, though, I’ve learned to use that chorus to avoid self-serving bias rather than giving in to it. When I admitted mistakes, when I recognized the luck element in my successes, when I gave other players credit for making some good decisions, when I was eager to share a hand that I thought I played poorly because I might learn something from it, that chorus reminded me that what I was doing was hard, and that others weren’t often doing it. Identifying learning opportunities that other players were missing made me feel good about myself, reinforcing my routine change.

Ideally, we wouldn’t compare ourselves with others or get a good feeling when the comparison favors us. We might adopt the mindful practices of Buddhist monks, observing the flow of inner thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations without judging them as good or bad at all. That’s a great goal, and I’m all for a regular mindful practice. It will, the research indicates, help improve your quality of life and is worth pursuing. But getting all the way there is a tall order if we don’t want to quit our day jobs and move to Tibet. It works against the way our brains evolved, against our competitive drive. As a parallel practice, the more practical and immediate solution is to work with what we’ve got, using that comparison to strengthen our focus on accuracy and truth-seeking. Plus, we won’t have to give up our lives and find a remote mountaintop to live on.

We need a mindset shift. We need a plan to develop a more productive habit of mind. That starts in the deliberative mind and requires foresight and practice, but if it takes hold, it can become an established habit, running automatically and changing the way we reflexively think.

We can get to this mindset shift by behaving as if we have something at risk when we sort outcomes into the luck and skill buckets because we do *have a lot at risk *on that fielding decision. Thinking in bets is a smart way to start building habits that achieve our long-term goals.

# Achieving Apatheia&#58; 7 Steps To Controlling Your Perceptions Like a Stoic

## The obstacles we face in life make us emotional. The only way we’ll overcome them is by keeping those emotions in check—if we can keep steady no matter what happens, no matter how much external events may fluctuate

The obstacles we face in life make us emotional. The only way we’ll overcome them is by keeping those emotions in check—if we can keep steady no matter what happens, no matter how much external events may fluctuate.

The ancient Stoics had a word for this state: *apatheia.*

It’s the kind of calm equanimity that comes with the absence of irrational or extreme emotions.

What follows are the 7 steps you can take to achieve this state, so you can focus on [overcoming your obstacles](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591846358/ryanholnet-20), rather than reacting to them.

**Step 1: Steady Your Nerves**
> “What such a man needs is not courage but nerve control, cool headedness. This he can only get by practice.” — Theodore Roosevelt

During the Civil war troops were unloading a steamer when it exploded. Everyone hit the dirt except [Ulysses S. Grant, who instead ran *towards *the scene](http://youtu.be/bqMG8Gy6KLU).

That is nerve.

Like Grant, we must prepare ourselves for the realities of our situation, steadying our nerves so we can throw our best at it.

**Step 2: Control Your Emotions**
> “Would you have a great empire? Rule over yourself.” — Publius Syrus

When America first sent astronauts into space, they trained them in one skill more than any other: the art of *not *panicking.

Here on Earth, when something goes wrong we trade in our plan for a good ol’ emotional freak-out.

As Nassim Taleb put it, real strength lies in the *domestication *of one’s emotions, not in pretending they don’t exist.

**Step 3: Practice Objectivity**
> “Don’t let the force of an impression when it first hit you knock you off your fee; just say to it: Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what you represent. Let me put you to the test.” — Epictetus

In our lives, how many problems seem to come from applying judgments to things we don’t control?

Perceptions give us information at the exact moment when it would be better to focus on what is immediately in front of us.

We must question our animalistic impulse to immediately perceive what happens. But this takes strength and is a muscle that must be developed.

**Step 4: Practice Contemptuous Expressions**

The Stoics used contempt to lay things bare and “strip away the legend that encrusts them.”

Roasted meat is a dead animal. Vintage wine is old, fermented grapes.

We can do this for anything that stands in our way, seeing things as they truly, actually are, not as we’ve made them in our minds.

**Step 5: Alter Your Perspective**
> “Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become the next moment. By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.” — Viktor Frankl

Remember: We choose how we’ll look at things.

What we must do is limit and expand our perspective to whatever will keep us calmest and most ready for the task at hand.

Think of it as selective editing—not to deceive others, but to properly orient ourselves.

**Step 6: Live in the Present Moment**
> “The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close up.” — Chuck Palahniuk

It doesn’t matter whether this is the worst time to be alive or the best, whether you’re in a good job market or a bad one.

What matters right now is right now.

Focus on the moment, on what you can control right now. Not what may or may not be ahead.

**Step 7: Look for the Opportunity**
> “A good person dyes events with his own color…and turns whatever happens to his own benefit.” — Seneca

The reality is every situation, no matter how negative, provides us with a positive, exposed benefit we can act on, if only we look for it.

Maybe you were injured recently and are laid up in bed recovering. Now you have the [time to start the book ](http://www.copyblogger.com/three-books-in-three-years/)or the screenplay you’ve been meaning to write.

That [business decision](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232848) that turned out to be a mistake? See it as a hypothesis that was wrong. Like scientist you can learn from it and use it in your next experiment.

Remember: This a complete flip. Seeing through the negative, past its underside, and into its corollary: the positive.

Another way of putting it: Does getting upset provide you with more options?

Sometimes it does. But in this instance? ***No, I suppose not***.

# Do Meditators Really Exist?

## 

**When Rene Descartes declared “I think therefore I am,” what type of thinking do you suppose he meant?**

Marcus E. Raichle discovered the default mode network, and in 2005 [showed](http://www.pnas.org/content/102/27/9673) that the human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anticorrelated systems.

The default mode is deactivated when we use the task positive network — which, unfortunately, is also known as the direct experience network, the central executive network, the external attention system, and the cognitive control network — and probably others …

The task positive network responds to attention-demanding tasks — when we focus our conscious attention on the external environment or our bodily states.

Dr. Pierre Magistretti concluded that the activation of the default mode represents an introspective activity of the brain, during which the center of our consciousness or awareness is reflecting about itself.

The default network is associated with [maladaptive, depressive rumination](http://web.stanford.edu/group/mood/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Hamilton_Furman_Chang_TPN_DMN_BP_2011.pdf) in people with major depressive disorder. [Failure to deactivate](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1472462/) the default mode during demanding tasks is associated with autism and [overactivity with schizophrenia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633557/). It’s preferentially attacked by [Alzheimer’s disease](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/health/14alzheimers.html?_r=0). And, lower connectivity was found in people who have experienced long-term trauma.

Interestingly, listening to your preferred music enhances the connections of the default mode, which is why it’s been used as a treatment for autism, and also elicits these types of reactions in Alzheimers’s sufferers:


Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist and author of [Ungifted](http://www.amazon.com/Ungifted-Intelligence-Scott-Barry-Kaufman/dp/0465025544), has found that the default mode (Daydreaming in particular), is related to many positive functions which include …
> *“Self-awareness, creative incubation, improvisation and evaluation, memory consolidation, autobiographical planning, goal driven thought, future planning, retrieval of deeply personal memories, reflective consideration of the meaning of events and experiences, simulating the perspective of another person, evaluating the implications of self and others’ emotional reactions, moral reasoning, and reflective compassion.”*

Phew.

[There is reduced activation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763414000724) and reduced functional connectivity of the default mode in long-term meditation practitioners.

Yup.

The thought goes that the default mode can [make us unhappy](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6006/932.full), it’s a distraction, that mind-wandering is too often a negative process, and that meditation and in particular mindfulness can help to ‘quiet the mind.’

And it does, actually I find it interesting that the name is mind*ful*ness when the idea is to use less of it.

[The PCC shuts off](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00440/full) when experienced meditators are in a state of “effortless doing” or “undistracted awareness.”

The PCC (Posterior Cingulate Cortex) is a central hub of activity in the default mode, and it [plays a part in learning](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=21420893), memory, reward, task engagement, and [empathy](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Anterior%20Insular%20Cortex%20and%20Emotional%20Awareness.pdf).

Failure to keep the PCC deactivated is [related to attention lapses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16767087)–you know, those times when you should be studying and suddenly your mind starts to wander, that’s the point you switched to the default mode.

This is why mindfulness helps, in that it can train our ability to keep the PCC deactivated, and in the process, improve our ability to focus.

But we lose something–actually, we can lose quite a lot–when we only focus on keeping the PCC ***de***activated. We miss out on everything the default mode has to offer, including self-referential thought, or thinking about ‘I’ …

We can actively try to keep the PCC activated, by forcing a state of daydreaming.

Mind wandering is volitional, meaning we can choose to do it–it doesn’t have to come in the form of a distraction from what’s really “important.”

The network that lights up in meditators (Task Positive) is the same as when we do math or have a conversation, it’s focused on the present moment, our surroundings.

Given that meditation is the act of shutting down the default mode, the brain network that allows you to think about yourself, I have to ask once more:

What did Descartes mean by “I think therefore I am”?

Surely he means that you need to be aware that you are thinking, you need to be self-aware. If you’re not, then you’re simply a reaction to the environment.

I would wager a guess that “becoming one with the world” is the feeling of shutting down your default mode, and losing that sense of self.

When we do this, do we think as Descartes did? Do people deep in meditation actually exist?

# Two Easy Ways to Overcome Social Anxiety

## Two Easy Ways to Overcome Social Anxiety

### Even If You Are a Shrinking Violet

There are two ways which you can use simultaneously. I utilized both of them and, frankly, I have a hard time to decide which one was easier.

### **1. Work on Your Social Skills.**

Even the most socially anxious person can do tiny things that don’t require two-way interactions with other people. When I decided to transform my life I tried to overcome my shyness via talking to strangers.

![](1*qRwKMQA75ntfWHL_xDR2nQ.png)

At the beginning, I fell flat on my face, but it taught me what a really shy person **CAN **do despite their affliction. You have no power over others’ reactions, but you have power over your mind, words and deeds. Especially those miniscule and easy ones.

Observe others, think positively about them, make eye contact, smile or say “Hi.” If this is still too much for you, you can do this inside your own mind when no one notices your awkwardness.

Here are the details, broken down into actionable steps on Coach.Me:
[Free plan: Overcome shyness by talking to strangers](https://www.coach.me/plans/254794-overcome-shyness-by-talking-to-strangers)

### **2. Spend Time with People Who Are Socially Proficient.**

You cannot help but become a bit like them. We call it “rubbing off” a behavior or trait from someone, but in reality it’s social mimicry we humans have in our genes. This is how children are learning everything. They observe and mimic.

This is how you learned living your life. This process is as natural for you as breathing. It’s enough that you will be around people who are friendly and outgoing to become more like them.

It’s not magic. You will not turn into Casanova tomorrow because you stand for five minutes next to a guy who has no trouble speaking with girls. But you may turn into Casanova if you repeat it tomorrow, and the day after, and for two years in a row every single day.

Additional level of easiness: you can do it online. When it comes to mimicking, your brain is not very discerning. Whether you are among real people or watch and listen to recordings, your brain can quickly “adopt” social avatars of people into your internal tribe and consider them real people.

So watch videos, listen to podcasts, join an online group that tackles social anxiety and interact with others who experienced something similar to your pain.

This method may fail if you stop** only at online interactions** and lie to yourself that it’s enough to sit in front of your computer and stare at the screen to get rid of your anxiety. But if you mingle online interactions with tiny activities from #1 point, it may create a killer combo for you.

Those two things should affect your mindset enough for a start. And once you begin the process of change, it will be much easier to continue it.

# How To Have Amazing Meetings

## How To Have Amazing Meetings

Meeting as an activity is so ubiquitous that we have come to accept it as an inevitable part of our daily life. It comes in many guises. Like *informal chats, routine check-ins, conference calls, fancy presentations. *We all have been there and felt the inevitability of it.

Our days are often peppered with them. Despite their ubiquity, they are not usually seen as a good thing. In fact, the word “Meeting” has somehow acquired a pejorative connotation. So, when we hear someone say “*I had a day full of meetings,*” we end up feeling pity rather than envy.

So, how did we succeed in making it an abhorrent task?

The answer has more to do with how often we end up paying a lot of undue attention to what we’re discussing. The document we’re sharing. The decision we need to make. And the message we want to get across.

Little attention goes to *how* we’re having the conversation. Think about the last meeting you were in. How much time went into thinking about the setup of the conversation. And the right way to encourage great contributions from everyone?

Not much, if I can hazard a guess. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen smart people spend hard, long weeks putting together a presentation. Followed by a few bare minutes — often on the way to the meeting — on how to make the most of the interaction.

**That’s why I’m going to share with you a five-step process you can use to have amazing meetings.**

Even if you try just one or two of these ideas, they might help you fall in love with meetings all over again, irrespective of whether you’re presiding the meeting or attending it.

## Step # 1: Preparation

Set intentions, by answering these questions before you walk in:

* **Aim:** If you could achieve only one thing in the meeting, what would be that?

* **Assumptions: D**o you have any negative expectations about the meeting? Can you challenge them?

* **Attitude**: Acknowledge what’s on top of your mind as you go into the meeting.

* **Attention: **Given your actual aim, where do you want to focus your attention on the meeting?

* **Actions:** What specific actions will help you make those intentions a reality?

* **Active Mental contrasting:** What’s going to get in the way of things that you have visualized?

Being a part of this ritual for more than a decade has taught me a thing or two for sure. The realization that aim and attitude can indeed play a critical role. Especially in shaping the outcomes of our meetings.

Believe me, I have been fortunate enough to attend those marathon meetings. Where participants were blissfully unaware of agenda points. Nothing but complete atrocity in the name of meetings.

Yet, instances when management and participants could define their aim and actions — everyone saw an increase in efficacy of the meeting. This was complemented by listing and introducing agenda items as questions, not statements.

For example, “How can we improve team communication?” rather than “Team communication”.

In fact, by focusing on the ‘how’ part of this problem, our team could come up with the proposal of using Slack. This proved to be an effective breakthrough from earlier methods of communication.

## Step # 2: Assigning Roles

Any meeting brings with it a chance to assign a few roles. For example, there is a moderator whose job is to make sure everyone sticks to the agenda and doesn’t go off topic. Besides, making sure that the meeting doesn’t last more than 90 minutes.

Then there’s the time-keeper, who’s in charge of making sure the meeting is running on schedule.

There’s also the closer, who keeps track of what transpired during the meeting. He closes it out by telling everyone the commitments and deadlines they agreed to.

But no meeting would be complete without the participants. Those who arrive on time, prepared with productive input, ready to add and take value from the meeting.

All these roles provide an opportunity for people to grow their skill sets.

Make sure different people are assigned different roles. So that a variety of people get the chance to try new things.

For instance, someone in customer service might enjoy being a closer. You can offer them an opportunity to summarize the main points of a discussion.

Similarly, the youngest team members might appreciate the opportunity to play the moderator. This will give them a chance to gain some invaluable experience. They will learn to field questions from participants and will help keep the meeting on track.

But be prepared to embrace all sorts of opposition. In fact, when I proposed assigning the role of moderator to the junior most member of our team, there was quite a lot of apprehension. But, my team soon realized that reposing our collective faith in the young lot, we will be grooming them for future leadership roles.

## Step # 3: Collaborate Goals While Addressing The Threats

You can encourage some collaborative goal setting by asking:

* **“*Where do we wish to see ourselves at the end of this meeting*”**

* **“*What’s the best way for us to achieve that?*”**

(These are questions you can ask even if you’re not chairing the meeting).

If possible, you should have a no-device rule. Otherwise, people are habitual to use their brain’s precious working memory on phones — making everyone a little dumber than they would be if they were concentrating.

In long meetings, you can have a “**smartphone daycare**” box. Here people can deposit their phones, with rights to access during breaks. (*If you can’t do any of this, at least put your own devices away*.)

I had to face initial resistance against this proposal. But it took a couple of meetings to experience the positive effects of this initiative.

Collaborative efforts from participants are possible if they are comfortable.

You can start with something positive to put people into discovery mode. It doesn't need to be extraordinary, you can ask people to share their most recent successes.

In fact, once you try this, you will be surprised to see the enthusiasm of the participants. People are generally very enthusiastic when asked to share their successful initiatives.

One of my junior team members disclosed he was sharing his math skills with a group of slum kids. He was spending his weekend with them. It was appreciated by all — which in turn boosted his self-esteem.

You can also ask:

* “*What’s going well so far?*” or

* “*What’s the best thing that’s happening on your part of the project?*”

There is every possibility of encountering annoyed people in a meeting. You need to remember that they’re feeling threatened by one of these common triggers — Exclusion, Unfairness, Feeling unappreciated, Lack of autonomy, lack of competence, or the threat to their values, or uncertainty.

And when they are sleep deprived their sensitivity to these “**threats**” is likely to get heightened.

To improve the situation, ask yourself: What exactly are they doing or saying? (Observe the facts). What could be triggering those actions? What are their expectations that need to be fulfilled? How can you reduce that “threat” by being more sensitive to their needs?

For example, even when I am not in the chair, I make it a point to help them by expressing interest in their views. You too can make them feel heard and respected by referring back to something they've said.

## Step # 4: Scripting Stories While Avoiding Group-Think

If you are aspiring to make your contributions memorable — try illustrating your points. An anecdote or real-life example should really help you in driving home the point.

One of my friend and colleague from marketing shared this anecdote.

He was giving a speech on marketing to a group of contractors. He noticed that the men’s room was decrepit.

So instead of his planned opening, he started his speech, *“How many of the men here have used the washroom today? And how many of you saw a marketing opportunity for contractors in there?”* . . . After that, he could say anything he wanted; they paid attention!

If you are offering longer comments — break your point into clear chunks to make it easier for people to process what you’re saying. *“There are three things that strike me about this. One . . . Two . . . Three . . .”*

If you need to disagree or raise a concern — help others stay in open-minded discovery mode. Here you could use one of the brain-friendly feedback techniques.

1. Say what you like about the idea on the table. Be very specific. Then say, ***“What would make me like it more is . . .”***

2. Say ***“yes, and . . .”*** rather than ***“yes, but . . .”***

3. Ask*** “what would have to be true to make that work?”***

Provide cues that nudge people towards whatever you need from them. If you want three suggestions, write an indicative “1, 2, 3” on a flip chart. Ask *“If you had three suggestions, what would they be?”*

There is no doubt that it feels great to reach a quick agreement. But if you’re talking about something important and there’s no challenge in the room — you’re missing a critical part of the picture.

Ask some of these questions to improve the group’s thinking:

* *“If we had to pick holes in this, where would they be?”*

* *“If someone had to play devil’s advocate what would he say — and what would we need to do to reassure him?”*

* *“Let’s fast forward and assume that things have gone wrong. What did we miss?”*

* *“Who all are the stakeholders going to be affected by our plans? What should they worry about”*

Reaching Closure is another challenge — what if there’s nothing anyone agrees on. Reduce the temperature in the room by doing this: **Clarify what you can all agree on.**

That promotes a sense of in-group and calms people’s instinctive threat response. Ask if it’s possible to agree to disagree on the rest. The answer might be yes if it’s clear that you already agree on the things that matter.

**If not:** Do your best to summarize each position objectively, doing justice to each idea. Ask what would have to be true for each position to be the best one.

Decide together on the process for getting evidence to test each position. If the issue is less about disagreement and more about lack of focus, then it is advisable to create a **“parking lot”** for off-topic ideas or issues.

It helps immensely if everyone feels heard. While still focusing people’s attention on the meeting’s real priorities, make a visible list on a flip chart, whiteboard, or notepad.

## Step # 5: Wrapping Up: Bite What You Can Chew

Always allow a moment to recap key decisions or reflect on the insights gained from the meeting. And agree on steps that each person will take. If you can, also do some kind of positive roundup. You can combine it with a “next step” summary from each person, by asking everyone to say

1. One thing they were interested or inspired to hear in the meeting, and

1. What they’re committed to doing, and by when.

Many people say they hate meetings because there are way too many on their schedule. Meetings help, but they need fewer of them.

If that rings true to you, you can afford to take a hard look at your own schedule.

In fact, one of my close friends discovered he was signed up for no fewer than thirty-four regular meetings.

But, once he became clear about his big-picture intentions, it became evident that many of his meetings were unconnected to those priorities. They were a legacy of past commitments. For those meetings, he began to send out a series of “**Positive Nos**,” to extricate himself gracefully.

Then, for the remaining meetings, he asked whether attending passed the **“comparative advantage” **test. Was he truly the only person who could contribute? Or could someone more junior step in for him and do a reasonable job?

Henceforth, he attended only those meetings where he had a unique role to play. He created opportunities for his younger colleagues to shine. Halved the number of meetings he regularly attended. And in the process got his life back.

There is some truth when we say time is money, especially in the corporate world. So to make sure you’re not wasting people’s time and money, meetings need to be both effective and efficient.

Scheduling regular meetings are still the best way to communicate. And get everyone on the same page. In fact, meetings can also improve employee skill sets. It can strengthen teams and help build the foundation of your company’s values and goals.

**If an employee says they don’t want to attend a meeting, respect that.**

You should strive to foster a culture where employees take the initiative to read the agenda. And afterward, decide for themselves about attending a meeting.

There is no doubt all these prescriptions might sound like an impossible task. Especially for organizations where managers demand that you:

* Show up on time.

* Don’t ask questions.

* Maintain the status quo by following all the rules.

* And don’t challenge authority.

But then there is also some grain of truth in the following statement:

# How These 7 Chrome Extensions Will Make You More Productive

## How These 7 Chrome Extensions Will Make You More Productive

I swear by seven Chrome extensions to get more done, have more impact, and live happier.

## #1. [1Password](https://1password.com/)

![](1*F5LdJPsbxWLbud2U4jzOTw.png)

This password manager holds all of my account and credit card information. Turn on the Dropbox integration and then install 1Password everywhere: phone, browser extension, and app.

Of the three versions, I end up using the 1Password extension 90% of the time.

Theoretically, you install a password manager to increase password security — it lets you have different, complicated passwords for all of your accounts.

But, I’m my angle is productivity so I want to point out that:

* You save your memory from having to remember passwords.

* You save time because you forget fewer passwords and rarely have to go through a site’s forgot-password flow.

I have the [$65 licensed version](https://agilebits.com/downloads) that syncs via Dropbox. Other people might prefer the [subscription version](https://1password.com/sign-up/) which doesn’t require Dropbox and keeps a version history of your account info.

## #2. [Highly](http://highly.co)

![](1*ViE3jkJ9Mc2yav_XbV0Zbg.png)

The [Highly beta](http://highly.co) lets me highlight snippets of text that I want to share with other people.

For years, I’ve been struggling to say why I love an article in 140 characters. Now with Highly, I can highlight my favorite parts of the article and then share that highlight in my tweet.

It’s more efficient, and more people click through.

Plus, I find that highlighting puts me into a smarter mode of reading. [I’m a fan of having a system for categorizing what you read](https://betterhumans.coach.me/one-trick-for-super-human-reading-comprehension-identification-systems-31e0c7701296). The system here is to identify insights.

## #3. [Evernote](https://evernote.com/webclipper/)

![](1*mLV3M1aVG2kjMwCfcNs1uw.png)

Evernote works best if you have enough information in it that you remember to use the search function.

The [Evernote Web Clipper extension](https://evernote.com/webclipper/) lets me save the text of an article for later.

This is a huge step beyond how I used to use bookmarking services like Delicious. My old collection of bookmarks represented things that I wanted to remember — but I never remembered to go back.

With Evernote, because of the web clipping, those articles now show up in search results and I’m much more likely to return to them.

## #4. [Send to Kindle](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-kindle-for-google/cgdjpilhipecahhcilnafpblkieebhea?hl=en)

![](1*GZBHa_9GKbcPnqEJ2FyPPw.png)

[Send to Kindle](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-kindle-for-google/cgdjpilhipecahhcilnafpblkieebhea?hl=en) saves the webpage you’re looking at and sends it to your Kindle so that you can read it offline later.

I had an epiphany that I was trying to use too many apps and so in practice, I ended up using none of them well.

If I want to read something later, I save it to Kindle. If I want to remember something I save it to Evernote. Period.

I stopped bookmarking and uninstalled Instagram and Pocket.

## #5. [Grammarly](http://gram.ly/p2KJ)

![](1*0yuuRPqUWifC3W4Kh7SYzw.png)

Grammarly is an incredibly well-made and convenient grammar and spell checker. Here’s what I like about it:

* It automatically checks everything I write on the web and gives red and green underlines (like in Microsoft Word).

* It gives a nice suggestion of what you could change, plus a one-click button to make the change.

* It explains why it’s making the suggestion. My writing has gotten much sharper based on this feedback.

So, obviously, I like that my writing has fewer mistakes (I sometimes make 30 or more corrections in a single post). But I also love the time savings from doing less work editing my writing.

## #6. [Birthday Buddy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/birthday-buddy/ciljodcgjplloiacmjbngigeihcgdheb?hl=en)

![](1*Ar9UyoZb7KB3z9cQCbKI7Q.png)

This extension sends automatic birthday greetings on Facebook. That’s one less reason for me to log in to Facebook.

I had a long discussion about the social acceptability of this extension and came to the conclusion that if it’s acceptable to have your secretary send a birthday greeting then it’s equally acceptable to have a robot send a birthday greeting.

A few years ago I ran a test to see how much people pay attention when they wish you happy birthday on Facebook.

On April 30th, my real birthday, dozens of friends wished me happy birthday.

Then I changed my birthday to May 1st (the next day). The same number of people sent me birthday greetings. And only two people noticed that I’d had back-to-back birthdays.

So, if you get a birthday greeting from my robot, know that just in writing these few paragraphs, I’ve spent more time thinking about that message than the average Facebook user.

## #7. [Adblock](https://getadblock.com/)

![](1*ZDv7WNZOwC_pKrwb3qXl-g.png)

I’m a recent adopter. [This extension](https://getadblock.com/) hides most ads on the page and usually stops them from even being downloaded.

I want content creators to get paid. Eventually it felt like ads were slowing down every page I visited.

Now webpages load faster and I have free time to help the world in some other way.

Do you have a must-have Chrome extensions that you use every day? What are they and how do you use them?

# How to Ruthlessly Prioritize When It Hits the Fan

## How to Ruthlessly Prioritize When It Hits the Fan

*“Everyone has a plan ‘till they get punched in the mouth.”* *— Mike Tyson*

In mid-April, we had a planned retirement for one of our six Directors. As part of our succession planning, another Director was to absorb these responsibilities with a focus on developing the team. Less than two hours after that party, a third Director shared with me that he was leaving.

**Our senior leadership team had just shrunk by a third. And we were headed into our busiest season of the year with several projects that needed to be completed quickly.**

If there were a textbook description of what it looks like when it hits the fan, this would be it.

To say that I felt overwhelmed would be the tip of a giant iceberg. But curling up in the fetal position wasn’t an option, so I needed to find a way forward. As I took it day by day, this framework emerged.

Oddly enough, I think it’s working. I didn’t fall apart, and neither did the team. We’re also on track with our key milestones.

### **Without further ado, here’s one approach for when it hits the fan.**

### **Step One: Do what it takes to protect your health.**

We’ve all heard this, but I really wasn’t sure what it meant exactly. I understood that getting sick or burned out and reducing the leadership team even further was not a good plan. So I decided to focus on two priorities — sleep and exercise.

For sleep, I gave myself a bedtime, with few exceptions on workdays. I decided on 8:30/9:00pm (for reasons explained below) and stuck to it. I’ve missed out on lots of playoff basketball and haven’t seen any of my favorite shows. Other than that, it hasn’t been much of a change.

For exercise, I decided that I would commit to 30 minutes of movement every day. I prefer swimming, but sometimes my shoulder isn’t happy or I’m feeling exhausted. I can always walk, especially with motivational music or an inspirational interview in my headphones. To reinforce my goal, I took all of my “get ready” stuff to my locker at the gym. I literally have to go there in the morning.

As a somewhat unintended side effect, my nutrition has also improved. I’m planning and preparing more of my meals as opposed to eating out. Mostly, I think this is because of the structure reinforced by the other two habits.

### **Step Two: Do what it takes to be positive.**

Shortly after this transition, we had a memorial for a team member that had been the “face” of our organization. Well into her golden years, she lived fully and embraced adventure. Through the tears, I recommitted to following her example of living joyously. Bitterness wasn’t going to be an option, but this was another principle that’s easier said than done.

For me, it turns out that waking up extra early was essential. Having time to do the things I enjoy — reading and swimming — made me happier. And it’s helpful to feel “ahead” of the day. After talking to my accountability partner, I decided on 4:30am (from a usual 5:30/6:00) start.

I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention another habit that seems to be making a difference in this area — cold water plunges. Certainly talk to your doctor and do your homework, but 2–3 minutes seems to make a huge impact in mood and in reducing overall achiness.

### Step Three: Do what it takes to understand.

When I accepted the General Manager position in 2013, I did so with one caveat — that we would add a position for a Director of Facilities. It was the one area of the business I did not know well, and we had a thirty year-old oceanside property. Salt air and high winds make for all sorts of fun challenges.

Making the choice to absorb (at least temporarily) the responsibilities of this position did not come lightly. In fact, it terrified me.

I made a list of what I understood to be the priorities and open projects, and reviewed them with each of our team leaders and technical consultants. I asked lots of questions that revealed my naiveté. I made a list of the terms and techniques I didn’t understand, and studied them in the evenings.

I decided to be upfront and honest about what I didn’t know. I also committed to learn as quickly as possible, so that I wouldn’t be a liability or a bother. It’s challenging to be that vulnerable and risk being labeled as incompetent. But that’s less risky than proceeding blindly and pretending to have knowledge I didn’t. The first step to understanding is acknowledging where the gaps are.

### Step Four: Do what it takes to comfort the team.

My team was stretched to complete projects before our occupancy soars, and now they have a boss that admits to not knowing much about their area. I’m sure that could be uncomfortable and awkward. I knew I’d need to be intentional about creating the confidence needed to move forward.

I decided to share a few stories of when we had been in similar situations. Over the last six years, I’d been the interim Director for three other areas. In two of those cases, I’d also known very little beforehand about the day-to-day operations of those departments. We survived the transitions, and often used it as an opportunity to make improvements.

I also decided to stay very present. I’ve adapted to the department’s existing meeting schedule. I’ve kept myself available for impromptu conversations or walkthroughs, even though it required opting out of community or social activities. (Given our oceanfront location, a lunch can take over two hours because of commute times.)

### Step Five: Do what it takes to get the job done.

All the healthy conversations and homework are a good start, but the real measure is whether the department is able to perform effectively. This episode served as another reminder that leadership is at the intersection of accepting full responsibility and recognizing that you can “do” very little as an individual contributor.

To move forward, we must have good systems and project plans, and align those with the team members with the skills to actually do the work. The long-term strategy, week planning, and daily execution rhythms are all essential. Omitting a planning or communication step quickly correlates with missed opportunity.

**I also think the sequence matters, both in the big picture and daily flow.**

* Step One: Do what it takes to protect your health.

* Step Two: Do what it takes to be positive.

* Step Three: Do what it takes to understand.

* Step Four: Do what it takes to comfort the team.

* Step Five: Do what it takes to get the job done.

As it turns out, tiny iterations of this process repeat themselves on a daily basis. It’s important that I get through steps 1 to 3 early enough in the morning that our [Stand Up meeting](https://kendrakinnison.com/leadership-essentials-masterful-meetings/) can fulfill step 4 and set the roadmap for step 5.

Since I’m serving in the coordinating leadership role, if I’m in a funk or not prepared, we’re delayed in getting to the priority work. That was a nuance I’m not sure I fully appreciated until this experience. And it gives me much more purpose and determination in keeping to my morning routine.

### **Now it’s your turn.**

### **Have you ever experienced a critical leadership event? How did you approach it?**

# Just Do It

## Close your eyes and picture this. It’s the beginning of June in the early nineties, seven in the morning and the air is warming up. Two kids — he twenty-two, she twenty-one, driving too fast in a red Lancia Delta, on a freeway toward the Mediterranean. One minute they’re singing out loud to a song on the radio, the next minute the car is upside-down on its roof. The boy’s skull is cracked open like a coconut fallen from too high a palm tree, the girl is standing there, her leg open from knee to ankle, staring at her Think Pink sweatshirt speckled with their blood and fragments of his brain.

Open your eyes now. That girl is me, twenty-two years ago almost to the day.

Even though the boy was the one driving, it took me years to get over the sense of guilt that came with having survived – he was an only child, my parents would have had my sibling. He knew what he wanted to do in life, I was still sorting things out.
I was angry, too. At myself, for having failed to prevent the accident—I knew he was driving too fast, we’d had that discussion many times before. At him for having, you know, abandoned me. How dared he.

Eventually the scars on my body began to fade, the ones inside, on some days, are still red and sore. A reminder of the things I lost that day and of the ones I learned. The nightmares, with time, have become fewer and farther in between. There has been, is, good coming out of this. Really.

The biggest lesson I learned is that you cannot rely on the knowledge that someone, anyone, will be there for you tomorrow. Or be there at all. Hell, you might even not be there in five minutes. And that, you see, puts you in charge of what happens in your life *right now*, holds you accountable for what doesn’t, too. Much as you cannot buy happiness, you cannot outsource it either. It’s your responsibility.

Responsibility is a big word, isn’t it? We are raised with the idea that we must, eventually, become responsible. And responsibility, in general, is directed outward, away from you. You owe it to others to be productive and reliable, available and willing. Smiling, patient, caring, kind. You must learn to recognize other people’s needs, preempt them even, and fulfill them because, you know, that’s what a *good *person does. You must conform to what’s expected of you, because that’s what a *good *member of society does. And because in the long run it’s easier, you do conform, and begin to confuse what’s expected of you with what you want. What you have, with what is essential to you.

But, you see, we’re only here for a moment. The long run might not be so long after all. And nothing, ever, is permanent or guaranteed.

You might not get a chance for a do-over, you know. You might not get to do all those things that you keep postponing until the time is just right. You might not get to say those words that right now seem so frightening, or explore those avenues that look so impractical.
You might not get to write that song, tell someone what they really mean to you, start that project, or just walk along the streets of that city.

Do it now. It’s scary, but close your eyes, take a deep breath and go for it. It’s your responsibility to yourself.

Your job will be there tomorrow, if not the one you have today, a different one. The car you drive doesn’t really matter, you can always take the bus. The clothes you wear, they all end up the same, worn out. Everything is replaceable, your life is not.

# The beauty of being human

## why we need the world to be imperfect to appreciate ourselves

Imagine for a moment, if you had super powers, an eternal life, and you lived in paradise. Everything is perfect.

Sounds beautiful?

Try to imagine that vision for a while much longer, imagine all you have wanted to do in your life is to make art for a living and eat caviar everyday.

Oh wait, you can make art all the time now because you do not have to make a living, and you could eat caviar everyday even if you may not need food for sustenance in a perfect world.

You will have no dreams to chase, because all your dreams are already true, you will have no food to crave, because you can eat whatever you want, you will not experience hunger, will not know what is like to taste something divine because everything is divine.There is nothing to fix, nobody to help.

Multiply that moment eternally. Tell me if you see joy in your existence if you had everything in this perfect world, forever.

We are horribly mistaken. We think, “oh if only I can do anything I wanted in my life”. We are mistaken that we seek the power to *do anything*, but what we really want is, to escape doing what we don’t like doing *now*.

Or perhaps we just like the idea of being able to do anything when the rest of the world has to do something. Is it self-empowerment that we seek, or power over the weak?

If there is a perfect world and a perfect you, you wouldn’t know how it feels like to sweat blood, drop tears and still realize that despite all the challenges you are facing, you are still totally invested in making your life worthwhile living.

The challenges we face, the pain we feel, is almost the only chance of us peeking into our inner-reserves, finding out who we really are.
> # c

The joy of living comes from our lives being imperfect. We know the strength of our love for our loved ones when we know we unconditionally accept their flaws. We know we are loved when our loved ones accept us for who we really are. People who are extremely rich and beautiful, we think they have it all, but how would they ever know if they are being appreciated for who they are? It is a curse they would have to live with, a burden they have to carry.

We run marathons because we know how it feels to be able to endure and reach that finishing line. We start businesses because we want to know if we are capable of growing an idea or if our expertise is worth something to people. We participate in social causes because there is a joy in wanting to make the world better.

What we truly want is to realize potential, be it in ourselves, in others or in the world at large. There can no be such realization if the world is perfect.
> # The idea that the world can get better only exists if
> # the world is flawed.

There is something intrinsically beautiful about being human which no amount of words can describe in human language. That we are all deeply flawed creatures with dark desires and yet some of us is trying so darn hard to put aside our flaws, our weaknesses, our egos, to try make something out of it.

Artists may instinctively understand that the best art is created during chaos and disarray. Try making art in a minimalist, sterile room (you will probably be distracted by trying desperately to keep the room clean). We need provocation to display our potential. We love having hard problems to fix. For solving hard problems allows us to know our capacity. Even those of us who have found joy in simple contentment, it is precisely the choice of feeling contentment in the midst of all the madness that is going on, that brings that inner peace.

The beauty of being human, is that we are both strong and weak at the same time. There is a paradox of being able to be weak that ultimately displays our strength; that sometimes trying to be strong all the time makes us weak.

It is how we choose to navigate the paradoxes, the dualities, the contradictions, the understanding that we cannot choose the cards we are dealt with, but we can choose how we play them.

That free will, the will to make that choice to either accept the status quo, or to consistently stretch our own potential despite all of us being flawed human beings living in a imperfect world, is inherently what makes being human so beautiful.

Would you contemplate for a while that what you truly want is not paradise, but rather a sandbox where you can be creative in?

And that the sandbox contains sand that takes on a somewhat organic form, that you can mould with your hands but it will never take on a permanent, unchanging form. You know you will be able to either shape your creations to be even better, or knock it down, so another kid can have the space to make a potentially better replacement — and all the kids in that sandbox can be amazed, with the cycle of disruption and creation going on in that sandbox.

# What I Learned After Six Months of Meditation

## 

I started a daily meditation practice on November 1, 2014. Since that day, I am incredibly proud to say that I have not missed a single day of practice. That’s over six straight months. Now, I want to share with you what I learned after six months of meditating, how it changed my life, and how it didn’t.

However, before we talk about what I learned after six months of meditating, I want to tell you about my sixth grade teacher.

## The Mythical Mr. Anderson

My sixth grade teacher’s name was Mr. Anderson.

Mr. Anderson was a special breed. He taught off curriculum more often than not. He told us stories about things that were interesting, and taught us things while we never even realized we were learning. For example, one vivid memory was a conversation about the veracity of the bible. He explained to us how Moses parting the Red Sea was actually more likely to be the tide going down at the Reed Sea, which was no less miraculous, but far less visually impressive than Charlton Heston’s performance in [The Ten Commandments](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049833/?ref_=nv_sr_1).

He taught us to think critically. He taught for the love of teaching. He loved his students, and we loved him.

In addition to being the best teacher I ever had, Mr. Anderson was also a bit of an odd bird.

He always dressed the same way: shirt, tie and sweater, regardless of the season. During recess, he would stand outside in his sweater, regardless of whether it was a sweltering summer day or several degrees below freezing. He never got upset. Ever. He was excessively private. His mannerisms could only be described as eccentric.

Put all this together, and many rumours swirled. He was independently wealthy, and taught for the fun of it, so he was never stressed. He was gay, but didn’t want anyone to know about it, which is why he was so private. He was some sort of mystic, which explained everything.

How many of those statements were true, if any, I have no idea, but the one about being some sort of mystic fascinated me. I remember my parents getting him to reluctantly agree to have his photo taken with me at my grade school graduation ceremony. After multiple protests they finally broke him by saying, “But you’re his favourite teacher, and it would be so sad if he didn’t have anything to remember you by.”

When we finally got the photos developed (this is before digital cameras, boys and girls), there were two pictures. In both pictures, Mr. Anderson’s head was cut off because the picture was improperly framed. My father, a veteran photographer, was perplexed. He never missed a shot like that…

A different time, during the dead of winter when I was bundled into toque, mittens, and probably a full snow suit, and he was wearing his regular sweater-and-tie combination, I asked him, “Aren’t you cold?”

He explained to me that he had learned how to control the sensations of his body felt, and essentially not let the cold touch him. At some other point, he had also mentioned meditation.

I added all this up in my 11 year-old brain, and came to the conclusion that my sixth grade teacher was a magic man.

## Meditation Gives You Superpowers

Many of these realizations only came to me later in life as I added life experience to my memories, but I had unconsciously convinced myself that Mr. Anderson had given himself superpowers through his meditation practice. As such, I gained a strange respect for the mystical powers of meditation. Hollywood depictions of monks who can control their “chi” and perform supernatural feats probably didn’t help this mental image.

Regardless of what my rational mind thought about these effects of meditation, subconsciously, I think I’ve always believed that the right meditation practice can take someone beyond the boundaries of human limitations.

Ironically, when I started meditating on November 1st, 2014, it was not to become superhuman, but rather just because I wanted to be happier, calmer, more at peace and more focused on what was important.

This was my stated reason for meditating, but in the back of my mind, I was still hoping that along the way, I’d gain those superpowers. I’d develop unlimited patience and calmness. I would learn to be unaffected by temperature. I would learn to control cameras with my mind.

For the first couple of months of meditation, things were going very well. As I began training my monkey mind, I was seeing noticeable differences, both in my meditation sessions, and in my daily life. I was calmer, and when stress would hit, I would actually do an exercise and find mindfulness again. I was mindful of this new practice. And I was seeing that I had better control over my mind. When I began my practice, sitting still for five minutes was a challenge. Eventually, getting to twenty-five minutes was a non-issue.

I think I started to believe that I was on the path to developing those super powers.

Then, after a couple of months, something strange happened.

I was no longer feeling those benefits.

Whatever, the requisite amount of time it takes for something to become a habit (some say 21 days, some say longer), I had successfully made meditation a habit. But that’s good, right?

## The Dangers of Habit-Forming

Well, sort of. I no longer had to force myself to meditate. I would wake up in the morning, and it was natural that the first thing I would do to start my day would be to sit in silence. In that sense, making meditation a habit was a good thing.

The down side, however, was that mediation became something I did without thinking about it. This defeats the purpose of being mindful. In order for meditation to “work,” you need to be doing it consciously, and be present in it. Once something becomes a habit, it becomes second nature, and begin doing it paying attention to it.

Here’s an example. It is common in mindfulness meditation to focus on the breath, and in order to help focus the mind on the breath, you count the breaths. When your mind wanders, you lose count, and you start again. This is a very common technique. When most people start meditating, they get extremelty frustrated by the fact that they can’t seem to even make it to ten without getting distracted. I was no different.

However, after a few months of practice, I realized that it was easy for me to keep count of my breath even *while* my mind would wander. I’d realize that my mind had drifted from the practice for minutes on end, and yet, there I was, still keeping perfect count of my breath.

I had gotten so good at counting breaths, it was now second nature. Unfortunately, the counting was no longer doing its intended job of keeping me focused on the present. Instead, it was now just a meaningless exercise.

The same occurred with other exercises and visualizations as I got used to them. In fact, after a few months, I not only felt like I had hit a plateau in my practice, but I felt like I had fallen backwards. My mind felt very similar to the way it had felt at the very beginning of my practice. The only difference was that I could sit still for twenty-five minutes while my mind bounced all over the place.

More often than not, mediation became an exercise in frustration. But still, I refused to give up and I powered through, figuring that eventually I would break through this wall and come out the other end. And perhaps then, my superpowers would be waiting for me. Maybe this was just the trial that one needed to go through to achieve nirvana?

## I’m Not That Special

It was during this period of intense frustration with my practice that a moment of clarity hit me from an unexpected source.

Driving to work one morning, I was listening to Tim Ferriss’ podcast, and he was [interviewing Amanda Palmer](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/03/30/amanda-palmer/). The entire interview is interesting, and it’s probably my favourite episode of that podcast. The majority of the episode is about how Amanda Palmer went indie and how she got what she wanted when she realized it was up to her to reach out to her fans and ask for it.

However, there is a couple of minutes of the hour-long episode where Tim and Amanda discuss meditation. It’s so short, that if your mind wanders you could probably miss the exchange, and it’s probably not even the most interesting part of the interview. But, it’s in that minute or two when Amanda Palmer was talking about her own meditation practice that clarity hit me.

Amanda has been meditating over a decade, and when she described her practice, she could have been describing exactly what I was feeling. She described the frustration of sitting for long periods of time only to realize that you’ve spent the entire time not being mindful at all. She described the dejection of feeling like you’ve been practicing something for so long and still suck at it. She described meditation as close to torture.

That’s when it hit me. *I’m not special.*

Everyone who meditates is going through the same thoughts. Amanda’s words resonated with me, but I’m sure they resonated with everyone who’s taken the practice of meditation seriously. The frustration is part of the exercise. Being aware of the frustration is part of the exercise.

If after over a decade of meditating, Amanda’s still going through this, what are the odds that I, after a mere six months, would be having an easier go of it?

When I decided to start meditating, I decided to do it alone, with the help of a couple of apps, but never with an actual teacher. As a result, I didn’t know if what I was feeling was normal, or if I was doing something wrong.

Since that moment of clarity, I’ve spent a lot more time talking to people about what they feel when they meditate, and it just reinforced what I now know: I’m not that special. It’s challenging for everyone. But that’s the point, isn’t it?

## I Don’t Know When it Gets Easier

The simple truth of the matter is, I don’t know when it gets easier. I don’t know if it *ever* get easier. I’ve talked to a lot of people, and it’s hard to get an answer that applies to me. Those who say it gets easier seem to be saying that it gets easier to accept that it doesn’t get easier (there’s a koan in there somewhere…).

If it it never actually gets easier and it’s simply a constant struggle to be present, to be mindful and to be aware, then it would seem to suggest that at no point am I ever going to get those super powers that I’ve been hoping for all these years.

So, why bother? Why go through all the trouble if it’s just going to lead to more frustration?

Because it’s worth it.

Every once in a while, not as often as I would like, I will experience a moment of clarity. A moment of bliss. A moment where all the workings of the universe and my place in it (my insignificant place) all become clear. That occassional feeling, no matter how rare, would be enough to keep me practicing.

But that’s not the real reason I keep going.

## Why I Continue Meditating

The real reason I’m still meditating is because of the ongoing frustration. No. I’m not a masochist. I don’t enjoy being frustrated in all things. In fact, I enjoy happiness so much, my blog is called* [*The Happiest Man in the World](http://www.thehappiestmanintheworld.com/). I enjoy having fun, being happy, and avoiding conflict. So, why am I saying I enjoy the frustration so much?

Because it forces me to realizes how happy I am. The struggle to remain present is a struggle to constantly recognize and be grateful for that present moment. It reminds me to enjoy the moment. I have absolutely nothing worthy of complaining about, and chances are, neither do you. But, at some point or another, you and I will get stressed, anxious or angry. All of these things happen because we’re concerned with what happened in the past or what could happen in the future, rather than being present and mindful of all that is right in front of us.

Does a daily meditation practice make me the image of zen calm? No. I still get stressed. I still get anxious. I still get angry. But at least once a day (and hopefully more often), I have an opportunity to remind myself that I should be enjoying the present moment. So, while I don’t always remember to be mindful, thanks to my daily meditation practice, I remember to do it more often.

## Unexpected Benefits

I’ve also noticed that applying these same principles to what were otherwise unpleasant activities made them pleasant again. For example, I hate exercising. I enjoy the benefits of exercising, but I hate the act of exercising. One day, as I was doing a set of exercises, I realized that what I dislike most about exercising was what came next. The individual set, the individual repetition, wasn’t that bad, it was the thought that I had to do X number more of them. So, I started applying mindfulness to my exercise routine.

Now, instead of having my mind wander, or thinking about how many more reps I have left as I’m exercising, I focus on the single movement I’m doing. Because you know what? No single movement can possibly be that bad! Yes, it requires effort, but that’s much easier to swallow than realizing you have to do the same thing 100 more times…

It was that realization that led me down the path of discovering the beginning of Mr. Anderson’s superpowers. I used to think he didn’t feel the temperature. Now I realize it was the exact opposite. He felt the temperature completely. And he accepted it. He allowed himself to acknowledge that yes it was hot, cold, humid, whatever, but that’s okay, and move along without allowing the discomfort to interfere with his life.

Wrapped up in that observation, I believe, is the secret to how meditation can unlock happiness. By being present and mindful, by accepting the present state, we free ourselves from struggle, from anxiety, from stress, from anger.

The present moment is as it is. My anxiety will not change it. My discomfort will not make it any warmer. My struggle will not make the exercise any easier.

In short, meditation has taught me to enjoy what life has to offer *right now… *most of the time.

As for the trick with the camera. I’m still working on that one.

# This is How to Overcome Your Fear of Failure

## This is How to Overcome Your Fear of Failure

When Pablo Picasso was an old man, he was sitting in a cafe, scribbling on a napkin.

He didn’t know it, but a woman sitting near him was looking on in awe.

A couple of minutes later, Picasso finished his coffee, crumpled up the napkin, and was about to throw it away.

But the woman stopped him and said “Can I have that napkin? I’ll pay you for it.”

“Sure,” said Picasso. “That will be twenty thousand dollars.”

The woman was stunned. “What? It only took you two minutes to draw that”.

“No, ma’am,” Picasso replied. “It took me over 60 years to draw this.” (1)

### Mastery Takes Time

Picasso lived to be 91. When he passed away in 1973, he had amassed a net worth of around $500 million, and his art had become famous all over the world.

His output was exceptionally prolific. The total number of artworks he produced has been estimated at 50,000, comprising a large number of paintings, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, prints, tapestries, and rugs (2).

By honing his craft for decades, Picasso eventually reached a point where he could charge twenty thousand dollars for a two-minute napkin scribble. Or, at least, deliver a pretty damn cool one-liner about it.

Anyway, the takeaway here is that mastery takes time. Therefore, we need to be [consistent](http://www.selfication.com/consistency/) in our practice. And to do that we need to be able to make mistakes without losing momentum or giving up.

To [become really good at what you do](http://www.selfication.com/get-really-good/), you have to be comfortable failing at it.

To [become remarkable](http://www.selfication.com/be-a-remarkable-person/), you have to be willing to fail more than anyone else around you.

### Why Failing is So Scary

When you were a kid, you didn’t think twice about learning to walk.

It didn’t matter what the results happened to be in one single attempt; you just kept on trying no matter what.

You stood up, took a step, fell, hurt yourself, maybe cried for a minute or two, and then tried again.

Giving up never crossed you mind.

At no point did you stop and think “Man, I suck at this. I guess walking isn’t for me.”

Clearly, avoiding failure is something we learn later in life.

Somewhere along the way, most of us become afraid to fail.

We learn that it’s embarrassing to fail and that others might hold it against us or make fun of us for it.

And when that happens, we tend to stick to what we’re already good at.

### We Start Failing At Failing

The problem with this, of course, is that it severely limits us.

As soon as we buy into the idea that failing is something to be avoided, every unsuccessful attempt sends the signal that we should stop trying.

And while that reasoning keeps us feeling safe, it also robs us of the opportunity to [realize our highest potential](http://www.selfication.com/realize-your-full-potential/).

Because the only way to become great at something is to be willing to fail at it. Over and over again.

**Success demands failure.** So, we need to take action despite our fear of failure.

How do we do that?

### The Sphere of Choice

In Stoic philosophy, there is a concept known as “[the sphere of choice](http://www.selfication.com/how-to-have-peace-of-mind/).” This idea makes a distinction between:

* **“Internals”** — things we *can* control. For example, our character, values, and behavior.

* **“Externals”** — things we *cannot* control. For example, the past, much of the natural world, and the thoughts and behavior of other people.

The Stoic philosopher Epictetus believed that we should focus exclusively on the internals and let go of the externals.

Only when we stop worrying about what is outside our control and instead turn our attention to what is within our control can we have peace of mind.

### Let Go of What You Cannot Control

I’ve found the sphere of choice to be very effective for dealing with my fears of failure.

Pretty much every time I sit down and write, a series of fearful (and quite mean) thoughts run through my head. Usually, they go something like this:

“Who do you think you are? Nobody is going to want to read this. Man, your writing is dull. You don’t have anything to say, do you? Let’s throw this article in the trash and go do something else.”

In the past, these thoughts would often get the best of me. But I have since learned that [I am not my thoughts](http://www.selfication.com/you-are-not-your-thoughts/) — [I am the one who *hears* them](http://www.selfication.com/two-minds/).

And since that’s the case, my thoughts belong in the category of *external* things. I can’t control what thoughts happen to pop into my head at any given moment, and therefore I don’t worry about it.

My writing, on the other hand, belongs in the category of *internal* things. It’s completely within my control. I can always decide to keep on typing. So, that’s what I do.

No matter what my brain is yelling at me, I just keep on typing away until I’ve met my writing goal for the day.

### The Opinions of Others

This is another part of writing that used to be a big problem for me.

If you’ve ever created something and put it out for the world to see, I’m sure you can relate.

Getting good feedback feels quite nice. But getting bad feedback feels downright awful.

If you get 100 positive responses followed by one negative, it’s that last one that’s going to stick in your mind.

So, to get really great at what you do, you simply cannot care what other people think about it.

Remember, the thoughts and behavior of others belong in the *external* category, and therefore you need to treat them with a healthy dose of indifference.

You’ll never get the approval of everyone, so don’t waste your time trying.

### How to Overcome Your Fear of Failure

From now on, whenever you’re experiencing a fear of failure, remember the sphere of choice.

* If you find that your concern is about something *external*, **practice letting it go**. Remember that it’s a waste of time to worry about things you cannot control.

* If the object of your concern is *internal*, **use it as a trigger to take action**. Stop thinking and start doing.

Be like a kid who’s learning to walk. Fall without concern about how it looks or what other people think. Then do it again. And again. And again.

Measure your success not by your ability to avoid mistakes, but by **your ability to show up and do the work no matter what**.

Picasso was willing to create 50,000 artworks to build his legacy. What are you willing to do?
> *“Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.”
** — Pablo Picasso***

# Altruism as a Path to Happiness

## Philemon and Baucis providing food and shelter for Zeus and Hermes, disguised as peasant travelers. Engraving after Rubens.

At [Coach.me](http://coach.me/), we’ve been talking about altruism. [Tony wrote about it as a path to success here](https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-power-of-altruism-how-good-people-attract-success-5a497a763b37). I’m interested in it as a path to happiness.

To be altruistic, you puts one’s concern for the welfare of others above other considerations—including yourself. The opposite of this is selfishness.

Altruism is a good thing, for lots of reasons (unless it is taken to pathological extremes like codependency). It’s good for the recipient of the altruistic act, but it’s good for the person who practices it, too.

Being altruistic is an easy way to feel greater happiness.

In fact, altruism may be the surest path to feeling better when you are feeling low. If you can’t be a kind person for any other reason, you might some “selfish altruism” and be kind as a way of boosting your own spirits.

I got this advice myself at a very low point in my life. Every part of it—my career, my marriage, my health, my finances—was in a shambles. I felt terrible. But it gave me the gift of desperation, and I was open to taking some advice. Including this:
> # “If you are feeling bad, go find someone to help.”

It seemed ridiculous at the time. If you are feeling bad now, it probably seems ridiculous to you, too.

The thing is, when I tried it, it worked. With the simplest of actions. Making coffee for a meeting. Picking up the phone to call someone who was going through a tough time themselves. Giving someone without a car a ride. Saying “yes” when someone asked me for help.

A funny thing happened when I began to take this kind of advice.

I’ll never forget the day when I was driving away from the ranch where I lived. The rains had cleared the air, leaving colors saturated and trees sparkling. A feeling nagged at me, and I became conscious that I was feeling guilty about something.

I asked myself what I felt guilty about, and the answer surprised me.

I was feeling guilty for feeling happy.

It was such an unusual feeling, it felt like something *must* be wrong with it.

I’m glad I came to my senses about *that*.

And now, when I read some of the emerging science about addictions, the strange advice to be altruistic as a way to feel happier makes a lot of sense.

The engine behind addictive behavior?

Isolation.

[Isolation can turn us into neurotic addicts](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/the-real-cause-of-addicti_b_6506936.html). The classic addiction experiment story goes like this: put a rat in a cage and give it two water bottles, one laced with an addictive substance. Soon the rat is emptying the doped water bottle. Because the substance is irresistible. Right? Right. *War on drugs!*

But what if you do the same experiment with a group of rats, and give them a nice rat environment to live in all together—call it “Rat Park” maybe. Guess what?

That doped water is no longer irresistible. In fact, it’s not even preferred. The rats drink the plain water and go on with their social rat lives.

“Rat Park” was a ground-breaking study by [Bruce Alexander](http://www.brucekalexander.com/articles-speeches/rat-park/148-addiction-the-view-from-rat-park) which has become a foundation for new understanding of social isolation as a primary driver of addiction.

Other studies point to isolation as a health risk beyond addiction. [Social isolation, loneliness, and living alone are associated with a higher risk—up to almost a third!—of early mortality.](http://pps.sagepub.com/content/10/2/227.abstract)

**Having a sense of connection to the people around us makes us healthier and more resistant. Altruistic acts are a way for us build these connections.**

And everyone has some capacity for altruism, even if it’s something seemingly as small as paying someone a compliment.

Making altruism part of your daily habits is a way to strengthen your feeling of connection with others. It works because we are social animals who are wired to function better in community rather than in isolation.

It works even if you don’t believe in it.

Here’s what my experience is like: when I make a conscious effort to be kind to someone—not because I’m obligated to, or because they’ll do something nice in return, or even because I feel it’s the right thing to do—but simply to be kind, there’s some magic that can happen.

* The other person might smile at me. That simple thing gives me a good feeling.

* I feel a little more empowered, because I’ve taken an action under my own terms. Even something as simple as holding a door open for someone can give me a sense of agency. Even if a terrible day leaves me feeling powerless.

* I feel better about myself because I’m contributing something positive to life.

* I might even experience “[the helper’s high](http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/science-good-deeds)” — a real physical state associated with lower stress hormones, increased antibodies associated with improved immunity, and higher levels of oxytocin.

* I feel a greater connection to life around me. I’m living a little more in LIFE, and a little less in my own head—a dangerous neighborhood that I’m better off avoiding!

* I’m able to reconnect to gratitude, because I become more aware of how much I have and how fortunate I am in many ways.

None of this makes me into a better person (that’s a value judgement I have no use for) — but it almost always makes me *feel* like a better person. And even if I can’t quite get *there*, then at least I don’t feel like a total waste.

The brain chemistry is on my side, even if my rational brain isn’t helping me out much.

I feel happier.

And, just maybe, those small acts brighten the lives of people around me just a little.

Now that’s a win-win.

There are plenty of people who control your dreams.

And chances are a lot of them are nay-sayers.

Road blockers.

**Gatekeepers.**

They are all around you.

Your friend, who tells you your idea for a shoe-tying robot is “stupid”.

Your boss, who says you “can’t just buy a fitness tracker for everyone in the office to improve company culture”.

Even your Mum, who might say you’re “too old to play video games and upload videos of it to Youtube”.

Easy for them to say, right?

Well, yeah.

They don’t know any better.

They don’t know that what they’re guarding is really just an archway.

It’s wide open.

Anyone can go through.

![](1*JD7XhkdbwN6XkJLdBo5j0Q.png)

But no one told them.

And no one told you either.

So you both think you actually need their permission to go through.

**You don’t.**

With the rise of the internet the last few gates vanished.

Whether it becomes your dreams or a tool on the way to accomplishing it, access to the internet is all you need to take control of your dreams.

Want to create a shoe-tying robot? Use Kickstarter.

Fitness trackers for the office? Create a massive Doodle survey, to show people want it.

Make money playing video games? We all know [that’s happening](https://gaming.youtube.com/).

The truth is, **you have zero excuse not to live your dream**.

## So why are you not?

What is it then, that keeps you from living your dream?

In one sentence: **You’ve gotten comfortable in the gatekeeper system.**

I can’t blame you. You’ve been raised to.

Just like me.

And it works. Oh how great it works.

**As long as people keep opening their gates for you, there’s no reason to leave.**

Trust me, I would know.

I’ve been complacent all my life. I had no reason not to. I didn’t know what struggle was.

I was raised in a German upper class family. I had the most cotton candy pink bubble rainbow unicorn childhood you can imagine.

I could read before I went to elementary school. I did my homework. I never had to study. I would just get straight A’s (except for gym class, oh wonder), no matter how much time I spent outside, hanging with friends, or playing Xbox.

I got into every college I applied for. I got a scholarship to study abroad. I got an internship at [the greatest company on earth](https://instagram.com/p/qFRyn5yHp9/?taken-by=ngoeke).

**Open. Open. Open.**

Everyone kept opening their imaginary gates for me.

Come on through.

Until they didn’t.

“I’m afraid you’re 5.5 credits short, Mr. Goeke. You see, we do this process to make sure *you’re able to follow the curriculum.”*

The lady looked at me like I was a hobo, living in the woods.

I had applied to get into the Mannheim Master in Management program. One of, if not THE most prestigious business school in Germany.

**REJECTED.**

**The gate is closed. You can’t go through.**

What did I do wrong?

I passed all the other gates!

The GMAT gate — 680 points when they required only 600.

The deadline gate — I submitted my application on the day they opened submissions.

Why can’t I pass the credit gate too?

She explained to me how a module that was labeled “business” at my former college was “too specific” for their taste. Yet somehow supply chain management was business enough.

Did you know that in Europe we have a new system in place that makes all credits equal?

It’s called [European Credit Transfer System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System).

Don’t you think that’s a funny name when I can’t even transfer the credit from Karlsruhe to Mannheim, two cities which are 40 minutes apart?

I asked the lady that in a later email.

No response.

I bet she’s busy opening the credit gate for other people.

What a bitch!

## Are there gates after all?

I lied.

There are gates sometimes. And they really are closed.

**But they’re never the gates to your dreams.**

They’re mostly the gates to other people’s dreams.

When you reach such a gate, it’s time to turn around.

Turn around and find another way.

![](1*Xsc1US8Mk4OwRjbLayDgyw.png)

Here’s my dream:

**I want to live on my own terms, make my own hours and not have to answer to anybody. I want to help as many people as possible to live better lives, create better habits and reach their full potential.**

And I want to do it all while having the freedom to walk away from it whenever I please.

That’s my dream.

As it turns out, getting into business school wasn’t a gate I needed to pass to make that happen.

I’m still on my way. But I just keep going through those archways.

## 3 steps to put yourself in control of your dreams

If you’re ready to turn away from the closed gates, and stop waiting for others to wave you through their archways, this might be for you.

If you want to keep playing that game, I’m not gonna stop you.

(See what I did there?)

But if you’re ready to **accept that everything between you and your dream is a bunch of wide open gates and archways**, that you just have to go through, then I invite you to [join me](http://niklasgoeke.com/join).

Here are the ones you have to go through to do so.

## **Step 1: Ask yourself what your dream is**

This isn’t easy.

But it’s not as hard as you make it out to be.

Imagine your perfect day for a second.

I’ll wait.

Got it?

Good.

**Now scratch that.**

You just imagined your perfect *holiday*.

The kind of day that will get boring after 2 weeks of re-living it over and over again.

Now I want you to imagine your actual, perfect day.

A day where you do something meaningful with your life.

You can still get up late. Or eat fancy. Or sit on a beach.

**But you’re doing what you love. Work you love. And what others will love you for doing.**

Maybe you’re teaching underprivileged kids how to surf.

Or you’re helping small businesses stand out from the crowd.

But you could also just study chess for 7 hours.

That’s your dream.

It will change over time. And that’s okay. But you need to start somewhere.

If it’s something you thought you wanted to be when you grow up when you were a kid, there’s a good chance it’s part of your dream.

If you can see a [theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrqPZlLCts) in it, whether that’s freedom, leaving a legacy, prestige, money, or having an impact, grab on to it and hold it tight.

**This might all sound wishy washy, because it is, but so is your dream.**

It’s not a fixed point in life and by the time you get there what it is will have changed 1,000 times.

Embrace that.

Just calibrate your compass to at least point towards your [true north](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/18888/meaning-of-true-north).

## Step 2: Schedule your dream

Yup.

Just schedule it.

30 minutes at a time.

Every day for the next week.

It might start with reading magazines about cars.

Or practicing to juggle.

Or doing the same spin over and over again for 8 hours straight.

![It took even Michael a while to get it right](1*gcJtz2KWS-_KyKa_r_svhg.gif)*It took even Michael a while to get it right*

For me, that means writing.

Every day.

Some days I just write crap. Some days it’s brilliant.

I often don’t even know which days are which.

I’ll let you decide.

But I know I must write.

To keep going through archways.

So I schedule it.

![](1*we1UIITbYBQ5AOnFfNB_eA.jpeg)

Simple enough, right?

**I’m making an appointment with myself.**

“Nik, you and I are going to meet at 10 am, every day, and then we’ll work on your dream!”

Okay me, got it.

## Step 3: Remember that it’s YOUR dream

*You have to make yourself the only person who can control your dreams.*

In reality, you already are.

But sometimes you might run into people who try to gate their archways.

Or actual, closed gates.

It’s your job to not get mad then.

It’s not their fault. **And it’s not their dream. It’s yours.**

You must remember that.

To just politely pass through, without offending them, or turn around and find another path.

After all, it’s not your Mum who wants to windsurf every day.

It’s not your boss who wants to teach kids in Africa about the value of music.

And it’s not your friend who wants to build that shoe-tying robot.

**It’s you.**

So go ahead. Make it easier on yourself. [Install that text reminder](https://ifttt.com/recipes/336348-your-dreams-text).

Tell yourself, every day.

When you [don’t feel like showing up](https://medium.com/better-humans/3-steps-to-take-when-you-lack-motivation-and-why-that-s-a-dumb-thing-to-say-c30d4d033ac0#.bleoo3vfv).

Or people tell you “you can’t”.

Remember that it’s really all up to you.

## How the next 10 minutes can change your life

“Dude, I just read this great blog post about gates ‘n stuff today, you need to check that out!”

“Ohh, that was good, let me recommend that.”

I’m flattered, but before we get to that part, I really need you to **take action first.**

It’s so easy to read this, bookmark it, share it, and forget it.

But it’s actually just as easy to, in Shia LaBeouf’s words, [just do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAVLOHbqWd4).

Take the next 10 minutes to do these 3 things:

**Step 1: **Ask yourself what your dream is. Zone in on that thing that’ll make you die with a smile.

**Step 2: **Schedule it. Work on your dream. 30 minutes a day. One day at a time.

**Step 3: **Text yourself [this reminder](https://ifttt.com/recipes/336348-your-dreams-text) every day to stay on track.

See? Easy as 1–2–3. Literally.

Okay.

I’m done for the day.

I’ll look for new archways tomorrow.

The only question is…

Will you be there?
