# Embrace Your Obstacles to Get Ahead in Life

## Image Credit: Martin Olsen via Unsplash

Can you recall the last time you faced a set back, or an obstacle that really weighed you down?

Whether it was in your past, or you’re presently facing an obstacle, we all have to deal with them. Though, however unpleasant, these obstacles that come our way are necessary for growth. If we never had to face any adversities, blockers, setbacks or failures in life, our experiences would be cake! We’d have it so easy.

The downside? We would never be forced to adapt and mature.

So, in theory, **having to face obstacles in life is actually desirable.** The more obstacles you’ve faced, the greater the likelihood that you are quite mature and adaptable.

Though, not everyone tackles obstacles enthusiastically and head on. Some people go to great lengths to avoid them… or go into denial about their existence. And, others let obstacles overwhelm them, and they feel defeated.

Most think of obstacles as a negative; but, if you can maintain an opportunistic attitude when facing your obstacles or limitations, you’ll have an even more impressive result once you finally reach your goals!

Now, think about what obstacles are currently in your way.

What might you be faced with? Often, it’s time and/or money limitations.

Here’s an example:

Let’s say you’ve always dreamed of writing a book — you find yourself daydreaming about the possibility (and have practically written 2 chapters in your head). The problem is, after work and family obligations, you definitely don’t have enough time to write. You wish you could just quit your job to pursue writing full-time, but you also need money to pay your bills.

It’s definitely not easy having to be in such a predicament. Most of us simply cannot drop our current routine to pursue something totally different.

But, you can do both!

What I mean is, you won’t reach your goals overnight; but, you can **take progressive steps** towards them using your obstacles as a guide for your path.

In this case, you have to keep making income, and writing a book doesn’t pay… so, your first challenge is to find a way to make money that will get you closer to writing. Or, you can find a way to increase your time.

One option is to find a job within your field that has more writing responsibility, which will position you well for writing your book, as you’ll gain experience and better understanding of the writing world. Through your own career, you may get closer and closer to becoming a professional writer, which is excellent leverage when it comes to getting paid to publish a book.

Or, you could find just 30 minutes a day to dedicate to writing your book, and maybe get rid of something else you habitually do–such as Netflix or Video games. Those 30 minutes a day will add up and you’ll be making major progress towards your goal.

To successfully overcome adversities and reach your goals, you have to embrace the obstacles that come your way.

You certainly don’t have to celebrate or welcome them with open arms, but rather accept and believe that these obstacles will push you to be stronger, help you grow and mature, and shape you to be more resilient.

**Your attitude towards setbacks will define the outcome of whether you rise from the challenge, or remain stuck in it.**

Here are some more great things to love about obstacles.

## Obstacles Give You Purpose

Sometimes obstacles can reset your objectives.

You might have always had a particular way of doing things, or wanted to pursue certain goals; but when you’re faced with setbacks or difficulties, you’re forced to re-think, and re-examine your path.

And, you may end up focusing on something new and exciting–maybe something that you otherwise wouldn’t have if not for the particular set back.

Granted, your obstacle may throw you off track for a bit, but it will also help you find strength when you’re faced head-on with a challenge. **By having to overcome an obstacle, you’ll be fulfilling a purpose, rather than just going through the motions.**

After you’ve overcome an obstacle, you’re more likely to feel confident to overcome the next one that may come your way, and well prepared to tackle other goals ahead.

## Obstacles Prepare You for the Unexpected

Even though obstacles aren’t pleasant, they don’t actually prevent us from reaching our intended goals. They serve as guides for where to go next, and–in a way–gives you time to stop and think if perhaps there is a new and better path to take.

While, of course, obstacles can bring out many negative emotions in us, such as frustration, anger, or sadness, it’s important to realize that they don’t inhibit us from reaching our destination — they only change the path we were originally expecting to take.

## Obstacles Shift Your Perspective

Obstacles, whether we like it or not, are inevitable.

Life is ever changing, and so we need to constantly change and adapt to new situations.

Life will never stop throwing you new obstacles. So, the best thing to do is know how to better *see and deal with* these obstacles, and transform them into opportunities for self improvement.

Everybody faces different obstacles — some much more severe than others. A few lucky people float through life with relatively few obstacles, others face more difficulty.

If you think of life like a game of poker, it’s easy to see how it’s advantageous to play the cards you’re dealt to the best of your ability. While inevitably some people are dealt better hands than others, your chances of success are mostly determined by how you play the game.

The more you’re able to see obstacles as being an advantage to your life, the better you’ll be at managing them, and using the experience to propel you further.

## Relish a Challenge

Your mindset is key when facing obstacles. When you practice being optimistic through adversity, you’re intentionally shifting away from negative forces that might consume you. This is the power of a positive mindset.

Accepting obstacles *will give you purpose, prepare you for the unexpected, and shift your perspective*, allowing you to grow into a better version of yourself.

It’s not what happens to us that determines our fate, but rather, what we do about it that makes the difference. It’s the choices we make and the actions we take along the way; it’s the thoughts we have, what we focus on and how we frame what we tell ourselves 24/7.

Here is an inspirational quote that I’d like to leave you with:

***“I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has had to overcome while trying to succeed” — Booker T. Washington***

Look at a current obstacle you’re facing, and ask yourself: “Have I accepted it with a positive mindset?”

# Creating a 360 Customer Experience

## Cindy Breshears, CTO of IBM Bluewolf, shares how companies that win have the best CX

![[Source](https://www.bluewolf.com/sites/default/files/net_promoter_score.png)](0*7QiA-h6lJmSTw2O8.png)*[Source](https://www.bluewolf.com/sites/default/files/net_promoter_score.png)*
> # “Customers have more choices than ever before and customer experience is the only differentiator that organizations really have out there.” — Cindy Breshears, CTO Bluewolf, an IBM Company

Back in 2012, IBM made a bold, strategic acquisition.

They acquired a large [Salesforce](https://medium.com/@salesforce) consulting company called [Bluewolf](https://twitter.com/Bluewolf).

Now, Bluewolf is on a tear, introducing new initiatives at a lightning pace.

One of the women behind these transformations is Cindy Breshears.

![](1*OuKfPfOerZ4L3PZcDU6Fyg.jpeg)

Cindy has been a CIO for multiple organizations over the last 16 years and is currently Chief Transformation Officer (CTO) for Bluewolf. There, she provides digital transformation leadership.

Cindy recently sat down with us on [*IT Visionaries](https://apple.co/2nTgInb) *to discuss one trend that is taking over the IT landscape: customer experience. What follows are some of the most important actionable insights for other technology executives who are looking to get an edge.

Consumers have access to more choices than ever before. They also expect the utilization of, installation of, and support for these services or products to be hassle-free.

“Execs don’t decide how customer-centric their company is. Customers do. And as we know, the expectations from a customer are changing rapidly, as their last, best experience becomes their new baseline for what they expect for the next experience.”

Over the last decade, as technology has advanced, customer experience (CX) has become more important than ever. Every aspect of the customer journey — from purchase, to use, to upgrading, to fixing a bug — must be optimized to the customer. Cindy calls this the ‘360 experience’:

“It’s a really what I would call 360 experience with the customer. A good [company] has a journey and take the data points for the beginning to the end and does a full 360 for that service or product. A bad experience is when, for example, I have a baby, but then I forget that I have to feed and clothe them. So I only go halfway with my engagement model.

“Companies must focus on optimizing every customer moment. In Bluewolf — as the top Salesforce Consulting partner — we believe Salesforce is the platform for that customer engagement and innovation model that we’re just discussing and our mission is to help our customers realize it and not just do half of an engagement model.”

Every part of the customer journey must be geared towards providing excellent service. Engaging a customer at the point of purchase, but then only providing mediocre upgrade options will result in a lost customer. And when “68% of consumers who switch to the competition don’t come back,” making sure that initial engagement is positive is crucial. Creating a 360 experience from the very beginning will result in a customer for life.

![[Source](https://prnewswire2-a.akamaihd.net/p/1893751/sp/189375100/thumbnail/entry_id/0_sfs9zqio/def_height/2700/def_width/2700/version/100012/type/1).](1*FpfwO8M21wvrpzvGxklemA.jpeg)*[Source](https://prnewswire2-a.akamaihd.net/p/1893751/sp/189375100/thumbnail/entry_id/0_sfs9zqio/def_height/2700/def_width/2700/version/100012/type/1).*

But, who owns CX? Which department is responsible for creating this 360 experience?

“I think we get into this Silo mentality with customer experience. So for me, the question is not about who owns customer experience, but who executes on customer experience. And the answer is everyone in the organization executes on customer experience.

“If it doesn’t start from the top, if it’s not being felt from an employee standpoint, and it doesn’t radiate through the entire culture and a mindset, then the customer experience will be in silos instead of being owned by everybody.”

Silos create gaps in the customer journey; a gap that could result in a lost customer. To prevent these gaps from occurring, every department must provide excellent customer experience.

Another part of Cindy’s job as CTO is to find where new tech can be brought in to support Bluewolf. AI, bots, and machine learning are changing how companies are able to interact with their customers.

“Technologies like AI, cloud, blockchain, and the internet of things will change the world. But only if they can be effectively trained, trusted, and applied. So it goes back to that change management piece… We have a lot of new technology but how to enable them into the organization and into our enterprises is the key.”

One example of this is transforming healthcare and improving patients’ medical experiences.

“We have patients that expect their healthcare providers to be familiar with their medical record history. So what we’ve done is we’ve used Salesforce Health Cloud — which provides a 360 view of the patient including previous doctor visits, medical history, transactions, and past inquiries — and when a patient dials their healthcare provider, IBM Watson Health improves call key management by analyzing a patient’s data to automatically route them to the appropriate agent for their issue…Then the Salesforce automation enables providers to officially route and escalate patient cases, minimizing the wait times for patients.”

Using this method, Cindy and her team have helped innovate new ways of approaching medicine and healthcare. Despite the results, she says the process of pushing IT to the forefront has not been easy.

![](1*vj8B-YZvkTA1ElTmw4c9Pw.png)

Throughout her career, Cindy has heard that CIOs are *not *change leaders. She believes they are. But without the support of an entire team and organization, she acknowledges change can be difficult to execute.

“CIOs have been talking change since the first day they got a seat at the table, but it takes the culture to interconnect metrics, technology, process people, and training together. The CIO doesn’t stand alone… he’s a body of a team of management that makes effect of change.

“The bottom line here for me, and the CIO as a change leader, is that leadership must administrate commitment to the long-term outcomes of customer experience.

“Commitment is through building a culture and organizational transformation plan that aligns and continuously adapts to business and technology with metrics to succeed and get the big ideas to reality.”

The customer journey is ultimately what will cause your company to keep or lose customers. Creating good customer experiences is the responsibility of the entire organization. Communication, clear expectations, appropriate technological adaptation, and a customer centric culture all work together to generate the 360 experience.

## Quick Hits

**What’s the app that you’re using on your phone that’s the most fun right now?**

“My daughter is in Africa, so the most fun is being able to see my daughter through FaceTime.”

**Favorite time-saving tool?**

“The Delta app for my flights [allows me] to make changes. And Amazon, I buy everything from Amazon.”

**Favorite team, sports or otherwise?**

“Favorite sport is dirt biking and ATV riding. Favorite football team is, from a professional sense, the New England Patriots, because you’ve got to love that Tom Brady.”

“I like Ted Talks and really enjoy the IBM podcast.”

**Favorite show that you’re watching?**

“I have two! The Americans and The Shooter.”

**Favorite book?**

“The one that kinds of bills into what I do on a daily basis is *Who Moved My Cheese?”*

**Favorite one-day getaway in Atlanta, or surrounding areas?**

“I would have to say going up to a place where we do a lot of dirt biking and ATV riding. We go up there for the day and I get on a bike or an ATV and I don’t think about anything else in the world.”

**Favorite Dreamforce moment?**

“I have a lot of them, but my most favorite was when I was one of those CIOs they did a spotlight on. They gave me a makeover and did a video of me. Then we all went out to dinner with Mark that night and it was a great experience.”

# This is how you live a healthier life

## This Is How You Live a Healthier Life

Most people strive to be healthier. But for a lot of people it’s pretty damn hard, and I’ve realized that it’s because people’s view of what “being healthy” means is dead wrong.

I used to think being healthy was an achievable goal — a one-time deal like an actor’s big break or a writer who starts making money for a living.

But it’s not.

I used to think being healthy meant following a strict diet and exercise routine, torturing yourself to achieve the body of a Greek God and a status of “oh shit, *that guy* works out.”

But that’s not true either.

I also used to think being healthy meant sacrificing things you love — cheeseburgers, desserts, and ICEEs at the movies (aka sugar) — for the sake of your well-being.

But yep, I was wrong about that too.

Because all of that *would suck.* And I don’t blame anyone who can’t live by those rules.

## **What being healthy actually means**

My view of being healthy was extremely short-sighted. I was looking at it as a sprint instead of a marathon. It turns out that being healthy is a *lifestyle *— a way of living. It’s not a prescription that you can follow to achieve a desired result and maintain forever. It’s a lifetime’s worth of decisions made each and every day.

Sure, you might be able to achieve the body you’ve always dreamed of after a few grueling months of diet and exercise, but unless you’re a freak or someone destined for the Olympics, I’d bet you’d burn out shortly after.

Sooner or later, something happens (looking at *you*, life) that puts a wrinkle in your plans, launching you back into old, unhealthy behaviors.

Instead, I’ve learned a far better way of living from a previous health coach of mine, Adam Bornstein, by reading Precision Nutrition’s newsletter, and a few years of my own research, which Adam helped with by teaching me how to weed out the BS.

Most of what I learned can be boiled down to one simple practice.

And here’s the cool part…

* You don’t have to do anything drastic.

* You don’t have to dive into anything grueling, hoping for a change that will stick.

* You don’t have to go full keto (unless that’s your thing).
> All you have to do is play the healthier-living game.

Let me explain.

## **Level 0**

This game, much like life, has levels to it. Everyone starts at Level 0 but people diverge along the way. Some go on to Levels 5, 10, 20, or 50. Some stay at Level 0.

Everybody progresses at their own rate and each level may differ from person to person.

Let’s look at an example of what your progression through the ranks might be.

Let’s say you’re just now beginning your journey to a healthier life, so you’re at Level 0. None of your meals are home-cooked and most come from the window of a fast-food restaurant. Instead of mindlessly shoving McDonald’s cheeseburgers down your throat like a pelican (shout-out to Bill Burr for the reference), it’s time to play the healthier-living game.

Ask yourself…
> “What can I do to make this decision a little bit healthier?”

You don’t have to stop going to McDonald’s — at least not at Level 0. **But what can you do?**

You could…

* Eat your cheeseburger with one less bun

* Order a small fry instead of a medium (which is like a large anyways)

* Ask for a fountain water instead of a Coke

By doing just one of these things, you made a conscious decision to live a healthier life. And while you — or whoever’s with you — might not think that’s a big deal, it is. Sure you’re still eating fast food but now you’ve made one small step in the right direction.

Ask yourself this question with every meal and before long, you’re out of Level 0 and onto Level 1.

## **Level 1**

At this point you’ve gotten good at eating healthier at your favorite fast food joints. Now that you’ve mastered the fast food game, you’re inspired to make a slightly bigger change.

It’s lunch time and you again ask yourself:
> “What can I do to make this decision a little healthier?”

Instead of McDonald’s, you decide to go to Subway. Instead of loading up on trans fats and frozen burgers, you get a delicious sandwich and a bag of chips. While certainly not the epitome of a “healthy” meal, you’re crushing it compared to last week.

And your meal has 300 fewer calories than your go-to fast food burger joint! Win.

## **Levels 2 and beyond**

Now you’re feeling over the moon about yourself and have been continuing to make your Subway trips even healthier. You feel like you’re finally ready to start making your own food.

First you grab some deli meat, mayonnaise, sliced cheese and bread to make sandwiches. Then you grab a bag of chips to eat on the side.

Level 2 complete.

Now…
> “What can I do to make this decision a little bit healthier?”

You could:

* Switch from bread to a lettuce wrap

* Add some vegetables onto your sandwich

* Replace the chips with fruit or a side of carrots

Every time you make a slightly healthier decision, you bump up another level.

Eventually, you’re eating homemade veggie omelets, lettuce wraps with hummus and fruit, chicken with rice and broccoli, and snacking on things like protein bars, fruit, nuts, and Greek yogurt.

You’re blasting through levels like it’s your job and without realizing it, you’ve been living a healthier life for the past ***6 months.***

You go Glen Coco.

## **The best part about playing the game**

This game is all well and great, especially if you can keep making progress unimpeded. But let’s be honest, life doesn’t work that way.

No sweat. The healthier-living game is actually *made* for this kind of living.

It doesn’t matter what you’re doing, or what level you’re on, or where you’re at, the way you live a healthier life is by looking at your current situation and once again asking yourself…
> “What can I do to make this decision a little bit healthier?”

For example, you might be a fucking rock-star who eats perfectly “healthy” foods on most days. But you also have to travel for work at least once a month. This puts a wrench into your plans since you can’t cook from home while away, especially not during travel days.

Have you ever tried to eat healthy making two or three connections in one day? It’s damn near impossible.

But you overcome this and still live a healthy lifestyle by playing the game with a slightly different mindset.

Instead of feeling like shit for having to settle for the McDonald’s cheeseburger right outside your plane’s gate (sorry Ronald, don’t mean to keep making you sound like the bad guy), you can play the healthier-living game with the cards you were dealt.

Embrace the cheeseburger but take off the buns.

Skip the fries.

*You know the drill.*

It’s OK to go back a few levels because in reality, you might not have a choice. Don’t hate yourself for indulging in a quick, tasty meal just because it doesn’t mesh with your new lifestyle. *Everything* meshes with your new lifestyle if you’re willing to bend the rules.

This is how you become healthier ***for life.***

By playing this game, you’re not only constantly looking for ways to eat as healthy as possible, you’ve also developed a **healthy relationship** with your diet — you’re OK not being perfect all the time. And that’s how life should be.

## **This works with everything, not just food**

Contrary to what you might think, this article isn’t just about your diet. Living a healthier life is much more than that.

The super awesome thing about this game is that it can be played *anywhere, with just about anything.*

For example…

### While slaving away in your cubicle at work, what can you do to make that a little bit healthier?

You could…

* Set a timer to stand up and stretch every so often

* Get up and walk around every hour

* Walk to the farthest bathroom instead of the one nearest you

* Ask your boss for a standing desk

### While watching TV at home, what can you do to make that a little bit healthier?

You could…

* Do push-ups during commercial breaks

* Watch while standing up

* Watch while running on a treadmill

### When out with your friends at the bar, what can you do to make that a little bit healthier?

You could…

* Order light beer instead of something heavy (Michelob Ultra is my go-to)

* Opt for vodka sodas over sugary mixed drinks or cocktails

* Have 1 less drink than you normally would

### When winding down for bed at night, what could you do to make that a little bit healthier?

You could…

* Floss instead of just brushing your teeth

* Use an aloe vera-based mouthwash

* Put the electronics away and let your mind relax

When stuck in traffic, you could use that time to practice deep breathing.

When cooking, you could use extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable or canola oil.

When cleaning, you could use tea tree oil and other natural products over items with toxic chemicals.

When swimming at the pool, you could put sunscreen on instead of letting your skin fry.

The list goes on. There are opportunities for improvement in everything that you do. But don’t freak out — you don’t have to take them all at once. All you have to do is play the game as often as you can and look to improve a little each day.

And when life throws you a curveball, be OK with it. Play the healthier-living game with the cards you’re dealt.

No matter where you are right now, or what level you’re on, or what you do, you’re always free to play. And I hope it makes you a healthier person like it did for me.

# I’ve Worked In Banking, Recruiting, Software, And More.

## I’ve Worked In Banking, Recruiting, Software, And More. This Is The Advice I’d Give Anyone Who Wants To Change Careers

### You don’t need to be a specialist.

***By [Brandon Metcalf](https://medium.com/@brandonmetcalf), CEO and Managing Partner of Blueprint Advisory, Founder of Place Technology***

As a kid, I wanted to be a cop. And then an Air Force pilot.

But in high school, I discovered my love for business. My first taste was a program I enrolled in my junior and senior year. For half the day, I’d work at a local newspaper, handling the bookkeeping for the classifieds section.

Many people my age were only in it for some cash-but right from the start, I was fascinated by the world of business. I wanted to learn everything I could and explore every facet of it. Since then, I’ve worked in banking, recruiting, and eventually software.

## I focused on being a generalist, not a specialist.

Early in my career, people always told me to pick one trade and stick with it.

But I didn’t listen, because the prospect of staying in one field forever just didn’t interest me. I deeply value consistent [growth and learning](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/how-to-be-more-disciplined-with-your-goals-7-simple-strategies-you-should-learn/) and expect every professional experience to be meaningful and challenging. And with those requirements in mind, before taking a new position, I carefully considered how any given route might shape my career path.

I cherished my time at Bank of America, where I grew from a college-kid teller to a branch manager to assistant vice president. But when I saw people who’d been there for 20 or 30 years-their entire professional lives, really-I knew I didn’t want to follow that path. As much as I loved that job and the people I worked with, I just couldn’t envision doing the same thing for so long.

After that realization, I began looking for [new opportunities](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/success-is-not-a-straight-line-3-traits-you-need-to-harness-to-overcome-adversity-and-reach-the-next-level/)-and found them in lots of different places. I knew that building a career in one narrow field would never satisfy my professional hunger. I also decided that I wanted to eventually lead a company and felt that having a diverse background with different roles in a variety of industries would be a key differentiator.

## A succession of strategic moves has led me down my varied career path.
> # Here’s the advice, gleaned from my own experience, for anyone with a desire to branch out or change careers:

* **Don’t be afraid to move for a job**. My willingness to relocate took me to seven different cities, each wonderful in its own way. I gained countless unique experiences-plus I now have friends all over the world.

* **But don’t job hop, either**. I’ve never joined an organization without staying for at least a few years. When I seize a new opportunity, I focus intently on the company and industry. I push myself to achieve my goals and be the best I can be. That level of knowledge and mindset was critical to my understanding before I made another move.

* **Nurture relationships wherever you go**. Building off the last piece of advice, it takes time for lasting relationships to develop. I’ve got a list of people who trust me, and vice versa, because I showed them I was trustworthy over years of working alongside them. You can’t shortcut a relationship, you have to invest and earn the trust.

* **Don’t take a job for the money**. If you do, the satisfaction from the paycheck won’t last long, and you’ll still have to do a job you don’t love every day. When you’re looking for a new role, focus on the position, what you can learn, the company mission, and what you’ll be able to do next. And remember that, if you do a great job, more money will always come.

* **Don’t take a job based on the prestige of the company alone**. I once turned down an incredible offer from Google. Sure, the campus, the perks, the money, and the prestige were all very enticing. But the role wasn’t for me-I wouldn’t have been doing what I’m passionate about on a day-to-day basis. No regrets.

* **Time things as well as you can**. Ask yourself, “Is it the right time for me to join this company?” And conversely, “Is it the right time for this company to bring me on board?” For example, one great way to break into a new field is to work at a startup. When we launched [Talent Rover](https://www.bullhorn.com/talentrover/), a Salesforce-based staffing and recruiting software company, many of our hires were people without any software experience at all. But that was OK, because they learned with us as we grew. But they may not have had that opportunity at an established company.

* **Before taking a job, know why you want it. **Do you want to learn and grow with that company over five or 10 years? Will the knowledge and skills you gain help you reach your ultimate professional goals? Always have a vision for your career down the line, and only take jobs that align with that vision.

* **Find [mentors](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/how-to-find-a-mentor-worth-listening-to/)**. Executives are just people-but they’re busy people. If you build a relationship with someone, they will want to help you. But be respectful of their time. Use it well, and make sure you’re working to maintain the relationship.

Working in different fields has enriched my career in so many ways. I truly wouldn’t have had it any other way. And I’m so glad I didn’t listen to the people who suggested I should narrow my career path to one industry and job description.

My cross-industry experiences and skills served me incredibly well as I grew my leadership skills and became a CEO. In my mind, every great CEO should be a generalist with knowledge and experience in a number of areas of business. So to aspiring CEOs and founders, my advice is this: Be open-minded about every opportunity that presents itself, but also thoughtful in your decision to take or pass up each one.

# Ditch Work Life Balance and Embrace Work Life Harmony

## 

How do you usually go about your day?

Do you wake up in the morning, get ready for work, and then spend the whole day looking forward to being at home and unwinding?

We often hear about *work life balance — *having a good balance between work and personal time. Whilst this may sound like a smart idea, it can also imply that we should dedicate at least half of our time to work–and sacrifice time for our “personal life”.

To me, that seems…off balance. Because, the truth is, it’s nearly impossible to split your time equally between the two. And, you may end up stressing out if you’re not able to meet that expectation of *balance*.

Instead, why not think of having *work life harmony* instead?

With this mindset, you can actually integrate work *into *your life in a way that feels more complete. This way, you don’t need to view work and having personal time as separate.

So, how do you achieve work life harmony?

## Work Life Harmony Explained

The difference between work life balance and work life harmony is pretty simple. With the former, there is an implication that you have to sacrifice your “life” for work. But, this is the worst way to go about things! How can you truly be at peace in life if you dread 8 hours of your day?

Work life harmony on the other hand, allows your work to be a part of your life. This means that you can choose to be happy both at home, and at work! Work no longer needs to be seen as the ‘bad’ or un-fun activity.

Having work life harmony also ensures you’re truly present in whatever place you find yourself.

Just take a look at Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon for example.

He uses a non traditional approach to work by making time for breakfast every morning with his family, doesn’t set his alarm before going to bed, schedules surprisingly few meetings, and still puts aside a few minutes every day to wash his own dishes.

He believes that all his staff should stop trying to achieve a ‘balance’ in their work and personal lives as that implies a trade off. Instead, he envisions a more holistic relationship between the two.

As the world’s richest man, he must be doing something right!

## Rethink Time Management

Now, when we think of striking a balance, we usually associate it with time, don’t we? How much time are we spending at work versus how much time are we spending in our personal lives?Are we taking enough time to be with our loved ones, to do meaningful activities with others or even for ourselves, or are we just dedicating all our time to work?

This is the so-called-balance that many struggle with.

With work life harmony, we learn to rethink time management. By re-assessing how you manage your time, you’ll have a lot more of it. It’s incredible how much time can get wasted over the period of a day–especially when you’re not accurately tracking it.

Unfortunately, unless you’re consciously making an effort, your brain is not always the best at making accurate judgement calls when it comes to prioritizing. It tends to have a bias towards short term benefits and short term costs.

As there are often many more options our brains link to short term benefit; when you’re trying to focus on a task that gives you a long term benefit, that task usually becomes low priority. This is otherwise known as [Priority Chaos](https://www.lifehack.org/811899/easily-distracted-and-hard-to-focus-try-doing-this).

In order to overcome this and be in better control of your time, identify the tasks that need the most focus to get accomplished. If it’s a big task, then it’s good to break it down into smaller bite-sized actions that will provide you with a clearer short term benefit.

When setting up tasks, give yourself a time limit. The brain has a bias towards short term benefits, and your attention span is limited, so if your tasks are going to take ages to complete, you’ll end up losing focus… and wasting time.

Once you have all your tasks written down, it’s time to prioritize them. Since you have a time limit, your focus should be on the top priority tasks. By doing this, you will already be able to get more done in less time at work!

## Have Passion for What You Do

Managing your time is important in achieving that work life harmony. But, perhaps of greater importance, is loving what you do in life.One of the most effective ways to achieve a work life harmony is to really enjoy, or find a purpose, in what you do for a living. Even though everyone isn’t always lucky enough to find a position that pays them for pursuing their passion, you can strive to find meaning in what you are already doing, or pursue something new entirely!

For example, say you work at an office that sells paper. While many people wouldn’t consider this a world changing pursuit, I beg to differ. Think of all the individuals in the world that rely on paper. From creative types to quantum physics experts, your role at your workplace brings incredible value to many many people all over the world. You will have, without a doubt, helped bring a new idea into existence. Several new ideas to be precise.

So have a think about what you’re doing now. Is it something that allows you to embrace your passion?

Or perhaps you might not even know what it is that you love or enjoy doing. Why not explore and reflect on what gives you joy and contentment? Is there an area or industry that you could see yourself exploring to experience that fulfillment?

Can you find a deeper purpose in what you’re already doing?

When you’re able to find meaning in your work, you’re that much closer to achieving work life harmony.

## Don’t Be Intimidated By Obstacles and Limitations

Creating work life harmony is also about understanding yourself–which includes your limitations and past obstacles–as this allows you to become more resilient.

If you never had to experience struggles, challenges or setbacks, then you would never be forced to adapt and mature. So in theory, having to face obstacles in life is actually quite necessary.

Most of us think of setbacks and obstacles as negative. Though, if you’re able to maintain an optimistic attitude, you’ll almost always have a higher chance of success of overcoming those obstacles to reach your eventual goal.

Your attitude towards setbacks will define the outcome of whether you rise from the challenge or remain stuck in it. So, in order to achieve work life harmony, it’s important to have a [resilient attitude](https://www.lifehack.org/715558/what-is-resilience-and-how-to-be-resilient) as challenges will always come your way–especially when you strive to integrate work *into *your life, and not a separate or dominant part of life.

## Delegate When You Need To

Of course, when you want to increase productivity and minimize the time or effort spent, a great way to do so is to delegate!

If you spend a lot of time doing tasks on your own that could be delegated to others (whether at work or at home) you’re losing a lot of precious free time that could otherwise be spent elsewhere.

At the end of the day, we all have a limited amount of time. So we should all be striving to create a harmonious work and living situation where we can find meaning in all that we do.

While an overall goal may be meaningful, not all of the milestones or tasks needed to get there may be meaningful. That’s because we have our strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. Not every task is going to be enjoyable or easy to complete. That’s where delegation comes in.

[Delegation](https://www.lifehack.org/810935/the-careful-art-of-delegation) simply allows you to leverage time from an external source, thus giving you opportunities to increase your own quality of time. Keep in mind that delegation should be done with [deliberate attention](https://www.lifehack.org/688325/how-to-delegate-work-the-definitive-guide-for-successful-leaders), otherwise you may end up *over* relying on others.

If you find that you’re running into the problem of over delegating, then it may be time to re-evaluate your motivation for doing whatever it is that you’re doing.

## Embrace the Circle and Become Happier and More Productive

Living in harmony is about feeling good about the ways in which you spend your time, despite how busy you may be.Your switch from work mode to a more personal mode should be effortless. It’s about integrating your personal life and the things you love into your busy work life!

It all begins with the shift in perspective. Understanding what your passions are, and learning to be resilient, before taking a different approach to the way you manage your time and everyday tasks.

These are steps that you can start taking to move away from *balance* to *harmony.*

# You Have Everything You Need

## Creativity Flourishes Under Constraints
> # “Own only what you can always carry with you: know languages, know countries, know people. Let your memory be your travel bag.” — Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

![](0*ThZ_U2v-sR6AXPNa)

### **Food For Thought**

## **You Have Everything You Need**

In Communist Russia, tens of millions of people were killed or sent to their deaths in the Gulag. The problem with an evil government that tries to (and does) kill millions of people… is that eventually they will try to kill the wrong person.

For the Soviets, that one person was a yet-to-be writer. Over the years this man was: imprisoned, starved, and faced countless horrors. Along the way, he began writing a novel… in his head. Some days he would get lucky and find pieces of toilet paper he could scribble his ideas down on, but most of the time, he was limited to recording the entire book mentally.

When he finally managed to escape the Gulag and get real pens and paper, he wrote*The Gulag Archipelago*, a masterpiece that was partly responsible for bringing down the Soviet Union and exposing its crimes. After his ordeal, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote:
> # “One man who stopped lying could bring down a tyranny.”

The best novels and books emerged out of enormous pressures. If you want to create something that stands the test of time, be warned:

**Give up all hopelessness, because it is possible.**

History is filled with examples of creators who produced lasting work with far fewer resources than you have and under far more hellish conditions.

You don’t need a little more money, a little more time, a little more inspiration… a little more anything. Creative constraints build masterpieces. Start building yours.

### **Deep Dive**

## **The Power Of Creative Constraints**

If you were given all the resources you needed to invent anything you wanted, what would you build? It’s a difficult question to answer. In fact, it’s so open-ended, that it may actually paralyze your thinking.

[Here’s why](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-power-of-creative-constraints-brandon-rodriguez) it’s oftentimes helpful to have to think *inside the box.*

### **Further Reading**

## **The Gulag Archipelago**
> “If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?” ― Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

## **Do What You Love**

Need an extra dose of motivation to get you through the week? Here are some wise words from Steve Jobs on the value of meaningful work:
> “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.”

# What To Tell Yourself During A Tough Time.

## Image Credit: Dan Evans

We all go through tough times.

A few examples of mine are:

* Multiple consecutive breakups

* Walking away from a business that could have made me a lot of money

* Having my career come to a grinding halt

* Dealing with mental illness

The list is very long and I’m sure yours is similar. It’s not about the tough times we go through though because they are guaranteed and you already knew that before you clicked this article.

What matters during tough times is what you tell yourself.

### This is what I say to myself during tough times — well there’s actually four things I say to myself depending on the tough time I’m facing:

## “This will pass”

No event in your life lasts forever. Today may be a really tough day, but that won’t last forever. We delude ourselves at times by saying in our head *“I’m always going to be like this.”*

*“Why does this always happen to me?”*

*“Here we go again.”*

These negative phrases tell our brain that things are never going to get better. When we say these phrases to ourselves enough, we start to believe them. During a difficult period in your life, in that moment, things will suck.

![Image Credit: OIVIND HOVLAND/IKON IMAGES/CORBIS](1*exTBtoIuJWFtYrsDvk2IIg.jpeg)*Image Credit: OIVIND HOVLAND/IKON IMAGES/CORBIS*

The way to get out of your head is to see the truth: this will pass. In one day, one month, or one year this tough situation will have passed and you’ll be onto the next part of your life.

Nothing lasts forever unless you allow your mind to trap you in the moment and believe a lie which is that this moment won’t pass. It will. You will come out the other side.

## “I’ll be stronger having dealt with this situation”

When you reframe your tough times into strength building exercises, they take a whole new meaning.

All of a sudden, your current situation that may be wearing you down becomes like reps at the gym. The reps are a struggle and it hurts, but if you keep moving forward, you end up with mental toughness and strength.
> # “Exchange your tough times for mental toughness”

See this challenging situation for what it is. It’s the chance to come out the other end stronger.

**Stack your tough times up like gold medals.**

Have you dealt with cancer? Good, then you won’t take your health for granted ever again.

Have you lost a loved one? Then you’ll never take the rest of your family for granted and care for them more than you did before.

Did you lose your job? Amazing! Now you can work somewhere else and discover more of your hidden talents!

Without tough times, you won’t have the strategies you need to deal with the impossible. Your heroes are your heroes because they’ve used their tough times to become stronger.
> # Failure and rejection are the building blocks to whatever your definition of success is. Tough times make you hungry and that’s a good thing.

## “Keep taking baby steps forward”

Tough times can feel like quicksand sometimes.

If you don’t keep moving forward though, you’ll eventually sink into the quicksand. The best thing you can do during the toughest of challenges is take baby steps.

![Image Credit: [François Coutu](https://www.artstation.com/francoyovich)](1*ckRqXaCosGQS1RUSO_qHXQ.jpeg)*Image Credit: [François Coutu](https://www.artstation.com/francoyovich)*

When I battled severe anxiety, I took baby steps such as these:

* Walked 15 minutes a day

* Drank an extra glass of water each day to hydrate my body

* Read one book a month on anxiety

* Exposed myself to one small fear each day. It started with going two levels in a lift (something I couldn’t do before). Then I’d go three levels the next day and so on.

That last dot point is critical. Overcoming tough times requires you to take baby steps in the form of being uncomfortable. When you’re growing each day, you don’t have time to be too concerned about a particular tough time.

My battle with anxiety eventually led me to flying long distances (another thing I couldn’t do before) and then speaking on stages in front of a lot of people.

As you can see, the first few steps — like going two floors in a lift — are quite small. Then the steps get bigger and bigger until what used to seem impossible becomes a piece of cake.

Take baby steps.

## “It only takes one person”

Tough times often require someone to believe in you. From my experience, you only need one person.

One person to believe in your idea. 
One person to love you. 
One person who has gone through the same tough times as you.
> This one person exists. You have to go out there and find them. That one person for me was a team leader when I was working in a call center. He believed in me enough to take me aside and coach me one on one.

He believed I was going to go on and change the world through personal development. He was right and I did!

Don’t give up. Your one person exists as well.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

These four things are what I tell myself during a tough time. One of these phrases will always be the right one depending on the circumstance.

Believe that there is a way out and you’ll find one. It’s during the tough times that you’ll develop the skills and experience to help others.

> # What I’ve learned is that to get through the tough times, one of the best hacks is to focus on helping others. When you’re focusing on how you can serve, your own selfish problems become insignificant.

Seek out people who have even bigger problems than you do and listen to them. See if you can help them.

That’s how you deal with the tough times.

Tell yourself the truth. You deserve to hear it.

# 10 days into family life on Ko Lanta

## Swing Time on Bamboo Beach, Ko Lanta

## The Journey: London &gt;&gt; Ko Lanta
> ‘It’s a pretty sophisticated system and it’s saying that it can’t check your bags all the way through to your final destination for some reason. It’s not saying why. I’m sorry’

I’m sorry, computer is saying no to all our kit going beyond Bangkok?

![Computer says no!](1*JE_24UAOF1BCxhMYSbei8g.jpeg)*Computer says no!*

Well this was a problem. We’d just spent two manic weeks de-cluttering five years of family home-accumulating life (during which we’d gained three children and a lot of baggage). We had packed carefully for our nine month adventure where (we thought) every item was ‘essential’ and within the regulations. However, we were told we were ‘overweight’, at least for the second leg of the journey.

What this meant in reality was that we’d have go through immigration on arrival bleary eyed in Bangkok, pick-up all our bags (16!) and wheel our lives up to departures to re-check-in and go back through security in two and a half hours.

Normally that wouldn’t bother me. If you go on on big trips you expect bumps along the way. But this time, for us at least, it was different. This time we had our three precious items of carry-on baggage: Isla, Mali & Jack. By this stage they would have spent 11 hours in the cabin (not the overhead ones) and changed time-zones; we suspected they wouldn’t be as co-operative or excited as when we’d left home (whenever that was).

We hit the runway in Thailand. Piled off the plane, and ‘ran’ through the airport already sweating more than we had for the whole of the hottest British summer, ever. It felt like I was in an exotic version of a Richard Curtis film, only much less romantic.

![](1*KAf6Py5HMSchKpWpBwNzyA.jpeg)

![](1*8xSfH096PDXPCzEKfB7qYg.jpeg)

![](1*qKbMrSuWXOAFrbnSsYm3mg.jpeg)

![](1*X7uJMY1hKHHAV-SUqI3l1g.jpeg)

![](1*5grk7gmLewhit6ZLa-hpNQ.jpeg)

We joined the ‘family’ queue at immigration which was moving slower than a family of sloths on holiday. Finally, passports stamped, we spilled out into the baggage hall which seemed to be the length of Thailand itself. Our ‘oversized’ baggage needed to be collected from Z2, we were at A2. Great. ‘*Daddy, I’m coming’*, Isla shouted as I ran down the hall. Now on my shoulders, Isla and I were side-stepping luggage, backpackers, families, everyone in our path.

Up on level 4, Bangkok Airways kindly checked-in all our bags and, with a few more moving walkways negotiated, we were soon on our way to Krabi in Southern Thailand. A couple of hours later and our mini van was driving up the ramp onto the short ferry crossing to Ko Lanta. We’d made it!

![Beached, and happy.](1*qcwbxKE6750olfGZDqyloQ.jpeg)*Beached, and happy.*

## **The First Week**

We found a great base for the first week at [The Escape Cabin](http://escape-cabins.com/)s, where we could unpack (a little) and jump in the pool. Having arrived in the early evening we optimistically thought we might even beat the jetlag with a quick round of milk and off to bed. Wrong. By 1am all three children were wide eyed and hungry. A midnight feast/snack-a-thon ensued. Tomorrow was going to hurt.

The tail end of rainy season, or the ‘green season’ as they say here, welcomed us the following morning with a shower so heavy it felt like there may have been a leak in heaven’s plumbing. The skies soon cleared we headed out of the air-conditioned safety of our apartment and into the tropical heat.

![First Lanta Sunset (Phi Phi islands on the horizon)](1*--pouLvONMMT4D7Lq9_qDg.jpeg)*First Lanta Sunset (Phi Phi islands on the horizon)*

### To the beach!

You’re never far from the sand on Ko Lanta. The kids ran to the sea like they’d crossed a continent on their own little feet to get there. At this point it felt like a long way to come for a holiday but we did our best to pretend it was — sipping coconuts, watching the sunset, chasing gecko’s, riding tuk-tuks with our favourite Disney characters embossed on their seats, jumping in any pool we passed and generally trying to all stay friends through the tiredness and new waves of sensory overload. A new cultural and climate immersion is an intense experience for an adult, never mind a one year old who usually buzzes off seeing a pigeon in the garden.

First impressions of Ko Lanta is that it’s busier, more developed and more interesting than I expected. There are still wilder, quieter spots but if this is low season and Lanta is one of the quieter islands then Phuket and beyond must be intense.

![When your favourite Disney character turns up on a tuk-tuk](1*f3FaqkYExycDgk8sY-uKCQ.jpeg)*When your favourite Disney character turns up on a tuk-tuk*

### Island Life Checklist

We took each day at a time to try and tick things off:

**What to eat?** Fried rice, Pad Thai, Massaman shrimp curry. Delicious. And for the children? Not much quality dairy so the staples of organic milk, yoghurts, and cheese have to take a break. Can we really give them pasta and veggie sauce with a side of dragon fruit, twice a day, everyday? Whatever it takes!

**New school?** Five days after arriving we took Isla & Mali to [Global Village School](http://gvslanta.com) which was setup up with the philosophy of:
> “It Takes a Global Village to Raise a Global Citizen”

The staff, students and parents of the school have been wonderfully welcoming and we’re very grateful the children can attend.

**New home?** Finding a longer-term basecamp on Ko Lanta has taken more energy and funds than we thought. Peak season (December-March) really does mean there’s very little family accommodation beyond a week at a time. But with some help from the friendly people of Lanta we’ve found a wonderful ‘Balinese’ style villa, up the hill out of the tsunami zone so my wife can sleep better.

**New wheels?** After 5 days of tuktuk-ing we rented a car and decided we liked it so much we negotiated with the owner — Yak, a used-car salesman of the finest calibre—until we were able to get a deal. We now have a safe, cool (aircon not style) mode of transportation for getting around the island.

**New office?** Today has been my first full day at [Kohub](http://kohub.org), a ‘tropical coworking’ home setup here a few years ago. It’s a fantastic open space and community and the wifi speed is almost as good as the vegan lunches.

![New office setup at Kohub](1*-u4PxmN1oxRZljz4EWelbg.jpeg)*New office setup at Kohub*

### The best bits so far? The children’s reactions to things.

Isla’s constant curiosity has included, amongst many other questions: *‘But I can’t see any Gods?’ *whilst looking at a shrine with fizzy drink offerings.

Mali is winning over everyone with her sassiness and smiles. The snails, geckos, frog jungle calls, and giant lizard (that we saw on our Sunday island drive) have her bouncing with glee.

Jack is literally turning into a monkey — eats 5 bananas a day and climbs everything, which brings us to…

### The hardest bits so far? The children’s reactions to things.

Jack climbs everything, which is good if you’re in a soft play in Berkshire but not when you’re on a ledge over-looking a pool, a pot hole or a roof terrace.

Getting them into a routine again is hard. We’re trying to stay relaxed but have only really managed about two out of ten nights of decent sleep. Isla has had an ear infection (long flight plus lots of swimming) which has been painful for her and meant she’s missed quite a lot of the first week of school (and therefore not given her Mum much relief). Mali’s behaviour has been erratic, more tantrums than normal and doesn’t seem to be able to listen to us. Jack, after 3 days of sweating and not eating, is coping much better, despite his cot being in our bathroom as that was the best way to create a ‘third bedroom’.

So now its about getting into routines, connecting more with the local culture and having as many mini-adventures as we can muster.

And after school and work we get to go to the beach.

We can always go to the beach :)

# The Strongest Amongst Us Are Not Applauded For Their Growth, Yet Bloom In Silence

## “A woman with bangs blows on a dandelion, scattering its seeds” by Nine Köpfer on Unsplash

## **Grappling With The Dark Night Of The Soul**
> # *“Talents are best nurtured in solitude, but character is best formed in the stormy billows of the world.” — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe*

Who are you in your quietest moments when no one is looking? How do you feed your soul when you experience pain and heartache? A wildflower by the side of the road endures the elements and yet blooms in silence. Therefore, strength is gained when others are oblivious to our struggles because we choose to feed our soul with nourishment. During such a moment we experience a shift in awareness that marks the mental landscape of who we will become. I’m reminded of the passage by the Zimbabwean author and poet, Billy Chapata who wrote: “The strongest ones bleed in silence. Have no one applauding their growth. Have no one watching their healing process. They bloom in silence.”

Take a moment to reflect upon the growth taken place in your own life. What events or circumstances have shaped your development? Did you resist it at first, yet realise it was exactly what was needed for your personal growth? As you may know, growth is never linear, we may experience one step forward and two steps back. However, if we dwell upon our setbacks, we are not seeing the entire picture, but judging the fragmented pieces of a puzzle that will eventually come together.

Personal growth is an arduous journey lined with moments of despair, interspersed with joyous ones. This journey called life is a voyage of highs and lows. There is never a time when everything is smooth sailing because that would mean remaining idle and not developing our greatest strength. Perhaps we shouldn’t cling to the good times but appreciate them when they arrive. I believe life is not meant to be a sea of happiness nor the depths of despair. Our journey is a transient tale of dualities, so we can experience our true nature amongst the peaks and valleys.

For example, has life been a series of good and bad times or is it smooth sailing? I’m yet to meet anyone who claims life has been easy-going. Even the wealthy with their material riches encounter problems. No one is immune to the ravages of life. Though, how we respond to our circumstances determines our level of growth or whether we remain mired in our problems. The strongest amongst us wrestle and toil with the fabric of their existence in silence, some of them grappling with the dark night of the soul. They bleed in silence. They bloom in silence and emerge stronger than before, for their wounds are sacred gifts to themselves and others. It is what spiritual author Matt Kahn means when he writes in *Everything Is Here to Help You: A Loving Guide to Your Soul’s Evolution*: “To alter someone’s experience is much like continually moving the seeds planted, hoping to find a more ideal spot for growth. Each time a seed is moved, the growing process is interrupted and disturbs the roots that are meant to sprout along their own rhythm of time.”

## **Meet Others With Kind-Heartedness**
> # *“You cannot dream yourself into a character; you must hammer and forge yourself one.”— James A. Froude*

We all have our cross to bear. Some of us carry heavier burdens than others but this does not diminish their self-worth. In fact, their spiritual path may be greater than others because of the challenges they face. So if we stumble across those experiencing hardship, instead of judging them, we may like to send them a quiet blessing. Because in the solitude of their existence they endure pain and suffering we take for granted. They do not need our sympathy nor do they need our judgement. Their pain and suffering is more than enough. What they need is thoughts of love and compassion. A Buddhist saying I often recite when I learn of someone’s pain is: “May you be safe. May you be peaceful. May you be healthy. May you live with ease.” Through this simple declaration I send them loving thoughts because what I wish for them, I wish for myself. I meet them from a place of kind-heartedness because I recognise their humanity, knowing our souls walk different paths. I remind myself they are not less worthy but they have chosen earthly experiences that demand greater growth.

It’s no secret: how we treat others reflects in how we treat ourselves. The greatest gift I can offer myself is to treat others with compassion even if I can’t do anything for them. It was the Dalai Lama who once said: “If you can, help others; if you cannot do that, at least do not harm them.” If they need to suffer in silence, we ought to allow them the space to find their strength and courage. It is their path, and ours is not to judge nor castigate them but greet them with kindness and humility. The strongest amongst us suffer in silence because in those moments when they are grappling with their inner demons, they are close to awakening their inner power.

# How My Addiction to Achievement Has Almost Destroyed Me

## “woman lying on bed” by Yuris Alhumaydy on Unsplash

A few days ago my friend Mike sent me [an article about being addicted to achievement](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-arylo/are-you-an-achievment-junkie-why-its-so-hard-to-stop-working-so-hard_b_7244298.html). Then he wrote, “sound familiar?.” For the last several months I have been addicted to achievement. I’ve taken cognitive enhancers”, worked longer hours, and hustled more than ever. Obsessive focus became my substitute for feeling any unpleasant emotion and my escape from anything I didn’t want to feel.

Because I didn’t have a contract for a third book, I felt this immense pressure to knock it out of the park for The [Audience of One](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733) book launch, no matter the cost. I churned out article after article, trying to push the limits of my word counts. When I returned from a short book tour, my mother mentioned to my dad that I looked exhausted. The harder I worked, it seemed like the worse things were getting.

At the recommendation of my friend Mike, I made an appointment to see my energy healer. For years I’d been skeptical about this kind of work and wrote it off as new age bullshit. But when a painful experience I’d been thinking about for years finally dissipated after my first session with her, I was less skeptical.

So I made an appointment to see her. She told me if I continued down this path things would only get worse. Her prescription went counter to everything I wanted to do:

* Time away from everything for at least a few days

* No social media, lots of water, and a general detox

* No hustling or crushing it

People wear sleep deprived 120-hour workweeks like badges of honor. They assume if they adopt the same working habits of some iconic figure like Elon Musk, they’ll get the same results. They mix up causation and correlation to their detriment. For most people, this isn’t hard work. It’s just a slower more socially acceptable form of suicide.

## Social Media Amplifies Our Achievement Addiction

If you scroll through your newsfeed, on any given day, you’ll find a parade of accomplishments and people who:

* Published books or hit a bestseller list

* Sold their startups

* Had babies

* Just got engaged to the love of their life

“Success porn” litters the headlines of Medium articles, many of which I have written. You compare yourself to people who have achieved more. You feel lazy because your habits aren’t as solid as theirs, and you try to “lifehack” your way to success.

## We Fail to Appreciate Our Accomplishments

A few weeks ago I was lamenting to my sister how shitty the year had been She said: “don’t forget you did publish a book.” When we were speaking the other night, she asked how it was doing, and I said “well it hasn’t made the New York Times Best-Seller list, but it seems to be resonating with people who read it. And she reminded me “but isn’t the message of the book not to concern yourself with that?” In its failure to live up to certain expectations, I failed to appreciate the accomplishment of publishing a book.

## The Hedonic Treadmill of More

We always want more because we think more is going to be the key to our happiness and our well being. But what we fail to realize is that more of anything will only provide us with temporary satisfaction because of hedonic adaptation. Would selling more books make me happier? Yeah, probably for a little while. But eventually that would be normal, and I’d find something else that was missing from my life.

***We live in a culture that glorifies accomplishment and rewards our addiction to achievement. After all, it’s not like being addicted to success is like being addicted to heroin. Nobody is going to tell you to seek counseling if you’re kicking ass and taking names. The false sense of celebrity that social media creates encourages and ensures that we keep chasing accomplishments, that we hustle and crush it, no matter the cost.***

We read self-help books, listen to podcasts, attend conferences and do whatever we can all to improve ourselves. I’m not criticizing anyone who does these things. I do them myself. I host a podcast and write books that would fall into this category. All I know is that my addiction to achievement was starting to look like it was going to end in a very dark, very bad place.

I wasn’t following my own advice. I fell asleep with my laptop in my bed. I looked at things on my phone after I turned the lights out, and sacrificed sleep in the name of “getting shit done” and the only things I did get done were shit. My accomplishments defined me so much that the only way I could feel whole or complete was to accomplish more. When what I accomplished didn’t live up to my expectations, I felt lazy and guilty. So I did more:

* I wrote another blog post.

* I read another book

* I fixed something else on our website.

* I emailed more prospects to advertise on our podcast.

There was never any sense that my work for the day was finished. Eventually, it led to this dark and debilitating narrative.

## Down The Rabbit Hole

Society doesn’t have protocols for how to handle the inner demons that haunt people and talk about them in a public forum.

* For the bulk of January, I had the flu that seemed like it was never going to end.

* In February, some teenage girl charged a wave and harpooned me in the lower back with a surfboard. It took me out of the water for almost 6 weeks

* In March, two weeks before my 40th birthday, I got dumped

* I had one 40th birthday celebration with my family. But I was forced to cancel the party with my friends when literally everyone couldn’t make it. After that, I figured there was no sense in celebrating birthdays for a while.

* My cash flow has also been tighter, and I made significant investments in my business.

This year has felt like an uphill battle, with a mountaintop nowhere in sight. The surface of life deceives us, and social media amplifies that deception. Of course, nothing I’ve mentioned is catastrophic or life-threatening. But that’s what the demon of depression does. It dreams up catastrophic scenarios and presents them to you like a Grammy-winning album. These are a few of its latest and greatest hits.

* It’s one thing to fail as an entrepreneur. But if you fail as an entrepreneur and you’re the guy who has been fired from all your jobs, you’re probably fucked.

* As much as you’ve extolled the virtues of [creating for an audience of one](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536767165&sr=8-1&keywords=audience+of+one), I’m pretty sure your publisher would be a lot happier if you’d written a book that had already reached an audience of millions. After all, they’re not in the business of making dreams come true. They’re in the business of selling books.

* Everybody is going to leave eventually. So best not to get too emotionally invested in them. When they ghost, you can move on without giving a fuck.

* You can’t even get your friends to show up to your birthday

Then you talk to a friend who feeds you with self-help cliches and platitudes, you feel better and realize that depression’s greatest hits are self-indulgent bullshit. You remind yourself that dark chapters and seasons of adversity eventually, and that your temporary circumstances are not your permanent identity.

## Founder Depression

People say the hardest thing about running a business is managing your psychology. When you’re running a business, it’s hard not to feel like the success and failure of a business is not a success or failure of you as a person. You measure your self-esteem in profit and losses, traffic and conversion rates, book sales and downloads or whatever North Star Metric you’ve chosen.

## Reasons to Live

A few weeks ago I picked up a book called Reasons to Live by Matt Haig. It turns out there’s a long lineage of successful and famous people who have dealt with depression. “**Depression can happen to prime ministers and presidents and cricketers and playwrights and boxers and stars of hit Hollywood comedies. Well, we knew that. What else? That fame and money do not immunize you from mental health problems**” says Haig. No accomplishment makes you immune to it.

My friend Joseph texted me when he saw a picture of Matt’s book.

**Joseph**: Is that what it sounds like?

**Me**: yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like.

**Joseph**: I could have used that a few months ago.

Suddenly, I didn’t feel crazy. Somebody else felt this way. So I made a list of reasons to live, in order of importance:

* My sister is getting married in February. I have to write and give a speech.

* My relationship with my parents is better than ever.

* My friends would probably miss me if I were gone.

* Snowboarding season is starting soon.

* You have a bed to sleep in, a roof over your head, food on the table — plenty of people don’t have this.

* There are still waves to surf, mountains to snowboard, and countries to visit

I’m sure the list is longer, but at the moment I can’t recall all of it.

## Where The Ghosts Don’t Follow

At moments, I wonder why it takes me so long to get over something that most people would get over quickly. I wish it didn’t. I wish I didn’t feel things that seem like they wouldn’t phase another person.

The heightened sensitivity pisses me off. It gets in the way of being productive. I don’t have time for my own drama. And yet that’s so much of what goes on in your head, your drama. A few weeks ago I was searching for a new roommate, and the whole experience was a shit show. People would commit to seeing the place and not show up, others would change their mind on the way to see the apartment, and one guy committed and bailed. I finally did manage to find a roommate. And then I was pissed off that I’d been so stressed about something that got resolved. My friend Mike said, “you’re beating yourself up because you beat yourself up.”

I wonder if the reason I surf, snowboard and do anything is that the flow is an escape. A professional skateboarder who jumps mega ramps once described extreme sports as a place where the ghosts don’t follow. I went on as many snowboarding trips as I possibly could this year. I surfed in Sri Lanka. And without a doubt surfing and snowboarding is that place for me where the ghosts don’t follow.

## The Insidious Stigma of Mental Health Issues in Immigrant Communities

Over the course of the last year, we’ve seen high profile celebrity suicides, a sexual assault epidemic, and unparalleled levels of anxiety, depression and mental health issues. But for every celebrity or high profile suicide, there are many we never hear about. Unless people learn how to manage their psychology, we face a questionable and dangerous future.

In the culture I grew up in, mental health issues were incredibly stigmatized. It was an unwritten and unanimously accepted belief that therapy was for crazy people. Many of the people who believed this would benefit tremendously from seeing a therapist. When I found myself in a therapist office at the age of 37, my only thought was “why did I wait so long?

I’m not even sure how my parents would have responded if I had asked if I could see a therapist. There were numerous signs of depressive tendencies very early in my life that went overlooked. When I got fired from my first job, I was at my dad’s office, and he asked: “what’s your plan?” I replied, “I don’t know, suicide.” All he said was “you shouldn’t say things like this.” He didn’t ask me if I was considering it. He didn’t ask if I was ok. He meant well, but it was clear he had no idea what to do with that.

When you grow up in an Indian community, you grow up in a culture of judgments and expectations. It’s not with malicious intent. But, “what will people think?” is something you hear over and over until you can’t help but ask yourself that very same question.

I don’t know what it’s like in other immigrant cultures. But I’m guessing as Indians we’re not alone. I was the “anonymous” person in [Sarah Kathleen Peck](https://twitter.com/sarahkpeck)’s post about how to go to therapy.

When it comes to mental health, it’s not until we reach a breaking point, that we finally decide to ask for help. But that is a bit like waiting to put gas in your car until you’re stranded on the side of the freeway. My energy healer even said, “why did you wait so long to come and see me?”

If you’ve never actually dealt with depression yourself, prescribing self-help books, telling people to look on the bright side and make gratitude lists doesn’t help. “It’s hard to explain depression to people who haven’t suffered from it. It’s like explaining life on earth to an alien” says Matt Haig. When somebody is dealing with depression, their emotions are a roller coaster. They might understand logically that something isn’t as bad as it seems. But that won’t change how they feel. In the midst of depression, it becomes really easy to believe the worst opinions you have about yourself.

I’ve had a front-row seat to some of the highest achieving people in the world. And I’m consistently amazed by how many have referenced asking for help or seeing a therapist in our conversations. Despite the appearance of being extraordinary, they all have demons they battle. I can’t help but wonder:

* What would have happened if I didn’t have the Unmistakable Creative?

* What if I never figured out that you could talk to somebody about something that you can’t speak to anybody else about?

* How many immigrant children are suffering in silence because they’re so afraid of how they’ll be judged and what’s expected of them?

I’ve had more than one podcast guest who attempted suicide. And I’ve had listeners who have told me that my work helped them get better after a suicide attempt. One of my readers also took his life, something I only learned when I sent him a Facebook message to ask if I could send him a book, and his wife replied.
> # ***When the state of affairs in our world is such that suicide feels like an option, it’s clear we need a serious reboot of how we address mental health issues.***

I’m not quite sure if there’s an appropriate way to start this conversation. All I know is that it’s a conversation we’ve avoided for far too long. If the price we’re willing to pay is that of human life, it’s far too high just because we fear judgment, are desperately trying to live up to expectations, and are addicted to achievement.

# 5 Practical Ways to Build Your Email List Like a Smart Marketer

## 

What’s the secret to a successful email campaign?

Great design? Engaging subject lines and email copy? Your offer?

It’s actually none of these things — while each, in itself, is important, the most crucial aspect of a successful email campaign is a quality email list.

A quality email list is one you’ve built through connection with your audience, based on their registered interest, and ideally, segmented by each person’s preferences.

So how can you build a great, effective e-mail list? How can you get more warm leads onto your database in order to target them with your future offers?

Here are some tips.

## 1. Website/blog is the best place to take the first step

Your website or blog is generally the first thing people visit — so leverage the power of your website and place an email sign-up form on it.

When a visitor lands on your blog or site, give him/her a reason to subscribe — offer something valuable in exchange for their information. This could be an educational resource, eBook, white paper, special discount, free demo, or some other incentives.

See how Blurb does this:

![](0*kHgfcyEI3OrLJVtY.png)

## 2. Use the power of content upgrade

Brian Dean says that content upgrade increased his conversion rate [from 0.54% to 4.82%](https://backlinko.com/increase-conversions). That’s 785%.

Nathan Ellering, Content Marketing Lead at CoSchedule, shared his take [here](https://sarv.com/resource/post/101-actionable-email-marketing-tips):

*“Content upgrade is an absolute best way to build an email list of active subscribers, just like how we’ve built a list of more than 100,000 subscribers at CoSchedule.”*

If you’re not using the power of content upgrade, you’re missing a great opportunity to build your email list.

Create an informational and interesting article, and offer an actionable cheatsheet or quick guide as an upgrade. Add a line at the beginning, middle or end of the post which encourages visitors to download your cheat sheet or guide.

Here’s a content upgrade example from Brian Dean:

![](0*WP3hF7s5vf73R1Ky.png)

## 3. Put a signup button on your Facebook Page

Social media is a great medium through which to build an audience, and you can also use it to grow your email list.

Add a ‘Sign up’ call to action button to your Facebook Page to collect email addresses — it’s a great way to convert your fans/followers into your subscribers.

See how Birchbox does a great job by placing sign up button their Facebook page:

![](0*MmI8PbxKGqX5PnLd.png)

## 4. Hosting a Webinar

Hosting a webinar can be a great way to communicate with your targeted audience — and collect email addresses.

The best way to do this is to find trending topic relevant to your service, then conduct a webinar based on that subject. You can then ask potential attendees to provide their contact information in order to join the webinar — and don’t forget to promote it across the social media platforms.

See how SEMrush adds a registration form to their Webinar page:

![](0*NXbbTVJQDS9MYe9O.png)

## 5. Run a Facebook Contest

Facebook is also a great channel to run a contest or special offer (Instagram, too, can be beneficial on this front)

Create a compelling graphic, engaging title and an irresistible giveaway, then ask your audience for their email address in order to join the contest.

Take a look at London Drugs’ Facebook contest:

# 3 Simple Ways to Improve Your Design Skills Every Day

## 3 Simple Ways to Improve Your Design Skills Every Day

### Here are three simple ways you can continue to improve your design skills:

***By [Nicolas Susco](https://medium.com/@nsusco), designer and entrepreneur***

After more than [15 years in the industry](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/3-things-most-startups-get-wrong-about-design/), a client base that stretches across the globe, and several companies to my name, I still strive to improve my design skills.

The joy of [working in a creative](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/rapid-growth-can-cause-chaos-heres-how-to-create-a-strong-plan-for-scaling-your-team/) but applicable field like design is that it’s always shifting, changing, growing. If you miss developments, you’ll be left behind-and catching up can become impossible.

But the benefits of constantly seeking improvement don’t end with the personal. By staying abreast of what’s happening in the design world, challenging yourself, and continuing to learn from others in your field, you’ll be able to bring the absolute best product to the table for your clients.

Whether you’re not sure where to start, or you’ve become so pro you don’t remember the basics, here are three simple ways you can continue to improve your design skills:

## 1. Diversify your clients, your work, and the industries for both.

A few years ago, I was working with a Salesforce competitor called High Profit on a UX project. Our main focus was making sure that it was more aesthetically pleasing than the one Salesforce offered. Our client’s functionality was already incredible, but by comparing it to the competition, we knew customers were also expecting killer visuals.

Part of the learning here was that good design isn’t based on just one aspect-it isn’t just aesthetics and it isn’t just UX. 10 years ago, you could design an interface and leave the user to puzzle it out themselves. But things have changed-users demand a much more catered experience. They not only want an intuitive interface, but they want to enjoy using it.

Because of my work with High Profit, I know how the consumers in their industry engage with design. I can now cater projects to fit those needs going forward.

The key to diversification is not getting too comfortable with one type of work just because it pays well. At the end of the day, if you aren’t being challenged and expanding your network, it won’t be worth it.

## 2. Network — but not just with designers.

Find work you love—art, music, books, movies. Then find what it is about that work that inspires you. Is it the color palette? The rhythm? The hairstyles?

Now incorporate those things into your own work.

Do this again, but with designers you admire. See what they’re doing that’s successful and find ways to incorporate it into your own projects. Reach out-ask to pick their brain and get advice.

I do this constantly. And not just with other designers. Sometimes, you can learn the most from talking with people who work in close proximity to design but aren’t necessarily designers by trade.

One of the startups I work with has a very talented team of developers. By talking with them about their experiences on the back end of design, I’ve been able to pick up a lot of valuable expertise that makes my design skills stronger.

## 3. Stay flexible and adaptable at all times.

The design industry frames the way people see the world. Sometimes technology disrupts that view, leaving us to change and iterate.

So, we have to be adaptable.

For example, some of the UX elements that have worked so well for mobile apps in the last few years have since been adopted for desktop platforms and websites. This means that web designers now have to learn some elements of mobile design in order to stay ahead. You can’t just be one type of designer anymore.

In a creative industry like the design world, you have to be ready to pivot and then implement on a moment’s notice without dropping the ball. It’s like being a tightrope artist or a tango dancer-but with technology and style elements instead of spandex and sequins.

Sounds crazy right? But that’s the fun.

# Be The Lowest Risk for High Hopes

## Be The Lowest Risk for High Hopes

### Jumpstart Your Career
> # “Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson

![](0*iwOtZbtJOvAwAEGz)

### **Food For Thought**

## **Be The Lowest Risk For High Hopes**

When Brad Katsuyama first started out as an intern in the Royal Bank of Canada, he knew he wasn’t getting into a glamorous position.

In fact, it was the least glamorous thing you could imagine: digitizing files (brb, we fell asleep just typing that).

But while some people might shy away from jobs like that, it was a moment that started Brad Katsuyama’s whole approach to climbing the corporate ladder.

Today, as CEO of the Investors Exchange, he’s finally made it to the top, and (luckily for us) he’s willing to share the philosophy that got him there. 🤗

His main advice? Be the lowest risk person for the highest risk opportunity.
> “If you’re thinking long-term about your career development and you want to put yourself in the best position to get offered opportunities, make it the lowest risk possible for your company to do that.”

If your bosses are looking to fill a new opening, be the person who is ready to step in and get your hands dirty. It doesn’t matter if it’s not your dream job (heck — chances are it won’t be), but be willing to adapt and be a team player.

Make that learning curve your jam. You live on the learning curve. You invented the learning curve.

So when something new comes up, raise that hand. Get on those tiptoes. Be the one willing to jump in when no one else is.

# Design leaders share their advice on nurturing the designer-dev pair

## Many of us know that pairing designers and developers can lead to a more creative and efficient problem-solving process. It’s no surprise — countless big brands around the world subscribe to the pairing model.

But for those that don’t, how do we get there? How do you bridge the gap to form a beneficial [developer-designer relationship](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/connecting-designers-developers/)? How do you support it once you have it?

![InVision’s Adam Fry-Pierce makes introductions at a recent Design Leadership Forum dinner in Austin, TX.](1*REAzZ95xX40fAOTY1kj7Ug.jpeg)*InVision’s Adam Fry-Pierce makes introductions at a recent Design Leadership Forum dinner in Austin, TX.*

At recent [Design Leadership Forum](https://www.invisionapp.com/design-leadership-forum) dinners, we’ve discussed this very idea. The Forum is a community where more than 800 design leaders at companies like Lyft, The Home Depot, [Capital One](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/inside-design-capital-one/), and MailChimp share honest conversations about the challenges they face at the tops of their organizations and the opportunities presented to the design community today. The community gathers all around the world to discuss these topics in person.

At a recent member dinner, [nurturing the designer-developer relationship](http://www.invisionapp.com/blog/designer-developer-communication/) was top of mind. Here are three pieces of advice everyone agreed on.

## Get everyone on the same page from the beginning

Designers aren’t there just to make something look pretty, and developers aren’t there just to work through Jira tickets. From project-onset, both groups should attend each others’ project meetings, share user research and interviews, and help each other understand the problem at hand. Setting expectations from the beginning can curtail miscommunication midstream.
> # **“Designers aren’t there just to make something look pretty, and developers aren’t there just to work through Jira tickets.”**

And when things do go awry, in the words of one member of the Design Leadership Forum, “align, realign, and realign again.”

## Connect on a personal level

As designers, our mission is to serve our users: We [research](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/design-research/) their behavior, we listen to their feedback, we work to improve their experience. We should be approaching the people we work with the same way.

Several Design Leadership Forum members suggested getting to know each other out of the office — go for a walk, go to lunch, visit customers, attend networking events or social gatherings together. However, you can also build [empathy](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/reimagine-products-empathy/) in the office by attending each others’ department meetings and understand each others’ KPIs and motivations. One member noted, “It all comes down to language.” Try incorporating more “we” statements, and ask how you can do better for each other.
> # **“Although we can get far working from the ground up, having senior buy-in goes a long way.”**

## Get senior leaders on board

Although we can get far working from the ground up, having senior buy-in goes a long way. Members suggested tactics like involving C-levels at the base levels of a particular projects (this can be especially useful in [design sprints](https://www.designbetter.co/enterprise-design-sprints)), organizing designer-developer communication workshops, and having managers put teams together more purposefully. For example, managers can set up teams based on personality assessments. Once team leaders understand how personalities work best together, they can assemble workgroup teams better, leading to better work and healthier workgroups.

What are you doing to ensure healthy designer-developer relationships at your organization? Tell us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/invisionapp)!

*Do you know a design leader you’d like to nominate for the [Design Leadership Forum](https://www.invisionapp.com/design-leadership-forum)? We’d love to know about them. Want to grow your own career? Attend one of our [workshops](https://www.designbetter.co/workshops) on topics like design systems, design sprints, and design leadership.*

# You’re Already A Cyborg

## istock

***“Ai is likely to be either the best or worst thing to happen to humanity.”***

***~Stephen Hawking***

You’re already a Cyborg. You just don’t know it yet.

That’s right. Sounds crazy right?

Maybe it does.

But you are.

That phone you carry is an extension of your brain.

I was watching Elon Musk on Joe Rogan recently and he spoke about this specific topic.

In today’s climate we use our phone (and to a lesser degree computer) for everything. We call an Uber, we get an answer to a question via Google, we store photos, we store music, we communicate with friends, we have apps tracking our health & fitness, among many other uses too numerous to mention.

So the amount of Artificial Intelligence is growing. And the frightening or jaw-dropping thing about it is we seem quietly unaware how dependent we now are on it. Yes, there’s the day to day jokes about spending too much time on phones and how we all need to get outside more, however recently it feels those talks aren’t as pronounced as they once were. It’s almost as if we’ve accepted it.

As Musk says in the podcast ***“If you can’t beat ’em, join ‘em.”***

So the vast majority of things you need these days you go to your extended brain with.

Your extended brain is …

![](1*Wtrl9YezOPFvK81DWCWv6A.jpeg)

It seems so simple and lovely doesn’t it?

But we are getting closer and closer to merging what we think and even more eye opening how we think with artificial intelligence.

So what happens when this merges?

Elon Musk said:
> “It would be difficult to really appreciate the difference. How much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without? You’re vasty smarter actually. You can answer any question. If you’re connected to the internet you can answer any question pretty much instantly. Any calculation. Your phone’s memory is essentially perfect. You can remember flawlessly. Your phone can remember Videos pictures. Everything perfectly. Your phone is already an extension of you.
> You’re already a cyborg. **Most people don’t realize they’re already a cyborg.** That phone is an extension of yourself. It’s just that the data rate, the communication rate between you and the cybernet extension of yourself that is your phone and your computer is slow. It’s very slow. And that…it’s like a tiny scroll of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. And we need to make that tiny scroll like a giant river. A huge high bandwith interface. It’s an interface problem. Data rate problem. We solve the data rate problem then I think we can hang on to human-machine symbiosis through the longterm. Then people may decide if they want to retain their biological self or not. I think they’ll probably decide they want to retain their biological self.

![“photography of woman during nighttime” by [h heyerlein](https://unsplash.com/@heyerlein?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*pNW_fvSycz75kjfA)*“photography of woman during nighttime” by [h heyerlein](https://unsplash.com/@heyerlein?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

Musk also mentions what’s call ***Limbic Resonance***. Limbic Resonance is what our brain puts out into the world based on what we feel. He goes on to say that this limbic resonance then shows up on Google and within social media as a reflection of how much limbic resonance each cyber network can generate from our brains. But it’s not just the cyber network. It’s how much limbic resonance each node (each of us) independently can generate within each network.

***It’s almost as if we are like Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram energy generators.***

We give them fire and life as if we are self-initiating limbic resonance generators. We just are doing it very slowly right now.

And what happens when the transference rate of limbic resonance speeds up?

Holy shit.

Watch out.

So who’s controlling the limbic resonance (Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) machines? How is this happening?

Social media and Google are already controlled by artificial intelligence.

Twitter hardly has control of its own algorithms. Brian Feldman, a columnist for New York Mag recently wrote in a column for [Select All](http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/07/twitters-algorithm-problem-is-not-a-bug.html):
> They process hundreds of variables and when the people tasked with overseeing them change one variable, it’s almost impossible to predict how it will behave across millions of users each receiving a personalized result. Their kludgeyness and imperfection are accepted by-products of this work. These programs are tweaked constantly, attempting the impossible task of trying to produce The Perfect Result. Twitter’s algorithm was, some would argue, overzealous in minimizing users’ ability to find certain accounts. It’s important to characterize it correctly not as a bug or a glitch — those words imply specific intent, and they let Twitter off the hook — but as an issue defined by a consistent outcome.

![“All We Have Is Words All We Have Is Worlds lighted signage at night” by [Alexandra](https://unsplash.com/@alex_tsl?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*e_mke_NqdOtvXNsJ)*“All We Have Is Words All We Have Is Worlds lighted signage at night” by [Alexandra](https://unsplash.com/@alex_tsl?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

So if Social media and the internet (Google) is controlled by advanced algorithms that we hardly have control over anymore, then at this point who is dictating what we see and often come to believe?

The algorithms. And algorithms are controlled by Ai. It’s not an unrealistic hypothesis to propose that artificial intelligence is now in control. We humans are simply nodes plugged into Ai’s matrix.

Our first instinct is to insist this is a bad thing. We naturally want to fear that. But should we?
> # Is artificial intelligence our best friend or our worst enemy?
> # That’s the big mystery.

What if we could discover a way to team with these algorithms? A common ground. We already are to some degree(via our phone and computer). But what could and will happen once we speed up the slow bandwidth between our phones and our brains? Is this even possible? Do we want to?

I’ll leave you with this. If we can teach machines to learn to value the human quality of life (how we think, love, act, behave, value), maybe in turn it’ll teach us to value it more too as a collective.

Are we the psychological “boot-loader” to Ai..or is it the boot-loader to us?

Are we teaching Ai or is Ai teaching us? Or are we teaching Ai to teach us?

These limbic resonance generators may be be the gateway to a higher level of thinking.

Something we can’t quite comprehend.

Something we can’t quite see.

But we will.

Someday in the near future.

See you soon.

# Faking It Till You Make It&#58; A Tragedy

## 

When I was in high school, I was interning at a local hospital that summer, hopelessly trying to discover whether medicine was my calling or just another fickle dream. One afternoon, I was sitting on a swivel chair in the break room of a department I was currently working in.

Side to side, I pivoted, bored by the lack of another active presence. Suddenly, a young man in scrubs burst through the doors, rousing the tranquility blanketing the room into a frenzy. It was not only the grave expression on his face but the manner in which he moved that made the air around him electric.

After quickly glancing at me, he rushed to a desk and flipped on one of the computers. As he clumsily navigated the computer, he introduced himself as a new medical resident. There had just been an incident in the emergency room and, it being his first day on the job, was at lost at what to do. He turned to me, shrugging his shoulders, and said, “Well, fake it till you make it”, before departing abruptly.

Relieved, the tranquility once again settled peacefully over the tables and chairs of the room, but my innocent bubble of a world had imploded. It only took six words to cripple the foundation of my conditioned belief that authenticity was an all-encompassing truth.

Adherence to a consistent self was no longer the salvation amidst the darkest of times nor the map out from the most intricate labyrinth. A truth was turned obsolete by a single stranger with a differing ideology.

Stripped from this universal principle at such young an age, I was suddenly very confused.
> *Rob a man of his possessions and he will still flourish, but rob a man of his values and he will perish.*

It being the summer before my senior year of high school, or rather, standing at the brink of adulthood, I confidently reasoned that this is what the *real* world must be like.

It was later that I stumbled across the riveting TED talk by Amy Cuddy that confirmed the six words uttered by the lips of a young man with a fresh medical degree. “Fake it until you make it” was not just a catchy phrase or recycled quote, but rather an actuality. It was a *science*.

Research has indicated that holding a facial expression in the form of a smile boosts moral, pretending to know more than you actually do leads to more correct answers, and dressing to fit the part results in the successful assumption of someone other than yourself. Posing in a powerful stance, as revealed by Amy Cuddy, tricks the body into believing it is less stressed and feigning confidence allows you to become more influential to others.

The answer to becoming an idea other than yourself is to force metamorphosis into that idea. Deliberate practice is not just for athletes or chess champions, but for each of us training to be better.

Several years later and now a BioEngineer, I recognize the significance and practicality of science. But, I am fascinated by the *philosophy* behind such a science.

As we move through this world, the only thing that remains consistent with absolute definiteness is self. Family is arguably a reliable concept, but it is always relative to the individual and has even proven at times to appear the beholder of another blood. In contrast, whether we be in London or South Africa, we can never physically and spiritually detach ourselves from this dependable construct of self.

And yet, science has proven that a most effective strategy to elevating ourselves is to abandon the one thing that is inevitably faithful. It is to bury the original story in pursuit of a prescription.

This idea of becoming these elevated constructs of ourselves mirrors the grand theory that we are all actors in this great play. As Robin Williams inquires his students,
> # “*That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?”*

But what is so powerful and ironic about role playing, especially when used in daily practice, is that the more we attempt to become someone we’re not, the more we begin to understand ourselves.

The deliberate motions of acting widen the discrepancy between who we desire to be and who we truly are. By building idealized versions of ourselves, we are inadvertently becoming more cognizant of those areas in need of improvement.

The power of mind comes with its ability to understand. It transforms into a weapon when used to design and then create. The science behind “faking until you make it” flourishes because despite the thousands that may walk into your world, the only worthy judge is yourself.

Just as the curtains begin to draw on this great play and the audience springs to their feet in applause, one last glorious headline, as put perfectly by One Republic, flashes across the screen:
> # “Can you see what I see?”

# Jeff Bezos Says Successful People Make These Two Types Of Decisions

## Photo by bruce mars on Unsplash

In September 2018, Amazon’s value crossed the $1 trillion threshold.

CEO Jeff Bezos didn’t take Amazon to the top of the marketplace without mastering the art of decision-making.

In a 2015 [letter to shareholders](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm), he proposed two types of decisions entrepreneurs and executives regularly face.

A Type 1 decision represents a door you walk through and can’t go back, such as quitting a well-paying job to focus on your side-hustle full time.

In Amazon’s case, its web services business was a risky gamble that’s [worth more than $190 billion](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4073423-amazon-web-services-190-billion-valuation) today.
> “These decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation,” Bezos wrote.

A Type 2 decision represents a reversible choice by an individual or smaller groups, for example, testing a new product with a group of beta customers or the layout of a section on the Amazon store.

## How To Make Optimal Decisions

Ideally, [spend up to 10% ](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-spend-your-working-day-wisely-and-actually-get-things-done-2824628e31d6)of your work week on Type 1 decisions. These are draining and time-consuming, but they demand your attention.

Don’t make Type 1 decisions while feeling angry, hungry, lonely or because you’re tired of the process. For example, it’s probably not a good idea to quit your job because you feel despondent on a Monday morning.

Make Type 2 decisions relatively quickly by batching them, delegating to a team member or outsourcing to a contractor.

Again, rather than letting emotions overwhelm you, learn what you can about the problem.

You can also triangulate a big decision by consulting other experts with contrasting views (what [Ray Dalio does](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2018/10/18/ray-dalio-on-what-to-do-before-making-your-next-big-decision/#4b196cc1b5ae)).

## Plan For Unexpected Consequences

Many of your decisions will have unexpected consequences.

Perhaps you create a [product customers love ](https://medium.com/the-mission/do-this-if-you-want-to-dramatically-increase-your-odds-of-success-d57f1b992134)only to find you must spend hours fulfilling orders and providing technical support.

These unexpected consequences often represent Type 2 decisions that you manage through delegating, outsourcing or reviewing business processes.

“If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups,” Bezos wrote.

For example, a new entrepreneur considering an email service provider will weigh carefully the costs of this software.

This choice affects their cash flow noticeably, and they will also have to decide on a solution that’s easy for them to use. So he or she may spend several hours reading reviews and testing what’s on the market.

A more established entrepreneur might be happy for a team member to recommend several solutions before selecting one. Then he or she will evaluate the total cost and consider how long training others to use this new software takes.

## Take Responsible Risks With Your Choices

The biggest returns sometimes come from decisions that go against accepted wisdom.

Why would readers want to consume books on a digital device when they can buy a paperback?

Why would an e-commerce store get into the cloud-hosting and services business?

Will people really [trust drones](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2018/02/13/delivery-drones-amazon-energy-efficient-reduce-climate-change-pollution/#3e112f016a87) to deliver their everyday purchases?

Bezos writes, “Given a 10% chance of a 100-times payoff, you should take that bet every time.”

## Plan For Failures

Amazon has taken many bets over the years. Some, like the Kindle and its cloud services business, paid off.

Others, like the Amazon Webstore (a Shopify competitor) and Amazon Fire Phone were expensive flops, with the latter costing the company more than $170 million.

Bezos believes these types of failures are part of the job.

He said:
> “You’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for the many previous experiments.”

After all, entrepreneurs or executives who embrace their choices learn far more than the people who run away.

# Digital Securities&#58; A Primer

## 

Disruption is everywhere.

Think of companies such as Uber that have had a profound impact on the transportation industry. Not only has the company single-handedly changed consumer behavior around transportation, but Uber also destroyed the value of owning a taxicab medallion. In the 1930s, New York City officials instituted taxi medallions to limit the number of drivers on the road. That cap was set at 13,000.

![A vintage taxi medallion](1*m5fWmyJCcRRv-7Iejs8szg.jpeg)*A vintage taxi medallion*

As the population grew, the demand for those medallions soared as an increasing number of drivers wanted access to a growing market in need of a ride. At its peak, a single medallion [sold for $1.3M in 2014](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/nyregion/new-york-taxi-medallions-uber.html). These medallions were coveted and had a real value pre-Uber. Today, you can toss them away and take a large tax write-off. Most recently, a taxi medallion sold for as low as $150,000, a far cry from its peak just a few years before.

Think of Airbnb, who is challenging the hospitality industry. What will happen to hotels when you can get a clean, spacious apartment at half the price? Why would a traveler stay in a tiny hotel room when they could stay in an actual home and feel like part of the city they are visiting?

It turns out that the disruption is not one of hurting the hotel industry. Indeed, in an [article published by the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/02/airbnb-hotels-disruption/553556/) in February this year, the data showed a different trend. The hotel business is booming. Business travelers prefer them, and Airbnb helps drive the cost down in hotels by reducing the demand. The true disruption is that Airbnb has had the unintended consequence of helping drive up the cost of rent: it has shifted the burden of rising rental prices from hotels to the locals that live in the area.

These disruptions, and many more, were all financed by Venture Capitalists, who are more than happy to disrupt any and every industry. The only thing they are unwilling to disrupt is themselves.

**The ICO Boom**

![](1*PcTu-jNSmwxr82jdEEGtiQ.jpeg)

The craze that caught everyone off guard. Companies are raising money directly from the public? They are not going after professional investors such as venture capitalists and funds? No. They are going directly to the source.

Better, these companies are not selling backpacks on Kickstarter, nor do they even want US dollars. These companies doing ICOs want cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, in exchange for new cryptocurrencies, tokens that functioned within their proposed business like tokens at an arcade or earning rewards coupons that can be redeemed for services. How will these companies pay their employees, pay for the physical office spaces they rent, with Bitcoin?

Turns out, it is quite simple. You raise $50M in Bitcoin and Ether during your ICO, and then you exchange these cryptocurrencies into fiat like the US Dollar as you need to. Similar to having a savings account earning interest, only it’s a lot more volatile. You would not be wrong to describe it as a gamble. In some cases, that $50M turned into $200M. In others, that $50M is now only $20M.

Regardless, the real story was this: entrepreneurs were raising money directly from investors on their own terms. No VCs, no banks.

**Trouble in Paradise**

![](1*3bRKS2gWxAQnrcMXYOokSw.jpeg)

Despite that, or perhaps because of it, there was a problem with the ICO model. Not all was bright and shiny in the land of cryptocurrencies even though billions of dollars flooded the market, and companies with not even a working product could raise tens of millions of dollars in a day.

The problem was this: companies doing ICOs did not exactly follow the laws of the land. They understood the promise of blockchain; they understood the promise of cryptocurrencies; and they understood that their business needed money. They also understood that an ICO was a remarkably easy way to raise capital compared to other means.

What they didn’t understand, or perhaps simply did not pay enough attention to, was this new asset class they were selling: the utility token. What was it, really? How would the federal government view such an asset? The state? Did no one stop to think that the regulators would almost certainly take interest in this amount of money flowing from the public into private businesses, businesses that had no obligations to its investors? If we take a moment for the US, this is particularly acute within the context of the Great Depression, where unprotected investments broke the national economy.

The SEC first vocalized their stance in 2017, and as the crypto community ignored them, they only sang the song louder: they believed the majority of those so-called utility tokens are securities. The ‘utility’ is a misnomer. That means the majority of ICOs were illegal because the sale of securities requires entrepreneurs to register the offering (this is expensive and not practical for a startup, or even a medium-sized business). This is analogous to going public with an IPO. However, there is an alternative.

**The Exemption**

![](1*Jim7Y0IGNNEUIV2uwFvXOg.jpeg)

Signed into law in April 2012 by Barack Obama, the JOBS Act (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) is a game changer for fundraising. The Act allows entrepreneurs to raise capital directly from the public through the sale of securities. Does it work for ICOs? You bet.

Using the JOBS Act protects both the company raising capital and their investors. A no brainer for both parties. Recently, many ICOs have gone this route after their lawyers politely declined to help them raise money through the sale of utility tokens. The lawyers reminded their clients that they have risk. They have a reputation to uphold, and that reputation is what their business is built on, how they get new clients. No lawyer wants a reputation of violating securities laws. This is why Cooley, which is an extraordinary law firm, is out of that business.

As the marketplace realized that issuing securities without following the rules is a bad thing, that there were consequences to it (surprise!), a new narrative began to take place. ICOs are being transformed and replaced by STOs, or Security Token Offerings.

While ICOs were undeniably successful — they have raised over $15 billion in the last 18 months after all, they caught the eye not only of the SEC, but the Treasury, the 50 State administrators, and the big ad networks. With the amount of rampant fraud in ICOs, Facebook, Google, MailChimp, and others got so nervous that they banned ICO advertising.

STOs differentiated themselves from ICOs by operating within the light of regulation and legal restrictions. With the JOBS Act combined with an STO, you now have a framework that allows entrepreneurs to issue securities to their investors.

But what kind of securities are those investors buying? The good news is that within the JOBS Act, with the different exemptions at entrepreneurs disposal, Regulation A+, Regulation Crowdfunding and Regulation D 506(c), there is a lot of flexibility to design security tokens that meet the needs of entrepreneurs and the demands of investors. Equity, debt, revenue share, you name it.

**Leaving Paper Behind**

![](1*p7kuKStrtPdHympALEvoVg.jpeg)

Digital securities may be a new buzzword, but it makes sense when you think about it. In the past securities were paper, literally. Your ownership of a stock was written down on paper and kept in a warehouse somewhere. Now these securities are digital, and this is in itself is a huge step forward.

With digitization, a security now can have special properties, including the ability to track the owners of those securities digitally and the ability to trade those securities with minimal costs. In the past, you needed to wake the lawyer and pay legal fees in order to decide whether a security could be traded and, if so, to whom. Then you have to pay additional fees after a trading match is made, and then more fees after the trade. While these fees were great at keeping the legal profession healthy, these fees made most trades impractical, especially small ones under $50,000. Imagine spending $5,000 on a $10,000 trade. Then imagine spending $5000 on a $500 trade. The model just doesn’t work for investors wanting to trade small amounts of securities.

So how is this changed with digital securities? The simple answer is this: what the ATM did to the bank teller, digitization does to the broker, the lawyer, and everyone else in between the buyer and the seller. If a security is digitized, it is now possible to make a $500 trade in privately-held securities and come out ahead. Digitization gives small amounts of securities liquidity.

Why not pay $25 to a broker-dealer in order to buy or sell $500 worth of common stock or debt? You could argue that broker-dealers cannot live off $25 because the brokers have to pay expensive office rent for that view of downtown’s skyline and to maintain the ludicrous lifestyle of slick brokers. Fast cars, lobster, and cigars. Yachts, scotch, 3-acre homes, and a vacation cabin.

But if you pare down the excess, if you increase the raw number of trades, then it is possible for broker-dealers to run a business off these small fees. It is possible right now.

**The future has landed.**

![](1*D7xJBeczFlaKcVWWDe2xFw.jpeg)

So how does it work? A digital security is issued by a company or a broker-dealer and sold to investors when a company raises capital utilizing the JOBS Act. These are public offerings, and the securities can be sold to the general public, to thousands of investors should thousands of investors find the offering of worthy interest.

The company issuing the securities hires an intermediary who can write the smart contract on Ethereum or Stellar, two blockchains well-suited for this purpose, though there are certainly others. The smart contract is a token, a digital marker that will track the ownership of the security itself. It also has some other functions that we will get back to in a moment.

The next step in this process is issuance. To properly sell these digital securities to the crowd using the right exemption, investors have two options: Regulation A+ (often described as a mini-IPO, in which companies can raise up to $50M in a given year) or Regulation Crowdfunding (in which companies can raise up to $1.07M in a given year, but it is a leaner regulation and companies can launch faster and more cheaply than a Regulation A).

Then, the purchase. Once the investor has purchased digital securities through either a platform or a broker dealer, a transfer agent needs to record the transaction and then post it on the blockchain. This promotes transparency in the process as the general public can see how many securities exist, how many were issued, and which wallets own them. There is no privately identifiable information on the blockchain at anytime.

Trading securities is significantly easier because all of the information required to determine whether the trade is possible is located in the smart contract. When was that security issued? What exemption was used in its issuance? Is there a lock-up period during which that security can’t be traded, and if so, when does it end? Are there restrictions on who can buy the security? All of those questions are key to securities trading, and it’s possible to eliminate the attorney if the broker-dealer has confidence in the immutable and trusted information located on the blockchain.

Why is a broker-dealer involved? Securities laws are complex and designed to favor the use of a broker-dealer to handle transactions. Broker-dealers are companies supervised by FINRA, a regulator created by the SEC. FINRA’s job is to make sure those under their supervision are doing the right thing and providing accurate information to investors and only allowing legal trading, per the questions above and other restrictions. Add to this the complex regulations of 50 individual states when it comes to security transactions within their own borders, and you can now imagine why a broker-dealer is required. There is simply too much to keep track of.

However, the problem with broker-dealers is that traditionally they are heavy and expensive. This was true yesterday, but a new form of broker-dealer is emerging and getting their licenses. This new breed hails from the technology industry. Software is in their blood. They know how to automate everything and deliver shares for pennies instead of thousands of dollars.

Imagine a world where entrepreneurs can sell securities to consumers for very little costs, and those consumers can later sell them to others, either for a profit or a loss, but for very little costs in the actual transaction.

That world is coming, and digital securities are leading the way. Hello world.

# The Principles of Hermetic Philosophy — Mentalism

## The Principles of Hermetic Philosophy — Mentalism

## “The All is Mind; The Universe is Mental…”

Have you ever thought about our ability to craft stories?

I mean… *really* think about it for a second.

I can’t be the only one that’s thoroughly blown away by the fact that we *just so happen* to have this innate ability to create deeply rich and expansive cultures, characters, and histories just by *thinking about it *for long enough.

We’ve envisioned* countless* numbers of intricate and involved worlds — all of them, in a way, *real *— all of them woven into the fabric of what it is to be human.

And we’ve been doing it since the very beginnings of our existence, with the power to do so coming from the one place integral to each and every one of us -

***The Mind.***

The mind is the root of who we are. That unexplainable aspect of us that is, for all intents and purposes, the *only* aspect of us.

And *The Principle of Mentalism* persists that the mind is the only true aspect of *anything*.

And as far as we’re concerned, this is the truth.

Consider, if you will, a delicious sandwich…

![mmmmmm, taste](0*DVRV8vQJQ10pg7S3.jpg)*mmmmmm, taste*


Okay, now imagine that you were aware in a dream and wanted a sandwich, what would you do?

You’d simply think about it of course — and then poof, you’d have a sandwich.

Now, lets take the same principle and translate it over to the waking world. Let’s say you’re just chillin out and want a sandwich — how do you get it?

Again, you’d simply think of wanting the sandwich. Only this time you’d have to think about getting the ingredients, putting them together, and then following up on those thoughts with action.

The only difference is that manifesting in the dream is like moving through air — effortless and immediate.

While manifesting in the waking world is more like moving through water — slower and takes more effort.

Even though the process is different, the result is the same.

Thought about sandwich = sandwich.

Following this logic, reality is ultimately based in the realm of idea and concept — at least in the sense that your thoughts, and subsequent action relative to those thoughts, leads you to what you experience.

And there is true *power* in understanding this, because the more in tune you are with this concept, the more capable you become in applying it. You begin to “see” it working in real time, so to speak.

And when you’re able to see it, your influence over it increases. You gain the ability to perform “mental alchemy” — the act of consciously changing ones own mental states and conditions, as well as the mental states and conditions of those around you.

***You become the antenna putting out the signal rather than simply another receiver.***

And this can *absolutely *lead to near immediate benefits. A deeper awareness of self in relation to the mind, and the mind in relation to the rest of the world, leads you to taking actions that promote better health on all planes — mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, and financially.

And success of every kind is a result of one thing — health, in one form or another. But getting to this point takes a critical level of self reflection — one that can only be achieved through strenuous (and even painful) internal analyzation.

Because most people hold their beliefs on a subconscious level, which can lead to conflict with conscious thought. When you make your beliefs synonymous with truth, you only end up seeing that which you believe.

As a result, realization, change, and eventual application of the principal of mentalism can only come from one thing -

***Focused Attention***

This is the key, and it’s through meditation, self reflection, and intentional action that we are able to cultivate focused attention — and make no mistake, all that humans have ever achieved is simply the result of this practice.

It truly is that simple, but do not confuse simple with easy — because for most, this is not. That’s why it is only ever the few that *truly *achieve the heights of what is possible through implementation of this practice.

# Journey Into the Space Between “Awake” and “Asleep”

## Liminal Dreaming, Lucid Dreaming, Solar Sailing, and The Infection of Desire

![](0*6sPnX6jzZhGltkuu)

Happy Tuesday! Welcome to the **June 25, 2019** edition of the Mission Daily Newsletter.

Yesterday our CEO, Chad Grills, [took over the newsletter](https://medium.com/the-mission/extinction-evolution-and-event-horizons-209c8f3eb164); what’d you think? Stay tuned for more newsletters like this to come (ETA for the next one is Monday the 1st). We’re ready to take you into our next wormhole of musings. 🕳
> # “Dreams don’t work unless you do.” — John C. Maxwell

## **Surfing The Edge**

### **Owning Your Dreams**
> “If you think of the subconscious, dreams, and sleep as the ocean, and you think of the waking, rational mind as the land, then the place where water crashes into land is super chaotic. That’s where all the waves are. And that’s where you surf. So liminal dreaming is surfing the edge of conscious and unconscious.” –Jennifer Dumpert

When we say it’s time to chase your dreams, usually we’re being inspirational. Today? It’s literal. That’s because we’ve been inspired by Jennifer Dumpert’s research ([more here](http://bit.ly/2Zy8T6Y)) — a sleep expert who specializes in liminal dreaming.💭

What is liminal dreaming? According to Jennifer, “Liminal Dreaming is the space between awake and asleep — hypnagogia when you’re falling asleep, and hypnopompia when you’re waking up.”

And, according to sleep experts around the world, this in-between space might be the key to some of your most interesting subconscious insights. From artists to innovators to scientists, some of the smartest, most creative minds in history have used liminal dreaming as a tool for self-discovery. People like Thomas Edison, August Kekulé, Albert Einstein, Mary Shelley, and Edgar Allen Poe have [all indulged](https://www.fastcompany.com/3023078/how-dali-einstein-and-aristotle-perfected-the-power-nap) in the practice of traversing the space between sleep and wakefulness.

![](0*gcv1UTfZmlFX1_0r)

So, if you’re feeling brave (and sleepy), you can try it today:

### **Liminal Dreaming How-To Guide:**

🛋When you’re sleepy, lie down on the couch or in your bed, and breathe really deeply.

🌬Exhale. As you exhale, exhale out all of your waking energy and any tension that’s in your body. Soften your mind. Exhale your daily to-dos, your thought processes, and just wait for whatever shows up.
> “It might be a little visual glimmer, might be points of light. It might be a sound. It might even just be something that you’re imagining, like you’re daydreaming. And then let that come into your consciousness.”

😌Exhale again. Exhale your waking energy out. Exhale any mental wordings that you have, everything. Let that animate the beginning of the hypnagogic dream, and let there be a feedback loop. Keep breathing deeply and continue to slow down your own mind and body, loosening your mental grip and letting all of the energy that you’re exhaling bring to life this hypnagogic dream.
> “Then you’ll just start to slide into the hypnagogic dream space. It’s really a balance between not falling asleep, giving yourself enough mental juice to stay in the space, but not waking up. It might be easier to find [that line] when you’re falling asleep at night, but then once you’ve learned to find it, you can always find it.”

Ready to try it? Go grab a blanket, settle in, and give it a shot. Let us know what you find. 😉

## **Catch Some Sheep**

### **Feelin’ Sleeping?**

Sleep is one of the most basic processes humans are capable of. Today, people brag about how little sleep they “need” to function. But functioning is not thriving, and getting quality sleep is what it takes for you to thrive all day, every day. Help us shift the narrative about sleep 👉 [Tune in to our Sleep Week Series](http://bit.ly/2FEA9s8). 😴

🤔 Do you really want to do yoga with goats, Susan? Or do you just want to try it because your coworker is posting about it on Instagram?
> “We often get infected by the desires of people around us. This should not surprise anyone. We also often start yawning when people around us yawn.

And our desires are influenced by the desires of others.” — [Catching Desires](https://aeon.co/essays/can-you-stop-yourself-being-infected-with-other-peoples-desires)

# How Social Media Amplifies Our Need to Live up To Cultural Models of Perfection

## “grayscale photo of person sitting beside wall using smartphone” by rawpixel on Unsplash

We live in a world where everybody’s achievements are on public display. This parade of accomplishments amplifies our need to live up to a cultural model of perfection, leading to many toxic byproducts.

## Vanity Metrics and Status Anxiety

For a platform like Facebook, the first measure of status was whether or not you’re in a relationship. The options were single, in a relationship, it’s complicated, engaged, or married. From the very first measure, we’re separated into categories and put into lists.

This was followed by friend counts, likes, shares, and comments. **The toxic impact of quantifying every aspect of our humanity is now nothing more than a product feature on most social media platforms.** By using hearts as its primary metric, Instagram enables people to conflate attention with affection. To top it off, the addictive design of all these products preys on a human brain’s vulnerability to dopamine driven feedback loops.

Each social media platform has a hierarchy.

* The people who have high status have to keep feeding the beast to maintain their status

* Those who don’t have status keep feeding the beast in hopes that they’ll eventually become someone who does have status

The potential for status causes people to overlook the fact that the creators of these platforms could care less about your status. As long as you continue to the feed the beast, it gives them more of your attention which they can package and sell to advertisers.

## Cultural Models of Perfection
> # *We’re living in an age of perfectionism, and perfection is the ideal that kills. Whether it’s social media or pressure to be the impossibly ‘perfect’ twenty-first century iterations of ourselves, or pressure to have the perfect body or pressure to be successful in our careers, or any other myriad ways in which we place overly high expectations on ourselves and other people, we’re creating a psychological environment that’s toxic. — Will Storr**, Selfie: How We Became So Self Obsessed and What it’s Doing to Us***

By creating a social hierarchy, it becomes easy to reinforce cultural models of perfection. As a cultural model of perfection is reinforced on a daily basis, our status anxiety increases. We’re made to feel deficient in some way. Somebody is always ahead of us in some way or another, which leads to the inevitability of comparison, which leads us to keep feeding the beast in hopes that we’ll finally measure up to a false sense of celebrity that is ultimately nothing more than an insignificant illusion manufactured for profit.

On the surface, our addiction to social media and digital forms of validation seems harmless. **Even though its effects on the brain are similar to cocaine, looking at your phone doesn’t have the same social stigma as snorting lines of blow off the dinner table would**. But the further we get down the rabbit hole of what social media is doing to our brains, the more there seems to be cause for concern.

We’re not just being programmed to click on ads. We’re being programmed with a value system that points our moral compass in a dangerous direction. The false sense of celebrity made possible by social media fuels narcissism and self-obsession. It brings out some of our worst tendencies. It leads to envy, comparison, and a perpetual sense of deficiency. The inevitable byproduct is a rise in anxiety, depression, and a whole host of other mental health issues.
> # *By 2014, 93 billion selfies were being taken every day on Android phones alone. Every third photograph taken by an eighteen-to-twenty-four-year old was of themselves. **— Will Storr,***

That’s a lot of people taking pictures of themselves to get attention from strangers on the internet.

Internet fame is a strange phenomenon because you can be famous for being famous. Amassing fans and followers isn’t a notable accomplishment. Getting attention from strangers on the internet doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve created any real value.

A couple of years ago I hung out with a friend who had a popular Youtube channel. When I looked at her Instagram feed, I realized close to 90% of her pictures were selfies. Most of her status updates were “humble brags” about how much tax she had to pay, etc., etc. There was a constant need to prove to the world how great she was.

The validation we receive from social media is based on nothing more than manufactured metrics that cause people to confuse attention with affection and inflated vanity with the value. We value clicks over connections and eyeballs over hearts to such a degree that we’re becoming utterly unaware of the toxic impact of quantifying every aspect of our humanity.

When the people who have helped to build a product won’t go near their own creations and use phrases like “ripping apart the fabric of society” it should be a major warning sign to all of us. It might sound grim, but we’re on the precipice of creating a digital dystopia from which there will be no turning back. Watch five minutes of this video on how China has taken most of the things that are features of on social networks and turned them into tools to organize and control society.


## What Kind of World Do We want to Live in?

* Do we want to live in a world where we’ve wasted the potential of the internet?

* Do we want to live in a world where narcissism and self-obsession are the center of our moral compass?

* Do we want to live in a world where we’re more connected and more isolated?

Or do we want to live in a world where

* We’ve utilized the potential of the internet to solve some of our most significant problems

* Technology truly connects us face to face, allows us to know our neighbors and help each other

There are no easy answers to questions like these. It might require the demise and downfall of social media empires that have fueled the social media industrial complex.

# This is The Only Viable Strategy to Build an Audience for Your Work

## Photo by Elena de Soto on Unsplash

A few nights ago I was having dinner with a listener of the Unmistakable Creative, and he asked me “how do you build an audience for your work?” I found it difficult to answer his question because there is no silver bullet. Over the last ten years I’ve seen people attempt many tactics:

I’ve watched podcasters sign up for online courses, participate in review exchanges with other podcasters in those courses, artificially inflate their rankings and delude themselves into thinking they’re reaching an audience when the only people they’re reaching are the other students in the class.

My friend Paul Jarvis designed some of Danielle Laporte’s first websites. When I interviewed him several years ago, he said people would come to him and ask him to design a website that looked like hers. He would have to tell them that he didn’t want to do that and that it wouldn’t work for them. They assumed that if their website looked like hers, they would become just as successful.
> # There are no growth hacks, shortcuts, best practices, foolproof formulas or ideas that are guaranteed to work.

Building an audience for your work is hard. And if you’re not up for that, you’d be better off reading some clickbait about the ten things you can do this minute to get a million new followers. If you’re up for the hard work, keep reading.

## Time

[The Unmistakable Creative](http://www.unmistakablecreative.com) is an anomaly in the podcast world because we’ve been around longer, grown slower and have a smaller audience than some of the podcasts that started long after we did. When most people find out that I’ve been working on it for ten years, they’re usually stunned.

By the time you know about somebody’s work, they’ve been at it for a long time.

Dani Shapiro wrote three books that in her own words “came and went without a trace.” It was her 4th book that put her on the map. Given my experience with writing books, I’d imagine writing four books probably takes a minimum of about ten years.

Is it possible to grow faster? Absolutely. But it’s the exception more than the norm. Sometimes people are in the right place at the right time.

Patience is an essential trait for building a career in the arts or for that matter any career. And a fast rise is often followed by a rapid fall. Think about all the hot startups that have run out of money and all the viral videos that captured our attention for a day and quickly became an afterthought.

To create something of real value takes time. If you’re not willing to spend at least a year working on something it’s highly unlikely you’ll find an audience for your work.

Sam Altman famously said your most significant competitive advantage is a long-term view which he defines as ten years.

## Quality

Quality is usually the byproduct of doing something for a long time.
> # In a world where everyone’s parade of accomplishments are on display, we’ve conflated vanity metrics with value, and confused attention for a genuine connection. Inflated vanity metrics don’t mean you’ve produced anything of real value.

You can employ more tactics, or you can make better art. Employing more tactics is faster, more comfortable, and might produce a short-term result. But if you choose that route, you’ll have to keep employing more tactics. You can’t hide shitty art and lousy products behind great marketing for too long. Eventually, it will be revealed for what it is. You might be relevant for a brief moment of time. But ultimately, you’ll become an afterthought.

Making better art is hard. It rewards its creator long after the average person quits. It takes time, effort, energy, and grit. It’s the result of years of deep work, deliberate practice, and becoming a master of your craft. But it’s also much more likely you’ll create something timeless. As Ryan Holiday one said, “nothing can survive long-term without word of mouth.” Make better art and more people talk about it. Easy to say, hard to do.

The only viable long-term strategy for building an audience an increasingly noisy world is to be so good they can’t ignore you.

![](1*TBZmm7k4ekI1c21GCY8LeA.png)

## Deep Work

[Attention is the currency of achievement ](https://unmistakablecreative.com/why-attention-is-the-currency-of-achievement-2/)and nearly all time management problems are attention management problems.

Social media has made it possible for people to be famous for being famous. You can collect hearts, likes, fans, and followers by sharing quotes and pictures on Instagram. But this doesn’t take skill, can be easily replicated, and outsourced to the lowest bidder. It also doesn’t require a consumer to invest much of their attention in what you’ve created. It’s just one more thing for them to scroll through. To add to this, all these sources of distraction are gradually eroding our attention spans and turning us into the cognitive equivalent of athletes who smoke.

To do something like writing a book you have to invest a great deal of time and attention. For someone to read that book, they have to invest time and attention. If something takes deep work to create, it’s much more likely to lead to a deep connection with an audience. The more they have to invest in you and your work, the more loyal your audience will be.

## Consistency

For the sake of this article let’s define your work as some form of media, blog, a podcast, a newsletter, etc. People overlook the profound power of consistency when it comes to building an audience for anything. Habit drives media consumption.

* For ten years, every Thursday, millions of people tuned in to NBC to watch Friends. But let’s say NBC decides to air episodes whenever they feel like it. Watching friends would never become a habit for millions of viewers.

* Seth Godin hasn’t missed a blog post in more than 6000 days.

* The Unmistakable Creative airs every Monday and Wednesday. Other than last week, when my new book came out, we’ve stayed consistent with this schedule for more than five years.

A few years ago, I heard a podcaster open an episode by saying “hey guys I know I’ve been gone for the last three weeks.” Chances are anybody who might have been listening no longer was. When you set the expectation that you’re going to show up consistently your audience will as well. When you don’t, they scatter like Brazilians do from Ipanema beach when there’s a cloud in the sky (If you’re Brazilian I’m sure you’ve witnessed this).

Producing something consistently increases the volume and quality of your creative output.

## Distinctiveness

If there’s an alternative to what you’ve provided that’s better, faster, or cheaper, people will choose it. If on the other hand, there is no alternative because what you’ve created is different not better you’re more likely to find an audience for it. As I said in my first book Unmistakable: Why Only Is Better Than Best, when nobody does what you do in the way you do it, your competition becomes irrelevant.

A few years ago popular podcasters got on their soapboxes and echoed the mantra that everyone should start a podcast. Conveniently they also sold online courses on how to start a podcast. It’s been close to 3 years since that happened. While new podcasts start every day, many are on hiatus and others have been abandoned altogether. This, however, isn’t isolated to podcasts. The same thing happened with blogs. When I started my first blog in 2009, there were 1000’s of bloggers. Many of them have completely disappeared.

Building a loyal audience for your work is a long game. It might take years, possibly decades. It’s a journey into a vast landscape of the unknown and uncertain combined with the possibility of scenic beauty and bliss that becomes an essential nutrient, something that might eventually reach an audience of millions, but at its core, you do for [an audience of one.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/audience-of-one/)

# The three words that changed my life

## The three words that changed my life

### When you need direction.

That day was a *really* low point.

I looked up from my desk, my eyes tired from staring at a gleaming screen.

I was working with terrible clients, commoditising my work for projects I didn’t enjoy and didn’t pay well. Friends? Well, I had moved places and let things dissolve, and…there I was hoping for better relationships.
I was in terrible shape.

Oh, and my energy levels were shockingly low.

Every day, I would look for a big breakthrough. Some sort of quick win, that would give me the work, the people, the body, and the energy that I wanted.

But. Day after day, it never happened.

Until, someone I might never meet gave me a great piece of advice through the soundwaves of a podcast.
> Think long-term.

Something clicked. I realised that I was being greedy.
Instead of making things better for my [**future self](http://timezillionaire.com/future-self)**, I wanted it all NOW.

That NOW never happened. Like a plane with too short a runway, I was crashing into the fence daily, ignoring the clear lesson: make the runway long enough to be able to take off.

So I switched my thinking from a few weeks ahead, to three years in the future. *Where do I want to be there and then?*

Suddenly, things started to change much faster.
Instead of worrying about the small things and get lost in what didn’t really make much of a difference, I became laser-focused on the big changes I wanted to make happen.

And change came fast: within 3 months, I already had better clients, better friends, more energy, and I had just embarked on a massive bulk up mission.

**You likely experienced the same thing already** without even noticing.
Think about a moment, a person, or an achievement **you cherish**. I bet that wasn’t a daily breakthrough. It wasn’t an overnight success. It took consistent work over time.

But, just like a child looking in the mirror every day, it’s difficult to notice the small, daily changes. You always look the same, until you look back at past pictures, and it hits you: you’ve grown so much!

Give yourself permission to think long term.
With a longer runway, you’ll be able to take off much faster.

# Journey ever on…

## 

I grew up in Northern California amongst the Redwood trees, salmon fishing on the Eel River, backpacking in the Trinity Alps, and listening to music by artists such as [Dan Fogelberg](https://www.danfogelberg.com/). And as time has gone by, the words of one of Dan’s songs plays through my mind:
> “May the trail rise up to meet you, May your heart rejoice in song, May the skies be fair above you, As you journey ever on…”

When I joined the [Equinix ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/equinix/)team in 2008, I was attracted by the opportunity to be involved in something truly special — protecting, connecting and powering the digital world. And while the possibilities were indeed game changing, I also came for the people, and soon discovered they were not only talented, but authentic, humble, and kind, with big, caring hearts. I saw people committed to a mission and to each other. Equinix is a great place to be.

When I celebrated my 10th anniversary with the company last August, I realized there were other, more personal journeys I was longing to explore. In his most recent article, “[After 25 years studying innovation, here is what I have learned](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/after-40-years-studying-innovation-here-what-i-have-christensen/),” Clayton Christensen stated that “your decisions about where and how you allocate your resources — time, energy, and talent — ultimately shape your life’s strategy.” I’ve been honored to serve as Chief Information Officer, Chief Customer Officer and Chief Product Officer during my tenure at Equinix, and now I’m ready to embrace a new chapter in my life and career.

I’m calling this my “exploration year,” as it’s all about making the time to explore new places, learn new things and gain new perspectives. As [Marcel Proust](http://www.proust-ink.com/) once said: “The real voyage of discovery consists, not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.”

If you run into me over the coming year, you’ll find me spending more time with my family; visiting new places where I can see new things and meet new people; reading in the Stanford library; advising startups and private equity companies; continuing to serve on the [Lumentum ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lumentum/)and [Talend ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/talend/)boards; and volunteering more in my community. It will be a year full of exploration and I hope to have new eyes at the end of it.

As Lao Tzu once said, “the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step,” and I will be taking the first step of my new journey at the close of business on April 5th, my last day at Equinix. Until that time, I will be working hard to transition my responsibilities to my very special team…I know they are more than ready to take on the challenges ahead, and Equinix’s future is extremely bright in their capable hands.

I am so grateful to have been a small part of the Equinix journey, and I wish all of our wonderful employees, amazing customers, and can-do partners nothing but the best life has to offer. Good luck and Godspeed to all of you.

May the trail rise up to meet you as you journey ever on…

Brian

# 3 Obstacles Halting U.S. Cannabis Industry Momentum

## 3 Obstacles Halting U.S. Cannabis Industry Momentum

### Here are three specific roadblocks that we should address if we wish to remain competitive in the ever-growing global cannabis market.

***By [Ben Owens](https://minutes.co/author/ben-owens/), founder of CannaVenture***
> # *If we don’t act and address the current roadblocks inherent to the U.S. cannabis industry, we risk falling behind and missing out on what could be a new global gold rush.*

As the popularity of legal cannabis industry continues to rise globally, projections in the billions of dollars are attracting both investors and governments looking to capitalize on these projected revenues. An untapped legal market with preexisting demand that can be invested in for pennies on the dollar seems like a dream come true for many venture capitalists and aspiring entrepreneurs who are looking to take advantage of the newly-legal industry. Countries like Canada that have legalized cannabis on a national level are paving the way for [multinational cannabis corporations that will dominate the international cannabis markets](https://investingnews.com/innspired/international-cannabis-global-domination-canadian-cannabis-companies-seeing-global-opportunity/) in the near future.

Meanwhile, the United States maintains some [30+ independent frameworks](https://disa.com/map-of-marijuana-legality-by-state) for how legal cannabis should be handled. The federal government has refused to reschedule or de-schedule the plant which would allow for traditional nationwide regulations, commonly-accepted financial services and deductions, as well as allow for the creation of a nationally accepted framework for legal cannabis consumption.

The United States’ labyrinthine system of frameworks and contradictory laws is having real negative effects on our national cannabis industry. Here are three specific roadblocks that we should address if we wish to remain competitive in the ever-growing global cannabis market.

## State cannabis industry frameworks cannot compete with national legalization.

Having worked directly with cannabis brands across the country, I know firsthand the troubles that state-by-state legality presents. Brands that exist in multiple states, such as the notorious MedMen, must start from the ground up each time with [licenses in each state](https://investors.medmen.com/overview/medmen-strategy/default.aspx). New everything, from staff to licenses to the products themselves, which often must undergo expensive labeling, formulation, and marketing changes to be compliant with each market’s unique requirements.

This additional financial burden creates both a barrier to entry for those looking to get into the industry, while also proving cost-prohibitive for many brands and businesses who have already established a local following but do not have the means to take their businesses to the next level in another state. This caps their market potential. A national framework would encourage more businesses to invest in growth, which would continue to spur job creation and tax revenues, and would raise this ceiling much higher, allowing businesses and investors to increase their potential return on investment beyond one state’s market.

## Cannabis businesses aren’t allowed deductions and banking services.

With the federal government in charge of banking regulations, the current Schedule I status of cannabis has scared most banks away from allowing cannabis-related businesses to use traditional banking services such as checking and savings accounts. Or they allow them to do so, but at a significantly higher fee.

Cannabis businesses are [not allowed to take advantages of deductions](https://moskowitzllp.com/tax-court-confirms-no-deductions-for-state-legal-cannabis-business-part-v-arguing-cost-of-goods-sold/) or write off the same expenses that other industries are. This directly adds to the financial burdens involved in growing the business, making it harder for businesses looking to consistently grow their efforts. In most industries, more staff and more expenses means more deductions to allow for the increased investment. For cannabis businesses, it often means a significantly higher financial burden, restricting the amount of businesses that have the liquidity to expand while also maintaining daily operations and receiving no incentive for doing so.

Additionally, the brands that I work with have to form consultant firms that allow them to work with banks under nondescript names and write off non-cannabis expenses as any other industry would be allowed to do so. Some use the firm to process payments to avoid being shut down by credit processors, while others may rent or purchase under an affiliated but distinctly non-cannabis name.

While this presents a short-term solution, it is an unnecessary complication added to an already intricate logistical nightmare. Businesses may be listed under one name but ordering supplies or making deliveries under another. Similarly, payments are often made from these ancillary companies rather than the actual licensed brand, which can present confusion to vendors and clients. The more diluted a brand is, the less valuable it is, and the cannabis industry is often forced to dilute its brands in order to play ball with banking, compliance, and other regulatory agencies.

## Legal to grow, buy, and sell, but illegal to use in most cases.

In addition to the logistical nightmare of state frameworks and financial uncertainty, most states with legal cannabis regulations have yet to establish consumption regulations other than to prohibit the public use of cannabis. [California, Colorado (specifically Denver),](https://www.freedomleaf.com/social-cannabis-consumption-california-colorado/) [Massachusetts and Nevada](https://news.weedmaps.com/2019/07/nevada-postpones-cannabis-lounges-but-other-states-are-pressing-ahead/) are among the only states to attempt to create social consumption models.

This forces tourists who visit legal states to light up illegally in public, on the street, behind bars, or in their hotels and rentals, often to the tune of hundreds of dollars in fines. We legalized the sale, production and possession of cannabis, but forgot to legalize its use. And those businesses that allow cannabis consumption are under constant scrutiny, subject to raids and licensing restrictions that prevent them from having a viable business model. Often, the only remaining areas to consume are private or illegal.

The countries that have legalized cannabis on a federal level have not only created a consistent framework, but have also allowed for cannabis businesses to take advantage of financial services, a move that allows investors to feel more comfortable working in the new industry, and set up laws for consumption, such as allowing cannabis to be consumed wherever nicotine is consumed. The removal of these barriers eliminates confusion among consumers and provides an extra level of assurance for investors and entrepreneurs who may be on the fence about getting in on the action.

## Global competition is stacking up, and there are three things the U.S. can do to allow its domestic cannabis industry to keep up.

Other countries that adopt nationally legal programs pave the way for the remaining pieces of the pot puzzle, namely:

**Federally legal status**. Banks will be leery of cannabis money until this changes, and the convoluted nature of 33+ individual cannabis industry frameworks will remain convoluted until a national framework is established allowing interstate commerce. Some states are attempting to encourage this line of thought, such as Oregon, who [recently proposed a state cannabis export bill](https://mjbizdaily.com/oregon-governor-approves-marijuana-exports/).

**Nationally-accepted social consumption laws.** Similar to alcohol, the federal government needs to have standards that states can further regulate. There’s nowhere to legally consume legal cannabis as a tourist, renter, etc. in most states with legal cannabis, which means that we haven’t fully legalized cannabis. Without a place to legally consume cannabis, many will be discouraged from ever trying a cannabis product or supporting the cannabis industry because they have nowhere to use the substance while visiting, and no way to legally transport it to their residence upon departure. California has among the most robust system to date for handling cannabis consumption in public, but it is still in its early stages and has much to improve upon. As more states develop pilot regulations that allow for consumption of cannabis as they do tobacco or vaporizers, more adults will be able to legally use the products they purchase without having to own their own home.

**Access to traditional banking and financial services.** Having to work and operate under DBA’s or partner companies adds unnecessary complication to an already complicated industry. Companies still must drive large sums of cash from one place to another, even to pay items like taxes, due to a lack of access to banks. [Members of congress are starting to agree](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senate-marijuana-banking-211818355.html) that this must change, but, again, most of this momentum will be paused until federal progress is made. Once banks and financial service businesses are allowed to openly work with cannabis businesses, the fees for using these services will decrease, making them more accessible to a greater majority of the industry while also encouraging outside investors who require specific considerations for large investments and wish to protect their interests as they would in other markets.

As an organizer who hosts cannabis events throughout the country, specifically [hikes and campouts](http://www.cannaventure.org/cannaventures), the inability to allow public cannabis consumption in legal states presents a logistical problem; most hiking trails are on public land and public consumption is illegal. We have had to come up with workarounds for hikes, campouts and disc golf tournaments to allow adults to choose whether or not they wanted to consume while protecting ourselves from potential illegal acts (consumption) that might take place. My business is ancillary to the industry, and I do not “touch” the product, which has allowed me to still enjoy banking and manage my expenses as any traditional pipe company, clothing brand, or smoke shop might. But cannabis businesses aren’t always this lucky.

In working with so many established cannabis brands over the years — and founders who’re experiencing the issues detailed above first hand — it’s clear that something needs to change. If we don’t act and address the current roadblocks inherent to the U.S. cannabis industry, we risk falling behind and missing out on what could be a new global gold rush.

# Here’s what’s going down at SugarCon 2018

## SugarCon 2018

SugarCon 2018 is mere weeks away and we have a full list of events that are going to go down at this year’s event. Sugar has managed to put in a lot of exciting events in this year’s edition after choosing to do away with [**AppThrowdown](https://www.rolustech.com/blog/sugarcon-2017-appthrowdown)**. Looking at the agenda, you can see its packed to the max. Let’s breakdown what Sugar has in store

## PitchFest

The inaugural PitchFest has everyone giddy and roaring. Sugar hasn’t outright said it but it looks like PitchFest is a replacement for AppThrowdown.

Apart from this, not much is known about PitchFest.

## Keynote Speeches

We’ve covered the keynote speeches and what they mean in great detail in our [**SugarCon 2018 preview](https://www.rolustech.com/blog/sugarcon-2018-the-countdown-begins)** but we’re putting it here as well because they are that important.

# How To Stop Feeling Like A Failure.

## Image Credit: Kenton Nelson

It was 2014.

I was living in Melbourne and I’d begun my transformation. I’d discovered personal development and seen rapid change. It was addictive.

I would watch Tony Robbins videos on YouTube and feel invincible.

There was one problem though: I felt empty.

I had given away my hobby of making music and my weekends were spent watching TV Shows and Louis Theroux documentaries.

**There was no real meaning in my life. I got my pay cheque each week from the bank I worked at, and that was about it.**

I felt like a failure and was embarrassed that I hadn’t achieved more — like my former private school, friends had achieved. I wasn’t saving lives. I wasn’t on stages in front of thousands of people. I was broke financially.

## The day things changed.

During this time in my life, my work life was pretty boring. I worked my ass off in a sales job and was very good at it.

I’d stay back late every night, so I could be number one on the sales board and feel like I was successful.

Things changed when I met a man at work whose nickname was Walt Disney.

![Image Credit: [Jennifer Hickey](https://fineartamerica.com/profiles/jennifer-hickey.html)](1*QygBfJQoAkDgUQLDCPLjxg.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Jennifer Hickey](https://fineartamerica.com/profiles/jennifer-hickey.html)*

Even though Walt was not my manager, he took it upon himself to give me advice. He could see that I felt like a failure. He knew I wasn’t living my purpose — he was Walt Disney after all :)

Walt challenged me to find a way to use the online world, to help other people. He didn’t tell me how to; he just planted that idea in my head.

## I experimented with everything.

I setup a LinkedIn account. I posted lots on Facebook. I even tried inspiring my work colleagues through Yammer at work.

* LinkedIn seemed emotionless at the time. Everyone was so serious.

* Facebook did nothing and I could barely scrape together two likes.

* Yammer had work colleagues on there, so I felt I had to be careful with what I said.

After all these mini-experiments, I felt like even more of a failure.

I told Walt, and he didn’t care. He encouraged me to keep trying.

One day, on Facebook, I saw that one of my friends posted a link to a website called Addicted2Success. The title of the site resonated with me for some reason.

Since 2011, I’d become obsessed with personal development but only used it to help myself — and cure my mental health issues.

![Artwork by Meg Jenson](1*FVgz1m1_a5TMO_YtUdQo_g.jpeg)*Artwork by Meg Jenson*

After reading this regularly for a while, I fell in love with the content. I decided I wanted to make an impact online doing the same thing.
> # **“The trouble was I had no website building capabilities and very little money. The thought of building a website was too overwhelming”**

I gave up and went back to feeling like a failure.

## A trip to Perth.

One Saturday, I was feeling rather fired up. I saw an ad for a seminar with the founder of Addicted2Success.

On the bottom of the ad was a phone number. It said, *“Call if you have any questions.”*

I thought to myself *“Yeah I have a question: how can I meet the founder?”*

So, I rang the number and felt a rush of nervous energy go up the back of my spine. A young lady answered and I nearly couldn’t speak.

![Image Credit: [**Aloysius Patrimonio](https://fineartamerica.com/profiles/aloysius-patrimonio.html)**](1*i8e3JmogTHOn3dMSpz43kA.jpeg)*Image Credit: [**Aloysius Patrimonio](https://fineartamerica.com/profiles/aloysius-patrimonio.html)***

I asked to speak to Joel (The Founder). I don’t remember exactly what she said, but by the end of the call, I had his personal phone number. The next week, I flew four hours from Melbourne to Perth. This was the longest I’d ever been on a plane which was a small achievement in itself.

When I arrived in the city of Perth, I rang the mobile number. Nobody answered.

I thought to myself *“Crap, now you really are a failure and you’ve wasted so much money to be here.”*

I took a long walk down the beach to be alone for a while. I thought I might as well enjoy the trip otherwise I’ll regret that too.

As I walked back up the hill from the beach, the wind was blowing fiercely. It was like some higher power was trying to send me an SOS message. I stopped walking and ducked into a small entrance to an apartment building.

I rang the number again and Joel picked up.

I told him how I’d spoken to someone previously and he told me that was his girlfriend. I asked if we could meet that same day and he agreed.

## The rendezvous.

I walked that night to a local shop that sold hot chocolate (even though I don’t consume sugar).

![Image Credit: [Joel Brown](https://www.iamjoelbrown.com/)](1*O3K3JQsz4Q1iPaSxmaCb5A.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Joel Brown](https://www.iamjoelbrown.com/)*

Mr. Addicted2Success arrived shortly after and we spoke for two hours.

I offered to do him a favor and didn’t ask for anything in return. I was ready to leave thinking that I’d achieved my goal.

Before we got up from the table, Joel asked me if I’d ever thought about blogging on his website.

I quickly dismissed his offer and said: *“I can’t write very well, so I don’t want to disappoint you.”*

He wouldn’t take no for an answer and given he’d made the time to come and see me, I felt obliged to say yes.

**When I returned back home, for the first time in a very long time, I didn’t feel like a failure.**

## The first blog post.

I published the first blog post on Addicted2Success a few weeks later. It read like a press release for a startup founder who I’d interviewed.

A couple of weeks later, I published another post and people liked it. It was the story of how I’d discovered personal development and transformed my life.

I also copped a healthy dose of people that hated my work.

*“You have spelling mistakes everywhere.”
“Who are you to give advice?”
“I can’t afford to buy a juicer moron!”*

For the first time in a while, I felt like a failure once more. I’d put my heart and soul on the line and not everyone liked it.

Gratitude saved me though because I knew that the chance I’d been given to write on a well-known blog was not something I should take for granted. I didn’t want to let Joel down, so I kept blogging even though I thought I sucked.

The next article to have any traction was much later — like years later.

## Eventually, this happened…

I published articles every week and people started enjoying them. They found the advice practical, simple and vulnerable.

**The fact that I got to help lots of people was a good feeling.**

Helping others by sharing my struggles and things I’d learned stopped making feel like a failure. I realized that I was never a failure. I figured out that I had to help others above everything else.

What I was lacking was not success but a purpose for my life. Blogging helped me to discover that purpose.
> # “None of us are failures; we’re just obsessed with ourselves and the pursuit of success”

Now I reach millions of people a month through my blogging and answers on Quora because I’ve stopped giving a fuck and made my life about more than just myself and my selfish desires.

Make your life about more than yourself and you can overcome failure to.

# This Is Why Most People Give Up On Their Dreams — I Plead With You Not To Become One Of Them.

## Image Credit: Bobby Anderson Photography

We all have a dream even if we haven’t realized it yet. It could be something as simple as raising a family, or it might be more extreme like winning an Olympic gold medal.

No matter the dream, most people give up on their dream.

I’m pleading with you not to be one of those people. You can achieve your dream when you understand why people give up in the first place.

### Here’s why most people give up on their dreams:

## They failed once before.

Many people try something once and when they fail, they give up. That’s because nobody tells you that achieving your dream doesn’t happen the first time around.

You have to try and try again until you reach your goal. 
The problem is it’s easy to try once, fail, and then say *“I already tried and I didn’t win.”*

We give in so easily because the upside is a life of excuses.

We give in because we can live through the heroes of our favorite Netflix show.
> # “We give in because in some ways there is a reward. Giving up gives you permission to sit on the couch, eat junk food, be angry at the world on social media and sleep in your nice warm bed”

The problem is that this life fucking sucks. You’ll get tired of it. One day you’ll want to chase your dream again, but you might be old, frail and full of regrets.

I’m pleading with you not to choose this option.

![Image Credit: [Stefano Corso](https://www.stefanocorso.com/streetphotography/)](1*H3pn06wkG9bH-GCz6JOPpQ.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Stefano Corso](https://www.stefanocorso.com/streetphotography/)*

## They got told no.
> “You don’t need permission — remember that. You are going to get told no hundreds of times in your life. With every dream you have, there’s going to be some fat, lazy slob that’s going to be standing in your way.”

Push through these people — flubber and all. Don’t let someone else’s laziness or issues with your dream stop you.

Ignore the no and get right back to it. Ask them again. Ask someone else.

Ideally, don’t fucking ask them at all. I never asked to be a blogger I just did it. Certain publications turned me down and I kept writing.

Not everyone understands your gifts or potential and that’s fine. The main point here is that you understand.

I’m pleading with you to not give up because of a no. Make the no your motivation instead.

## They don’t see failure for what it is.
> # Failure is nothing more than the inevitable education that any person who achieves their dream goes through.

Failure is so important that I personally like to pay money for it. I wish there was a shop or course I could do that would guarantee me failure instead of success. I want you to want the failure because that’s where all the answers are.

Once you know what doesn’t work, you’ll have a path forward. Change the word failure into education.

I’m pleading with you to fall in love with failure and not to give up on your dream.

## Boredom strikes like thunder.

Everyone gets bored. I watched a documentary where Usain Bolt was training for the Olympics and even he admitted that he got bored after he won a few gold medals.

**Boredom is normal, but it’s why a lot of people give up on their dreams.**

It’s in the moments of boredom that you give your mind a chance to rest. Doing nothing and being lazy for a few hours can often bring a spark of creativity. No one is motivated 100% of the time — not even me.

It’s up to you to add some variety into your day, so you don’t get stuck in boredom forever.
> Boredom can also be a good sign as well. It can be a sign that you need to change your approach or do things in a new way.

I’m pleading with you not to be afraid of boredom. Use boredom to your advantage.

## They stop believing in themselves.

Your dreams are not easy (obviously). The rejection, failure and setbacks you’ll achieve can bring you down. What messes people’s dreams up is they stop believing in themselves.

Everything starts to fall over when you don’t believe in yourself. You have to believe you can do it before anyone else will buy into that idea. The challenge is that you’re going to need help to achieve your dreams. You can’t do it alone.

You’ll never get that help unless you can get people to believe what you believe.

I’m pleading with you to believe in yourself no matter what. You have this dream for a reason and you can do it.

## They are stuck on one strategy.

Many people live their entire life based on one strategy or one arbitrage. They refuse to change and so eventually the environment around them changes which affects their ability to reach their dream.

If you’re set in your ways and won’t change your approach, you’ll probably fail. We all imagine how our dream should look yet sometimes the reality is different.

You have to be open to change. In my experience, my original dream looked much different and I’m glad it’s changed. Changes to your dream are for the better.

I’m pleading with you to be open-minded.

## They are surrounded by an army of morons.

If everyone around you is telling you you’re an idiot and they don’t respect your dream for what it is, this will have a negative impact on you whether you like it or not.
> # “Run away from the dream killers who are making up for their own broken dreams and surround yourself with people who support you”

![](1*cD3YBwicwBHJfnNPYeXzqw.jpeg)

The best people are the ones that support you but don’t always agree with you. Even better are the ones that support you and challenge your thinking. 
I’m pleading with you to reassess the people around you.

## They want security.

No dream comes with an insurance policy or a set path. People are afraid to take risks and want reassurances when they pursue their dream.

There are none. Dreams are made off the back of taking calculated and clever risks most of the time. If you want someone to guarantee your dream, then it ain’t going to happen.

It’s the unpredictability that makes dreams addictive, delicious and worth the effort. Not knowing is what our mind craves — we just don’t know it. If we knew how our dream turned out, we wouldn’t be as excited.

I’m pleading with you to take a risk or two.

## They refuse to be disciplined.

Nothing worth achieving can be done without discipline. There’s work involved and that has to be scheduled and executed upon.
> **I’ve written every single week since 2014. That takes bloody discipline.**

My discipline reflects my results in the blogging world. The same applies to your own dream.

Block out chunks of your calendar and get to work. If you’re not doing at least one small thing towards your dream every day, then you’re heading in the wrong direction.

## The greener grass syndrome.

Another reason we give up is not because we’re lazy necessarily but because we failed and there is a better option. That’s what our mind tells us.

*“I didn’t fail; I just found something better,”* you say to yourself.

Well, that’s the sad truth.
> # “Changing your idea of success consistently is not the answer. At some point, you need to decide to chase one dream and quit the ADHD dream chasing the average person chases. You’re better than that”

Worrying about what everybody else is doing and then chasing their dreams is ridiculous.

I’m pleading with you not to fall for this lie. The grass is not greener it just requires more work than you anticipated.

## Final thought.

Please, please, please don’t give up on your dream. You’re closer than you think. You just need to stand back and think about a few of the points I’ve mentioned.

**Broken dreams have birthed so many broken people.**

It doesn’t have to be that way. See your dream for what it is: Something special that you can achieve if you put your mind to it, focus and be excited by the possibilities.

Don’t give up on your dream.

# Chick-fil-A’s Amazing Millennial Marketing Campaign for Attracting Mothers

## 

It’s one of the most lucrative markets in the U.S. Each year, Americans open their wallets and shell out over $160 billion for their favorite fast foods.

But competition is insane–over 200,000 restaurant locations across the country vie for a greater share of the fast-food revenue pie. [Major brands](https://mobilemonkey.com/blog/2018/01/10-examples-of-how-brands-are-using-chatbots-to-delight-customers) like McDonald’s, Yum Brands, and Wendy’s dominate, with McDonald’s alone cornering a massive [21.7 percent of the market](http://www.statista.com/statistics/196611/market-share-of-fast-food-restaurant-corporations-in-the-us/). Chick-fil-A sits at №8 in the national fast-food revenue rankings.

Chick-fil-A wants to steal away a bit more of that fast-food revenue with [an unusual strategy ](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/the-unusual-business-strategy-that-made-this-woman-a-multi-billionaire.html)that marks a departure from their heavy emphasis on quality over speed.

With [$5.8 billion in 2014 sales](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/reports/qsr50-2015-top-50-chart?sort=2014_sales&dir=desc), Chick-fil-A is no slouch. It’s already generating more revenue than every pizza brand in the U.S.

But fast-food restaurants are battling increasing food costs–the rising prices of corn, wheat, and livestock have seriously damaged margins over the past year. Until now, Chick-fil-A’s strategy has been a hardcore focus on “great tasting, high quality” food–on fresh ingredients, and on eschewing fillers and additives in their food products.

It’s an [entirely different strategy](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/the-unusual-business-strategy-this-startup-used-to-raise-86-million.html) from say, McDonald’s, which has focused on introducing new product lines, like McCafé coffees, and speeding up service for an ever-demanding crowd of time-constrained customers.

Chick-fil-A, in its quest to steal a bit of business away from McDonald’s, has launched a new service to make their offerings more attractive for moms, particularly Millennial moms between the ages of 18 and 35.

David Farmer, Chick-fil-A’s vice president of menu strategy and development, told [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-mom-valet-service-2016-1) that the idea took root when the restaurant’s management noticed how hectic ordering could be for parents of young children.

The solution? **Mom’s Valet.**

Now, parents can pull into the drive-thru to order their meal, then come inside to their prepared table. With their order already in, service is a snap, and kids spend less time in the restaurant–meaning parents can spend less time wrangling their impatient kids inside the restaurant.

It’s the first time a major restaurant brand has offered a service like this.

[In a story ](http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Story/Detail/1813)published on the Chick-fil-A website, one North Carolina mom wrote, “Our local Chick-fil-A does Mom’s Valet and they know us by name now!”

While other restaurant chains are focusing on creating efficiencies, even where it may mean a lesser service or experience for customers, Chick-fil-A wants to make life easier for moms and, in doing so, win them over from restaurants better known for their lightning-quick service.

It’s the latest in a series of steps the brand has taken to make its service faster and more efficient for customers.[ Late in 2014](http://inside.chick-fil-a.com/mobile-payment-pilots-mobile-ordering/), it launched mobile payments and began piloting mobile ordering, in which customers could place an order from the Chick-fil-A app and check in to start the order-making process once they reached the physical location.

They also [removed coleslaw](http://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-is-doing-something-no-other-fast-food-chain-has-done-before-2016-1), a staple menu item since 1946, from the menu, replacing it with a healthier kale salad as an alternative to French fries. In fact, Chick-fil-A has made [eight major changes over the last year](http://www.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-changes-this-year-2016-1) in an effort to compete with brands like KFC and McDonald’s.

Will its willingness to reinvent itself pay off? Time will tell, but time and again, companies have had to look beyond what everyone else in the market is doing–[to get super creative](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/this-unusual-startup-strategy-led-to-a-200-million-acquisition-by-microsoft-in-1.html)–to really stand out and make the kinds of gains that have the potential to fell giants.

Chick-fil-A may not steal McDonald’s crown, but they’re sure going to try. And they’re going to do it their way.

# On Creating Serendipity in Relationships

## 
> “Adversity is like carpet bombing false relationships…When you face significant adversity…There is a great sunlight that causes indifferent or false friends to scurry in the darkness away from you.” –Stefan Molyneux
> # “A body in motion will stay in motion, while a body at rest will remain at rest.” –Sir Isaac Newton

To hear a deeper discussion on the following topics, listen to:

[The Mission Daily Episode 41: Upgrading Your Relationships](http://bit.ly/2MXrVhD)

When we become childlike by making space and time for activities and play, we can’t help but create great memories. It’s these memories which help us recharge, relax, laugh, and find that we’ve created meaning as a byproduct.

That movement leads us to better moments, and better moments help create the byproduct of meaning.

In our own relationships, we might bump into meaning while we’re on a road trip, taking a class together, on a double date, in a yoga class, building something, or discovering a business idea with our spouse and friends that we’re perfectly suited to pull off. To help apply this framework for making choices, let’s consider a simple equation.

**Movement + Exposure = Meaning**

To get movement, we need to not be afraid to ask our parents if we are allowed to stack our beds to create bunk beds. We need a willingness to open up and be ourselves in an environment, or during an activity, with someone we care about. Often, we find that trying to manufacture meaning on demand is impossible. But, when we dive into action, and take small risks, we find that we’ve given ourselves the exposure necessary to stumble on meaning. If we look back on all the happiest moments in our relationships, we’ll likely see that many align with this simple equation.

People often underestimate how movement and exposure are the single drivers to break out of relationship challenges or stagnation. Here are two quick stories about movement from a world class entrepreneur, Tony Hsieh, and one of the most successful angel investors of all time, Chris Sacca.

First, let’s take Hsieh’s story. He has started many companies, including LinkExchange (sold to Microsoft) and is most famous for building and selling Zappos to Amazon. Hsieh is in the midst of building a technology hub in Las Vegas around the Zappos headquarters. Many of the buildings and outside areas are strategically designed to spark connections from movement to “encourage serendipity.” The inspiration for manufacturing serendipity came when Hsieh was reflecting back on his life. He discovered that many of the most serendipitous events in his life came without planning. They occurred when he had given himself exposure to serendipity through activities and chance meetings.⁠ The meaning in his life often came when he was moving and had given himself exposure to new things.

The second story comes from Chris Sacca, who, at the age of 25, was in debt for $2.1 million, in his own name.⁠ How he got there is an entirely different story, but the amazing part was that he did not declare bankruptcy. He fought his way back to repay the debt. He did everything from voiceover gigs on Upwork to sneaking into networking events through the kitchen because he had no money to pay the fee at the door. Over the years, he continued to acquire skills, take on work, and chip away at his debt. He leveled up in his career as he went and became an executive at Speedera Networks (acquired by Akamai Technologies), and then went on to become the Head of Special Initiatives at Google. He never stopped moving or searching for places where he could have exposure to the greatest upside possible. At Google, all of his movements exposed him to landing equity in the company, which eventually allowed him the ability to pay off his debts. After that, Sacca took his movement and exposure equation into angel investing. His venture capital firm, Lowercase Capital, has invested in dozens of companies and owns large stakes in Twitter and Uber.⁠ Sacca went from negative $2.1 million to over $1 billion of net worth. That relentless movement and exposure to upside (good things) led him to build a heroic (and mission-driven) life story to reflect on.

One of my favorite quotes from Sacca is in regard to the types of founders and CEOs who actually innovate.
> “…it’s the people who know to turn off the switch and go outside… it makes for well-rounded people, and ideas come from those people… its people who have balanced relationships that come up with the cool stuff.”⁠

So often we conceptualize CEOs as people who are hard-chargers. We mistakenly think it is the 100-hour-work-weeks which produce the innovations we laud. In reality, these types usually burn out early. They destroy their bodies and minds and poison their relationships.

We can always give ourselves exposure, meaning, and a rewarding life story by getting out and getting in motion. It’s when we’re out paddle-boarding with our spouse that we have a chance to find our mission. It’s when we’re skydiving with a friend that we’ll create a memory we’ll have forever.

It’s not the 14-hour days of work that help us find our mission. We can’t find our mission when we’re sedentary, watching the same television shows everyone else is watching. If that’s all we do, we’ll end up looking back in frustration and wonder why we don’t have more meaningful memories.

When we undertake activities and new experiences that add positive memories (and endorphins) into our relationships, the quality of our relationships skyrockets. By keeping this balance, we effectively give our relationships the best chance to thrive over the long term.

Now, let’s jump into the strategy and action section where we’ll cover more ideas for movement, activities, and exposure that will help us find our mission.

![](0*IgjuxLjaNPzLlSa_)
> # “The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.” –Confucius
> “It’s not a failure if you have to resort to Plan B. Or even Plan Z. You will be stronger, happier, the people around you will benefit, and society will benefit from having toughened you up for what you now deliver to it. It’s the BEGINNING of success when you start having multiple plans.” –James Altucher

## Fridge Lists and Advertising to Yourself

I was thinking of calling this strategy and action section, “Awesome Activities That Accelerate and Engineer Moments of Meaning,” but that’s just ridiculous. A much better label for the lists that appear below is “Fridge Lists.”

This highly technical term refers to the fact that these lists are best utilized when they’re literally written on paper and stuck to the refrigerator. They stare us in the face several times a day and remind us to stay in motion. The happiest people I know are (almost) always in motion. They inject meaning into their relationships and lives though activities that pump out endorphins.

Some of the things my wife and I have on our Fridge List of activities include these categories: Events, Conferences, Meet-ups, Learn, Adventures, and Travel Ideas.

Are many of the ideas listed below simple? You bet. But are they simple to do? No, of course not. Otherwise, everyone would have meaningful relationships. Getting moving is the hard part. It’s easy once we’re going. Below are some ideas on how to build a Fridge List.

## Events, Conferences, and Meet-ups:

* What conferences are coming up which you’re interested in? Many of the big technology companies you might want to work for have conferences all the time, and they’re a blast. Go to them.

* Find people with similar hobbies in your area by attending a meet-up. [www.meetups.com](http://www.meetups.com/)

* Speaking events and book signings. Are any coming up which you’re excited about?

* Comedy tours (Find a local spot and go.)

* Plays. Whether they are Broadway, local, or murder mystery dinners, get out and experience more in-person experiences that make you laugh and think.

* Find Co-Founders who you can build projects (and maybe even a business) with. You can try meeting entrepreneurial types at a local meet-up, or maybe try a site like [CoFoundersLab.com](http://cofounderslab.com/).

* Concerts. We start with a list of the ones each of us want to attend, and then narrow our way down to the most mutually agreeable ones. I’ve found the best way to ensure we actually go is to buy tickets whenever we’re excited and have agreed on a specific concert. That way, we can’t back out.

### A subsection of this list is the “Learn” list:

This is a list of areas that we want to learn more about.

* Paint

* Yoga

* Design/Coding. I’m a designer, and my wife is learning to code. This is one example of two synergistic skills you can learn with a friend or partner. Because each of you have two sides of skills that fit perfectly together, you can create more easily together.

Maybe for you it’s learning a language, a musical instrument, crafts, or how to garden, fix cars, or do home repairs. Whatever it is, learning something new stimulates the brain and widens exposure.

## Physical Adventures:

* Take a drone out and film/practice flying. Record with a GoPro and tinker.

* Local gym classes: Cycle, Bikram Yoga, Battle Ropes, etc.

* Hikes (We list specific ones in our area and new ones we want to explore.)

* Paddle Boarding

* Kite Surfing

* Dance Class (Massive, massive points were scored with the spouse for this one.)

* Trampoline Indoor Arena

* Tandem Skydiving

## Travel Ideas:

* These can be longer day trips, mini-vacations, or even month-long sabbaticals.

* Cross-country trip to explore new cities

* Snowboarding trip (Airbnb rooms for cheaper travel)

* State parks

* Highly rated Trip Advisor places you want to go

* Camping group trips (Group trips are a great way to save a bunch of money and hang out with select groups of people.)

Most people willingly allow themselves to be bombarded by advertisements all day long. Why not change it up and advertise to ourselves? Fridge Lists help direct and target advertisements to ourselves to create outcomes we want. Lists all over the fridge are great places to plaster advertisements, reminders, and ideas to reduce the friction required to get moving.

Also, when we’re in the process of finding new friends or building new relationships, having fun and interesting events already listed and ready to go makes building relationships easier. These types of activities and movement are much healthier than the usual happy hours. There are fewer barriers to connecting in a meaningful way if we can quickly glance at these lists on our fridge and send a text message or email that says:

*“Hey, (event, meet-up, activity) is coming up on the (date) — you want to go?”*

## The Challenge

The challenge is to force ourselves to move even when we don’t feel like it. We can make it easier by scheduling things before we’re ready and cutting off our ability to back out or get a refund.

The more we can build our relationships with meaningful memories, the less likely it is that future experiences will break us apart. This also helps create the type of relationships that always grow, instead of slowly stagnating. We’ll never be at a place where we start a business, do great work, or win a mission-driven life story, until we build up the habit of always moving.

# The Secret To How This Athletic Trainer Helps Clients Achieve Every Goal They Set Out To Accomplish

## The Secret To How This Athletic Trainer Helps Clients Achieve Every Goal They Set Out To Accomplish

### Three lessons which—if applied in your own life—might just make the difference between excellence and apathy.

***By [Jack Martin](https://twitter.com/Mr_JackMartin), staff writer***

Have you ever had to let go of your dreams due to circumstances beyond your control?

Hopefully not—it’s a terrible experience. Just ask Dale Rodick: former collegiate student-athlete turned personal trainer, who had to give up his dream of playing professional football because of a head injury.

“That final concussion left me with a decision I never thought I’d have to make: stop playing for my own safety, or risk worsening the permanent damage that’s already been done to pursue my lifelong dream,” said Rodick.
> # *“I felt like I had something taken away from me,” he said in a heartbroken tone.*

In a way, he kind of did. He had been working his entire life toward one goal: play football professionally. But after weeks of nauseousness and constant headaches, he knew he had to hang up his cleats for good. Which ultimately meant he no longer had anything to work toward.

“After being depressed for a good three months, I realized I was missing something,” said Dale, thinking back over a year ago. At the end of the day, it wasn’t so much the sport of football that he missed, but some of the things that came along with it-the camaraderie, the discipline, the feeling of achievement after surpassing your workout goals.

## But most of all, he missed the aspect of goal-setting—and working towards something positive.

That’s when he decided he wanted to be a trainer.

“Football taught me so many valuable lessons about goal-achievement—I figured I could put those lessons to use as a personal trainer.”

That was less than a year ago. Since, Dale became certified as an athletic trainer and is currently pursuing his master’s. He has trained dozens of high-level athletes and dozens of non-athletes looking to get into shape.

He told me he wants to work with people who are serious about achieving their goals. “Whether it’s someone wanting to get in shape for summer or a high school athlete working to get a sports scholarship somewhere, I want to work with people who are committed,” he “That’s how I was as a player, and the types of people I work best with.”

In the past six months, Dale has helped dozens of clients hit goal-after-goal, and continues to help people exceed their expectations. One of his clients, Jett Elad, received multiple D1 offers for football and is expected to be an impact player next fall at Ohio University.

He’s been able to excel as a trainer — mastering this science of helping people achieve their goals — thanks to the lessons he learned as an athlete, those intangibles he still carries with him and brings to his work.

Here are three of those lessons he considers most influential, and which, if applied in your own life, might just make the difference between excellence and apathy.

## 1. “You need to be self-disciplined.”

Regardless of who you are, where you’re from, or the opportunities that are presented to you, you cannot and will not achieve your goals without self-discipline.

If your goal is to become an 89% free-throw shooter, or to become a scratch golfer, you need to practice on a daily basis. Whether it’s shooting hoops in an open gym or practicing your form in your living room, you need to have intention, and set aside time to work toward that goal constantly. Even when you’ve got a tight schedule, or feel under the weather, you need to have the discipline to show up, and give your best effort.

“Self-discipline comes down to choices,” Dale tells his clients.

“You can either show up to the gym like you said you would, or make an excuse to reschedule. How you prioritize says everything about your discipline, and about your want to achieve your goals.”

## 2. “You must define your motivation.”

Defining your motivation is crucial to your success in achieving your goals.

“Right now, my motivation is my wedding,” Dale told me. He’s getting married in early June. “That’s why I’m getting my masters and working three jobs. Every morning I wake up and attack the day regardless of how tired I am because I have that as a constant reminder.”

Whenever Dale lands a new client, the first question he asks after asking what their goals are, is “why?” If you don’t know what your “why” is, you need to take the time to define it. If not, being self-disciplined towards your goals becomes that much harder-you’ll be more inclined to take the easy route without having that motivator.

You need to define your motivation in order to stay enthusiastic-and ultimately, to justify- whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish.

## 3. “You have to have an undying work-ethic.”

Work ethic and self-discipline aren’t the same thing—but they do work hand-in-hand.

“Self-discipline is showing up,” Dale explained. “But you’re not going to lose ten pounds because you went to the gym every day for six weeks. Shedding that weight comes down to how hard you push yourself when you’re there.”

According to Dale, this is the most important aspect of goal-achievement. Without a willingness to push yourself past a level you’re comfortable with, you’re not going to see any exceptional results.

“Use your motivation to fuel your work ethic,” says Dale. “The more you remind yourself of what you’re trying to accomplish the easier it’s going to be to push yourself.”

# Holding Back Your Emotions Is Not Helpful — Let Them Out.

## Image Credit: Unsplash/Bruce Dixon

Another day, another funeral. Yesterday I lost somebody close to me and had to say goodbye.

I was determined to get through it without any tears to show my family that I could be strong. It almost worked — until it didn’t. I made it to the end of the service and then it was time to carry the coffin to the hearse.
> # As soon as I took the handles of that coffin in front of the audience, tears came pouring out. My plan to hold back my emotions was down the toilet.

Everybody saw me cry even though I tried not to.

There are times in our lives where sad things happen and we are forced to deal with them.

## The answer is not to hold back emotion.

Crying at a funeral is how you grieve and pretending to be strong when you’re sad is never the answer.

**Emotions exist to propel us forward and help us take actions.**

![Image Credit: [Deposit Photos](https://depositphotos.com/vector-images/hypocrisy.html)](1*MGzAenfGFEJatz6V5CD5yQ.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Deposit Photos](https://depositphotos.com/vector-images/hypocrisy.html)*

The family member I buried never got married until very late in life. She never had any kids and regretted that a lot. Through feeling the emotion of those regrets and mourning her loss, it helped me to make some decisions that would lead me to take action. Emotions are such good motivation.
> Holding your emotions back prevents you from making those life-changing decisions that end up shaping your life.

We need emotion. Emotions are like oxygen and we have to acknowledge them.

## Holding back emotions leads to abuse.

Many of the emotions I never dealt with as a young twenty-year-old were suppressed by temptations like alcohol.

Holding back your emotions is hard. It takes real work to stop yourself from feeling negative emotions in particular. That’s why we abuse alcohol, overeat and spend money on things we don’t need.

Holding back emotions is doing more damage than you think.

Letting some tears out yesterday was exactly what I needed. I’m going to miss this family member an awful lot. Life without them already feels empty, but there’s nothing I can do to change that. My family member would want me to carry on with life and feel the emotion of every high and every low. They wouldn’t want me drowning in regrets and numbing my emotions.

## In the emotion, is the answer.

We all reach times in our life where we don’t know what the next action is that we should take. *Do we get married? Do we start a business? Do we change career?*
> # Many of the answers we seek are found in between the emotions we have to feel in order to take action.

![Image Credit: [Sebastian Eriksson](http://sebmaestro.deviantart.com/)](1*VYxxkP-0tNwIcTb6ftdzeQ.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Sebastian Eriksson](http://sebmaestro.deviantart.com/)*

Embrace the sadness. 
Let some tears out. 
Feel the joy of achieving a goal. 
Let the regret of not doing something set in for a bit.

Your emotions are a good guide of what you need to do next. Based on how you feel, you can get good at fine-tuning your body to use your emotions a bit like a compass. They don’t give you the exact coordinates, but they’ll at least point you in the right direction.

I recently left finance after seven years because I refused to hold back my emotions. I knew I needed a change and wasn’t inspiring enough people, and so I went on an emotional nine-month journey to find something else.

I did the same the year before when I went on fifty plus dates to find the woman of my dreams. I stopped holding back my emotions and started getting real with myself about how lonely I was feeling at the time.

In both of these situations, not holding back my emotions led to me finding the answers for myself. I used both the positive and negative emotions to give me the motivation I needed on days when it all seemed too hard.

## Men struggle with this the most.

By nature, many men fall for the lie that they always have to show strength thus never letting their emotions (like tears) out.

Men need to hear this message (and so do women).

*It’s okay to cry. 
It’s okay to not always be up.
It’s okay to have a bad day.*

Strength is actually found in letting your emotions out. **People that express their emotions do what many are not prepared to do and that’s the real sign of strength.**

If all our problems are the same (which I believe they are) then letting out emotions is natural for all of us to do. You can’t fool us with Instagram selfies anymore.

You have rough days.
I have rough days.

It’s okay to let your emotions out.

# 3 Habits Ruining Your Focus And Relationships

## 

Whenever I walk into a library, something clicks in my brain.

The sight of an unmistakable banker’s desk lamp with a green glass shade primes me to focus and concentrate.

And I’m sure that’s the result of about a decade’s worth of higher education. Thousands of hours in the quiet section of the library have taught my brain to associate that environment with study and concentration.

The interesting thing is, modern technology has a similar effect on us. But instead of priming our brains for focus, we’re being taught to seek instant satisfaction and stay distracted.
> # Our habits are becoming less aligned with some of the most important [goals we want to accomplish](https://artplusmarketing.com/how-to-accomplish-goals-when-you-have-no-idea-where-to-start-cffcf2040467).

That misalignment can lead to plenty of problems in our personal and work life — and in our relationships. Modern habits have created ways of working and living that feel more convenient but are robbing us of the ability to concentrate.

And that lifestyle is epitomized by these three habits:

## **1. Not eating your broccoli.**

Most people don’t want to immediately start the day by working on their toughest tasks.

Those difficult conversations (the tough-to-swallow foods) are put off as long as possible. Instead, we answer emails, go to meetings, jump on conference calls, or text colleagues.

It all feels like a lot of work. Realistically, it’s not hard work — it’s communication.

### When you spend large portions of your day on easily repeatable activities, you’re wasting time that could be used for your most difficult challenges.

But you’ve been programmed to respond to the stimuli of messages, alerts, and vibrations, which means if you want to break out of this cycle, you have to structure a proper working environment.

You may need to do something radical to accomplish this. For example, I’m always tired by the time I get home from work and most prone to let my guard down. If I even start looking at Twitter or LinkedIn, in that weakened state, I will veg with it for hours.

The thing is, I would rather be doing something meaningful or spending this time with my kids.

So, I’ve learned the only way I can avoid that trap is with exercise. I force myself to immediately change clothes and go for a run or spend 45 minutes on the Peloton bike. Exercise is a potent drug, and afterward, any craving for electronics is gone. I’m refreshed and can focus on what I want to spend time doing.

You may need a less extreme habit, but you’re going to have to put the time in to figure out what works for you.

## **2. Failing to see the larger picture of your life.**

Your current self is only concerned with the present moment.

Skipping a workout, attending a happy hour, waiting until next week to call a friend — these are all things your current self usually prefers to do.

Of course, whether you’re trying to lose weight or [maintain friendships](https://medium.com/the-mission/to-make-business-friendships-work-follow-these-3-unspoken-rules-42276bf1c04), what you’d rather do in the moment is often the direct counter to your stated goals.

To help see the larger picture you’re working toward, make friends with your future self. You can even create a Photoshopped older version of yourself as a reminder that there’s a future self you need to take care of.

### However, developing a strong vision of your future requires an ability to pause.

Slow things down. Start by getting a glass of wine, along with a tabloid-sized piece of paper, and spending a few hours mapping out what you want to get done in the years ahead.

If you’re not one to slow down, you’ll have to carefully orchestrate your environment instead. Find a few activities that force you into a reflective state, like housework or mowing the lawn.

I learned the benefit of this last fall when a baseball broke the front windshield of my car. Something happened to the electrical system, and the car couldn’t hold a charge for very long. Each day, I would have to jump it at least once.

For a couple of months, I didn’t fix it.

That dysfluency slowed me down and forced me to test what I was doing. I couldn’t just run out the door and immediately take off, so my routine required a different type of planning and revisiting basic assumptions.

In the same way, orchestrating your environment in certain ways can force you to automatically refect long term.

## **3. Communicating in an ad hoc manner.**

We live in a world full of cheap communication.

What does it cost you to send a text message? To fire off a few emails? Essentially nothing, if we’re talking about money.

The truth is, there’s a hidden cost to our ability to instantly communicate. The price we pay comes in the form of an overwhelming amount of poorly thought out and unnecessary communication.

### There are few situations that require continuous ad hoc communications.

When I was a young physician in residency, I bought a cell phone. These phones were just appearing, and I kept it in the glove compartment of my car for patient emergencies. If necessary, I could call from the car to help with a life-threatening situation — even in a traffic jam.

But in those three years of medical residency, I only remember one time when I pulled over, plugged in the phone, and called the hospital. It showed me that introducing even the tiniest amount of friction dramatically changes the amount of communication.

Unfortunately, that friction is largely ignored today. Everything slows down when we constantly send messages back and forth with little purpose. Large projects take more time because each person has to sift through a cascade of messages, some of which hold important information, others that contain nothing useful. There are real costs to coordination.
> # When contacting someone feels effortless, people tend to put less effort into it.

And this is just as true for personal relationships as it is in the business world. A friend who may have received a birthday card decades ago now gets a “happy bday!” post on Facebook. Texting, while more convenient for us, is an inefficient and impersonal means of communication.

Just remember, you don’t have to work or live like this. Responding with a “thumbs up” to a friend, or sending out information one piece at a time, rather than in a comprehensive document, is a choice.

Structuring your days and weeks to communicate effectively requires more effort than taking things as they come. That’s true. But you’ll be rewarded with a greater sense of control over your life. Feeling focused, sharp, and productive is enormously satisfying, as is making time for someone you care about.

In the end, all these bad habits really come down to a lack of structure and an overreliance on technology to make life more convenient.

At some point, you have to turn your phone on “Do not disturb” and get busy building the life you want.

# To Make Better Decisions, Don’t Confuse Difficulty With Urgency

## Photo by Patrick Schneider on Unsplash

Decisions shape important outcomes, for better or worse.

They are the most basic building blocks of life.

[Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky](https://amzn.to/2QOTBHt), and other experts have clarified the specific ways in which decision makers are likely to be biased.

No amount of deliberation can ever guarantee that you have identified the “right” option.
> *The purpose of a decision is not to find the perfect option but get you an optimal choice that can help you get to the next one.*

## Don’t confuse difficulty with urgency

When you are overwhelmed by the urgency, magnitude, and complexity of a choice, you are likely to procrastinate or rush through it.

A smarter approach for making difficult decisions is to break down the process into manageable steps that you can tackle over time.

Before you rush to make a call on a tough issue, gather the facts (for and against your current assumptions), give yourself time to think through your options (process what you’ve found), and then make the call.

“In the end, if you don’t give yourself the time *you* feel you need to make a judgment or choice, you will undermine your satisfaction and your subsequent experience. You will regret you decision, even when it is completely unwarranted, [writes](https://www.fastcompany.com/1758386/quick-decisions-create-regret-even-when-they-are-good-decisions) Heidi Halvorson is a motivational psychologist and author of [*No One Understands You, and What To Do About It](https://amzn.to/2DjevvQ)*

Don’t panic in times of crisis, or when you think your career, life or business is on the line. Keep calm and think through your options.

For many people though, impulsive decisions stem simply from getting caught up in what they want right now without thinking ahead, never thinking about the potential consequences or the long-term impact.

## Take an outsider’s perspective

Many judgment errors can be eliminated simply by broadening your frame of reference.

The quickest, easiest, most effective way to do this is by involving someone who thinks very differently from you.

It’s amazing how many poor decisions can be avoided simply by asking one other person for their opinion.

A fresh perspective changes everything.

An impressive amount of [empirical research](http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~kmilkman/PPS_2009.pdf) backs up his observation.

Taking an out- sider’s perspective has been shown to reduce decision makers’ overconfidence about their knowledge (Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, & Kleinbölting, 1991)

Decision makers may also be able to improve their judgments by asking a genuine outsider for his or her view regarding the decision.

Searching for evidence that could prove you wrong is a painful process but it works.

If you’re wrestling with a difficult decision, consult a friend or colleague who’s been in your situation before.

Their insight will likely be significantly more valuable than almost any research.

## Choice overload is a trap

Too many choices exhaust us.

And when you have too many scenarios to consider, you are likely to abscond from making a decision altogether.

Researcher [Barry Schwartz](http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/bschwar1/SchwartzCulture.pdf) calls this “choice overload.” We tend to avoid making important decisions when we have too many choices.

“As the number of options increases, the costs, in time and effort, of gathering the information needed to make a good choice also increase,” writes Schwartz.

“The level of certainty people have about their choice decreases. And the anticipation that they will regret their choice increases,” says Schwartz.

When you reach that level of stress in a decision-making process, you procrastinate, overthink and delay important decisions.

Jane Porter of Fast Company explains, “Given the endless options of which route to take, we can sometimes end up going with the more conventional path simply because it’s the easier way to go.”

By all means, consider all your options, but narrow your most important options to help you make a better choice in the future.

A study from [New York University](http://web-docs.stern.nyu.edu/pa/sellier_dahl_creative_success.pdf) found that “restricting the choice of creative inputs actually enhances creativity.”

## Embrace the OODA loop

Military pilots are known to rely on the OODA cycle/loop (*observe, orient, decide and act*) when making decisions.

The **OODA loop** was developed by military strategist and United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd. Boyd applied the concept to the combat operations process, often at the operational level during military campaigns.

There is no rush.

But every step is calculated based on careful observation.

The OODA loop has become an important concept in litigation, business, law enforcement, and military strategy.

Consider a fighter pilot being scrambled to shoot down an enemy aircraft.

*The pilot **decides** to “get into the sun” above his opponent, and **acts** by applying control inputs to climb. Back to **observation** — is the attacker reacting to the change of altitude? Then comes **orient**: Is the enemy reacting characteristically, or perhaps acting like a noncombatant? Is his plane exhibiting better-than-expected performance?*

*As the combat begins, little time is devoted to orienting unless some new information pertaining to the actual identity or intent of the attacker comes into play. Information cascades in real time, and the pilot does not have time to process it consciously; the pilot reacts as he is trained to, and conscious thought is directed to supervising the flow of action and reaction, continuously repeating the OODA cycle. Simultaneously, the opponent is going through the same cycle.*

Most of us are under enormous pressure to act quickly, to show that we’re doing something and in control, but it’s important to stop and think every now and then.

Inaction (for orientation purposes) is sometimes more important than quick execution. Decision-making is about more than appearing decisive.

It’s also about managing the context to achieve an optimal outcome.

In any decision-making process, the winner isn’t the one who reacts most quickly, but the one who decides how to act most effectively.

## Think in years, not days

Use the 10/10/10 rule.

“People who overweight the first-order consequences and ignore the effects that the second- and subsequent-order consequences will have on their goals, rarely reach their goals.” — Ray Dalio

Every decision has a impact on the next one.

Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger and many other known figures swear by the 10/10/10 strategy.

Ask yourself the following three questions:

1. How will I feel about it in 10 minutes?

1. How will I feel about it in 10 months?

1. How will I feel about it in 10 years?

Most of us are conditioned to respond as quickly as possible in many situations, however, it’s vital to consider the long-term consequences of your decisions.

Milton Friedman once said, “The best measure of quality thinking is your ability to predict the consequences of your ideas and subsequent actions.”

## Trust your gut “brain”

In the business worlds, you hear a lot of talk about intuition, “trusting your gut.” It’s less simple than you might think.

Professor William Duggan believes that there are [three different types of intuition](http://columbiapress.typepad.com/strategic_intuition/what-is-stra.html):

*Ordinary intuition is just a feeling, a gut instinct. Expert intuition is snap judgments, when you instantly recognize something familiar, the way a tennis pro knows where the ball will go from the arc and speed of the opponent’s racket… The third kind, strategic intuition, is not a vague feeling, like ordinary intuition. Strategic intuition is a clear thought… That flash of insight you had last night might solve a problem that’s been on your mind for a month.…Expert intuition is always fast, and it only works in familiar situations. Strategic intuition is always slow, and it works for new situations, which is when you need your best ideas.This difference is crucial, because expert intuition can be the enemy of strategic intuition. As you get better at your job, you recognize patterns that let you solve similar problems faster and faster. That’s expert intuition at work. In new situations your brain takes much longer to make enough new connections to find a good answer.*

*A flash of insight happens in only a moment, but it may take weeks for that moment to come. You can’t rush it. But your expert intuition might see something familiar and make a snap judgment too soon. The discipline of strategic intuition requires you recognize when a situation is new and turn off your expert intuition.You must disconnect the old dots, to let new ones connect on their own.*

Learn to trust your expert intuition (based on experience) when making choices about familiar problems.

## Build a decision-making system

“We don’t always have control over outcomes, but we do have control over our process,” says Amy Summerville, a psychology professor at Miami University.

Sometimes you don’t have the luxury of time to extensively consider all the different scenarios and options.

What you need in a situation like that is **a solid decision-making model.**

Medics, boxers, footballers, and firefighters think on their feet.

In the heat of the moment, they don’t have time for deviating thoughts.

The pressure of the moment forces their minds to focus on what needs to be done now.

They process information so quickly that “rapid cognition” — decisions that spring from hard thinking based on sound experience — can feel more instinctive than scientific.

If they make mistakes, they recover quickly.

These are two ways to build a better decision-making system:

### 1. Understand pattern recognition

Most of what we face each day is similar to other scenarios we have already experienced. By understanding this, it’s possible to quickly map a range of previous experiences and their outcomes.

Leverage those to arrive at the most viable decision…fast.

Over time, as you continue making decisions, your speed and quality will improve.

### 2. Use the 2 minutes rule

For most decisions, it’s much better to pick an option, and just move on, and the two-minute rule can help.

Give yourself a timer that helps you focus on the decision rather than having your mind wander and get distracted.

If you had two minutes to make a decision, how will you decide?

It doesn’t even have to be two minutes, necessarily, it just has to be a short amount of time, and you have to force yourself to pick a side by the time it runs out.

Use this approach if you suck at making small decisions fast (where to eat, which movie to watch, what to eat for dinner etc.).

With the pressure of a time limit, you’ll need to get to the heart of the matter faster and collect the pros and cons quickly, which you might not otherwise do.

### Key takeaway

The only way you’re going to get better at making smart and better decisions is by practicing making decisions every single day.

If you start making this part of your daily routine, you may feel more confident in your actions and decision-making skills.

It’ll take time and practice, but once you get the hang of it, you will make an informed decision in any situation.

# Do self-help books really work?

## Do self-help books really work?

Every year, I read over [40 books](https://www.timezillionaire.com/btp?utm_campaign=august31an&utm_medium=answer&utm_source=quora).

Sometimes, I wonder why. If you ask me to name all the books I read last year, I can probably name 10 (and some of them, I read every year).

Self-help books don’t work. Most of the time.

Here’s why.

## **#1 — Infocrastination.**

(I just made that up, I like it).

In 2016, I read two books about dating. I went on a few dates earlier that year and…let’s say I wasn’t too happy with the raw material. I clearly had to change my strategy.

When I closed the second book, I was pretty confused. I knew what I needed to do: take some action.

The first time I spoke to a girl in a café (during the day), my right leg was shaking so much, I looked like a tip tap dancer.

She said yes. I asked for her number. She said yes.

I hand over my oversized phone (still trembling). Success.

When I felt confused, it was tempting to read a third book.
Would that have got me a girl’s number? I doubt it.

Somehow, we think that reading a book about business will get you closer to being a business owner. Or that a book about dating psychology will make you an irresistible seducer. Reading more makes us feel accomplished.

But actually, whenever you read a self-help book, the work starts when you close the book, not when you open it. That’s why I like to have at least one takeaway from each book, so I can implement it straight away, and see whether it’s for me or not.

When you open another book instead, you are just procrastinating by seeking more information. Without action, you don’t need more information.

That’s infocrastination. Expecting the book to do the work for you.

Since there are around 1 million new books published every year, it’s easy to get lost down the rabbit hole.

Read. Action. Repeat.

## **#2 — Knowledge vs Experience**

Imagine reading a book on handwriting, and memorising every single letter and how each stroke is drawn. Without ever practicing.

Does this make you good at writing longhand? Or even able to?

Most of us learnt how to write by practicing. Someone showed us how to do it (the theory), and then through experience it became automatic. We’re so good, we can apply it to different materials and use different pens. But, though we do have a theoretical understanding of how to write, most of us can only do it with one hand.

**Theoretical** **knowledge** usually builds context, exposes you to new ideas, gives you a clear direction and specific examples of what you are learning. It’s a great way to learn from the experience of others, and direct and shortcut your own.

**Experience**, on the other hand, comes from blending theory with facts, events, and actions. It brings knowledge to a whole new level, making it flexible to problem solving and adaptable to different situations, which makes it more applicable and requiring less cognitive power.

![](0*4i2CCBaZfigedDZ8)

Theory helps you [shortcut experience](https://www.timezillionaire.com/information-overload/). Experience gives theory purpose.

## **#3–Too much information**

How many books did you read before learning how to walk? Or to ride a bicycle?

I’m going to have a wild guess: zero.

Learning how to walk is usually pretty messy.
Here’s the step by step:

1. Rock on your back for months.

1. Then learn to sit up.

1. Crawl on the floor while random adults make the *‘ooohh’* sounds of a house haunted by ghosts.

1. Finally, stand up and fall on the floor like a sack of potatoes. Usually with a loud thud.

1. After a while, you will find yourself walking.

1. Keep at it, and then you’ll be able to run.

Except, I left one step out: observe people that already walk, then copy them.
You could summarise the whole process in **three steps**: observe, practice, master.

![](0*agqpbPTk9-NhFH5c)

Reading books is **observe**. And that’s great.

But of the three steps, practice is where most people get stuck. Practice is messy. That’s where babies fall flat on their faces, and adults get discouraged, hurt, embarrassed.

So most people stay stuck in the first step. They keep observing. They read another book. Google another blog post. Send another question. All to avoid taking action.

Reading another book might make you feel like you are decreasing uncertainty and mitigating risk. But actually, it’s adding more information that needs to be actioned, increasing complexity. Eventually, you have so much to action it’s overwhelming.

So you’re stuck swimming in theory.

## **#4–Not knowing enough**

If you’re a serial learner, you know how difficult it is to choose.

First, **choose what you what to learn**.
Another book on launching a business? Or maybe you want to learn UX design.
What about a course on optimal nutrition? Mmmh, maybe I should learn about stoicism, since everyone talks about it so much.

Often, the default is not to choose.
Just say yes to all of them, leave the books on a shelf, open your Facebook timeline, and click on *“27 Pairs Of Leggings You Can Wear As Pants, Dammit”*.

Dammit indeed.

But let’s say you do choose. Let’s say you want to focus on marketing for two months and really understand what is it that your missing. Decisions, great!

You read one book about how to find your first 100 customers. It blows your mind. You want to know more! Why stop at 100?
So you pick up another book. You want to be an expert!
By the end of your third book, you’re confused. Though the three books have a lot in common, they’re also pretty discordant.
Should you start from Facebook ads? Should you create a landing page first? Are Messenger bots a fad or the future? What about social media? You’ve got to be on social media.

**You know more, but you feel like you know less.**

Because you appreciate how much information and how many options are available. Now you need to know more.

So you get another book, or binge-watch youtube, looking for the perfect answer. It must be somewhere.

The same story goes for nutrition and fitness. Or building an app. Or going on amazing dates.

The more you know, the more you realise you don’t know.

## **#5–Confusing information**

The self-help genre is often based on personal experience. On the author reverse-engineering whatever worked for them, and then sharing it with the world.

Amazing. Except, different authors have different principles, tactics, goals, strategies, lives…that’s when self-help books can give you confusing information.

The trick is to choose someone you really admire and trust. Then immerse yourself in one author’s material, and really understand how they got to the result you want to mirror. Then read something else from them. Go deep. Trust them fully.

That’s how you can actually learn from them and copy their results, not just their information.

## Reading vs Learning

Here are my 5 rules to make the most out reading (a lot).

1. Choose a theme around your books, so that you can go deep in a particular topic (but know when to stop)

1. Have at least one takeaway and one action from each book I read

1. If a book resonates, read your notes again at the end (bonus points — create a summary)

1. If a book resonates, read more from the same author.

1. If a book resonates, read it again while you take action, don’t look for new information

1. If a book doesn’t resonate, you don’t have to finish it

1. Read my foundational books once a year

If you’re not getting the results that you want, you’re either missing the right information, taking the wrong action, or not taking action at all.

Self-help books work. But only if you do.

# Why Creating a Shared Vision Matters

## “woman jumping on green mountains” by Peter Conlan on Unsplash

Gather ’round, children, it’s story time:

My first job was rough, very rough. Without divulging identifying details, I worked for a company that suffered from low morale, a lack of direction, and nobody who worked there got up in the morning thinking “what a great day to go to work!” Because of this environment, turnover was high and it was almost impossible to challenge the status quo.

Looking back on it now, I believe that experience could have been dramatically improved by one single thing: A shared vision.

Some people, when they hear the term “shared vision” think of some pretty poster on a wall in their break room, or a slogan that they are forced to chant at every corporate event, with little to no enthusiasm. They think of catchy jingles forced down employees’ collective throats by the shadowy, ubiquitous “management”.

What I’m referring to is something vastly different from that. A truly powerful vision can be, I believe, the catalyst for change, for growth and for success.

To begin, let’s get to some sort of working definition of what a shared vision should be, in a perfect world. Simply put, vision is the boiled-down essence of you, (yes, a personal vision is something I believe in) your company or organization, hitched to a long-term, definitive goal. Your company is the horse, and your goal is the cart, in this analogy. How would you describe your horse? Is it brown or black, is it old or young, large or small? So, when you think of a vision statement, how would you describe your company? These questions form the first part of your vision statement.

The second part, the “cart” of our horse-and-cart vision statement, is a long-term, definitive goal. This is not a goal like “make more money.” or “save the world.” The first example is not a real goal at all, since a good company’s primary mission should never be about their own bottom line. The second example is nebulous and vague. It’s too broad and too ill-defined.

That being said, a definitive goal, and the boiled-down essence of your organization form the backbone of any good vision statement, and they do so regardless of the type of company or market in which you’re engaged.

But I still haven’t addressed the central question of this post: WHY do vision statements matter? What good do they do? In my opening story, how could a shared vision, expressed clearly, have improved that company?

Well, I believe vision statements perform four key duties in any company, regardless of size or scope.

First, a great vision statement serves as a yardstick. You can and should be able to measure success or failure of your company by your vision statement. If not, it may be that you need to draft a more applicable vision statement.

Second, a great vision statement refreshes your mindset about your work. You can use a properly applied vision statement as a compass to check your daily tasks and determine if the work you are doing is moving you and your company closer to achieving your vision, or farther away.

Third, a great vision statement is an interpreter. A software engineer working deep in a laboratory on highly complex computer problems might struggle to answer the question “What do you do for a living?” but a software engineer working for a company that wholly buys into its own vision statement can connect his work to the grander scheme of the company as a whole. Just as no company should be about its own bottom line, so no employee should feel that the work they do exists in a vacuum.

Finally, a great vision statement promotes workplace unity and high morale. When we all feel like we’re part of some great, interconnected whole, we thrive. Again, nobody should feel like they exist in a vacuum. They should be able to anchor themselves to the company and feel a part of the whole.

To conclude then, a vision statement is an essential ingredient in any company seeking to grow and to succeed. Without one, it becomes far to easy to become entrenched in the processes, it becomes far to hard to challenge the status quo. “This is the way we’ve always done it.” becomes a rallying cry for the people who refuse to get out of their comfort zone and do new things. Let’s avoid that trap of complacency by holding every action, every task, up to the lens of a fantastic vision statement; one that empowers, and promotes energy and dynamic thought in our organizations!

# 6 Qualities Mindful People Enjoy That Mindless People Don’t

## 

Mindfulness, as hot a topic as it is, is also an oft-misunderstood concept. Many confuse being mindful with being meditative, but you don’t have to become a dedicated yogi to enjoy the professional and personal benefits of a more mindful existence.

It’s not about being new-agey or trendy. Mindfulness is a tactic you can employ to improve your performance at work, your health and [your overall wellbeing](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/can-money-buy-happiness-experts-say-maybe-infographic.html).

This is especially important at work and in business, as we go about the often mundane and repetitive tasks required to do our jobs. See, when we’re doing something new and crazy and cool, like traveling a new area of the world or playing a sport we’ve never tried before, we pay close attention. We take it all in. We savor every detail.

We’re mindful.

When we think we already know everything there is to know about the task at hand, that’s when we start to get a bit mindless about it. We don’t pay as much attention. Our brain wanders off. We’re just not as careful.

And every time we get lazy and mindless, we’re missing out on an [opportunity to be awesome](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/adopt-these-24-daily-habits-to-make-yourself-smarter-infographic.html).

This is especially true when we’re tasked with doing something we don’t like very much, as proven by mindfulness researcher Ellen Langer. She and her colleagues found many years ago that people who were asked to do tasks they disliked actually gained a greater appreciation for the activity when they were asked to be mindful and take notice of new things about it.

In a recent [*Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/2016/01/mindfulness-isnt-much-harder-than-mindlessness) *article, Langer identified several qualities mindful people enjoy more than those who go about their tasks mindlessly:

**1. Productivity**

**2. Innovation**

**3. Attractiveness**

**4. Superior work output**

**5. Authenticity**

**6. Trustworthiness**

Those are pretty awesome and impactful outcomes for simply slowing down, focusing your energy, and being more mindful about the work you’re accomplishing!

So how can you make 2016 your best year yet? Adopt some of the positive habits of super mindful people.

Cut back on the destructive tendency to multitask and [focus your efforts](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/11-best-productivity-hacks-for-2016.html) instead. [Take a personal inventory](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/12-tips-for-silencing-the-bad-self-esteem-demon-on-your-shoulder.html) and identify the awesome things about yourself that make you unique and great at what you do. Then, [work these simple mindfulness hacks into your daily routine](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/12-mindfulness-hacks-you-can-use-in-24-hours.html), beginning with a more mindful morning routine and wrapping up each day with a guided meditation to help you power down before bed.

## “Wide angle shot of a war veteran cemetery filled with white crosses.” by Neil Thomas on Unsplash

### D-Day.

Me and June 6th seem to meet each other in funny ways. As a military history geek, I remember reading excerpts from Cornelius Ryan’s incredible book [“The Longest Day”](https://www.amazon.com/Longest-Day-Classic-Epic-D-Day/dp/0671890913/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1528394897&sr=1-1&keywords=cornelius+ryan+the+longest+day) when I was in junior high school. That was probably my first real exposure to military history as told from the point of view of the people who lived it, rather than dry, prosaic facts and figures.

Then, I became a logistics readiness officer and D-Day became a classroom study, a textbook example of the good, the bad and the ugly of 20th century military logistics. I can rattle off the numbers: 153,000 troops landed, 650 warships, more than 10,400 airplanes all working in (somewhat) solid harmony to effect the greatest amphibious assault in human history.

Then, I “met” Harvey.

I say that in quotes because I’ve never actually met him. He passed away years ago. But, in the hearts of his family, he lives on. Harvey was at Normandy in 1944. He operated one of the transport craft that landed American heroes on the most heavily defended mile of sand on the planet. Harvey was a hero. He was an uncommon man.

But his legacy was not solely captured by the medals he earned, or the history he lived, or even the lives he saved that day. Like so many others of that generation, after the bullets had stopped flying, and the bombs had stopped dropping, and the world was again at peace, Harvey returned home and resumed his life. He married, had kids, grew old, and passed away nearly fourteen years ago.

Today, Harvey’s tombstone is surrounded by his fellow comrades, from D-Day to Fallujah. One of his closest “neighbors” is a guy a few years older than me, who died in Afghanistan in the earliest days of Operation Enduring Freedom. He is in good company.

And so, on the 74th anniversary of D-Day, I want to thank those who have introduced me to Harvey, my wife’s grandfather. I want to thank them for telling me his stories, for showing me his medals and memorabilia, and most of all for sharing with me stories of a good man, a loving daddy and grandpa, and a truly great person who, though I’ve never met him, I look up to.

# The Top Concern for American Workers — and How Businesses Can Help

## Paying It Forward: Inclusive Organizations Boost Employee Financial Health

![](1*JWc-oXMW4GSfqtLcDxVydg.jpeg)

Money is a necessary concern for all businesses, of course, but it also creates the [most stress for workers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellevate/2017/09/07/what-employees-financial-unwellness-is-costing-their-companies/#71b1288555f9) and affects morale and the bottom line.

More companies are seeing this financial strain on employees — and on their businesses’ bottom lines through missed work days or employee resignations. Companies seeking to maintain a strong team are turning to innovative, effective programs, such as [Income Advance](http://go.pardot.com/e/39792/2018-10-19/8mf9m4/1103859541), to help workers facing financial challenges like unexpected expenses or income volatility. By helping their workers build a strong financial foundation, employers create a more unified and productive workplace, a stronger business and a more equitable economy for everyone.

Here are two examples of Certified B Corporations providing programs that help workers improve their financial knowledge and fiscal situation.

## ‘Our Most Valuable Asset’

About 10 years ago, Ted Castle, Rhino Foods’ founder and CEO, realized that small financial surprises could create big problems for employees who live paycheck to paycheck — and could cause them to miss part or all of their work day.

“We were losing some of our best people,” Castle says. “So we decided to do something about it. It’s one thing to hang a sign on the wall saying, ‘Our employees are our most valuable asset’; it’s another to prove it by supporting them with innovative solutions.”

Castle and others at Rhino Foods — a Certified B Corporation since 2013 — worked with North Country Federal Credit Union and the United Way of Northwest Vermont to develop the Rhino Foods [Income Advance Program](https://bthechange.com/creating-financial-stability-how-to-really-help-american-workers-cc13ccc28e24). Through the program, employees can apply for loans of up to $1,000 from their credit union. Typically they get the money they need immediately and pay off their loans in small, weekly payroll deductions.

Employees build a credit history in the process, and once the loan is paid off they can continue to have the automatic deductions go into a savings account. Rhino Foods requires employees to opt out of the automatic deduction program — encouraging them to continue — and so far 97 percent of employees have continued to save.

## Springing Forward

B Corp Spring Bank not only set its own goals as a 2018 Inclusive Economy Challenge participant, it also helped other businesses achieve theirs as a financial services partner.

With its headquarters in the South Bronx, [Spring Bank](https://springbankny.com/) focuses on serving underserved consumers and small businesses in the New York City area to help them break debt cycles and build wealth. Since opening in 2007, the bank has added a branch in Harlem and became a [Community Development Financial Institution](https://www.occ.gov/topics/community-affairs/resource-directories/cd-bank-and-financial-institution/index-cd-bank-and-financial-institution.html), a designation that recognizes its investments and loans in low- and moderate-income communities.

About two years ago, Spring Bank began partnering with businesses to offer its [Employee Opportunity Loan](https://springbankny.com/happy-employees-vibrant-productive-workplaces/) program. The program provides loans to employees at participating companies of up to $2,500 with no minimum credit score requirement as alternative to payday loans and other high-interest financial options. Spring Bank is on pace to make its 1,000th loan in the program this year.

The loan program is free for employers, says Melanie Stern, director of consumer lending for Spring Bank, and it’s automated so employees can complete the loan process on a computer or phone. Employers do not have to be a B Corp to participate.

# Focusing on the Time You Have, Not How Much You Have

## 

As I sit here writing, this my brother is on a respirator in a hospital room. He hasn’t been able to breathe completely on his own or wake up fully in three days. His wife sits, sleeps, and prays by his side. My parents do the same.

Family members and friends have poured in to see him over the past three days. He is loved because he has loved. We are broken because he is broken. We have hope because he has hope.

Gabe is not just my brother. He is my best friend. My best man at my wedding.

He’s also my hero, for reasons most won’t be able to understand.

Ten days ago Gabe and his wife, Kristen, headed home from the hospital. We’d be given news that over 50% of his liver was now compromised by the cancer that was in his body. His lungs had collapsed weeks before due to cancer in his chest. He hadn’t been able to walk since June 12th due to cancer in his leg and along his spine. He had three surgeries to get rid of necrotizing fasciitis, and a wound to show his battle.

The day they broke this news, Gabe and Kristen brought us all into the hospital room. He told each one of us he loved us, then asked what we were getting for lunch! He was hungry for food and to be with all of us. Their faith filled the room with peace.

They arrived back at my parents’ house on August 16th, Gabe’s 33rd birthday. We celebrated, sang, and ate together as my brother smiled, happy to be home. Many people were able to come and hang out with Gabe (he’s got a lot of friends and family!) over the next few days.

Everyone wants more time with Gabe, we all say there is not enough of it. Yet, my brother has shown from a very young age that it is how you spend that time that counts.

If you don’t know Gabe you may not realize that he has had to live his entire life NF1. As a child, Gabe was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis, where tumors were attached to his nerve endings on the inside and outside of his body. He grew up getting MRI’s, chemo, and surgeries on his eyes and his spine. He spent an entire year as an adolescent taking interferon treatments every day to slow the growth of these tumors.

Despite growing up in hospitals, Gabe’s passion for life was always present with friends and family. He was the kid that could have done anything with his Make-A-Wish opportunity, and he decided to take his entire family on a vacation.

Flash forward 10 years later. Gabe had started a business, was working full-time and had met this amazing girl (more on that later!). No one expected his next big diagnosis to be cancer.

When Gabe started this journey, Kristen was his girlfriend and soon to be fiance. They quickly got married and began the journey of surgery and chemo against cancer together. Their love story is a unique one (but if you know either of them, it also fits perfectly!). Their paths crossed many many MANY times over their lifetime but it took a random message (Gabe has some game) on OKCupid to bring them together. Then, like an OKCupid commercial, the rest was history 🙂

As Kristen says: “Gabe’s unshakable positive attitude strengthened me, his parents and everyone he was connected to through this tough time. A warrior child turned amazing man.”

A year after this initial diagnosis of testicular cancer, Gabe and Kristen shared the great news with family and friends — the chemo had been successful. Gabe and Kristen were able to start working again and even take a long overdue honeymoon as husband and wife.

That’s why these past six months have been so incredibly challenging. After months of enjoying life together, working with the youth group, and beginning their life as a family — Gabe’s health started to deteriorate. His right leg became numb and then in April a shooting pain shot across it that was unbearable. We rushed him to the ER to get treated and find out what was happening.

After many tests, consults with teams of doctors, they explained that Gabe’s cancer was back, this time in many places.

The cancer took form in a nerve sheath on Gabe’s leg and spine. His L5, C3, and C4 are all impacted deeply by malignant tumors that are taking away movement and causing great pain. Additionally, the cancer was back in his liver and lungs.

Gabe’s faith has not wavered. His love for his wife, for his family, for his friends has never been stronger.

And in the midst of all this pain and struggle, he has not let his condition define who he is. He has never let his condition define who he is.

A few months ago he wrote many of us an email titled, “A Letter From My Heart”.

Here was my brother, told of his cancer returning, sitting in a hospital room, writing a letter to me about fear, faith, and love. Yes, he is my hero, but for so many reasons.

I see how the fear did not stop Gabe from living life.

I see how Gabe is strong for our family. I see him trying to protect us.

I see a kid who took his whole family on a vacation out of love when he could have done anything with a make-a-wish.

Gabe has been my growing up partner from Day 1. I’ve watched him get surgery, take needles every day for a year, do MRI after MRI, and deal with cancer.

But, I’ve never defined him by NF or any condition.

And I never will.

Because he never has.

I’ve seen him make friends with almost everyone he has met. I’ve seen him destroy me in video games without a second look. I’ve seen him try out for a basketball team and deal with being cut by an awful coach, only to bounce back and take the positives. I’ve watched his intelligence shine through poker. I’ve seen my brother start his own business, pivot that business, and sell that business when the time was right.

I’ve seen Gabe work hard every day for himself, for his wife, for what he believes in.

Most of all, I’ve seen my brother handle life like a chef and not a cook.

My favorite writer in the world is Tim Urban. He explains the difference between a chef and a cook like this:

*The words “cook” and “chef” seem kind of like synonyms. And in the real world, they’re often used interchangeably. But in this post, when I say chef, I don’t mean any ordinary chef. I mean the trailblazing chef — the kind of chef who invents recipes. And for our purposes, everyone else who enters a kitchen — all those who follow recipes — is a cook.*

*Everything you eat — every part of every cuisine we know so well — was at some point in the past created for the first time. Wheat, tomatoes, salt, and milk go back a long time, but at some point, someone said, “What if I take those ingredients and do this…and this…..and this……” and ended up with the world’s first pizza. That’s the work of a chef.*

*Since then, god knows how many people have made a pizza. That’s the work of a cook.*

*The chef reasons from first principles, and for the chef, the first principles are raw edible ingredients. Those are her puzzle pieces, her building blocks, and she works her way upwards from there, using her experience, her instincts, and her taste buds.*

*The cook works off of some version of what’s already out there — a recipe of some kind, a meal she tried and liked, a dish she watched someone else make.*

Gabe is a chef, not a cook.

He has always taken what life has given him and created something unique. I’m constantly in awe of how he does it. In fact, it challenged me in many ways to make life great every single day regardless of the circumstances.

This current situation sucks. It’s unfathomable. It makes me sick to my stomach to think about what him and Kristen are going through.

Yet, here he is, sending letters of love to those closest to him. Here is my brother, when the rest of us would be hiding from the world, inviting his family over and sharing his story of faith and belief. Here he is, in what the outside world sees as a potentially dark and depressing time, finding joy in what life has given us.

Yes, it doesn’t matter if you are talking about working with kids at school, or spending time with friends and family, or any situation.

We always complain: There is never enough time.

But, here we are with time on our hands. How we spend it and who we spend it with will always be more important than how much we have.

That’s a lesson I learned from my brother. A lesson all of us should remember.

# 3 Reasons Why Getting Started On Projects You Know You Won’t Finish Right Away Is Actually…

## 

I’m writing this from a train.

I’ve been doing it a lot recently — writing on trains. Personally, it takes a little over an hour to write a typical piece — between 600 and 800 words — and an extra 40 minutes or so to edit. And since it only takes about 30 minutes to get from downtown to my stop, I rarely complete a piece in-full by the time I get home.

Yet, I still go ahead and get whatever I can onto the page in that 30 minutes.

### **I didn’t always do this.**

Write on the train, that is.

The notion of not finishing an article in one sitting used to prevent me from starting one altogether. Unless I had specifically blocked out two hours to write, or waited until after work to begin a piece, I’d fill any downtime — like time on the train — scrolling through travel pages on Instagram or playing billiards on GamePigeon.

*“I don’t want to break my train-of-thought,”* I’d tell myself. *“I’ll just write later, when I’m home, when I know I have time to finish.”*

I wasted a lot of time convinced this was the right way of thinking. I told myself that I’d only write well if I was in “the zone” and that it’d be a waste of time trying to write a piece on the train — or during any form of downtime, for that matter — because I wouldn’t be able to write a piece from start to finish.

## **Most of us use the excuse of ‘not finishing’ to push things off.**

Keyword: excuse.

We hold off on starting projects we don’t have time to finish immediately because once we start, we feel obligated to finish until completion. What *“I should do this later, when I have more time”* really translates to is, *“I really don’t feel like doing this right now.”*

Instead, we opt-out of starting all together, and tell ourselves we’ll do it when we have time — when it makes sense — so we don’t add any more stress to our already stressful lives.

Admittedly, yes — adding an uncompleted task to your ‘to-do’ list is a bit stress-inducing. But it is* always* better to get started on something — especially when you have downtime — as opposed to not getting started just because you can’t finish in one sitting.
> # Here’s why:

## **1. You get a ‘head start.’**

Quite obvious, but worth pointing out.

Imagine it’s a Tuesday and you have a lengthy presentation due Friday at 8:00AM. You’ve blocked out the entire day Wednesday to start and finish the project, and two hours Thursday morning to review and edit. However, you find yourself with a bit of unexpected downtime Tuesday night.

Instead of using that downtime to rest, recharge, or do whatever else you were planning on doing, get started on your presentation — even though you know you’re not going finish. Make an outline for Wednesday and Thursday, organizing your thoughts and planning out exactly how you’re going to approach the project.

That way, when it’s time to ‘actually’ start, you’ve already got a plan in mind.

## **2. You give yourself different perspectives.**

This is extremely important.

I’ll go back to my writing example to explain.

I used to get frustrated if I didn’t finish an article in one sitting. Actually, I wouldn’t even start if I knew I wouldn’t finish. I’d write for one, two, three+ hours until I had the piece exactly how I wanted it — or so I thought — publish, and carry on with my day. However, I started revisiting published pieces for feedback purposes — and every time I did, I ended up editing, workshopping or rewriting pieces altogether, improving them in the process.

Coming back to those pieces at a different time with a new perspective is what allowed for that improvement.

Using my downtime (like those 30 minutes on the train) to get started on articles — instead of waiting to finish everything in one sitting — I give myself the opportunity to review and improve upon what’s already been written.

## **3. You avoid procrastination.**

Of course, the purpose of this piece is to stress the importance of not forcing yourself to finish in one sitting, but an equally important point is to avoid procrastinating on tasks altogether.

When we convince ourselves that our downtime is best used scrolling, web-surfing or something of the like, we end up pushing things off until later — waiting until just before the due date to get started. And if whatever your working on doesn’t have a due date, then the excuse that the ‘timing isn’t right’ will always suffice.

Simply getting started, regardless if you’re going to finish it at once or in time, is essentially promising yourself that you’re committed to whatever it is you’re doing.

Most of us hate having unfinished tasks on our plate. If you procrastinate and wait for a better time to begin something, it’s easy to keep pushing it off.

Starting something and having that project in the back of your mind will force you to come back to it.

# 15 Signs You’re About to Burn Out

## Here’s Why You Should Take a Vacation Immediately

![](1*G8PDz0e8ACPaYwVkAdwvPQ.jpeg)

How long has it been since your last vacation?

If you’ve been hustling like a true entrepreneur, then it probably has been a while. You might have been to a few states in the last month, but if those trips were business related, they don’t count.

Did your recent weekend getaway count as a vacation? Let me ask: Did you do any work on that weekend?

Gotcha.

When’s the last time you actually went on a vacation without having to do ANY work? More likely than not, it has probably been a long time.

If you have seen the below signs lurking around in your life, then it might be time to plan your next getaway — one that doesn’t include any work.
> *“A vacation is what you take when you can no longer take what you’ve been taking.” — Earl Wilson*

## **15 Signs that an Entrepreneur (or Anyone) Is Due for a Vacation**

### 1. You aren’t as motivated as you used to be.

Whether it was just yesterday, last week, or a bit further in the recent past, you feel like your motivation is slipping.

### 2. You keep daydreaming about the Bahamas, Hawaii, New York, California, the beach, the mountains…

Finish the sentence with wherever you can’t stop thinking about!

### 3. You haven’t gotten completely away from work in what feels like a lifetime.

“Was that 2016 that we got away … or was it 2006?”

### 4. You aren’t as quick on your feet as you were in the recent past.

When you’re approaching burnout, your brain isn’t firing as fast as it usually does.

### 5. You are losing passion for what you are doing.

You look at your day’s agenda and just feel “meh.”

### 6. Your creativity is taking a hit.

It’s harder to think outside the box when trying to solve problems.

### 7. Your friends and family can tell you aren’t as happy or motivated as you once were.

How many people have asked if you’re stressed in the past week? Is your spouse concerned that you’re working too hard?

### 8. A prospective client or a big business deal doesn’t excite you as much as it used to.

This was what you lived for just a short time ago. Now you’re feeling apathetically content with your current clients and don’t want to increase the load.

Need to get your influence back on track? I have [a road map for that](https://khe.clickfunnels.com/key-person-of-influence)!

### 9. You aren’t hustling like you used to.

You’re just not sure if you can muster the energy to keep up this pace.

### 10. You are making mistakes you wouldn’t typically make.

How many times have you thought, “That wasn’t like me,” lately (or heard it from another person’s mouth!)?

### 11. The only thing you have been doing for an extended period of time is working.

When’s the last time you had just an evening off?

### 12. Everything sets you off, and you take it out on others as a result.

Are people walking on eggshells around you? Those who are closest to you will notice it first.

### 13. You forgot what down time feels like.

“What free time?”

### 14. You try to think of any other time than the present.

Today can seem too overwhelming, so you spend your time reminiscing about good times or imagining what you’ll be able to do “as soon as things slow down.”

### 15. You honestly can’t remember when your last day off was.

See number 3.

**Are You Exhausted?**

I’m exhausted just looking at that list. Burnout is a terrible place to be.

Being an entrepreneur is not for the faint of heart. You work a lot of hours, and hustling becomes second nature. Business deals will fall through; you will be yelled at, and you will yell at others; every day will pose a problem that you have to solve.

The stress of being an entrepreneur is the reason you have to take care of yourself every single day. You need to keep your mind, body, and soul happy and functioning well. If you’re in this for the long run, you’ll need to take a few pit stops along the way.
> *“A vacation is having nothing to do and all day to do it in.” — Robert Orben*

Doesn’t that sound refreshing?

Now, taking a vacation is easier said than done. More than likely, you are running a business or three, which makes getting away from work quite the feat. But to keep your sanity, you have to get away from the office and not think about your job for an extended period of time. Not only that, getting away and clearing your head will actually make you more creative, more productive, and more efficient when you get back!

If you are showing 5 or more of the above signs, then you know what that means — you are due for a vacation!

Now go get looking for a great destination. You deserve a break, and your work actually needs one!

# How To Shoot For A Successful Exit, From Someone Who’s Been There

## How To Shoot For A Successful Exit, From Someone Who’s Been There

### Here’s the advice I would give to any founder considering an exit:

***By [Brandon Metcalf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/metcalf/), CEO and Managing Partner of BluePrint Advisory***

I loved every minute of running Talent Rover, a staffing and recruitment software company I founded in 2011 and sold in 2018.

That’s why I never operated with a focus on an exit. Of course, our leadership team was aware of all the potential outcomes: getting acquired, going public, or simply staying the course and continuing to grow and serve our customers.

## We were always focused on the latter-growing the business.

With that goal in mind, we raised ~$28 million from an awesome group of angel investors who believed in what we were doing.

However, we were still always talking to private equity folks-which is great advice for any entrepreneur. They are extremely knowledgeable and can help with everything from operations to sales to product issues.

We eventually were looking at our Series A and taking on some institutional money, which was a strategic move to create a stronger backing. We never completed that round, as we were fortunate enough to have our largest competitor swoop in and acquire us.

## Considering and eventually accepting that offer was one of the hardest decisions we ever had to make.

Statistically, most companies don’t have a successful exit. Just reaching the point where another company wants to acquire you is an amazing feeling, nevermind when they give you a fantastic offer.

It was an exciting time, but it was bittersweet-very difficult, incredibly emotional. Leadership had to consider the entire team and our customers, and whether the deal would be good for them-not just us.

Were we living up to the promise we made to our company and clients if we took the offer?

Every [founder](https://minutes.co/startup-founders-get-no-shortage-of-advice-not-all-of-it-good-heres-how-to-filter-the-signals-from-the-noise/) faced with a potential exit will find themselves asking some form of this question.
> # Here’s the advice I would give to any founder considering an exit via acquisition:

## 1. Figure out why-or if-the deal makes sense.

The first thing we did was sit down to list the pros and cons-for us, for stakeholders, for employees, for clients. Obviously, pros need to far outweigh cons for a deal to make sense.

Additionally, be clear on *why* you’re making the decision to exit (or not), because the outcome will be difficult either way. Being able to reassure yourself that you accounted for every detail will help you avoid tossing and turning in bed at night about your decision.

The due diligence of the acquisition process is more detailed, long, and arduous than I could have imagined. You have to conduct a financial audit, tech audit, HR audit, operations audit, sales audit, etc. And you must work to thoroughly understand your business and its finances-don’t assume you already do, even as the founder.

More specifically, take a deep analytical dive into these areas:

* **Financial forecasting**. I was always focused on running the business by the numbers well before any talks of acquisition popped up, so we had a good starting basis. Even with that, we spent a lot of time, money and effort on our forecasts, models, budgets and assumptions. Not to mention how much time we spent sharing, collaborating on and discussing them. This was such a huge amount of effort, which is one of the primary reasons I decided to build my new product, [PlaceCPM](https://www.placecpm.com/), to help simplify this for other companies.

* **Accounting. **You need to really understand your books and ensure that they’re accurate. Even a seemingly minor error can throw measurements off. For example, we were incorrectly recognizing quarterly bonuses, which turned into a big wrinkle when ironing things out during our audit.

* **How you stack up to your competition. **Consider different [financial ratios](https://www.investopedia.com/university/ratios/). Compare your ratios to the ratios of competitors in your industry. Know where your business stands-where you’re strong and where you might be struggling. It’s all part of the company story you want to tell.

* **Your valuation**. Valuation is certainly an art and not a true science, but look for a middle ground between optimistic and pessimistic-realistic. Above all, it’s important to understand how exactly companies are valued, which can take into account everything from revenue to cash-flow analysis to financial formulas and more.

## 2. Surround yourself with a brilliant team of professionals.

We had a legal team which had collectively conducted dozens of exits. On top of that, our investment banker guided us. Make sure that the experts you’re working with really understand your business-not just the sale, but the way your company operates and its mission.

## 3. If you’re being acquired by a competitor, be honest but cautious.

You have to protect certain info, in case the deal falls through. In our case, we had to protect our client and prospective client lists, sales strategy, product details, code and more. This is a great example of why you should never burn bridges with your competitors. You never know if you’ll be doing a deal with them somewhere down the road.

## 4. Acknowledge that some things are out of your control.

They wanted to go into a level of detail we couldn’t even imagine during the due diligence phase. They asked so many unexpected questions and talked to so many of our customers. And what our customers told them was entirely out of our control.

All you can do is prepare as much as you can for the things you *can* control.

## 5. It’s a team effort, but the team is very small and operates on a need-to-know basis.

You have to keep all discussions confidential until an ultimate decision is made. If details get out to the whole team or the world at large, that can disrupt the business, kill the deal, or even kill the business. Because people often assume the worst when they hear news of a potential company acquisition. And poisonous rumors can spread quickly internally.

## Once an exit deal is in place, you-the founder-typically have one big, final decision to make: to stay or go.

This can be especially difficult because you’re not sure exactly what daily operations will look like at that point. Sometimes, a founder fits well into the new company’s culture, and they settle into an [executive position](https://minutes.co/when-your-companys-growing-giving-away-your-responsibilities-is-a-good-thing-heres-why/). Other times, not so much.

I chose to stay with the company for a period of time and see how it went-mainly because I wanted to make sure our customers continued to receive the high-level service we promised them. And I wanted to help the transition go smoothly for everyone involved.

But I quickly realized that my passion is building companies and I love being an entrepreneur. There’s nothing more fulfilling in life than taking an inspired vision and turning it into a company full of passionate people-and value. Of course, it’s bittersweet to see a company you built from the ground up come to an end upon a successful exit.

But then comes the best part: developing the vision for your next company.

# 7 Ways To Make Your Job Much More Interesting

## Photo by Fancycrave on Unsplash
> # An average person spends 90,000 hours at work over a lifetime.
> That’s 1/3rd of your life, which doesn’t even include working extra hours or thinking about work.

It’s a no-brainer to find a job you love.

But there’s a problem…

**Finding a job you love is hard.** Even when you find such a job, the love may go away if you don’t know how to keep loving your job.

Then there are those people who absolutely hate their jobs, but they can’t leave it because of all the responsibilities they have over their shoulders.

![Photo by [Berkeley Communications](https://unsplash.com/@berkeleycommunications?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*ZMzw6TuW_D67Os7P)*Photo by [Berkeley Communications](https://unsplash.com/@berkeleycommunications?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

I remember when I was doing a part-time job making phone calls.

As a natural introvert, every phone call was torture for me.

To make the matters worse, it was right after I had stayed in a studio from 9 to 5.

Sometimes, I would feel like a zombie.

There was nothing *fun* about my job. But I had to do it anyway.

So I had to do something about the situation. I couldn’t keep living that way.

Then I thought to myself…
> # If I can learn to love this job, I can learn to love any job.

So I learned how to LOVE a job before quitting it.

And here’s how you can do the same…

## How To Love Any Job

Maybe you hate your job.

Maybe you like some parts and dislike other parts of your job.

Or maybe you’re indifferent about your job.

No matter what your case is, today you’ll learn how to turn your job into play because it’s the essence of life.

So how do you turn your job into play?

I’ve [said it before](https://designepiclife.com/life-fulfilment/) and I will say it again, you need to experience flow in your everyday life.

You experience flow when you do something and lose track of your time because you’re fully immersed in an activity.

To find flow, you need to match the challenge of your job with your current skills.

![[Flow: The Psychology Of Optimal Performance](https://amzn.to/2oi0nss) By Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](1*RTqep-WFxkIGLbGW1bp-AA.png)*[Flow: The Psychology Of Optimal Performance](https://amzn.to/2oi0nss) By Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi*

When I was making phone calls after phone calls, I was too anxious because I wasn’t good at it.

Some days, I had to enter data instead of making phone calls, which was too boring for me because there was no challenge.

So I combined [the models of Dan Pink, Edward Deci and Richard Ryan](https://designepiclife.com/love-what-you-do/) with [Yu-Kai’s Octalysis framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octalysis) to turn my job into play.

Here are the 7 ways to love any job:

## 1. Chase Mastery And Accomplishment

**No matter what you do, always begin with mastery in mind. Every job involves a skill. Your aim is to get better at it no matter where you start.**

You can track your growth using specific measures to feel the progress and accomplishment.

For example, while I was making phone calls, I tracked how I was getting better at taking surveys over the phone. Building trust, building a rapport, speaking clearly, listening, persuading, asking difficult questions were some of the skills I was getting better at. So after each call, I could rate myself on these skills to track my progress.

Keep in mind to challenge yourself according to your level of skills. For example, at first, I worked on easier skills such as speaking clearly. As I got more comfortable making the calls, I started working on asking difficult questions.

Now you may be thinking…
> What about the boring jobs that require zero skills?

Data entry almost requires no skills if you know how to use a computer well. For me, the task wasn’t challenging at all. But, there’s always a way to bring mastery in your work.

So I gave myself the challenge to improve typing. You could achieve mastery in terms of speed or accuracy of typing. Or you could learn to type the right way (placing fingers correctly). Once you’ve mastered that too, you could use the next trick which is to…

## 2. Give Yourself Autonomy Or Constraints

**If your job has a pre-determined set of directions or restrictions, you can give yourself the freedom to do things your own way.**

Let’s go back to the example we’ve been talking about.

When I was making phone calls, there were an order of questions and a script I had to follow each time I’d make a call. Repeating the same script was boring as hell. So I switched it up. I started testing out different opening lines and instead of asking the questions in the same freaking order, I’d flow with the conversation and ask the one most appropriate at the moment. Then I’d check off the questions to make sure I cover everything.

**Another trick is to give yourself imaginary constraints to get out of a rut, find new challenges, and spark creativity.**

## 3. Find Purpose And Meaning

There’s a famous story about the two bricklayers.

When asked about their work, one complained about how miserable his job was. The other one responded differently…
> “I’m the luckiest guy in the world,” he said. “I get to be a part of important, useful and beautiful pieces of architecture. I turn simple pieces of brick into exquisite masterpieces.”

**They were both right. The difference was in their perspective and mindset.**

You can find meaning in anything. You don’t have to be the big cog in the machine because [every cog matters](https://amzn.to/2of1d9l). Even when one tiny cog is missing, the machine won’t work.

Be grateful for the contribution you get to make. If you look for it, you will find meaning and purpose in your work. When I wasn’t motivated to make the calls or fill in data, I would wear my superhero cape and imagine how I was bringing value to my employer and the people they were serving. And suddenly, it wasn’t about me anymore. It was about the greater purpose that brought fulfilment in my work.

## 4. Bring Predictability Or Unpredictability To Your Work

Depending on your preference and experience, [bring a structure or novelty](https://designepiclife.com/design-your-day/) to your work.

**If you often feel chaotic or anxious while working, bringing structure or predictability will allow you to enter the flow state. But if your work has become monotonous, bringing variety or unpredictability can bring fun to your job.**

Going back to my example, I would listen to different music while doing the data entry work. Or maybe I would play a guessing game in which I’d try to predict the data as I entered it.

On the other hand, if you want to bring order to chaotic work, you can pre-plan your actions and set boundaries to feel more certain and less stressed. Because it’s better to plan and act at separate times for more challenging tasks.

![](1*wYegfQF8H_0mKal8NRVfZg.jpeg)

## 5. Reward Yourself To Feel Empowered And In-Control

**We all want fruitful rewards for the hard work we put it. Your employer may give you a raise or recognition, but you shouldn’t rely on them to feel rewarded.**
> Instead, why not make your own rules and reward yourself?

The rewards can be small or big. Use small rewards for celebrating small wins. For example, I would set rules for myself like “After making 5 more calls, I would take a snack break.”

For bigger rewards, you can either set a point system or set milestones to reward yourself.

Two of the best rewards you can give yourself are empowerment and ownership of something (or remove something from your life if you like minimalism).

The rewards could include upgrading your tools, getting a book or a course, treating yourself with a self-care practice, watching a movie or a show, experiencing something new, playing a game, and so on.

With such practice, you can make sure [not to overindulge in anything](https://designepiclife.com/optimize-life/) (including work) and remember to celebrate the small things in life.

## 6. Form Social Bondings And Find Relatedness

**If you work a job that requires you to work in isolation, then you can significantly boost fulfilment from your work by finding other people doing similar things.**

I am a solo entrepreneur. So I find people to connect who are doing similar things as me.

Whether you’re a programmer, designer, writer, artist; you can connect with people who can give you feedback, inspire you or whom you can give guidance. Or you can also connect with people who do different work from you to gain different perspectives.

Besides, you can always crack jokes and talk with your coworkers about anything you want.

## 7. Use The Power Of Scarcity

Accept it or not, we operate at peak with scarcity. It’s in our nature.

**When you put yourself on a deadline, suddenly, the impossible tasks become doable. You become laser-focused and you also love to experience such a boost in productivity.**

One of the simplest ways to experience such a rush is to set goals and use a timer (or Pomodoro technique).

The reason it works is the Parkinson’s law, which states “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”

You can also use this information to work smarter and not spend hours on tasks you don’t enjoy as much.

## Conclusion

You spend so many hours of your life working. You owe it to yourself to play at work.

Until you find a better job, you don’t have to hate your current job.

Even if you plan on doing the same job for the rest of your life, now you know how to turn any job into play.
> How can your job become predictable or unpredictable?
> How can you use scarcity to your advantage?
> How can you chase mastery at your job?
> How can you bond with others?
> How can you reward yourself?
> How can you bring autonomy?
> How can you find meaning?

Because remember… **if you can learn to love a miserable job, you can love any job (and your life).**

# Declutter Like You’ve Got A Gun To Your Head.

## 

Clutter is the enemy of creative work.

You can’t focus when you’ve got a desk full of mess, an email inbox loaded with unread messages, 50 unread Slack messages, posted notes everywhere and a to-do list longer than a roll of toilet paper.

There’s a solution to the problem of clutter and the downstream effects that come with it.

The solution is to get serious about clutter. Act like you’ve got a gun to your head if it helps.
> # “Whatever you do, don’t see clutter as something minor; see clutter as something major”

## How I declutter?

I never leave the office with stuff on my desk. There’s my laptop, keyboard and mouse — nothing else. Everything else is put away or put in my backpack to take home.

Any dirty dishes are washed before I leave the office. The same goes if I’m in my home office writing — dirty dishes are a distraction. Dirty dishes come with smells that remind you to declutter and put them where they belong.

I may sound like a control freak here, but by ending the day with no clutter, I can ensure I start tomorrow with a fresh outlook instead of being behind the eight-ball trying to fix up yesterday’s mess.
> # “Deal with today’s clutter today”

## Someone else will do it.

That’s what causes clutter. At work, the kitchen is loaded with dirty dishes because the majority of people believe someone else will do them. It’s this lack of responsibility that causes the clutter in the first place.

If each person washed their one cup a day, then there would be no clutter. 
The way to own the problem of clutter is to take responsibility.

## Decluttering helps you think.

That’s what I do when I lack inspiration.

Just like taking a hot shower helps you to think, so does decluttering. Decluttering is like taking a walk in the park and getting away from the worries of the day.
> Decluttering is a form of multitasking that’s acceptable.

Combine the act of thinking with decluttering and see what I mean.

## Decluttering is an excellent break.

We’ve all read a 1001 blog posts telling us to take more breaks.

I used to think this advice was BS until my Osteopath told me about how messed up my spine is. Now I have to take regular breaks when doing my Saturday blogging.

The best way to move around is to put things away and stretch at the same time. Bend down to pick clothes up off the floor. Bend down to load the dishwasher.
> **Decluttering can be an escape from the art of flow.**

I realized that by resetting my brain with decluttering breaks, I could go longer and write more.

## Focus comes from blank space.

When there’s nothing but blank space around you, it’s much easier to focus.

That’s why I write on Medium because the user interface is full of blank space, so there’s nothing to distract me.

Creativity excels in blank space.

Thoughts multiply with blank space.

![](1*9UNr5u9VtKhNrutKpzQcFQ.jpeg)
> # “Many of you want to know how to build a startup or gain traction on social media and often the answers are in the things you overlook”

## What you’re seeking is in what you’re overlooking.

Like clutter…

The fact that I threw away more than 50% of my possessions in pursuit of blank space is how I do the work that’s mentally exhausting.

If you read another success guru blog post, you probably would never learn that. You’d think that success came from more traffic, or a better sales funnel or a new morning habit.

**Success comes from the simple things you’re overlooking like clutter.**

# What Makes Pop Music “Pop”

## Or: Why Taylor Swift Says “Shake It Off” 44 Times
> # “Too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet.” -Taylor Swift

![](0*0oTig7wUcWiEW5jg)

### **Food For Thought**

## **Let’s Get Poppin’**

*Throughout time, music has been used as a way to connect people, express feelings, and tell stories. This week’s newsletters will highlight some of the most well-known and little-known musicians, music facts, and genres. Today’s theme: Pop.*

Pop music grew into its own genre in the 50s with the emergence of rock ’n’ roll. “Pop” music suddenly wasn’t just what was “popular” at the time. It became more about the type of crowd the music or artist attracted. The rise of pop music is typically attributed to Elvis Presley, whose music [helped create a notion of youth](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/may/02/popandrock) that previously didn’t exist.

Today, pop is some of the most universally appreciated music that reaches across countries, gender, and age. It’s something that everyone can get down to — even those of us that “hate” pop will find our feet tapping or mumbling along to the lyrics.

Pop is easily identified by its repetitive verses and instrumentals. [Our brains really like patterns](https://www.amazon.com/This-Your-Brain-Music-Obsession-ebook/dp/B000PC0SDW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=theearthcitiz-20&linkId=470a597af54b0b23e8947a784e8bdde1&language=en_US) and pop music follows simple patterns that are easy for us to quickly pick up.

Take T-Swift’s “Shake It Off” song where she says “shake it off” a whopping 44 times.

This technique is called ABA where the music always circles back to something familiar. It has been used to produce popular music for decades, you can even find it in 20s jazz music.

Speaking of way back when, let’s take a fond look back at the music that was…

Here are some of the most popular pop songs throughout the 2000s:

2000 — Bye Bye Bye by NSYNC
2001 — How You Remind Me by Nickelback
2002 — Hot in Herre by Nelle
2003 — Hey Ya! by OutKast
2004 — Since You Been Gone by Kelly Clarkson
2005 — Run it! by Chris Brown
2006 — Big Girls Don’t Cry by Fergie
2007 — Apologize by Timbaland
2008 — Low by Flo Rida 
2009 — TiK ToK by Kesha 
2010 — Just The Way You Are by Bruno Mars
2011 — Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO
2012 — I Knew You Were Trouble by Taylor Swift
2013 — Counting Stars by One Republic
2014 — Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars
2015 — Love Yourself by Justin Bieber
2016 — Closer by The Chainsmokers
2017 — Shape of You by Ed Sheeran

But there are so many more. To continue your trek through time, check out [Billboard’s list of greatest of all time pop songs](https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-of-all-time-pop-songs) or [Thoughtco’s top pop songs of the 2000s](https://www.thoughtco.com/top-pop-songs-of-the-2000s-3248358).

### **Deep Dive**

## **The Role of Music in Human Culture**
> Given our understanding that most (if not all) of our physical and social faculties are adaptations for success in our environment, the origins of music remain an enigma. Prof Oliver Sacks (in his book Musicophilia) notes that even “Darwin himself was evidently puzzled [about the origin of music in culture], writing in The Descent of Man: ‘…as neither the enjoyment nor the capacity of producing musical notes are faculties of the least use to man… they must be ranked among the most mysterious with which he is endowed….’”

### **Further Reading**

## **Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!**

In *Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!: The Story of Pop Music from Bill Haley to Beyoncé, *author and musician Bob Stanley provides an encyclopedia-style account of the evolution of pop music. He explains how cultural influences and technological advancements have caused pop music to evolve in such distinctive ways.
> # *“The story of pop music is largely the story of the intertwining pop culture of the United States and the United Kingdom in the postwar era…”*

# Skills for Success in Any Career

## 

Specialized skills help you stand out amongst job applicants, but they aren’t the only skills that employers seek. There are many transferable soft skills that are sure to come in handy throughout your career. From professional communication to emotional intelligence, here are just 10 of the abilities that make you an invaluable asset in the workplace.

## **Professional Communication**

![](0*ma9g34zePz7y-M5z)

The importance of professional communication skills cannot be overstated. Whether you are speaking with your coworkers via email, phone, or video call, what you say — and how you say it — matters.

You may have heard that potential employers begin interviewing you the moment you contact them. Any email interaction you have with your interviewer before your initial phone screen or meeting is of utmost importance in the interview process. If you are unable to clearly express yourself via email, they may question whether or not you will be able to express yourself in the office.

Remember to greet the recipient(s) of your email by name and close professionally (“Thanks” and “Cheers” are great options). This isn’t always necessary when talking with coworkers, but beware of lingo that may jeopardize your high standard of communication.

When it comes to video communication, ensure that you are dressed professionally before the call begins. As a rule of thumb, avoid distracting clothing and jewelry. Wearing your favorite Marvel Comics shirt could distract the person with whom you’re speaking, and they may spend the entire call wondering where they can get one just like it. Not exactly productive.

In general, speak clearly and be concise. And most importantly, if you need to ask a question for clarification, go for it!

## **Organization**

![](0*Q4bDC5r3C-EtvLdw)
> Hello You,
> I just wanted to check in and make sure you received my email last week. This is a time sensitive issue, so if you could get back to me ASAP, I would greatly appreciate it.
> Best,
> The Person Who Wrote That Email You Lost

We’ve all been there: Emails are piling up faster than you can respond to them. Your inbox is filled with so many unread messages, you’re afraid to count them. You’ve long since stopped trying to delete the junk mail as it comes in, and why isn’t your spam filter working anyway?!

Take a deep breath, my friend. Emails can smell fear.

Organization skills begin with a decision to clean up and clear out. To avoid the dreaded “Did you get my email?” message, you might have to consider the unthinkable: folders. Create folders for certain people and/or projects. Create folders for the product ads that you may find useful at a later date. And by all means, move those junk messages to your spam folder.

Another great organization tactic is to keep lists of your in-progress and upcoming projects. You should never have to ask yourself, *What am I supposed to be doing?*

Use a calendar app (or two) to keep track of important dates and deadlines so that you can focus on one task at a time (but don’t forget to set reminders!). You can also turn off distracting notifications from social media apps.

Finally, keep your desk as organized as possible. The pile of papers next to your laptop makes you look busy, which, unfortunately, is not the same as being productive. Keep your space clear and your mind focused on the task at hand.

## **Keep Learning New Skills**

![](0*Wh6NYX4N3910QdjA)

It’s easy, once you’ve landed a job, to believe that you are unstoppable. You have the uniform, and the desk, and your list of tasks. You are on *fire*.

But not for long.

Technology is changing every day. The skills that were impressive just a few years ago are now, sadly, outdated. The ability to recognize when updated or new skills are required is invaluable in any career.

Are you a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learner? Knowing this can help you pick up skills in a uniquely efficient way. You may learn best when you’re reading, or maybe online courses better suit your style. Either way, engaging with great content is a fantastic way to become better at your job.

While you’re gobbling up information on the latest tech and marketing trends, don’t forget that professional skills aren’t everything. Outside of work, discover practices that inspire the creativity and mindfulness you need to do your job well.

## **Sales**

![](0*s9J8ITyCgz8qe-hf)

You don’t have to work in the sales department to hone your sales skills. In fact, the ability to sell comes in handy in virtually every career on the planet.

Do you know your product? Can you use it well enough to teach someone else how it works? This is important knowledge for any employee.

Another invaluable sales skill is the ability to speak clearly and empathetically. Get to the point but remember that you’re not a robot! Human beings value authentic conversations with other human beings. No one enjoys a shallow phone call or meeting.

Finally, become a great listener. This is the only way you’ll be able to ask intelligent follow-up questions during conversations.

## **Emotional Intelligence**

![](0*AfbmkaHPKLFfTcZA)

Emotional intelligence is not an easy skill to hone, but once you can use it, you will instantly become more valuable as an employee (and improve the overall quality of your life!). This form of intelligence requires that you recognize not just your own emotions but the emotions of your coworkers and customers as well. The ability to wear multiple hats while on the job is great, but the ability to step into someone else’s shoes is magical.

Always take a moment to pause before commenting or asking questions. Learn from constructive criticism, no matter how harsh it may seem. And as I mentioned before, be your authentic self and show empathy.

When giving feedback, it’s always a good idea to use the “compliment sandwich.” Deliver your suggestion/criticism between two compliments. This makes it easier for people to accept your thoughts without making them feel underappreciated.

One of the challenges that comes with emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize when you’re wrong. When you make a mistake, it’s important to have the strength to admit it and redirect your actions. On the flip side, don’t forget to show grace when others make mistakes. Nobody’s perfect, right?

## **Keep Your Commitments**

![](0*zlwQo6W2VZ8vnvzn)
> “To be on time is to be late. To be early is to be on time.”

Consistently showing up early for meetings sends an important signal: you’re reliable. If you plan to be early and then life (bad hair day, traffic, mass escape by animals at the local zoo) happens, you still have the potential to show up on time. Unfortunately, that’s not the case if you plan to be on time.

A missed phone call may seem like a small thing, but the more reliable you are with the little things, the stronger your good reputation becomes. Ultimately, if you can’t prove that you’re worthy of their trust, your boss and coworkers will lose faith in you and possibly pass over you in favor of someone they can count on consistently.

Keep an eye on the clock. You got this.

## **Flexibility**

![](0*QSLZBvklFIbMp0HK)

You know how it goes: You’re working on a project that requires your full attention. You’ve gotten into a rhythm, and there’s no stopping you now. This thing is getting done *today*.

And then your phone rings.

In a movie-esque moment of unrehearsed drama, you sweep your arm across your desk and watch your hard work tumble to the floor. Or maybe you just pick up the phone.

Answering the phone confirms your suspicions — you have a new, high-priority assignment. Your other project will have to wait. You hang up the phone, slump into your chair, and wonder if you’ll ever find your perfect rhythm again.

The ability to go with the flow without compromising quality is invaluable in any career. As long as there are plans, there will be wrenches to mess them up. But as long as you’re flexible, you can keep plugging along with confidence.

Roll with the tasks as they arise, and remember that you are only human. You can only do what you can do — no more, no less. Approach each task with a positive attitude and nothing can stand in the way of you doing your best.

## **Time Management**

![](0*bvGx2FVRsUXnm8xG)

You knew this one was coming.

Prioritizing your daily tasks is of utmost importance when you’re striving to manage your time. In addition, checking your email at designated times can help eliminate any pressure you may feel to answer your messages as soon as they arrive in your inbox (one of the main culprits of suffering time management).

This seems like a good time to remind you about those distracting social media notifications….

Finally, *don’t skip your lunch break*. It may seem like a good idea in the moment, but skipping your break inhibits productivity later in the day. Treat yourself to dessert and be thankful for 30 minutes of “me” time!

## **Be a Team Player**

![](0*IFKLO7okdQCQz6fx)

Do you work well in groups and on teams? If so, congratulations! You possess a skill that employers value and that few people can claim.

Being a team player becomes much easier when you are willing to cooperate with and appreciate your coworkers and their ideas. But don’t let this stop you from taking on a leadership role when appropriate. By showing confidence in your own abilities, your other team members will be inspired to do the same. Soon, your team will be running like a well-oiled machine, with each individual focusing on the tasks that are best suited to him/her.

## **Grace Under Pressure**

![](0*Uf8prV7Q2lKSjkk7)

Finally, any career will require you to handle deadlines, crises, and stress with grace. Do your best work… even when your efforts feel futile. Stay calm and collected in difficult situations. Most importantly, reframe tasks that you don’t enjoy into challenges to be overcome. By keeping a positive attitude in the midst of the proverbial storm, you’ll remain connected to your inner joy. And if you can do that… well, then, you’re virtually invincible.

# How to network on LinkedIn (without coming across as a total douche bag).

## 

*It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.* The famous first sentence of Charles Dickens classic 1859 novel, [*A Tale of Two Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities),* that was set before and during the French Revolution, doesn’t feel all that out of place when used to describe the times we live in today.

There is less blood, obviously. But, platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn come with both beautiful opportunity and a tremendous amount of bullshit.

They’ve opened the doors to the masses, allowing anyone and everyone to make bucketloads of money doing whatever their hearts desire. But, along with this opportunity, these platforms have birthed a widespread practice we’ve all grown to despise — networking.

**shudder**

Just the other day, I was the victim of a networking vampire. I was scrolling through LinkedIn, minding my own business, when out of nowhere a greasy internet marketer slid into my DM’s uninvited, pounding his chest and pitching me on how he could grow my business, [Honey Copy](https://www.honeycopy.com/stickynotes/), to levels I had never dreamed of.

While I wanted to message him back a punchy “fuck off”, I held my tongue (or my fingers rather) and instead removed my connection with him.

Two maybe three days went by and to my surprise the same internet marketer had requested to connect with me again, attaching yet another poorly-written sales message.

I don’t remember it verbatim, but it was something along the lines of…
> # *“So, you obviously aren’t interested in growing your business, but can I at the very least tell you three ways you can get new leads in case you decide to work with me in the future?”*

On this second attempt, I had to *double hold* my tongue (or fingers rather) and instead of writing a nasty response, I blocked him.

While I’m sure this internet marketers intentions weren’t malevolent, they left a bad taste in my mouth. He made me feel, not like a living breathing human being, but rather a bag of money he couldn’t wait to sink his claws into.

I was both disappointed and annoyed but I withheld from saying anything hateful to him. In part because it wouldn’t have helped the situation… but also because I’ve been in his shoes before. I’ve been the new kid on the block fighting tooth and nail to build my business. And, like him, I’ve been the greasy internet marketer firing off DM’s.

## How to network on LinkedIn thoughtfully and effectively.

In this article, I want to discuss how to network on LinkedIn and other social media platforms without coming across as a self-centered douche bag like the guy in the story above.

The lessons I’m about to share are pulled from my own experiences on both sides of the LinkedIn inbox — *the person being the networker and the person being networked to.*

## Approach LinkedIn networking like dating.

If a girl or guy came up to you in a busy cafe and said* let’s go to the bathroom and have sex*, you’d either call security or dart.

*Why?* Because you don’t know them. *Hell, they didn’t even ask you your name.*

A lot of networking that happens on LinkedIn is like asking for sex before dinner. Folks are rudely barging into one another’s inboxes completely uninvited and making a pitch before they even get to know the person.

In my eyes, good LinkedIn networking begins as a conversation without expectations. It starts with a simple *hello* and continues with a thoughtful building of rapport.

Just like you’d never go up to a random person and ask them if they want to have sex, you should never barge into random people’s inboxes asking if they want to buy from you.

*This shit takes time, [honey](https://www.honeycopy.com/stickynotes/).*

## When LinkedIn networking, give the person something (don’t ask to give them something).

Do you recall the earlier experience I shared about the slimy networking vampire that flapped his slimy wings into my inbox and proceeded to ask me if he could give me something?

Well, it didn’t feel like a gift, it felt like a passive aggressive nudge to do business with him.

When we ask to give someone something, especially in a setting like LinkedIn, it feels conditional.

*Yeah, I’ll give you these fancy shmancy tips… but only under the condition that you maybe give me money down the road.*

It feels gross.

Instead of asking, just give.

For example, let’s say there is someone in your LinkedIn network that heads marketing at a small SaaS startup. An effective way to connect with this individual would be to direct message them something like…
> # *“What’s up Doug, I’ve been following your startup since we first got connected and I am a big fan of the cool stuff you’re doing in marketing. I read this really interesting article today on how some SaaS startups are leveraging Facebook messenger to drive sales. Thought you might find it useful. Cheers!”*

A direct message like this leaves the recipient feeling valued and rightfully so. The networker isn’t promoting their own work nor passive aggressively trying to get the recipient to do business with them. Instead, the networker is just trying to pass along information that might be useful. Which, bring us to my next point… be useful.

## When networking on LinkedIn be a fountain, not a drain.

The entire marketing strategy behind my business [Honey Copy](https://www.honeycopy.com/stickynotes/) is to give more than I take. [I’ve written nearly 100,000 words on my blog](https://www.honeycopy.com/copywritingblog/) about marketing, copywriting and selling and I give these blogs away free of charge.

This year nearly 100,000 people will land on my site and out of these people a select few will reach out to me about writing and consulting for them.

I’m fortunate to be in a position where this select few pays me handsomely for what I do. But, that has only come after months of giving away more than I have ever taken.

Too many people, both on LinkedIn and other social platforms, are selfish. They’re not fountains. *They’re drains.* They don’t seek to be of use to others but instead, they only care about taking, taking and taking some more.

If you’re truly interested in successfully networking on LinkedIn, I’d recommend creating value and giving it away for free — this can be in the form of videos, posts or articles.

If you don’t have the time to create useful content, reach out to one person each week and ask them how you can help them for free.

Hell, if you have to, [send someone an eGift in the form of a $10 Starbucks card](https://www.starbucks.com/shop/card/egift).

The point here is to give, give and give. *Be a fountain not a drain.*

## Treat your LinkedIn profile like your website.

Most LinkedIn profiles are shit. The summaries read like a bad autobiography and the job descriptions sound like something straight out of a computer manual.

Folks who take the time to create a stunning LinkedIn will reap the benefits down the road. Get a professional photographer to take your headshot. Ask a copywriter to write your summary. Come up with a weekly content plan and publish useful, valuable articles that resonate with your industry.

Treat your LinkedIn profile like your website, because in many ways, it is.

## Network with folks on LinkedIn in your city versus miles away.

While certainly not in all cases, most of the time you’re better off networking with people in your own city or in a neighboring city.

For example, I’m based in Nashville, Tennessee. As much as it would be nice to network with other entrepreneurs and freelancers who live in Silicon Valley, I don’t believe that’s the best use of my time.

We’ve been sold this idea that the internet makes everyone our neighbors and that’s bullshit. It is much easier to get connected with someone you can meet in person.

Where it concerns LinkedIn networking, I recommend spending the majority of your time building rapport with people you can grab coffee with tomorrow.

## Lastly…

I would say if I were to sum up everything we covered today in one sentence, it would be this:
> # *“Effectively networking on LinkedIn comes down to being a good thoughtful human being that puts others before themselves.”*

The end.

# What we can all learn from LGBTQ Pride

## Photo by Oliver Cole on Unsplash
> “The first thing that comes to mind when I think of pride is the ability to freely and safely express oneself. For me personally it’s being able to be the **TRUEST VERSION** of myself without having the fear of being judged.”
> – my number 1 queer crush, [Antoni](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj7eckxlB8k/?hl=en&taken-by=antoni) from Queer Eye

So beautifully said and completely relatable. Who of us doesn’t long to be their most authentic self without having to worry about becoming a pariah or losing the love of our friends and family?

I find the LGBTQ pride month and season that we’re in to be so admirable and important. I walked in the LA Pride parade with Uber on Sunday and my heart swelled as I waved at and danced with all of the supporting and loving people on the sidelines. Everyone of varying ages, religions, and ethnicities were represented on the sidelines showing their support for their fellow neighbor.

![On the Uber float at LA Pride](0*eM1EgqYtwx8cspIu)*On the Uber float at LA Pride*

The word pride is an interesting one to unpack.

I feel like if we were to ask an average person what they have pride in or what they’re proud of, they’d most likely look to an accomplishment or something they’ve achieved. People take pride in their education, their career, the material items they can afford, but it’s rare to hear someone say they simply take pride in who they are. In their intrinsic qualities. In the way they’ve grown. In the way they love and are continuing to evolve.

We’re so achievement-oriented and reliant on external validation that we’re programmed to immediately think of the things in our lives that may be praised by someone else when we need to feel proud. What if we could just forget about what everyone else thinks and just focus on the core of what matters? The core of who we all are and what we all want.

Genuine and unique individuals who want to be happy.

It may vary from person to person in terms of how it manifests. Maybe you’re funny and kind and obsessed with turtles. Maybe you’re subdued and relaxed and a fan of historical fiction. Maybe you have a ton of piercings or wear your hair pink or choose life makeup-free. Our differences are a result of our life experiences and keep us interesting. We’d be SO BORED if everyone we met was exactly the same.

## Learning from LGBTQ Pride

This is where we can all take a lesson out of the LGBTQ pride book. They have the bravery to take pride in who they are despite every indication that some other people might not like it. When who you intrinsically are is received as a political statement, serious measures must be taken to preserve your self-esteem. When others try to shame you for who you are, pride is a life-saving response. I personally find every person in the LGBTQ community to be the embodiment of bravery and courage. Simply waking up in the morning and owning your truest self is something we all need to practice.

## What is the truest version of yourself?

While you may not be hiding your preferred sexuality, maybe you feel like you have to hide or restrain some other part of yourself. Maybe you’re hiding your love of Manga comics (I saw in an interview that [Cole Sprouse did this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1PxnoVsUm8) as a kid), maybe you’re self-conscious about your funny laugh (hehe hi there, that’s me sometimes), maybe you’re hiding your dissatisfaction with your job, maybe you’re hiding your love of Jesus, maybe you’re hiding that you actually give a fuck, maybe you’re hiding that you’re really struggling and need help.

I don’t know what it is that you’ve tucked away from the public, but I challenge you to fully embrace it. Be your most authentic and truest self and walk it with confidence. Who you are is *supposed* to be unique and different — and in that, there is perfection. **Never forget that.** Others will either love you or leave you but what’s most important is that you’ll like yourself.

Ask yourself:

“How can I embrace who I truly am when I go out into the world?”

“How can I love myself exactly as I am?”

That’s where I’m currently focusing. I suggest you do the same.

*Have you recently embraced a part of you that you recently struggled with accepting or sharing with the world? Leave a comment with your experience or thoughts on the matter. We can all benefit from hearing other people’s tactics for living their most authentic life!*

*Originally posted on my personal blog [Brightly Illuminated](https://brightlyilluminated.wordpress.com/), where I document my perspective as a millennial post-grad trying to make sense of the “real world” through a lens of positivity and self-development.*

# 12 Shortcuts For Entrepreneurs To Get More Done In Less Time

## 

As a startup founder, you’re always under pressure to do more with less.

Over the last decade, my co-founder Alex and I have started two companies — one that ultimately failed, and one that was acquired. And during that time, through a lot of trial and error, we’ve learned a lot about how to do exactly that.

Here are 12 of our most valuable shortcuts:

## **1. Cap the quantity and duration of meetings.**

Meetings are in most cases a waste of time. They create an illusion of productivity, but often drag on for way too long. But it doesn’t have to be that way.

There are 10–15 minutes in every meeting that account for 80% or more of the meeting’s value. You can prevent meetings from becoming unproductive by capping their length to 30 minutes, or by setting strict personal rules such as: “I will not spend more than 30% of any given day in meetings.” Or, even better, create a “No Meeting Wednesday” policy like Facebook did in 2012.

These kinds of adjustments might seem limiting, but they actually will encourage everyone on your team to treat meetings more efficiently.

## **2. Spend less time on your poor performers.**

It’s a natural tendency to want to invest *more *time in employees who are struggling, as you want to help them.

But the truth is, perma-struggling employees who require help from team leads or founders are massive time-sucks. You should provide such employees with tools and resources to improve, sure, but the majority of your internal energy should instead be [invested in employees who are excelling](https://medium.com/swlh/why-you-should-focus-more-on-your-top-performers-than-your-weak-ones-fe29e3d5b6e2) — those who could turn into your company’s future leaders.

That’s an investment that will pay off. Investing in employees who continue to struggle and don’t create unique value, on the other hand, does not.

## **3. Spend less time at conferences & networking events.**

Some founders fixate on this idea that conferences and networking events are inherently valuable and always worth your time.
> # They’re not.

As a company leader, only attend conferences that will help your company grow in tangible ways and against trackable metrics. And always be weary of cost. It’s likely you can network as effectively on your own as you can by going to conferences — and dinners or drinks are much cheaper than $5,000 conference fees.

## **4. Hire people who care.**

There are people who truly care, and then there are people who just [want a job and will be fine working anywhere](https://medium.com/swlh/the-8-most-dangerous-people-to-have-on-your-team-4aad439736c8). Imagine a software engineer who’s just as happy working on a mobile game as he or she is working on some legacy banking platform.

Hiring decisions are some of the most important investments you can make, especially when the team is still small, so it’s important that you screen for people who will live and breathe your company culture and get fired up about the products that you’re building.
> If they care, it will show in all aspects of their work, and others on the team will notice.

When your company is still in its formative stages, you should *only *hire people who live and breathe your product and industry. And you should fire people who don’t.

## **5. Give team members autonomy (and refrain from micro-managing).**

The more your employees are able to drive functions, domains, and features autonomously, the more time you’ll have to focus on other critical tasks.

It pays, then, to give out that sort of autonomy — and, on the other side of the spectrum, to avoid the habit of micro-managing. This can be difficult, especially early on when you want to be heavily involved in every critical company decision. But micro-managing other people means you’re *not *working on other potentially mission-critical tasks. That’s simply not sustainable as a founder.

## **6. Don’t give every task the same priority.**

In the same vein, it’s critical to understand that not every problem carries the same weight. Prioritize tasks in accordance with which is most immediate, and which will take more time.

You can do this at the start of each day. Ask yourself: what are the three most important things I need to do today? What are the smaller things I might be able to accomplish easily later on? Set this strategy, then abide by it, delaying other non-immediate items that arise until tomorrow. It’s fine to have a bit of a backlog.

## **7. Don’t follow every piece of advice.**

Just as not all problems are created equal, neither are all pieces of advice.

In fact, you should only spend time and energy focusing on advice or feedback from folks who have some [skin in your game](https://theascent.pub/why-you-shouldnt-take-someone-s-feedback-if-they-have-no-skin-in-the-game-2b78e05ead21) — who are incentivized to provide you with thoughtful, prudent advice — or who have proven themselves to possess an interesting and valuable perspective.

Wisdom, in this sense, should be weighted — and never asked for just for the sake of asking.

## **8. Block off chunks of time to “go deep” on specific tasks.**

Some tasks do require longer amounts of uninterrupted time and focus. It’s important that you identify which tasks fall into this bucket, and that you then block off times on your calendar to give those items the focus and attention they need. Set your calendar purposefully, then abide by it. If an email comes in during one of these blocks, don’t respond to it until that time’s up.

That’s the only way you’ll force yourself to finish those tasks or solve those problems.

## **9. Outlearn your competition by making small bets.**

We learn faster by doing and trying than by talking and thinking.

So when it comes to learning about a potential hire, or analyzing the merits of a new feature, [test those things with small bets](https://medium.com/swlh/win-bigger-by-betting-smaller-84ad640d37f7) rather than simply talking about them in the abstract. Hire that potential employee for a month-long trial. Test that feature in a small geo-targeted beta release. This will win you the insight you seek more effectively and in less time.

## **10. Learn to leverage market momentum.**

Look at the market around you, and ask yourself what is working in your favor and what is working against you. Identify what challenges might give you resistance, and preemptively work around them. This will allow you to proceed seamlessly in whichever direction you’re headed.

Momentum trends are especially critical when it comes to distribution and user acquisition costs, since the ad channels and distribution tactics are always evolving.

## **11. Motivate your team through transparency into decisions.**

I’ve found that nothing motivates people as quickly or as seamlessly as just being transparent with them.

By giving our team [insight into why exactly we’ve made a certain decision](https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/why-the-insight-into-how-a-decision-is-made-is-just-as-important-as-the-decision) or are pursuing a specific strategy, I spend *far *less time convincing them of as much through presentations or additional meetings. “Closed door” decisions are a lot more likely to receive pushback, and the less time you have to spend motivating your team around a new strategy or focus, the better.

## **12. Design for speed instead of for “cool.”**

Many people seem inspired to design or build new platforms or features that are innovative and cool simply because they think that innovation is cool and sexy. They do this even when what they need already exists in a serviceable — if not entirely flashy — version.

Don’t do that. It’s hardly ever worth reinventing the wheel or over-complicating something just because you want to be unique or original. Spend that time and money elsewhere.

# Simplify your life with this mental model

## Simplify your life with this mental model

Legend has it that NASA spent a decade and millions of dollars developing a ballpoint pen that would work in zero gravity and function in extreme temperatures.

The Soviets used a pencil.

The story of the “write stuff” turns out to be [a myth](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-write-stuff/). Pencil tips have a habit of breaking and getting into nooks and crannies — which may be okay on Earth, but not so okay on a spacecraft where they can find their way into mission-critical equipment or end up floating into an astronaut’s eyeball.

But the moral of the myth still holds. As Einstein put it, everything should be made “as simple and as few as possible.”

This principle is known as Occam’s razor. The name, I admit, is unfortunate. It sounds like a cheap late-night horror flick starring a ghoul named Occam and his preferred weapon, the razor. But it’s actually a mental model named after William of Ockham, a fourteenth century philosopher.

The most elegant theories rest on the fewest number of assumptions. The most elegant solutions, in the words of the author David Murray, “are those that use the least number of components to solve the greatest number of problems.”

Simple systems have fewer points of failure. Complicated things break more easily. Every brilliant new idea has the potential to generate a dozen unintended, and sometimes disastrous, consequences. Every brilliant new component, system, or app that promises a breakthrough has the potential to break through and through.

For the vast majority of my life, I took none of the advice I’m laying out here. I’ve had what can charitably be described as an obsession with the new. I was every computer company’s dream customer, the stereotypical early adopter, the first in line to buy the new hardware or download the new beta operating system filled with bugs. When I started [my blog](https://ozanvarol.com/), I stacked one plugin on top of the other to enhance the user experience.

This jenga tower collapsed at the worst possible moment. One of my articles — titled [*Facts Don’t Change Minds. Here’s What Does](https://ozanvarol.com/how-to-change-a-mind-yours-or-someone-elses/)* — went viral. It sent hundreds of thousands of viewers to a website that had previously been frequented by four people a day. The skyrocketing views put my shiny plugins to the test, and they failed spectacularly. The website crashed — right when many of these first-time viewers may have been turning into long-term readers.

Change introduces new variables, and therefore complexity and uncertainty, into the mix. Before we add new variables, we must ask: What benefit will we get from this? Does that benefit exceed the potential uncertainty, complexity, and expense that will result? If this new component fails, will it compromise the fundamentals and produce mission-critical consequences — such as the collapse of your website?

Often, we’re irrationally attached to our investments. The more we invest time, effort, or money, the harder it becomes to change course or abandon it. We throw good money after bad, continue to read a terrible book because we already spent an hour, or pursue a dysfunctional relationship because it’s dragged on for eight months.

Take out Occam’s razor and shave off these excesses. Negotiate the seemingly non-negotiable. Kill your darlings, as Stephen King exhorts, even if it breaks your egocentric little heart. Do it all with a smile on your face and with no trace of melancholy.

Occam’s razor isn’t like Freddy Krueger’s glove. You’ll survive — no, thrive — after you play roughly with your work, tear it apart, and chop it up. Cutting the immobile kitchen gave us food carts. Cutting bank loans and venture-capital funding gave us Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Cutting late fees and physical stores for movie rentals gave us Netflix. Cutting their ties to Great Britain gave the colonies the United States of America (cue the inspirational patriotic music).

To cut is to make whole. To subtract is to add. To constrain is to liberate.

As the ashes and clutter settle, something beautiful will soar.

# The Best Way to Extend Your Influence.

## Culture Eats Strategy.

![Photo by [rawpixel](https://unsplash.com/photos/3BK_DyRVf90?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/collections/1903059/community?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](0*kp4oMnXzEB7s_hJ0.jpg)*Photo by [rawpixel](https://unsplash.com/photos/3BK_DyRVf90?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/collections/1903059/community?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

Steve Jobs did not personally invent the iPhone. Or the iPod or iTunes. Others within his company did. Instead, Steve Jobs created a culture of innovation and unflinching standards. He developed an environment where questioning the status quo was not only expected but celebrated. And Apple’s people and products responded in kind. As Peter Thiel described in [*Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)*,
> # “The greatest thing Jobs designed was his business.”

The mark of great leader isn’t based on individual accomplishments but the level of accomplishment they create through others. It’s this force multiplier that accompanies those we see as truly influential. As Simon Sinek wrote in [*Start with Why](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone-ebook/dp/B002Q6XUE4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1528770646&sr=1-1)*,
> # “The role of a leader is not to come up with all the great ideas. The role of a leader is to create an environment in which great ideas can happen.”

We often refer to these environments as a company’s culture. Environments that help people see their own potential so well that they’re inspired to achieve beyond that level. Environments that help people see that they belong to something greater than themselves.

And not only do they have the potential to inspire, but a high quality culture can become our greatest competitive advantage. In the words of Herb Kelleher, co-founder of Southwest Airlines,
> # “Given enough time and money, your competitors can duplicate almost everything you’ve got working for you. They can hire away some of your best people. They can reverse-engineer your processes. The only thing they can’t duplicate is your culture.”

But in recent years the notion of culture has become blurred. Replaced by visions of ping pong tables, open floor plans, and in-office yoga, as well as whatever other perks are currently in vogue.

We visualize these superficial conveniences and forget that none of them make people truly proud to work somewhere. And few reinforce the behaviors that will provide the competitive advantage we’re looking for.

We focus on these perks because they’re easy. Easy to implement and easy to promote.

And in doing so, we sacrifice the opportunity to develop cultures of real substance. And create those environments where our people will truly excel.

### Culture Cannot Be Mandated
> # “The beatings will continue until morale improves.” — *Unknown (at least to me)*

We’re conditioned to want short-term results. So we focus on things that will bring those results.

When companies (and parents, for that matter) want to have an immediate impact, they focus on rewards and punishment. Methods of control. Because the best way to get immediate results is by mandating actions.

But this is rarely sustainable. And the person doing the mandating rarely knows all the answers.

Instead, we need to recognize that cultures can’t be procedurally mandated or the result of a company memo. They can’t be driven by superficial perks that encourage entitlement over innovation. Or worse, trying to punish anyone who doesn’t toe the line.

Steve Jobs didn’t need to bribe people into creativity. He offered them the chance to do great work with great people. And high quality people flocked to the opportunity.

We can try to shortcut the process with perks and create a shallow environment that only demotivates in the long-run. Or we can invest in a culture that will provide the sustained benefits we need. Which, in my experience, comes down to mission, systems, and behaviors.

### Mission — Give People a Reason to Care
> # “A team aligned behind a vision will move mountains. Sell them on your roadmap and don’t compromise — care about the details, the fit and finish.”* — Kevin Rose*

Do your employees understand why they do the work that they do? Do they recognize the importance behind their daily responsibilities?

Everyone wants to feel valued. Everyone wants to take pride in the work they do each day. So one of the most critical responsibilities of management is to define the organization’s purpose. And help people see the direction and meaning behind the work they do each day.

True, most companies do have a mission statement. And you’re likely to see some inspirational posters tacked to the walls. But great cultures take their mission and make it personal. They develop guiding principles to help people make the decisions aligned to the mission. They individualize it in the work that every employee does.

Try this: Ask the first three employees you see about your company’s organizational principles. If they can’t define them, then management has fallen short of giving people a mission that’s specialized to their role. As Captain David Marquet wrote in [*Turn the Ship Around!](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers-ebook/dp/B00AFPVP0Y/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1528770704&sr=1-1),*
> # “The guiding principles needed to do just that: provide guidance on decisions.”

Otherwise, they’re just some empty words on a poster.

### Systems — Infuse the Mission in Everyday Actions
> # “If you can’t describe what you are doing as a process, you don’t know what you’re doing”* — W. Edward Deming*

The biggest reason that most cultures fail is inconsistency from leadership. When people preach one message and then behave a different way, people notice. And they lose confidence in the message.

How many companies preach technical excellence, but then ship out poor quality product to meet delivery goals? Or how frequently do we hear about companies that preach innovation and then punish employees that are willing to take risks?

This isn’t always deliberate. But when people are under pressure, they often fall into old habits. And they don’t always make decisions that align with the culture we’re trying to promote.

If a company’s culture is the result of 1,000 tiny decisions, then each of those decisions needs to align with the culture. And if we’re expecting every manager to consistently make the right decision, we’re setting ourselves up for disappointment.

Instead, great leaders design their business systems to reinforce the culture. In this way, the principles within the culture are embedded throughout the organization.

Whether it’s hiring, talent development, performance assessments, or rewards systems, each area needs to be developed with the culture in mind. As Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca described it, *“you must study the endgame before everything else.”*

Steve Jobs didn’t run an innovation initiative. He ran a company that was centered around innovation. Howard Schultz didn’t draft memos on inclusion and then go back to business as usual. Every facet of Starbucks was designed around his principles.

Does your hiring process look for cultural fit or cultural contribution? Does it encourage managers to find candidates that fit in or does it ask what’s missing and find someone who fills that need?

Does your recognition system recognize people who take risks or just those who have mediocre success? Are people promoted for accomplishments aligned with the values of the organization or for short-term success that runs counter to the guiding principles?

People will behave as the environment dictates. As the great Dr. Phil Zimbardo once put it,
> # “If you put good apples into a bad situation, you’ll get bad apples.”

### Behaviors — Set and Reinforce the Expectation
> # “We can change culture if we change behavior.”* — Dr. Aubrey Daniels*

At the end of the day, behaviors determine a culture. The daily things that people do, and the methods by which they execute their jobs, will do more to develop a culture than any amount of management preaching.

But before we can expect people to behave accordingly, management needs to set clear expectations, and then take steps to reinforce those expectations with timely and frequent feedback.

Do your employees understand the expectations for success? Every employee I’ve ever managed would happily trade their so-called perks for clear expectations. People generally do want to do good work. It’s management responsibility to help them see what that success looks like.

How many managers complain that their people aren’t performing yet haven’t taken the time to make their expectations clear? And how often do we see managers criticize someone in their performance appraisal without giving them that feedback in real-time, when they have the opportunity to do something about it?

Do your employees understand what it takes to be successful? And are there mechanisms in place to reinforce those expectations?

If we aren’t doing this, why would we ever expect things to improve? As Tony Robbins put it,
> # “It’s not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives. It’s what we do consistently.”

### Culture Eats Strategy
> # “A company’s culture is the foundation for future innovation. An entrepreneur’s job is to build the foundation.”* — Brian Chesky*

As we’re pushed towards a culture of immediacy, it’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to shortcut a culture with perks and punishments. But these superficial aspects won’t build the solid foundation that we need. And any short-term gains we make through this method are difficult to sustain for any real length of time.

We repeatedly see empowerment initiatives and innovation programs fail because they’re developed as temporary fixes. Few companies take the time to cement these mindsets throughout their organization, so it’s inevitable that they eventually fall back into old behaviors. And return to being mediocre.

The alternative is to invest in developing a foundation. One that encourages people to bring their best self to work and reinforces the principles we want our companies to represent.

It takes time. And discipline. And process. There are no shortcuts. But given the possibilities, doesn’t it seem worth it?

# Finding Your Team’s Mission

## Creating A Vision For Your Business

![](0*b2pcHRL4M_Hx1qji)
> # “The task of leadership is not to put greatness into humanity, but to elicit it, for the greatness is already there.” — John Buchan

### **Food For Thought**

## **Creating A Shared Mission**

The key motivator in any successful business or team is a shared vision. It’s a clear goal that you, your teammates, and your customers recognize; one that articulates the impact you want yourself and your business to have on future generations.

A mission acts as a director for all of your business decisions: who to hire, what to sell, what innovation to encourage, which clients to work worth. It also functions as a guide for your employees so that they can frame their work in a way that always mirrors the mission of the company.

Most importantly, having a vision draws and keeps a team together. When things are tough in the short term, a long term vision helps team members remember why they are there in the first place.

But drafting up a vision isn’t going to bring together a successful team on its own.

### **Find the right team members.**

Building a team that lasts starts at the first interview. Hire slowly and make sure a prospective employee is the right fit. Get people around you that believe in what you do and are passionate about the mission.

### **Keep your mission at the forefront of all you do.**

Remind your employees (and yourself) of the mission often. Make sure that all of your decisions align with that goal, and don’t be afraid to update the mission statement as the company or industry evolves.

### **Tackle the big problems.**

Doug Merritt, CEO of Splunk, [joined us on Mission Daily today](http://bit.ly/2Zprhjw). Doug has a vision for Splunk — he wants to solve problems, no matter how big, prevalent, or challenging they might be. And he’s not just talking about difficulties within companies. For Doug, solving global problems is at the forefront of Splunk’s mission.

Short term goals and solving small problems won’t sustain a company for long and can become distractions if they aren’t aligned with a larger vision. Big, forward-thinking missions can drive innovation for years, decades, and even centuries.

### **Mission Daily**

## **The Hidden World Of Data**

Most companies don’t mine all the value from their data. Splunk is changing that.

Splunk is a technology company that allows organizations to take all their data and turn it into opportunities for employees and shareholders. They are transforming the way companies think about, manage, and use their data — and CEO Doug Merritt is at the helm of this major innovation.

Doug has had a fascinating and expansive career in tech. In today’s interview, Doug shares his insights on company leadership, personal development, and why you are undervaluing your data.

# The Time Will Never Be Right

## But Here’s Why You Should Act Anyway

![Photo by [Xan Griffin](https://unsplash.com/@xangriffin?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*_SZwru1QObiLRwcH)*Photo by [Xan Griffin](https://unsplash.com/@xangriffin?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*
> “And they waited for years and years, staying safely within their comfort zone, watching every opportunity pass them by, until success fell right into their laps.”

Yeah — no.

If you’ve been led to believe that next level success comes from procrastinating the big moves until the “right moment,” you’re not alone — but you’ve been dangerously misinformed.

It is true that timing can *seem* like your biggest obstacle. When you have a dream, every single day brings easy excuses and convenient road blocks.

I can’t take the next step because:

* not enough time,

* not enough connections,

* too tired,

* too distracted,

* too scared.

Most people yield to these thoughts all their lives.

But, as you might have guessed, this attitude does not work. Ever. It’s like saying that when all the lights turn green, I will leave my house and drive to work. Huh?

Not only do the conditions never become perfect for action, but, you know what?

Most people wouldn’t act even if they were.

Most people have become so used to not committing to things that when the time comes for them to act, they* just don’t do anything*.

## **How Long Will You Wait on Success?**

Who do you think sees greater returns? The person who waits for the all clear or the person who clears the way?

After witnessing many successful people and many of those who struggle, I can tell you that the people who are successful are the ones who commit to things that take them forward, even when they aren’t sure exactly how it will all come together.

I’m not saying be reckless, I’m just saying that there’s never a right time. You will always have challenges going on with your time, your money or your focus. They’re just part of the process. If something comes along that you know you should do, then do it, and figure it out along the way.

Did you know that at one time, Elon Musk — multi-**billion**aire tech mogul/ real-life Tony Stark — was in massive debt and at risk of losing everything? He had an ambitious dream to launch a rocket more efficiently than NASA.

But the path wasn’t lit for him. And he did stumble. But even in his darkest hours, he kept moving forward. He committed himself to the outcome. And in the end, he figured it all out, because he had to.

Currently, he’s building electric cars at Tesla, distributing solar panels at Solar City and launching reusable rockets at SpaceX. He acts first, then he figures it out because he must.

You don’t have to be an Elon to start making the big moves you dream about. But making those big moves could make you an Elon — a major person of influence in your area of business.

It’s easy to second-guess. It’s safer to be stagnant.

But if you’re not moving forward, you’re losing ground. If you’re not growing, you’re dying.

Trust yourself — you have greater skills than you think to manage obstacles. The only person with the power to keep you a wannabe — or to break out and start growing — is yourself.

## **Ready, Fire… Aim!**

I wish the universe worked differently. I wish that you could plan to do things and then magically make time and money to then do them. It would feel a lot safer. But unfortunately, I don’t see that happening for anyone I know. The people I know over-commit themselves then figure it all out as it unfolds.

Resources show up after resourcefulness: The more resourceful you are, the more resources you will have.

That’s true, but here’s the secret that few people share: Resourcefulness shows up** after you make a commitment.**

Prior to committing to something, half of your resourcefulness is working on overtime on why this is not a good idea.

Without a commitment, humans use up too much brain energy on assessing the idea, the timing and trying to predict an unpredictable future. When you finally commit to an outcome, you’ve freed up gallons of energy to become more resourceful in following through.

Commit to a big goal (I mean literally sign yourself up to some sort of deadline or external commitment) and then start filling in the blanks.

## **The Ideal Time Doesn’t Exist, but Right Now Does.**

Becoming a Key Person of Influence doesn’t happen for most people because they are waiting for “the ideal time.” They think that “one day” they will have the time, money and focus to get something done.

So they keep working towards making enough money or earning enough vacation days rather than going for what they want.

I’ll ask them, “Why are you working so hard?” They reply, “So I can get some spare time and money to go and do what I want.”

No, no, no, no! Don’t work to make money for the ideal time, work for the **result**. Ask yourself what it is you actually want to do. Then go and do it.

**There is no ideal time**. It never comes.

You will be an elderly person in an aged care home and finally you will realize that had you just gone for what you wanted, you would have had it.

An “ideal time” is not a goal. Bite off more than you can chew and then figure it out as you go. If you were any good at creating an ideal time in your life, you would have had one by now.

When was the last time you actually arrived at the perfect time and place with all the money you needed? It’s a fairytale.

If you suddenly realize that the most important thing you could be doing for your success is to write a book, then don’t put it off.

If you know in your heart of hearts that you should be starting a business, then go start it.

If it’s time to sell your business, then sell it.

I’m not saying that you should be reckless; I’m just saying when something is important, you should begin it now rather than waiting for all the circumstances to be perfect. There’s never enough time, there’s never enough money, there’s never a perfect plan. That’s life. Move forward anyway.

## **The Stakes Have Changed — Take Advantage.**

So why don’t we act now? What are we so afraid could happen?

If you are wrong about your idea, very rarely is the downside catastrophic.

In past civilizations, people who had bad ideas died. They were eaten by bears, burned at the stake, tortured to death, or worse. Today, the absolute worst thing that most people fear is the feeling of being a labeled a failure. Many people’s worst nightmare is getting embarrassed because their idea didn’t work out the way they thought it would. At worst, they may lose some time and start-up capital.

Your losses aren’t as bad as you think. But the reward of success is even greater than you think.

Imagine trying to explain that to your ancestors!

Your ancestors would shake their heads in disgust. They faced wars, plagues and disasters to create a better world and you’re not taking full advantage of all it has to offer? You owe it to them to be braver and make some bold moves to achieve your dreams.

When you wake up tomorrow the excuses will begin again. I promise. But if you’re truly intrigued at the thought of becoming a key influencer, if you’re ready to trade comfort for achievement, whether your dreams have been lying stagnant for months, years, or decades, be honest with yourself:

The time will *never *be right. So what are you *waiting *for?

# 11 Incredible Ways Webinars Can Drive Company Sales and Growth

## 

Need help growing your business fast? Have you considered webinars as part of your marketing strategy?

There are many other powerful technologies you should use to fuel massive growth over the coming months — we’ve discussed several over the past few weeks. Things like [website updates](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/7-insane-website-hacks-to-triple-sales-first-90-days.html), [video ads](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/3-effective-ways-to-get-increase-video-ads-traffic-first-90-days.html), and [business productivity apps.](https://mobilemonkey.com/blog/2018/02/business-productivity-apps)

Today we’re talking about webinars, which are critical for doing B2B or solution sales at scale.

Webinars are hardly new. Many companies do them. But many companies do webinars incredibly poorly. I’m sure you’ve experienced a terrible webinar first hand — and probably not too long ago.

Don’t let the same thing happen to your business! Here are 11 incredible tips to get 10x more output from your webinars.

## 1. Topic Generation

Doing a webinar about a boring topic, or a topic that your target audience simply isn’t interested in, is a recipe for disaster. Why waste the time and effort promoting and presenting something that few people really want.

Here’s the key to success with webinars: you need to pick topics that have already proven themselves. For example, if you’ve produced an ebook that got tons of downloads or a certain email subject line for one of your newsletters got huge open rates, that’s a huge flashing “DUH!” sign that people are interested in that topic.

Look to your data. Figure out what your top 5 percent performers across all your channels and content.

Pick one of those topics.

## 2. Reduce Frequency

Some companies do hundreds of webinars per year. Seriously? Yes, seriously.

You really don’t need to do multiple webinars per month (definitely not multiple webinars per week!). That’s crazy.

You’re much better off doing one big spectacular webinar per month than doing four mediocre webinars. Focus on QUALITY, not quantity.

At WordStream we were able to increase registrations to 5,000+ for one big monthly event versus seeing signups of around 500 for our smaller, less produced and promoted weekly webinars.

## 3. Go All In on Visual Slide Content

Are you still using bullet points in your slides? Please. Just. Stop.

Today it’s all about high impact visual slides. [Visual content](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/visual-content-marketing-16-eye-popping-statistics-you-need-to-know.html) is so incredibly powerful. Awesome visuals will keep your viewers engaged. Be memorable and entertaining.

Take [this deck](http://www.slideshare.net/WordStream/the-top-10-facebook-and-twitter-advertising-hacks-of-all-time-larry-kims-presentation-at-hubspots-inbound-2015-marketing-conference) as an example — 97 slides and not a bullet point to be found! Oh, and it just happened to be one of the [top 20 SlideShares of 2015](http://marketinginsidergroup.com/content-marketing/20-best-slideshare-presentations-2015/).

Not a visual person yourself? Hire a designer to help to make high-impact slide decks. Trust me, it’s worth the investment.

## 4. Go Nuts on Event Promotion

You have to do email blasts. That’s a no-brainer. But email isn’t enough.

You should also be [targeting your target audience](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/3-free-tools-that-help-you-understand-your-customers-grow-sales-first-90-days.html) using:

* [Remarketing](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/5-proven-ways-remarketing-will-make-your-business-successful-first-90-days.html)

* [Facebook Ads](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-important-reasons-you-need-to-use-facebook-ads-right-now-first-90-days.html)

* [AdWords Customer Match](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/05/adwords-customer-match)

* [Gmail Ads](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/5-powerful-ways-gmail-ads-can-grow-your-business-first-90-days.html)

## 5. Turn on the Webcam

Most of the webinar software products let you turn on the webcam. Do it! Although people can’t be in the room with you, this is the next best thing.

Your presentation will be even more impactful when they see you presenting. Also, people will trust you more when they see your face, versus just hearing an anonymous voice.

## 6. Do A Poll Question With An Offer

Polls are a good way to learn about and engage with your attendees. But we’re talking about business growth here, so let’s take it a step further.

Attach an offer to one of your questions. For example, something like: “Do you want us to follow up with you about a free demo?”

Then, after the webinar, this lets your sales team follow-up by saying, “Hi, I’m just following up on your request for a demo…”

## 7. Personalize Your Event Reminder Emails

Your reminder email should come from the presenter.

For example: “Hi, this is Larry. So glad you signed up for this event. Looking forward to chatting with you tomorrow.”

This small thing can increase attendance rates from 20 to 33 percent. That’s huge!

## 8. Send Out the Recording immediately

As every entrepreneur knows, opportunities don’t last forever. If someone is slightly interested in your webinar today, chances are two days from now they’ll be less interested — if they haven’t forgotten about it entirely!

People lose interest quickly, so send out your webinar recording quickly. Keep your leads engaged. Don’t let hot prospects go cold!

## 9. Follow Up With Non-Attendees

People who don’t attend are still good leads. Actually they may be even better leads since it means they’re busy people and likely to need whatever it is you’re selling.

Webinar attendance versus non-attendance isn’t a discriminating factor in lead quality. So don’t make the critical mistake of assuming that people who didn’t attend aren’t interested in your product or service.

## 10. Practice Your Presentation a Few Times

Not everyone is a naturally gifted speaker. In fact, while it may look giving outstanding presentations is second nature to some speakers, what you never see is all hours of research and practice that went into creating that presentation.

If you want to deliver an amazing webinar that people will remember, it’s essential to take the time to practice your presentation.

Consider doing a practice run in front of a colleague, friend, or family member.

Another tip: record yourself giving the presentation and listen back to see what areas need work. You may discover [bad speaking habits](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/these-13-bad-speaking-habits-are-killing-your-credibility.html) that you can easily fix.

## 11. Make Your Webinar Interactive

Solo webinars are terrible. We live in a world of short attention spans. After 15–20 minutes, the mind starts to wander, no matter how skilled and knowledgeable he or she is.

To avoid losing your audience, use an active moderator who can ask questions dynamically. Make it more conversational — like a radio program with back and forth and callers interjecting. This will make sure your audience stays engaged and entertained.

# It’s Okay To Be Average.

## 

People call me average all the time. I work an average job in a bank, earn an average salary, drive a very average Honda, live in an average place and catch the train to work with the rest of the ‘average folk.’

**Social media tells us that it’s not okay to be average.**

If we’re not traveling, trying out the latest product, attending an event with thousands of people, running a marathon or drinking a green smoothie with our dog then there’s something wrong with us.

*Right?*

*Wrong.*

Being average is perfectly fine.

![Image Credit: Shutterstock](1*rK0TT4flfKCWbYfHMilAwg.jpeg)*Image Credit: Shutterstock*

## Average is cool.

The people that make a difference in this world are often the people you’ve never heard of. Average is the new cool. What’s in fashion becomes out of fashion.

The fashion of having to be extraordinary is quickly becoming out of fashion. The people that are being noticed are average citizens doing good in the world.

Average people are sharing their struggles. 
Average people are giving speeches.
Average people are raising money for good causes.
> # Average people are inventing businesses that solve real problems not first world problems like conveniently packaged junk food to your front door.

I’m average and I’m bloody proud of it. You should be proud of being average too.

See, the thing is that average is just a state of mind. Average is not about an obsession with one’s self but about going beyond one’s self. The opposite of average is to be all about one’s self.

Be average and make your life about more than just you and what you’ve done. No one will remember that.
> **Average people do cool things too they just don’t get noticed for it and that’s okay.**

## Billionaires, founders, influencers and celebrities are overrated.

Lots of you reading this are chasing one of these labels.

Often, we don’t know any better. We’re all greyhounds running the same race and we think the finish line of these titles is the goal — it’s not.
> # Don’t follow what everybody else is doing. Live your path and do what makes sense for your life.

Billionaires have issues with money. They spend their lives trying to get more and stop people from stealing their money.

90% of founders have their startup fail in the first five years.

Influencers are often the most lonely people on the planet despite their millions of followers. After a while the follower count means nothing. These influencers often have no meaning to their life and are acting out most of what you see.

The online world is deceiving. What you think are happy influencers are often messed up individuals. Meet an influencer in real life and you’ll soon see a different person. That’s not always a bad thing and some influencers I’ve met are doing extraordinary things behind closed doors — Prince EA is one of those people.

Now on to celebrities. If you’ve watched TMZ once before then you’ll know that celebrities are quite messed up. They have huge career highs often followed by massive lows. Drugs is another issue.

**Many of these labels we think we want are overrated.**

On the cereal box, these labels look delicious until you live the life of that label and realize — like I did — that they’re not the holy grail.

## You don’t hear about average people as much.

I’m one of those people. I sit behind my computer each week typing out blog posts because I want to make a difference. I’m focusing on legacy and purpose.

You don’t hear about us average people much, but you do see the difference we make — you just don’t know it was us. I’m fine with that honestly.

## Loving the simple things is okay.

Average people love the simple things and that’s why we’re called average.

Simple things like:

* Family

* A roof over our head

* The ability to travel

* The food we’re having for dinner

All of these simple things are a disguise for meaning. In these simple things, there is more meaning and purpose than you could ever hope for.

Be average and find something you love. That could be your family, a place or even an average job. No matter what, find something regardless of whether the crowd says it’s average or not.

## The real message: Make A Difference.

What am I really trying to say? I’m trying to tell you to make a difference above all else. Don’t worry about whether that difference is considered average or not because in the end, only your opinion matters.
> # “Every time I’ve followed someone else’s dream I’ve been disappointed and hit rockbottom”

Other people’s dreams won’t make you happy even if they promise you an escape from the average life.

Escaping average is not what matters.

What matters is the difference you make.

# The Career Flywheel&#58; 4 Steps to Runaway Career Growth

## Don’t build a career ladder. Create a flywheel that builds momentum to dramatically propel you forward. Here’s how.

![](0*t2gd5HxQ7PRlx66G.jpg)

In a previous post, I wrote about the importance of [“balance sheet” thinking](http://www.sean-johnson.com/incredible-power-working-free/) vs. “income statement” thinking. The idea is to think of your career like an asset that pays dividends over time.

While most people think of their careers in terms of cash in — cash out (I work for 10 hours, you pay me for 10 hours), asset-based thinking realizes certain career investments will more than pay for themselves and are worth the delayed gratification.

When done well, your career stops looking like a ladder — slowly climbing rung after rung.

Instead, it starts to look like a flywheel. Once you get it moving, it accelerates faster and faster. It might take a ton of momentum to get that first revolution going, but each subsequent revolution gets easier and easier.

It’s a very different way of thinking about your career, but one that can dramatically alter your career trajectory.

## The Typical Career Progression

Payscale [did a study](https://www.payscale.com/gender-lifetime-earnings-gap#methodology) looking at worker’s average lifetime earnings. They segmented their data out by gender, so I’m extrapolating a bit, but in general, the typical career progression looks like this:

![](0*wvnDy1jbkUmZvbED.png)

*(Note: Compensation is obviously not the only variable one should consider when making career decisions. But it can often be a pretty solid directional indicator of one’s progression in their career.)*

You typically will make around 60% more at 30 than you did when you started. And around 45 or so you top off at 110% of your initial salary when you started. From 45–65 you will typically have an extended plateau.

Given this, you can think your career as having two phases — the **Growth Phase** where you’re working to get increase your worth as much as you can, and the **Harvesting Phase** where you reap the benefits of all the hard work you put into the first phase.

![](1*7NueRhYh8ddV9y1ZIraCiQ.png)

## The Career Flywheel

I would submit you have two objectives in manipulating this curve.

The first is to **make the slope of the Growth Phase as steep as possible**. In the event you do eventually plateau, your Harvesting phase will be much more lucrative.

Even better is to **avoid the plateau altogether**. To have generated such momentum that you blow right past where things taper for most people and just keep on growing.

This is what the Career Flywheel can do for you — maximize your ascent, and avoid the plateau.

But how practically can you do this? How do you build your Career Flywheel?

I would submit there are four levers you can use to build your flywheel:

* **Mastery**

* **Network**

* **Brand**

* **Wealth**

Let’s explore how these can work for you.

## Pursuing Mastery

Mastery is the foundational lever. It’s the one that’s available to anyone who decides to pursue it. It’s the process of becoming really good at something.

Good can mean many things. It can simply mean possessing knowledge of a particular domain. Anyone who commits to a **discipline of reading** and synthesizing can pursue this.

Tony Robbins used to say spending an hour a day reading about a topic would put you in the top 1% in the world in terms of expertise around that topic. This gets magnified if you pursue a systematic approach to [remembering what you read](http://www.sean-johnson.com/how-to-remember-everything-you-read/).

But to really internalize a topic, it’s helpful to actually **get experience** with it. This isn’t always possible (I’m learning about quantum computing right now, even though practically I won’t be getting hands on experience.) But with most disciplines it is.

I don’t believe you should wait for your boss or organization to give you opportunities to practice. If they do, amazing. But in most cases you’ll need to submit to some form of self study.

A common approach in product design circles is to do a “design a day”. They’ll identify a design challenge (a login/registration dialog, for example), and attempt to design it. They’re typically using it as an opportunity to learn the UX of a particular interface, while also learning how to implement a particular design technique.

Go on Udemy or Coursera and look for courses in the domain you’re interested in. Either take the courses directly, or use them as an outline to build your own curriculum.

The other approach is do take on side projects. It’s one of the reasons [I beat the drum around working for free so much](http://www.sean-johnson.com/incredible-power-working-free/). When you think of it as an investment in your career, you no longer are worried about how much money you’re making on the project. You’re worried about getting as many reps as possible in the shortest time possible. You’re focused on your portfolio of experience, not your checking account.

I believe anyone who seriously submits themselves to a discipline of reading one hour each day, coupled with completing at least one project a week will position themselves much more successfully for the rest of their career. They’ll be able to start charging more for what they do, and pursue projects with more visibility.

They will have built the first critical leg of their flywheel.

## Building a Network

The second critical step is to build a network. A strong network is the primary mechanism people use to surface new opportunities. The best people don’t have to submit resumes to job sites. Because people come to them.

Some people feel like you can’t start building a network until you’re achieved mastery. While the kinds of opportunities you’ll see will certainly be more compelling and lucrative as you get better at what you do, you can start building your network immediately.

The secret is to focus on helping people. Go above and beyond what is typically expected to find out what people need and serve them.

The people who you aspire to be like — where do they hang out? What events do they attend?

Attend those events. Get to know them. Learn what they’re trying to accomplish in their career. Be listening for ways you can help. It could be sending them a book you’ve read related to a problem they’re trying to solve. It could be an introduction. It could be an offer to volunteer some of your time (another project for your portfolio!).

Don’t play the “collect business cards” game. Set a goal to get to know one person at each event well.

Take it to another level — who are the organizers of those events? Volunteer and get involved in those organizations, whatever that looks like. Say yes to all the crappy stuff no one else wants to do.

Don’t worry about what you’ll get out of all this help you’re providing. Don’t keep a tally. I promise it pays dividend far beyond what you invest in it. It just happens in scattershot, serendipitous, almost mystical ways.

If you want to put your networking process on steroids you can [leverage the 5/25/150 networking strategy](http://www.sean-johnson.com/how-to-be-a-better-networker/) my buddy uses to systematically add value to his most important relationships. It’s not for the faint of heart. But after implementing it for several years, the guy has access to literally anybody he wants at any time.

Pursuing mastery and building a network put you in a position to start pursuing the third lever of your Career Flywheel.

## Create a brand

One of the unfortunate misunderstandings of the Instagram generation is the belief that you build a brand first. While there are certainly examples of people who’ve done this, I would argue it’s the exception to the rule.

More importantly, it’s a brand built on a super shaky foundation. I’ve met dozens of people over the years who seem like they are competent, only to find out there’s nothing of substance underneath all their bombast.

The right order is to pursue mastery first. THEN start talking about it. Not the other way around.

What if you don’t have the expertise yet? Is there anything you can do?

The wrong answer is to attempt to convince people you’re good at things you aren’t, or that you’ve achieved a level of success you haven’t. Don’t rent the lambo and film yourself in your garage.

Instead, my buddy [Nick Seguin](https://twitter.com/nickseguin) suggests becoming known for **competencies** rather than skills early on.

If you develop a reputation for being hungry and curious (which you will have by now through your pursuit of mastery and your focus on helping your fledgling network), that in itself can be a great foundation for a brand.

Being known for curiosity and hustle will start to open doors for you, which will give you chances to improve your skills and meet interesting people, who will see your drive and want to introduce you to more opportunities. And so it goes.

Once you have mastery, by all means leverage it. There are plenty of people to follow to learn how to build your brand. [Gary Vaynerchuk](http://garyvaynerchuk.com/) is a great one.

The rules are fairly simple. Get clarity on your message. Identify the channels that will be most effective at sharing your message. Be consistent about creating content around your message (it’s much easier to have ideas about what to talk about if you’ve already done the work of becoming an expert).

Write. Speak at events. Create video or audio. Take an idea and tailor it to as many mediums as make sense. Engage with your followers. Give, give, give. Ask occasionally, but focus on providing value.

But please, don’t get intoxicated by the temptation to shortcut the process. That guy toiled in the aisles of wine stores for years, learning how to sell and manage and grow a business before attempting to give anyone advice about how to do it themselves.

A great personal brand can be incredibly powerful. But focus on acquiring skills. Become great at them, then talk about it. In the meantime, simply be known for your work ethic, curiosity and character.

## Avoid the Plateau: Reinvest wealth

Build the first three levers and you will dramatically alter the slope of the Growth Phase of your career. You will start having more lucrative, interesting opportunities more often.

You will start building wealth. This doesn’t mean that you’ll be “wealthy”. It simply means that you will have more resources than you did previously.

![](0*jcvizLJPbiKbQSEh.png)

This is where many people go wrong. There is a huge tendency for people’s standard of living to increase as they make more money.

It’s okay to have some increases. But just like you want to make sure you’re investing a portion of that income into retirement, saving or investing accounts, you should reinvest as much as you can back into your career. Specifically, you can invest them into the first three components of your flywheel.

This is how you bust out of the plateau.

Reinvesting your wealth into your Career Flywheel will further increase and accelerate the slope of your Growth Phase. But even more important, it has the power to delay or even permanently eliminate the plateau that you typically see in a Harvesting phase.

![](0*ieS3PLdaNzQws4kn.png)

What are some examples of investments you can make?

**Increasing Mastery:**

* Attend conferences or take higher level courses that might have been prohibitive before.

* Hire a part time assistant to learn management skills and to free up your time to focus on learning.

* Make capital investments to accelerate your skills — better gear, etc.

* Acquire new skills you didn’t previously have.

**Improving your Network**

* Identify higher level people that you’d love to add to your network. Figure out the conferences they attend and go to them.

* Create a travel budget specifically for visiting cities where these folks live to get coffee or lunch.

* Use the resources to help your network in ways that might have been prohibitive before.

**Build Your Brand**

* Hire someone to help you scale the creation and distribution of content.

* Submit speaker proposals to conferences, even if you have to pay to go to them.

* Level up your website.

* Get nicer cards or better clothes.

* Be like Garyvee and get a videographer to follow you around all day :)

## Building your Career flywheel

Start building mastery. At the same time begin to cultivate a better network. Once you actually have something interesting to say, begin to create a brand. And use the income generated from the increases in those areas to reinvest back into your career.

Most of all, be patient. Everyone’s in such a hurry to be successful immediately. As a result they flit from thing to thing, looking for the silver bullet that leads to immediate success. Life doesn’t work that way.

Your Career Flywheel isn’t a one year endeavor. Plan to spend your entire career investing in building it. And plan to constantly reinvest back into it as you start to level up.

Track your time each week. Set a goal to spend 5% or 10% or 20% of your time investing in your Career Flywheel. Get a buddy to hold yourself accountable if you need to.

Putting in the work isn’t glamorous. It isn’t always fun. It will be slow going in the beginning.

But over time you’ll build momentum. Your flywheel will start going faster and faster. Eventually the momentum will carry you with it.

In 10 years you’ll look back and be completely blown away by the progress you’ve made. And you’ll know the next 10 years will be even more incredible. Your job will become to learn how to hold on for dear life without blowing everything up.

You will have achieved runaway career growth.

# There’s Nothing Better Than A Deadline (Literally Nothing!)

## Image Credit: The Ringer

Anyone who has worked in the business of sales or has been around it would have been beaten over the head with the power of deadlines.

Or if you’ve read a blog post on productivity or goal-setting, you would have seen deadlines as well.

I’ve fallen in love with deadlines and it’s how I stay productive.

## Without a deadline you’re useless.

Let me give you an example. If I have a deadline, I produce twice as many blog posts.

Right now I’m seven days away from going to Europe which means everything I’m currently doing has to be finished quick smart.

Last week I had a day where I had nothing booked, no meetings and no phone calls. I put aside the whole day to write. Instead, what ended up happening was I sat there and watched YouTube, binged on Facebook and read a few articles.

In other words, I pissed the entire day up the wall and had nothing to show for it (nice one Timbo).

If you think about people on the brink of retirement, they suffer from the same problem. They think that when they retire, they can finally travel or learn the piano or spend time with their kids.
> When these fun-loving folk finally reach retirement, they don’t do half of what they said they would. They waited their entire life to do the things they love and they don’t do it.

Saving up tasks to complete in the future is a complete waste of time. You need a deadline otherwise you’ll never get to your goals/tasks/dreams.

## I make up deadlines.

A little hack I use is to make up deadlines.

Every Saturday is my writing day. It’s when I bust my chops to deliver you as many helpful articles I can, for free, with the most beautiful imagery I can find on the internet, that will inspire you and make you take action.

It’s bloody hard work.

To achieve this enormous weekly task that sucks up all my energy, I put a deadline at the end of the day.

I promise my girlfriend dinner at 6 pm every Saturday which means I have to be done by 5 pm. Failure to meet this deadline involves a slow and torturous death by my girlfriend who will never let me hear the end of being late to a romantic dinner date.

This deadline not only gives me a hard stop to be done writing by, but it also gives me something to look forward to. It makes all the pain and sweat of writing worth it. It’s how I celebrate.

If you struggle with deadlines, then try making up your own one.

Purposely place an event in your calendar right after the goal you want to achieve. Make it something you can’t get out of without experiencing a lot of pain (or in my case ‘death by girlfriend’).

## The illusion of free time.

The best habit you can cultivate is to focus on ‘the doing’ no matter what day, time or month of the year we’re in.

The moment you need to set aside time is the moment nothing will happen and you’ll find your long lost friend called procrastination.
> # “When you don’t feel like it is the best time to work on your goals”

Whenever we have free time, we think we have all day when we don’t. Digital distractions can rob you of an entire day faster than I can drink a Matcha Latte.

Next time you hear yourself saying “I’ll do it during this block of free time” be suspicious of yourself. See through your own BS.

## It’s all in the mind.

The battle of achieving your goals takes place in the mind mostly.
> # “Deadlines are just a way to sort of trick your brain into working with you rather than against you”
> **We’re wired to be fat, lazy bastards who should be scared of the big, bad world we live in.**

Using reframe techniques like deadlines helps our mind think clearly and focus on what we want.

Our million-year-old brain is not there to make us win and so using deadlines is how we can program it to help us win big.

Deadlines are beautiful.

Until you’ve played around with deadlines, you won’t see the beauty in them like I do.

The reason I love deadlines is because they are such a simple hack.

**Simplicity is beauty in disguise.**
> # “We’re often led to believe that whatever we dream of in life is incredibly difficult and our chance of success is almost zero. When you discover 2–3 little life hacks like deadlines, you start to see the impossible becoming possible”

I never thought I’d have the time, creativity, stories or knowledge to ever be a blogger. It always sounded really hard.

I then used deadlines, habits, and energy from a clean diet to blog my way to my goals. It’s a beautiful thing when you can see how the world really works through tools like deadlines.

## Deadlines work.

You can win at life.

All you need to do is pick a goal and whack a nice deadline activity at the end of it that gives you leverage against yourself to defeat procrastination.

Give deadlines a shot!

# The Pursuit of Happiness, and the Power of Intention

## 
> # “It was right then that I started thinking about Thomas Jefferson on the Declaration of Independence, and the part about our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And I remember thinking, how did he know to put the pursuit part in there?”
> # Chris, from The Pursuit of Happyness

## **Chasing the American Dream**

There are many books, songs and movies about our struggles over adversity, in chasing the American dream. And, of course, we identify with these heroes. That’s why these stories are created, to connect with audiences. But it’s not hard to get lost in the irony of ‘Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness’ from our *Declaration of Independence*. Based on recent history, it’s obvious that not all our dreams are playing out as our forefathers had planned.

## **The Pursuit of Happyness**

In this movie, life is a struggle for single father Chris Gardner (Will Smith). Having been evicted from their apartment, he and his young son (Jaden Smith) find themselves alone with no home. The pair lives in shelters and endures many hardships. Chris refuses to give in taking a new job that will change their lives.

## **Find Optimism**

The story is so far fetched, we probably wouldn’t believe it, if it wasn’t based on a true story. Even through the Hollywood polish, we are charmed by his dignity, his independence and the habitual optimism that drives his persona. Even in the darkest days, his power of intention carries him through.


## **The Psychology of Happy**

We get much broader perspective on the pursuit of happiness with the indie documentary, *Happy*. The filmmaker, Roko Belic, interviews a number of influential experts from the positive Psychology field, including the author of “Flow” and introduces ideas that can help us mindfully create a happier life. The movie takes us around the world, looking at different people in various economic situations. We learn a lot about people with very little.

For example, much poorer countries like Iceland and Puerto Rico easily surpass the U.S., in the “Happy” category. The movie makes a case, after basic necessities like food and shelter, that economic factors have relatively little to do with overall satisfaction in life.


## **Power of Intention**

After the 50 percent of the ‘happiness’ we get at the genetic level, only 10 percent comes from social status, income, age and health, combined. 40 percent of our overall happiness is determined by intentional behavior. These are things we can do on a regular basis to become happier, and lead more fulfilling lives.

We can gain more happiness with exercise, being in nature and adding more variety to our lives. But most importantly, it seems intentionally balancing our work and personal life is the most influential factor in a happy life.

It’s not always easy to schedule time for more personal explorations, but after seeing these movies, it won’t be so hard.

# Make Your Life a Story Worth Reading

## Be the Hero that You’re Meant to Be.

![Photo by [Joshua Earle](https://unsplash.com/photos/-87JyMb9ZfU?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/collections/2238096/story?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](0*loaTU6KWfOiD1bTK.jpg)*Photo by [Joshua Earle](https://unsplash.com/photos/-87JyMb9ZfU?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/collections/2238096/story?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

*“Your life is your story. Write well. Edit often,” *wrote Susan Statham, capturing the essence of self-improvement and the conscious practice of crafting a life. And as [Joan Didion memorably put it](https://www.amazon.com/Tell-Ourselves-Stories-Order-Live/dp/0307264874), *“we tell ourselves stories in order to live.”*

Indeed, our stories may be a critical component in living, but as Gabriel García Márquez reflected,* “life is not what one lived, but what one remembers and how one remembers it in order to recount it.”*

While Winston Churchill famously said that history would be kind to him because he intended to write it, many of us perform this same narrative editing, casting our actions and exploits in a better light than perhaps they deserve. As George R.R. Martin put it,
> # “Nobody is a villain in their own story. We’re all the heroes of our own stories.”

But what if we weren’t the primary narrator? What if we read our story without the biased perspectives that we’re so adept at adding?

Would it still be a story worth reading?

Would we like the main character?

And would we be happy with the end?

### What is a Good Story Anyways?
> # “It has always been the prime function of mythology and rite to supply the symbols that carry the human spirit forward, in counteraction to those that tend to tie it back.” — *Joseph Campbell*

There’s no universal answer to what makes a compelling story. As a wise-beyond-her-years fourteen year-old Sylvia Plath [once told her mother](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/03/sylvia-plath-letters-home-first-tragic-poem/),
> # “Once a poem is made available to the public, the right of interpretation belongs to the reader.”

Yet the stories that stand the test of time contain many similarities. From Homer’s Odyssey and Dante’s Inferno to Lucas’s Star Wars and Rowling’s Harry Potter, many of our common hero stories follow the same framework.

Legendary mythologist Joseph Campbell points this out in [*The Hero with a Thousand Faces](https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Faces-Collected-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8).* After reading hundreds of stories, he developed “[the hero’s journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey),” a 17-stage outline showing how heroes depart from their status quo, answer the call for adventure, and overcome crisis and temptation on their way to transformation.

Discussed in a [recent Mission: Daily podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-mission-daily/id1382999024?mt=2#), [Chad Grills](https://twitter.com/ChadGrills) and [Ian Faison](https://twitter.com/ianfaison), point out that while the hero’s journey offers a common framework, it also presents a call for originality. While there may be a common theme, there’s endless variations.

So instead of considering what makes a compelling story, perhaps it’s better to consider what stage our story is currently in. And whether we’re seizing the opportunity for that originality.

### Have You Answered the Call?
> # “The big question is whether you are going to be able to say a hearty yes to your adventure.” — *Joseph Campbell*

Imagine *Star Wars *if Luke decided to stay on Tatooine. Maybe move to Mos Eisley and pay for a flat by picking up shifts as a dishwasher at Chalman’s Cantina. Or how would [*The 4-Hour Workweek](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357)* have turned out if Tim Ferriss elected to play it safe in the supplement industry?

Great stories start with an initiation. A call to adventure. Something that breaks the main character out of their current status quo and challenges them to take a risk for something better.

And most people who never take this call — never break free from their own complacency — assume it’s because they never received it. They’re waiting for a half-giant to kick down the door and tell them they’re a wizard.

But the call for adventure doesn’t need to occur when your younger sister is selected for the Hunger Games. It could be taking the opportunity to learn about something new. Or find a new job. Or deciding to start a family.

It could be recognizing the need to step in and help someone. Or become involved in a cause. Or just start asking yourself some questions on meaning and fulfillment.

Growth is what makes life compelling. It’s what makes it fulfilling. And all growth comes from that decision to step outside the bounds of our current limits and start an adventure for something better.

So stop waiting for Morpheus to call and tell you that you’re the one. As Thomas Edison put it, *“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.” *Look for the calls that are already in front of you. Because once you start looking, you’ll start seeing them.

And in Campbell’s wise words,* “We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.”*

### Are You Following Your Own Path?
> # “If you can see your path laid out in front of you step by step, you know it’s not your path. Your own path you make with every step you take. That’s why it’s your path.” *— Joseph Campbell*

We’re all under constant pressure to follow the proven path. The majority of advice consists of people telling others what worked for them, and assuming that everyone should merely mimic their methods.

But excellence comes from self-expression. And stories that follow an obvious script offer few risks — few dramatic questions — that keep us turning the pages.

Parker Palmer, a former ad man turned founder for the [Center of Courage and Renewal](http://www.couragerenewal.org/), also followed a beaten path in pursuit of riches over fulfillment. Until one day [he awoke to a haunting realization](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/02/parker-palmer-let-your-life-speak/),
> # “The life I am living is not the same as the life that wants to live in me.”

We take the well-trod path because it’s safe. We know it will be more predictable and less risky than the alternative of trudging through the forest and clearing our own way.

But often the greatest risk is in taking no risk at all. And in Campbell’s words,
> # “Regrets are illuminations come too late.”

The alternative is to be true to our own interests. [Choose presence over the distractions of productivity ](https://medium.com/the-mission/productivitys-overrated-choose-to-be-present-and-enjoy-life-937554a38069)and let your passion guide your steps, regardless of the obstacles this places in your path.

Campbell, a man who considered our greatest transgression to be *“the sin of inadvertence, of not being alert, not quite awake,”* saw the solution to be: *“follow your bliss.”* As he told legendary interviewer Bill Moyers in a [conversation at Skywalker Ranch](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/04/09/find-your-bliss-joseph-campbell-power-of-myth/) and later transcribed in [*The Power of Myth](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Myth-Joseph-Campbell-ebook/dp/B004QZACH6/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)*,
> # “If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Wherever you are — if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment, that life within you, all the time.”

Great stories and great characters share an authentic connection. They believe in their path because it’s their own and their journey is driven by their own sense of bliss.

Are you following your bliss down your own path? Or are you sacrificing that authenticity for the seemingly safe, well-trod path. Only one of those leads to a story worth reading. And as Campbell put it, *“Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls.”*

### Where Are You Going to Stop?
> # “The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.” *— Joseph Campbell*

The hero’s journey is fraught with challenge. Frequent temptations threaten to pull us from our quest. And there are often setbacks and delays, losses and heartbreak. The difference between a great story and a dissatisfying ending doesn’t lie in whether we overcome these challenges and temptations on our first attempt, but in how we respond to each setback.

Do we choose to stop? Or do we keep going? As Orson Welles wisely said,
> # “If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.”

As we answer the call for adventure and elect to make our own path, we need to accept the progress as well as the stumbles. We need to acknowledge those challenges and temptations that will periodically get the better of us.

We often place a great deal of emphasis on that first step. But the most important step that we can take is not the first step, but the next one.

Because in those unavoidable times when we struggle and fall, it’s the decision to take that next step which keeps our story going. The next step keeps us from accepting the person we are at that moment and [keeps us from allowing our story to end with that failure](http://www.dailycareergrowth.com/rejection-sucks-can/).

The next step keeps us growing. It keeps us on our path. And it prevents failure from defining our end.

As Churchill put it, *“If you’re going through hell, keep going.”* When do you plan to stop? How do you want your journey to end? And which one will give you an ending you’ll be happy with?

### Make Yours a Story Worth Reading
> # “We’re not on our journey to save the world but to save ourselves. But in doing that you save the world. The influence of a vital person vitalizes.”* — Joseph Campbell*

Today is but one sentence on one page of the book that will eventually become your life. A sentence that adds onto yesterday’s which builds from last week’s and frames the ones that are yet unwritten.

One sentence. But what is a story if not but a collection of those sentences. And [quoting Annie Dillard](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/06/07/annie-dillard-the-writing-life-1/), *“how we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives.”*

Today is your story. And mine. Let’s choose to make them stories worth reading.

*Thanks, as always, for reading! Please don’t hesitate to chime in with any thoughts. I’d love to hear from you. And if you found this helpful, I’d appreciate if you could clap it up* 👏*and help me share with more people. Cheers!*

# Startups Compete in the New Sports Betting Arena

## 

It’s time to place your bets!

Sports wagering is definitely on.

The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down a federal law that previously made it illegal to bet on sports events in any state other than Nevada opens up a new world of opportunities for sports companies and related startups.

The unprecedented convenience of online wagering, including mobile, certainly comes as extremely welcome news to sports betting app developers, while simultaneously enabling new avenues for eSports, sports social media and a wide range of analytics platforms to pursue.

Not surprisingly, the new sports betting ecosystem includes a plethora of sports-related startups, all competing for a piece of the potentially lucrative industry as it hits the mainstream.

But which startups are making the most significant initial impact and showing the brightest signs of success? Observing the latest reports, some trends become apparent.

The sports betting ecosystem has been harnessing the advantages of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, especially when it comes to establishing reliable and trustworthy environments for bettors and bookmakers. Matt Corva, counsel for ConsenSys, told Bloomberg, “A betting business built on blockchain technology might assuage some of the historical concerns held by people about sports betting in the U.S., such as the threat of collusion, money laundering, and tax evasion, all of which would be more easily identifiable and enforceable with a trustworthy shared ledger and the robust identity frameworks blockchain can provide.”

At the same time, legalized sports betting is further driving sports fans’ demand for viewing live sports content. Thus, it stands to reason that a number of emerging startups are trying to seize the opportunity and fulfill bettors’ demand for information.

Here are some interesting sports startups which are gaining momentum and taking advantage of the broad opportunities in this rapidly growing industry.

**Proof of Toss **aims to modernize the betting landscape by building a decentralized system powered by blockchain. With the hope to “set a new standard for the industry” with its blockchain-based protocol for sports gambling, users of the platform can create wagers, bet on events, and judge the outcome of games to compete for TOSS tokens. You can even earn rewards by participating in the platform as a judge.

**Unikrn **is another promising startup in the sports betting landscape with its $15 million funding round from accredited investors in advance of its public initial coin offering (ICO). Known as the only fully-licensed and regulated eSports gambling platform, Unikrn started in 2014 and is now expanding with its own ERC20 token called UnikoinGold. Users with tokens will gain access to a range of premium content, such as raffles, exclusive features, and the potential to win prizes. The firm aims to raise $100 million through the public ICO to allow for the development of an upgraded skill-based betting platform.

**WinView Inc. **plans to use its $12 million Series B funding round to further develop and market its skill-based mobile app across all major professional sports. With the intriguing slogan “Get paid watching sports on TV,” WinView’s platform allows fans to become play-along-live participants, thereby bringing together live TV sports coverage with mobile apps, skilled games, and interactive advertising to create an innovative experience. Users who correctly predict plays in the game can win cash prizes in addition to interacting with other fans and the teams themselves.

**Wave **is an interesting sports media startup just coming off a $3.3 million funding round, which included digital media visionary Larry Braitman. The company was founded in 2017 with the goal of delivering content to sports fans on the primary platforms that they use. With an impressive reach that includes a network of 24 million followers, 725 million monthly content views, and 50 million engagements per month, Wave shows great potential for expansion in the coming period. It owns and operates in excess of 100 social channels covering a wide range of sports, teams, and stars.

**TAPPP**, a startup sports streaming platform, enlivens the traditional digital environment by providing customers with exclusive access to premium live sports content. Currently, TAPPP distributes pre-paid card access to Major League Baseball’s (MLB) MLB.TV streaming service as well as the National Football League’s (NFL) NFL Games Pass. The cards are already available at over 5,000 retailers including Walmart and Gamestop. Although the platform does not provide any betting related features, timely access to the exclusive MLB and NFL content can make an essential difference for avid sports bettors. OurCrowd’s ADvantage Fund has just acknowledged the potential of the startup by investing $5 million to support the company’s long-term plans to extend their reach even further and to develop new sports media products.

Sports betting is poised to enter the mainstream in a big way, leading to a multitude of new players developing innovative platforms with exciting concepts to engage fans and expand the size of the relatively new yet rapidly-growing market.

# Making Music Social&#58; What Drives Streaming Revenues

## 

Following many years of declining revenues, the music industry has finally started growing exponentially, with consumption in the first half of 2018 reaching the highest peak we’ve seen for the past 15 years. The total music consumption in 2017, which combines traditional album sales, track equivalent album units, and on-demand streaming equivalent album units from video and audio streams, increased by 12.5 percent to reach 636.65 million units. Clearly, the music industry is experiencing a powerful resurgence that shows no signs of slowing down.

Simultaneously, we see massive growth in social media usage. To give you an idea, a recent Pew Research Center survey finds that the majority of U.S. adults visit social media sites on a daily basis.

Not surprisingly, these related trends are resulting in the significant integration of social networks and music platforms, providing new levels of music engagement for fans and new revenue potential for social media sites. Are we headed for a time when the division between music platforms and social media networks disappears?

### **Social Music**

Music has always been a primarily social activity. At the same time, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who isn’t immersed in social media these days. From young children to older adults and everyone in between, social networks have become a fabric of our society. So, it’s only natural that people are increasingly using social media sites to share the music that they love with their friends and family, telling everyone about a new song or artist that’s making a difference in their lives and following updates from their favorite artists and bands. As Russ Crupnick declares: “[Music drives social media](http://www.musicwatchinc.com/blog/music-scores-a-gold-record-on-the-social-media-charts/)”.

While traditional features of connecting with social media platforms for sharing, following and liking continue to exist, a new world of additional tools is being introduced to increase user engagement and encourage socializing among listeners. For instance, streaming giant Spotify has released Branded Playlists as a method for brands to create engagement, while Choon is offering the world’s first Monetized Playlists. Another example is Instagram and Spotify joining together to release a new sharing feature, allowing users to post what they’re enjoying on Spotify to their Instagram Story simply by tapping the option while listening to a song. The new “Friends Mix” from Apple Music, which is already available in beta for selected listeners, suggests songs based on what a user’s friends listen to. SoundCloud has just relaunched comments on mobile with a brand new experience for both iOS and Android users. And we expect the list of companies that will jump on board to continue growing from there.

### **Looking Behind the Curtain**

Who and what is behind these convergences? Social networks and music companies are increasingly joining together in licensing deals to ensure that artists and songwriters earn royalties from all the music played on social networks. YouTube has struck deals with both Universal Music Group and Sony, while Facebook has entered into licensing deals with Universal, Sony, and Warner Music Group. At DataArt, we meet more and more companies looking to upgrade their software and digital assets to comply with current market requirements. Both social networks and music businesses increasingly invest in development and improvement of their copyright management systems and other technical solutions, such as digital fingerprinting and automating content recognition technologies that are intended to enhance the industry’s ability to track and manage music.

Spotify has been acquiring a wide range of startup tech companies to expand its reach into the tech world that drives the digital music industry. The recent purchase of music identification firm Sonalytic is supposed to help the streaming giant track copyright-protected materials, while the acquisition of machine-learning startup Niland is meant to help build better personalized playlists and thus support user involvement. And how about Spotify’s recent hiring of professor and AI researcher Francois Pachet? An expert on teaching computers to write music, Pachet is an interesting addition to the Spotify team, with the company explaining in a blog post that his role will be heading up its new Creator Technology Research Lab, which will “focus on making tools to help artists in their creative process.” Will this also include tools for artists to engage and communicate with their fans?

On the other side of the fence, Facebook is making giant steps towards the music business. In January, the company hired Tamara Hrivnak,, former YouTube and WMG executive, to lead the network’s global music licensing strategy. Facebook has also been actively enhancing its Rights Manager system to compete with YouTube’s Content ID. In addition, to better protect music content creators’ rights, the social network acquired Source3, a company established by the same people who created RightsFlow for Google.

As I stated at the beginning of this article, music has always been a very social activity. Therefore, the convergence of music with social media is a natural occurrence. Whether the division will completely disappear or simply become increasingly blurred is yet to be seen. However, it’s clear that these worlds are coming together profoundly to expand engagement and further the interests of artists, fans, and the entire music industry.

What are your thoughts about the merging of social media and music? Please share your opinions in the comments below.

# Tenacity + The Right Thing = 💥

## Tenacity + The Right Thing = 💥
> “Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.” ― Thomas A. Edison

![](0*UCe9xEEhhNlBX8PM)

### **Food For Thought**

## **Tenacity + The Right Thing = 💥**

It’s easy to be right about something when other people don’t see what you see.

It’s easy to be bold once.

It’s not actually that difficult to have a pretty good idea.

It’s a lot harder to do all those things a thousand times.

Two thousand.

Three.

If you’re looking to change the world — or heck, even just change yourself — being right isn’t enough. Having a great idea isn’t enough. Being bold isn’t enough.

You have to do all those things over and *over*. (And over.)

When Alex Mashinsky, CEO of the Celsius Network, [talked to us on *IT Visionaries*,](http://bit.ly/2Xr0SA4) he gave us a glimpse into this idea. He was working on technology that would eventually replace traditional phone lines, and many people scoffed at the thought of that industry giant ever taking a tumble:

“They’d say: ‘You can’t bring down the phone companies, they’re the strongest, most powerful companies on the planet.’ And those companies used to charge us three dollars a minute to call our friends and family. And now we are having this phone call with you for free. So tenacity, and doing the right thing, does pay off.”

It’s not just being smart, and it’s not just having a good idea. It’s sticking to it. The haters were so busy telling other people they couldn’t subvert the powers that be, they didn’t see when it got done.

Go into today with that knowledge. With that grit. You have the power to change things. Even if they seem impossible *at the time* —

They might not be impossible *always*.

### **Deep Dive**

## **Building The “Impossible”**

Hey. Things can seem impossible until they’re done. Here’s [a list of long-shot tech ideas](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/05/25/the-best-tech-innovations-of-the-last-three-years/#4864472b25a4) that are now a part of our reality. Thanks, Tenacity.

### **Further Reading**

## **Got Grit?**

If you’re looking for the deciding factor in success, don’t look at IQ. Don’t look at creativity. Look at Grit. In her book, [*Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance](https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth-ebook/dp/B010MH9V3W)*, Dr. Angela Duckworth looks at the factor that most accurately determines success. Can you guess what it is? 🤔

### **Marketing Trends**

## **Purpose-Driven Marketing**

Marketing has always been about more than just marketing for Paul D’Arcy. Throughout his entire career, Paul has sought to understand the purpose behind the messaging that he delivers. That passion for purpose has led Paul to serve as the CMO of MessageOne, Executive Director of Americas Marketing and Global Demand Gen at Dell, and now serves as Senior Vice President of Marketing at Indeed.

On this episode, Paul discusses his entry into marketing and what he has learned thus far in his career, including the importance of being purpose-driven, creating long-term customer memory, and maximizing creativity.

# How to Create a Personal Vision Statement

## 

*Read parts [**one ](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-get-focused-for-2019-4cefc9067df3)**and [**two ](https://medium.com/@ctaylormpearson/three-focus-failures-and-how-to-avoid-them-60538c3bbb4c)**of this series.*

Science Fiction author and futurist Arthur Clarke observed that there are two hazards of prophecy:

1. *failure of nerve*

1. *failure of imagination*

In 2012 I was working as a project manager at a boutique marketing agency in my hometown. I had a five year goal that I would be able start doing my job remotely or branch out and freelance so I could travel more. I was able to do that within 6 months.

Looking back on what’s happened in the intervening years, the possibilities and opportunities I’ve been exposed to were beyond even my wildest dreams when I began.

In 2012, I was mainly suffering from a failure of imagination. While there are legitimate obstacles that hold people back, often times the biggest one is our own conception of what is possible.

Over the last few years I have made a habit of sitting down every three to six months to just think about what is possible. I’ve developed a system to help me work through that question that I’d like to share here. As you sit down to reflect on 2018 and plan for 2019, I hope it helps you frame that in a more helpful light.

## The Power of a 25 year Vision

The first step in the system is to craft a 25 year vision. 25 years is somewhat arbitrary so if that feels too long, pick whatever amount of time is as far out into the future as you’re comfortable with (five and ten years are fine).

In a previous article, [*How To Get Focused for 2019](https://medium.com/@ctaylormpearson/how-to-get-focused-for-2019-4cefc9067df3)*, I talked about why I think a long-term vision is important.

For one, it’s motivating. A study by Vallacher and Wegner (1987) found that higher levels of meaning and motivation were consistently marked by longer time frames.

By starting with a longer time frame, you can connect the work you are doing today to something more meaningful and inspiring.

It can also help you identify new, better opportunities by priming yourself to see the world through a certain lens.

The final reason is that having a long-term vision can help with failures of imagination. When you set 1 year or even five year goals, there is a sense that time is running out and “*I won’t be able to make it.*” One of the biggest mistakes I’ve made and see others make is starting to think about how to accomplish the thing before just laying out what they want.

The result is that a sort-of subconsciously sabotage where you think “Oh I could never do that” and don’t even write it down. If you write it down, you might discover it’s more achievable than you initially thought.

By giving yourself a longer timeframe, like 25 years, you’re more likely to root the things you really want to do out of your head and avoid a failure of imagination.

## How to Craft Your 25-Year Vision

I’m going to walk through this exercise for your work life. In my popular [masterclass](https://taylorpearson.me/productivity-masterclass/) I talk about how you can apply it to other areas of your life (health, relationships, spirituality, etc.), but to keep this essay to a reasonable length, we’ll stick to work (though of course these lines are blurry!).

For crafting our vision, we’re going to use one question:

*“If you were reading this twenty five years from today, and reflecting on the events of those twenty five years, what has to have happened in your professional life for you to feel successful?”*

Before you get started on the answer, there is one important guideline:

1. **This should feel totally impossible and saying it out loud should feel embarrassing**.

1. As I mentioned before, one of the biggest mistakes people make is to start trying to figure out the “how” before they set the vision, and when they can’t immediately think of a way to accomplish their goal, they throw it out.

1. They end up setting goals which aren’t meaningful and exciting enough to keep them motivated so they end up quitting. Counterintuitively, if they’d set bigger goals, they would have been more likely to achieve them, not less.

## A Business/Career Example

Let’s walk through the exercise.

### Step 1: [Download or Copy the template here and scroll down to page 4 of the template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eoCUFwZT5hLapOE9crpdAkaXVsbi8fhDptlD-MFMH9g/edit?usp=sharing).

Respond to the question above: “If you were reading this twenty five years from today, and reflecting on the events of those twenty five years, what has to have happened in your professional life for you to feel successful?”

List everything you can think of.

Remember: Do not start thinking about how to make it happen. It’s essential to keep all these steps separate. If you start to think about “how do I do this,” you will start to make compromises because the vision might sound outlandish.

That’s why I like 25 years rather than one or three years, because it gives you so much time that you can think really expansively.

It’s also important to be honest with yourself. If you want to own a $250k sports car, write that down. I’d like to write a New York Times bestselling book. Is it vain and status seeking? Yes. Will it make me happy if I do it? Nope. But, I still think it would be cool, so it goes on the list.

![](0*cbrYLk_ugBGrnS0y.)

Once you feel like you have a good list, move onto step two.

### Step 2: For each of your aspirations, list what challenges need to be overcome

These challenges are weaknesses or problems that could hold you back.

For each challenge, ask the “5 Whys.” The 5 Whys is a heuristic developed by Toyota that predicts that the root of a problem is usually 5 Whys away from the first thing you say. For example:

**The vehicle will not start. (the challenge)**

**Why**? — The battery is dead. (first why)

**Why**? — The alternator is not functioning. (second why)

**Why**? — The alternator belt has broken. (third why)

**Why**? — The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. (fourth why)

**Why**? — The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (fifth why, a *root cause*)

Applying this strategy to one of the barriers to a given listed goal, looks like this:

![](0*LG6G7hSNVuQ_5oEO.)

You don’t have to get all the way to 5 Whys for each one, but go as far as you can to look for deeper root causes.

### Step 3: What opportunities need to be captured

These are advantages in the external environment, things you need to be leveraging to move you towards the goals you listed above.

So for “write a lot of books” as a goal, one opportunity might be “blocking off an hour every morning to write.”

This can just be a running list of everything that comes to mind and doesn’t need to be sorted by goal like in the challenges section.

![](0*5smFOG8k2IkzMbqs.)

### Step 4: What strengths need to be leveraged?

These are things that you are naturally good at which can help you get to the goals you have listed.

![](0*NchM7SP1WvZdbcTj.)

*Note: The line between strengths and opportunities is fuzzy and it doesn’t really matter which category you put your responses in. It’s useful to ask both though since you will probably think of things for one that you wouldn’t have if you had just asked the other.*

### Step 5: Create a 25-year vision document.

This is something that you can refer back to which is both motivating and primes you to spot opportunities.

Format the document in three sections, as follows:

**Role **— This is a definition of what someone living your chosen life would be called. How would you describe them if they being written about in a history book? Or, how would you give their bio if they were being introduced as a speaker? Look for words in your response above which emotionally resonate.

**Why you want it** — Why is this goal meaningful and exciting to you? What’s the best thing that could happen?

**What you want** — What does it look like and feel like on a day-to-day basis? What does someone who has already achieved this do on a day-to-day basis? These are going to be pulled from the Challenges, Strengths, and Opportunities sections. What are the core activities you listed there that need to be managed going forward?

You should be emotionally excited by reading this document, if you’re not, you need to do the exercise over again and really focus on being honest with yourself and not shy about what you’re saying.

![](0*nlb9znxAaX_UeA7H.)

### Step 6: Copy this document somewhere you can read it every morning.

This is the easiest one to do and the one many people skip. Either print out this one page summary or copy it somewhere on your computer or phone that you look everyday.

I keep mine in my Evernote shortcuts so I can read it on my computer when I’m at home or phone when I travel.

![](0*vsp8OFLMGSNO2kjW.)

## What if I change my mind? What if I don’t know what I want in 25 years?

*“The process of planning is very valuable, for forcing you to think hard about what you are doing, but the actual plan that results from it is probably useless*.” — **Marc Andreessen**

You aren’t bound by this document — creating it is an exercise to help get clarity and think about what’s possible. After that, you will want to revise it. If you think about what you would have responded to this question five years ago, it’s likely very different than what you just came up with.

The example I gave here is a personal one from over a year ago and I feel differently about almost all of the things I put down, but it was still a very useful exercise.

I felt more motivated because I could see how the work I was doing led to a vision that I believed was important and inspiring. I saw new opportunities that I might not have otherwise identified because I was able to use my 25 year vision to prime myself.

I’ll be doing the exercise again in a couple of weeks as the new year rolls around. If you’d like to join me, [**my masterclass (discounted until Dec. 15th)](http://taylorpearson.me/productivity-masterclass) **walks you through these processes step by step.

The full masterclass will help you get clear on your 25 year vision for all the aspects of your life, translate them into discrete 90 day goals, prioritize the most important ones and make consistent progress towards them.

# Conference Hope for the Introverts

## 

Here’s what it’s like for introverts to decide to go to a conference:

“Oh, let’s go to a conference where you know no one, expect to mingle and ‘network.’ Up next, getting your teeth drilled by a rabid monkey.”

I get it. I get that you’d rather curl up with a good book or watch some Netflix than walk into a room full of strangers.

But there is a way for introverts to thrive during a conference — it just takes a bit of preparation to endure the bombardment of new people, small talk and constant conversation.

And by the end of this, you might actually envision not only going to a conference, but enjoying it.

## Setting the Right Expectations

A conference at its core is designed to bring people together around a topic they love to meet other people and get some great content as well as nighttime outings to see the city.

But if you don’t have the right expectations of what you are going to get out of a conference, it can be a large disappointment.

Asking yourself some key questions can help you have better expectations and spend your time much more wisely. Here are some examples:

* What sessions are you going to?

* How many outings do you plan on attending?

* What are your plans at night?

* What is one speaker you want to meet? What question would you ask?

* How many connections would you like to make at the conference, someone you would follow up with?

By writing down some expectations, you can have some goals that are worth going after instead of feeling like you got nothing accomplished.

## Choosing Your Seating Wisely, Sisters and Brothers

When you are sitting down at the conference, most rookie introverts sit in the back.

Don’t make this mistake. You can sit wherever you want, just make sure you sit in an aisle.

You have an easy escape if you want to relocate or you have some chat-bot sitting next to you.

## How to Meet People at the Conference

It’s hard to mingle for introverts; we aren’t the kind of people who just say, ‘Hey, I’m Ryan. What’s going on with you? Tell me about your life. . .your dreams. . . .your regrets.”

It makes us cringe.

Here’s my strategy for meeting people, but not having to do any “small talk.”

## Just Like Me

I find people in the mixers and “get to know you”s who are off by themselves. My fellow introverts!

They are eating alone at a stand-up table or at the bar. If they are looking at their phone, I let them be, but if someone is actively looking around, I’ll approach them and say, “Hey, I’m Ryan and I’m new here. Not great at the mingling. How’s it going?”

95% of the time the person engages. They know I’m new, I’m out of place and maybe, just maybe, they feel the same way too.

## Go for the C Group

[Chase Reeves over at Fizzle](https://chasereeves.net/2013/third-tier/) talks about the idea when we go to a conference we make the rookie move of trying to meet the “A group”, the speakers, the conference hosts, the A listers. We imagine we will be sitting with them in no time having coffee and becoming lifelong friends.

I’ve seen people do this over and over — and they leave the conference a bit disappointed because everyone is trying to do the same thing.

Even people in the B group, workshop leaders and other people who are much further down the road than you, have enough friends. They have enough contacts. Maybe you can connect with them. Maybe not.

But what I do is I focus on the C group. We are the first time attendees, the ones who are new and figuring out our place. The misfits. The overwhelmed. The ones who don’t know it all or even much. Maybe not a little.

That’s who I hang out with. That’s who I spend my time with. Our beer glasses clink and our laughs are loud.

We make promises we keep — checking in, mentoring, helping out, and loaning out expertise.

Find the C group.

## Introverts, Have a Wingperson

If you have a bit of social anxiety, that feeling where a crowd of strangers is pretty much like being the gazelle at the jackal convention, I got you. I understand.

My buddy Dave is like that. He’s a powerful introvert, but the *initial hello* is what jams him up.

Do you just go up to people?

Why does small talk everyone feel so small?

What do you say? What’s a good opening line?

By the time you work up the courage, the conference is over and someone is putting away the chairs.

Dave and I met at the World Domination Summit and he enlisted me as his wingman.

![](0*N4e0N5R3OFyofWlW.jpg)

Here’s how our wingman system worked. (Trademark pending.)

He’d hang out in the shadows, the dark shadows and I would meet and greet around the conference. If I was making a connection and having a good time, he would saddle up and I’d introduce *him* to the group.

We’d chat. Have a good time and then I’d slink away and meet another group.

Rinse. Repeat.

We wound up meeting a ton of people, making friends, and the following year I had a picture of him on my t-shirt and underneath it read “WINGMAN.”

If you are looking for a wing-person, simply ask a more extroverted friend of yours to attend with you and help them break the ice. It will go much more smoothly.

## Break Time is Your Time

If you need to get out and get some air and skip the chit-chat crowd, do so. Grab a bench. Read a book. Have some coffee or tea. You don’t have to grind it. Take a breath.

## Be the Batman of the Conference

In my backpack I have a little zipper bag filled with items that some people just forgot: a couple of chargers, a couple of battery packs (the small ones that I’ve received as swag), hand wipes, and other sundries.

Without a doubt, I will hear someone lament about something they forgot. And Batman to the rescue! I’ll hand out the battery pack and charger and strike up a conversation. Huzzah! I’ve saved the day.

A conversation usually happens and they gratefully return the items when they don’t need them anymore!

## The Best Journal Practice at a Conference

You want to capture all of the information at a conference; it’s normally the reason you are there. So what’s the best way? There’s going to be a ton of information — a ton.

I’ll watch most people frantically take notes of the speakers’ talk: pen in hand — huge new blank journal — and a frenetic pace.

When I’m taking a notes, I know that I’ll usually get the copy of the presentation. And frankly, I want to enjoy it. I want to be present with the speaker. So I take simple notes around these topics:

* What stories did the speaker tell? (1–3 words so I remember)

* What missteps did the speaker make?

* What recommendations did the speaker make? (Books, movies, etc.)

* What action steps should I take in the next 1–3 weeks?

This way I get the most learns out about the conference speakers and remain present. I’ll get the recording later.

## Channel Your Inner Jimmy Olsen

If you snap some great photos at your conference, share them! I’ve sent pictures I’ve taken with the conference organizers as well as the speaker. I offer a quick note of thanks, how the conference and talk impacted me and give them the photos. It’s a great way to make a connection.

## Volunteering But Not as Tribute

Most conferences have a need to volunteer; it could be doing airport pickups to stuffing swag bags. If you want to meet more people in a less overwhelming fashion, send an email to the conference organizers and offer your assistance.

## Do One Thing Out of Your Conference-Comfort Zone

Maybe you join the treasure hunt.

Maybe you step up for karaoke night.

Maybe you decide to meet 5 new people instead of 3.

Whatever it is, step out of that shell a tad and who knows what will happen or who you’ll meet. I’m in my mid (sort of) 40s and my dearest friends are those I’ve met at conferences. I hope you find the same joy I do when I put on my name badge, see the crowds and say to myself, “This is going to be fun.”

# Get Out Of Your Head In 2 Simple Steps

## Thoughts On Creative (and Life) Block

![Photo by [Element5 Digital](https://unsplash.com/@element5digital?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*MRJNsC07ca1seCkV)*Photo by [Element5 Digital](https://unsplash.com/@element5digital?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

I felt creatively stagnant after a 6-week hiatus from writing.
> # What should I write about?

I started digging inside my head to find answers, but instead I got stuck in my own shit. I tried clawing my way out by looking deeper and deeper inside myself. It never works that way.

I was deep in a cranial hell of my own making.

And no wonder. All of my attention was on myself.

In a moment of desperation, I flipped the script: I asked for help.

## Step 1: Ask for Help.

I asked for help in two ways.

First, via my [newsletter,](https://mailchi.mp/giveliveexplore/vol6no14) asking my humble following:
> # What would you like me to write/share/do more of here? What do you need help with in life/work/career that I might be able to shine light on?

Next, on Facebook via [this post](https://www.facebook.com/matt.trinetti/posts/10102873753891089):


Between the Facebook post and newsletter, about 50 questions came back. Whereas usually I have a monkey of a time figuring out what to write about and where to start, my writing flowed quickly and easily. The simplicity of responding each person*, s*hining a little light or relieving a little pain for them, was hugely liberating.

I reached out for help and showed up to serve. The questions that came back became a mirror to how others thought I might be able to help them.

My writing output skyrocketed. I wrote the equivalent of 10 blog posts in 5 days. Far more writing than I’d done in a long, long time.

I forgot that writing isn’t a *talking*-focused art, but a *listening*-focused one.

That was step 1.

## Step 2: Help 1 Very Specific Person.

There’s a single secret weapon [for writers struggling to write](https://medium.com/the-mission/this-is-how-you-write-c7cb9610d97d), one that’s been passed down from generation to generation, from scribe to scribe:

**Write to 1 very specific person.**

The same goes for us, wherever we’re blocked in our life:

**Help 1 very specific person.**

By this, I mean help Chuck or Mary or Claudia or Luis.

Not just some marketing persona you named “Chuck” or “Mary.”

I’m talking about your cousin Chuck and your old high school friend Mary. Your new friend Claudia. That random guy Luis you met in Lisbon at the airport and somehow ended up Facebook friends.

Help them.

You might not be able to directly help them, but maybe you know someone who can. Or maybe there’s a TED talk that might help. Or an article you once read. Or a quote or a story that might help.

When I asked for help, the hesitation I had about “showing up” and sharing my writing dissolved. It became less about me, and more about helping my friends.

In helping 1 specific person, I shifted from a *self*-focused to *service*-focused.

If you’re struggling to “put yourself out there” or feeling stuck and self-conscious about your work, here’s a thought:

**What if putting yourself out there — on social media, in your work, in life — was less about you and more about [people in pain around you?](https://medium.com/@trinetti/dont-start-with-the-problem-start-with-the-people-3fc8a15e73c3)**

Pain is a big word. It could be acute or a little niggle. Either way, you can help.

When you give, your courage is magnified. You become less self-conscious. Because it’s not about you any more.

There’s a mantra in the startup/investor world:
> # “Ask for money, get advice. Ask for advice, get money.”

The same goes for us. By asking for help or sharing where you’re struggling, you’ll indirectly achieve your goals.

To get out of your own head, help someone get out of theirs.

# Giving Language to Desire&#58; the Story of an Uncelebrated Inner Compass

## “I want to win” — she said

![Photo by [Wesley Quinn](https://unsplash.com/photos/ntwfp7OQAb8?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/desire?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*Uv07Lhu89o5hbVXUUBesxA.jpeg)*Photo by [Wesley Quinn](https://unsplash.com/photos/ntwfp7OQAb8?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/desire?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

In Western society, there’s a narrative that equates desire with love: it’s the good old story of romantic love. Who didn’t believe in it, at least for a while? An entire body of literature, a film and a music genre, and a number of unquestioned urban legends have thrived on that narrative for decades.

It’s fair to recognize that more and more people were awakened to the fact that this paradigm has rather been more a source of excruciating dramas and shredded expectations than nurtured fulfilling and sustainable relationships.

We have come to acknowledge that, in the realm of relationships, desire leads to infatuation first and then to what we call “falling in love”, a condition which over time *might *lead — or rather evolve into — a more sustained, conscious, considerate, mature type of connection that we can call “love”.

But if on the one hand desire is romanticized, on the other hand, it’s been demonized. In certain belief systems desire is seen as the wicked impulse that drives us to temptation, sin, and folly. Seen this way, people were encouraged to silence it or repress it. To the point that the fact itself of feeling at all might generate a sense of guilt or even shame.

Neither of these two perceptions of desire, however, is balanced.
> # We’re doing a massive disservice to ourselves if we don’t find a constructive way to learn from and deal with our desires.

Because desire is a compass. In all realms.

Desire says: “*Here’s what attracts you”*.

Desire wants, craves, wrestles, screams. It’s a pointer to something we don’t have — and wish to have. It’s visceral, intuitive, gutty. It points out what feels beautiful, interesting, mysterious. What makes ends meet. Something that, if attained, might bring bliss, satisfaction, pleasure, peace.

But, if unfulfilled and burdened by expectations, it can also lead to misery, depression, intense sadness. Interestingly though, even when fulfilled, it can become an addiction, an identity, a vicious circle of fruitless search for purpose.

So where is the balance?

Let’s begin by recognizing that being conscious of our desires is critical to the development of our self-awareness. Desire per se is not an issue. It’s **not **an emotional state we should get rid of because it drives us into troubles, temptation or to eternal damnation.

On the contrary: it’s something that connects us to our deepest nature of human beings. It carries within itself tens of thousands of years of evolution and adaptation of needs and transformational impulses.

Giving language to desire is a remarkable opportunity for self-discovery.
> # The starting point of all achievements is desire. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desire brings weak results, just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat. (Napoleon Hill)

![Photo by [Ricardo Gomez Angel](https://unsplash.com/photos/LXFVPMrTINE?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/fire?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*AMlngLVOLGM8w-cobGuAow.jpeg)*Photo by [Ricardo Gomez Angel](https://unsplash.com/photos/LXFVPMrTINE?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/fire?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

A ’weak’ desire is a not simply something that we do want, but not badly enough. It’s rather a wish of the ego that is not attuned with body and mind.

It’s there and wants to be fulfilled, but there’s no consciousness to look at it. There’s no witnessing of it. It’s the craving that takes over control. It’s the energy that drives our actions towards dangerous and inconsiderate extremes. As Adam Smith nicely puts it:
> “The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another — Some of these situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others, but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice, or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds, either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly, or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice.” (Adam Smith)

The flame of “passionate ardor” that Smith talks about is often ‘weak desire’ because it cries for survival. On the surface, it manifests with intensity but if examined consciously, it’s like a dying flame.
It needs oxygen: the object of the desire. That’s what makes it weak.
> # A truly ‘strong’ desire is holistically strong, in the sense that it is held in high consciousness and looks beyond the gratification of the perceived need. Awareness is its backbone.

This type of desire is detached from the outcome: it points somewhere but it’s peaceful with not getting there. It recognizes when the place it leads to might be dangerous, dark and potentially painful, for ourselves or for others. It shows a beauty or a purpose that can be attained through different paths, and not necessarily the ones that we can envision today.

![Photo by [Tim Graf](https://unsplash.com/photos/ErO0E8wZaTA?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/desire?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*x__jbTvKLXn63oagxeILsw.jpeg)*Photo by [Tim Graf](https://unsplash.com/photos/ErO0E8wZaTA?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/desire?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

Desire answers the question: “*What do **you** want*?”

When we’re aware of desire and we look at it compassionately, we can ask ourselves probing questions, such as:

* *what’s underneath that? is it something that resonates with my heart or perhaps it’s just the result of my conditioning, other people’s expectations, or the lack of a better goal, purpose, vision?*

* *How will I feel when I achieve that? Am I going to need to make victims on the way to that? Will it drain my energies? Am I going to be the victim of my own desire?*

* *Is this going to do any good beyond me? To others? To the environment? To the world?*

My friend Marta wants to become a world-class athlete in triathlon. She wants to train hard and win competitions. I know she has the potential. But when I ask her: “*What makes you want this?*” She goes: “*I want to win*”.

I challenge her: “*Is that all? I think you can do better than that. How will you feel when you become Olympic champion? What will you do next?*”.

M: “*Hm. I don’t know. I will tell my story*”

V: “*What story? To whom?*”

M: “*How I got there. I will share this to motivate people*”

V: “*Tell me more*”

M: “*I can share how to stretch your body to the limit. To train hard and keep your focus high. To stand up even after a massive life-altering event like what I’ve gone through*”

V: “*Right. You can inspire others. But not to win the gold medal at the Olympics. You can inspire them to work on themselves, to be bold and resilient. To strive to become a better version of themselves. I’ve seen you do this already. How does this sound?*”

M: “*Oh. Much better. Thank You*”

Winning per se is a weak desire. Inspiring others to believe in themselves and stretch their skills, *winning or not, *is quite another story.

Similarly, when we feel intensely attracted by someone, we can ask ourselves the question: “*What do I desire*?”. Is it the body? Or is it the companionship? Is it the confidence that the person seems to possess and that makes me feel safe next to her? Or is it the fun I can envision to have with him? What vision do I hold in mind when I think of that person? What feelings does it generate?

Desire will point out experiences, motives and feelings that we are looking to bring into our lives and that are currently not there.

It doesn’t necessarily mean they were missing until now. Sometimes, we come across someone or something new and we suddenly find ourselves drawn to that by an unfolding desire. It shows us a new facet of the world we didn’t even know about: something we suddenly want to discover, explore, dance with.

It’s time to embrace desire and make it a source of growth, transformation and increased self-awareness.

Are you ready to follow your inner compass?

# How the Agricultural Revolution Inspired a Wrong Way of Thinking

## 
> # No—it has nothing to do with your diet.

### First, a little history:

12,500 B.C. — somewhere in southeastern Turkey (where Kurdistan should be)—the agricultural revolution began.

It didn’t spread across the globe from there, though. Actually, over the span of a few thousand years, the exact same revolution occurred in places that housed the right climate, crops and animals necessary for agriculture to take place, completely separate from one another. Meaning, with no way of communicating with one another, different people in different parts of the world all saw the same benefit of domesticating animals, tending to and maintaining crops, and settling down in one spot within the same 4,000 year time span.

It changed the way we thought about life itself.

For 2+ million years, we evolved and assumed a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle. We were on constant alert for predators and always searching for food.

After several millennia of socializing, learning, surviving, we began to recognize the power of agriculture—less traveling and stress on the body, seemingly guaranteed food sources, etc. We decided to leave hunter-gatherer life behind.

We saw there was something better, and went after it.

## It was all a fraud.

I’ve been reading [*Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316117/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)* by [Yuval Noah Harari](http://www.ynharari.com/).

A quote on page 87, in a chapter titled “History’s Biggest Fraud” inspired me to write this post. I’ve copy and pasted it below. It’s a bit long, but please:
> “How many college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are 35? But by the time they reach that age they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad? What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.”

The sad part is that what Harari describes represents a vast majority of the working population today. We think working our asses off at a young age will make our lives a hell of a lot easier down the road. It’s not necessarily a “wrong” way of thinking, but life rarely works out the way we plan. Most people forget to account for the lurking variables that come with age and changing times.

### This way of thinking — work hard now, reap benefits later — started with the agricultural revolution.

When we found our escape from life as nomadic hunter-gatherers, we seized it in-full, with no plan of returning to the life we knew for millions of years prior.

Back then, the thinking was,
> # *“As long as we work hard to harvest these crops now, we won’t have to worry about going hungry in the future.”*

We left hunter-gatherer life for this “easier” way of living because, on paper, the agricultural lifestyle made perfect sense — settle down, relax, eat plentifully.

But like young college grads underestimating vast changes to come, our ancestors failed to see the negative effects of focusing solely on agriculture.

Settling in villages set the stage for a population boom, which meant more mouths to feed. Domesticating animals led to hundreds of new illnesses—more people to care for. The change in diet was terrible for the human body; we lived much healthier as hunter-gatherers—something people are just starting to realize today (think of all the dieting trends happening right now: paleo, raw vegan, keto, etc). Tending to crops all day was laborious and more taxing on the human body than nomadic life.

Not to mention, if we had a bad harvest, we starved. Over time, we lost our ability to live the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. We forgot how to survive “in the wild” so-to-speak, and put all of our eggs in the agricultural basket.

But again: work hard now, reap the benefits later.

## Here’s why it matters today:

Too many of us are like the young college graduates Harari described in *Sapiens—*we’re willing to slave away now with the hopes our hard work pays off later.

But maybe later isn’t all that great.

Maybe now is when you need to retreat the most. Maybe now is when you’re supposed to listen to what your instincts are telling you. Maybe now is the best time for you to pursue your real interests because it’s the only time you have the flexibility to do so.

Maybe, for you, there is no later.

Of course, we should all have goals and work towards them on a consistent basis. And sure, those goals are—for the most part—long-term. But don’t make everything you do in “the now” strictly for “the later.”

We never actually *know* what ‘later’ looks like until we’re in it, and from what history has shown, it may not be what we want.

# Shedding The Skin Of Ego

## Your Ego Is Holding You Back
> “The ego is only an illusion, but a very influential one. Letting the ego-illusion become your identity can prevent you from knowing your true self. Ego, the false idea of believing that you are what you have or what you do, is a backwards way of assessing and living life.” — Wayne Dyer

![](0*nw53cRH2R-x1zw1l)

### **Food For Thought**

## **Shedding The Skin Of Ego**
> # *“Ego is the absolute impediment to Dao. The sin is pride. If it thrills you that you’re enlightened then you’re ruined. Forget sharing it. You’re not pure enough to share it.” — Terence McKenna*

Your ego has a lot of plans for you.

It wants you to seem clever, intelligent, and confident in front of your friends.

It assumes that everyone’s actions somehow concern you.

It believes that the people in the gym, or on the sidewalk, or at the store *are *looking at you.

But when you think about where you are headed because of these plans and assumptions, you’ll find that you are moving toward a living “ego hell.”

What is a living ego hell, you might ask?

It’s a place where you’re performing for imaginary people’s imaginary expectations for you. A place where you act for appearances instead of principles. A place where your life is a constant compromise instead of a bold declaration and pursuit of your highest self.

The practice of surrendering or letting go of ego can be hard… But it’s incredibly powerful and has to become a habit for you to succeed.

It’s a continual fight that needs a consistent structure to succeed: regular exercise, meditation, reading, writing (and journaling), or talking with people that love us. Happiness lies behind habits and routines that help shed useless portions of the ego.

The snake doesn’t shed its skin only once. You’ll have to shed your ego over and over again if you want to continue becoming more than you are now.

## **Ego Is The Enemy**
> “And that’s what is so insidious about talk. Anyone can talk about himself or herself. Even a child knows how to gossip and chatter. Most people are decent at hype and sales. So what is scarce and rare? Silence. The ability to deliberately keep yourself out of the conversation and subsist without its validation. Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong.” ― Ryan Holiday

Alright, this suggestion may require you to really shed that ego and open your mind…

[Try listening to Wayne Dyer’s motivational tape on getting rid of ego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0zmX14wQlI).

We know there is a stereotypical narrative around listening to motivational tapes, but they can have massive ROI. (In fact, [the world’s youngest self-made woman billionaire sites Wayne Dyer’s tapes](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-woman-who-everyone-laughed-at-b7bf3d09041) as one of the ways she built her internal drive.)

### **#WhatWeAreWatching**

## **The OA**

Part 2 of *OA*, the mind-bending sci-fi Netflix original, was released last week. Naturally, we binged all 8 episodes as quickly as we could. [Watch the trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlSXDaRR2bw).

This is one of those shows that’s hard to explain without giving everything away. But if you like thrilling science fiction, multiple dimensions, near-death experiences, and want to twist your brain in knots… then this is a must-watch. 😏

# Why You Should Not Climb The Corporate Ladder

## 

Do you think climbing the corporate ladder is the best chance for career success?

Think again.

One of the favorite studies I wrote about in [*Friend of a Friend](http://amzn.to/2up15sv) *is Adam Kleinbaum’s research on what he calls organizational misfits. We might think that the people that stick in one silo, stay in one lane, and slowly climb the corporate ladder get ahead the most. This is the advice so many of us get. And it’s reinforced by the siloed nature of so many organizational charts.

But what Kleinbaum found by studying one large 30,000-person organization is that the people who actually spun their wheels a bit earlier in their career before finding traction were the people who had more successful careers over the long-term.

Kleinbaum called these the “organizational misfits.” These are the people who bounced around from department to department. But they were also the people that built a more diverse social network that allowed them later in their career to be able to see more holistically, to be able to see a big picture. As a result, their careers moved further faster. They were more likely to get promoted. They were more likely to get raises.

The organizational misfits often became the organizational leaders.

The implications of this study are powerful for two reasons. First, if you feel like you’re just spinning your wheels and you’re not getting traction, then this study brings a little hope. Maybe it’s okay. Instead of worrying about climbing up the ladder of your silo, focus on building a diverse social network as you find that thing that you want to climb up in.

Second, the study implies that all of us need to be thinking about how we can be a little bit more of a misfit. Even if we’re steady on this path of climbing the corporate ladder and moving up rung by rung, we still need to be doing things that get me a more diverse social network inside the organization. We need to ask peers in other departments for coffee. We need to drop in on meetings for departments that we’re not responsible for and see if we can learn a thing or two — or meet a new person or two. We need to develop a social network that is wide across the organization because we’ll need it down the road.

The organizational misfits become the organizational leaders. So we all need to be a little more misfit.

# 7 Signs You’re MASSIVELY Productive

## “A man working on a laptop at a table with a mug and two iPhones” by Parker Byrd on Unsplash

As a productivity nerd, I’ve spent hours reading books, testing apps and obsessing over what the perfect To Do list looks like.

(Pro tip: It’s perfect if you use it).

I’ve dove deeper into the world of [productivity ](https://medium.com/the-mission/3-timeless-productivity-lessons-from-benjamin-franklin-33c57880d9db)than I care to admit, and I’ve discovered seven telltale signs that productivity aficionados are in danger of turning efficiency and effectiveness automation into a personal religion.

## 1. The Perfect Morning Routine Keeps You Up At Night

Should you get up at 5:00 a.m. or 6:00 a.m.? Is it better to meditate or exercise first thing? And just how much caffeine is enough before breakfast?

You’ve spent hours reading about the early morning routines of your mentors and experimented with copying what they do.

Deep down, you know tweaking how much protein you consume first thing doesn’t impact your day much, but it helps you feel like you’re accomplishing more before everyone else.

## 2. You Prune Your To Do Like A Well-Kept Garden

Sanity is a neatly categorised [To Do list](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2018/06/21/goal-strategies/#3206d8727b5a). You love nothing more than ticking off items one by one. The reassuring ding or swoosh of completing an item in Things, Wunderlist or Asana fills you with an alarming sense of satisfaction.

Like an artful gardener, you take special pride in weeding out items from your To Do list that you’ve no intention of completing.

## 3. The Latest Productivity Apps Excite You

What’s this?

Trello just released a new desktop app. Now you can use your fingerprint to log into 1Password. Evernote has redesigned their experience for iOS.

You sometimes spend more time downloading and testing productivity apps than using them. You even read the release notes on the app store to see if you missed anything, and the developer’s Easter eggs usually raise a smile.

## 4. Tim Ferriss Is Your High Priest

…and the 4-Hour Workweek your bible.

A well-thumbed copy of *Tribe of Mentors* sits on your bookshelf. His two-hour podcast episodes auto-download to your phone, which you listen to on x2 speed of course. Tim’s reading list is your speed reading list. You even know all about his dog.

It’s best you never meet.

## 5. You Think In Terms Of Next Actions

Are you ringing the contractor with the bad news or Stephen from marketing? Is it your responsibility to distribute the report or Sarah’s?

And the deadline for the project, it’s next Friday, right? If your [calendar](https://medium.com/@BryanJCollins/the-secrets-of-effective-calendar-management-83cb29fc06c1) is a shield for defending your best self, then next actions are a sword you use to slice through the work week.

## 6. You Treat Meetings Like The Enemy

You’d rather rub lemons in your eyes than spend 30 or even, gasp, 60 minutes on a conference call or sitting in a room with a large group of people talking about one topic. All you can think about is your To Do list and what you could have accomplished in that time.

What’s more, you die a small death inside each time someone wraps up a meeting without summarizing who is doing what and when.

A plague upon their houses.

## 7. You Spend More Time Reviewing Your Calendar Than Watching Television

You muse over the best time for block booking 30 or 60 minutes to work on your most important projects. Should you set time aside in the morning or the evening for deep work?

You’ve color-coded everything so you can see at a glance who you need to talk to or update and when. Yes, your calendar is a triumph of personal micromanagement.

Who has time for *Love Island* or *This is Us* anyway?

**Ready to supercharge your productivity?**

I’ve created a cheat sheet that will help you FOCUS immediately. Follow this and you’ll accomplish more than you can imagine.

# Why Writing Creatively Every Day Has Made Me A Better CEO

## 

From the moment I could form wobbly letters with my stubby right hand, writing stories has been my primary passion.

In fact, it’s informed my entire career — from studying journalism at the University of Oregon and working as a reporter, to serving today as President of [BookBaby](https://www.bookbaby.com/), the nation’s eminent self-publishing company. I’ve *always* found pleasure in the art of writing, the miracle of creation, the joy of conceiving a world inside your head and nurturing and translating it into something real and tangible. My love for that act has inspired me in every important career decision I’ve made.

But far from mere inspiration, writing creatively — something I still do every day — has benefited me tangibly, too.

## **In fact, it’s made me a better CEO.**

There are a variety of reasons why that is.

First, the act of writing is inherently inspiring. To say nothing of the gratitude, wisdom, and increased empathy which daily creative writing habits build, I find that on a day when I’m grappling with a particularly stubborn problem or issue, setting aside some time to write has the effect of clearing my mind. Moreover, it boosts my creative abilities — so much so that when I return to the original problem, I’m able to perceive it with fresh eyes and a more open mind.

And *that’s *when the answer I’ve been searching for comes.

Beyond problem solving, however, I’ve found the ability to write cogently and effectively to be a critical skill to possess. It gives you the ability to motivate others, empathize with employees, and connect with customers. In this sense, it’s a skill that separates great CEOs from average ones.

## **The personal benefits of writing, too, are critical — perhaps more now than ever.**

Every one of us in today’s 280-character world are living disjointed, fragmented lives.

Our attention spans are fragmented. The amount of responsibilities vying for our attention are ever-increasing. More and more, we invest only fractions of our minds to each individual task we work to complete — and the result is final products of compromised quality.
> This is especially true of CEOs.

But that’s why it’s doubly important for CEOs to set aside time every day to write; creative writing is the perfect antidote for a digitally-splintered mind. The craft necessitates prolonged periods of intense and purposeful focus, windows of time wherein you’re forced to ignore email, Twitter, Facebook, and TV.

To write well, you have to immerse yourself fully in the project at hand. And unlike other tasks that require such focus, writing puts your *entire *brain to work — both the left and right sides, the creative and the more strategic. In this sense, creative writing — taking an idea from conception to creation — is like calisthenics for the brain.

And the benefits of that exercise are numerous and invaluable.

When you write every day, you’ll find yourself becoming not only more creative, but you’ll recapture the ability to focus on individual tasks or problems. You’ll find yourself able to think and operate more empathetically, too, as imagining the lives and predicaments of other characters and people translates directly to better connecting with your customers and better understanding what drives the people who work for you.

## **Of course, there are challenges to writing every day.**

For one thing, CEOs *all *lack one resource that proves very important to building a daily writing habit: time.

In my own life, I rarely suffer from writer’s block. That’s hardly ever the primary impediment to my writing. More problematic *by far *is the sheer lack of time I have available during the day.

For most writers, writing doesn’t happen spontaneously. Personally, it takes me a few hours to really get myself into the sort of mental space I need to occupy in order to be creative. And writing is not something you can do once or twice a week, either. Improving your writing ability is a matter of diligence, routine, and daily persistence.

Now, I know what you’re asking: how in the world* *is a CEO supposed to dedicate multiple hours a day — amidst the hurricane of other responsibilities swirling around them — to sitting down and writing alone?

## **Ultimately, it amounts to investing in yourself.**

Similar to how you might block out time in your schedule to go to the gym, or network at night, or spend quality time with family, you owe it to yourself to block out time for your creative development and focus, too.

It might seem like a lot up front. But most CEOs are highly organized and disciplined. You should have no trouble creating the space and time needed to make this a priority. And, simply put, if you do, you’ll be a better CEO, leader, and person for it.

Consider this a call to arms.

Too often, us CEOs find ourselves mired in Excel spreadsheets, emails, conference calls — and that’s when we’re not distracted by the computers in our pockets. We neglect our creative abilities, deny ourselves the opportunity to flex our empathy muscles. And when we do that, we inadvertently make ourselves less effective.

I say it’s time we reject this status quo. Invest in your creativity and in your writing ability. I know doing so has made me a better CEO. Hell, it’s made me a better person — all the way from elementary school to the office in which I’m sitting in now.

I imagine it will for you, too.

# Out of the City and Into the ‘Burbs

## Out of the City and Into the ‘Burbs

### The Mission Newsletter, 10/30/18

![](0*KKFHl5S3oUOLG_uF)
> “Same old boring Sunday morning, old men out washing their cars
> Mum’s in the kitchen cooking Sunday dinner, Herberts still moaning for food
> And Johnny’s upstairs in his bedroom sitting in the dark
> Annoying the neighbors with his punk rock electric guitar
> This is the sound, This is the sound of the suburbs.”
> -The Members

## **Leaving the Suburbs**

Bill’s house was a rancher with big windows in the front, a white chimney, and a driveway. It had a large front yard with green grass, a mix of trees, and flowering shrubs. He built the house on a gracefully curved road, so it didn’t feel like it was in the city.

Bill designed the house with his father and his brother, but none of them would ever live in it.

Then they built another… and another… and another.

Bill wanted every single American to be able to buy a house just like it. They built thousands of homes — entire cities of cookie-cutter replicas.

Now, these communities might sound familiar, like what you have seen in *Pleasantville*, *The Sandlot*, or *Edward Scissorhands*.

And that’s because that perfect little slice of suburbia is the vision of a single man.

His name was Bill Levitt.

# Monkey Selfies, Catching Yawns, and Soulful Connections

## Monkey Selfies, Catching Yawns, and Soulful Connections
> # In Sulawesi live the Yaki. On this Indonesian island, deep in the Tangkoko reserve, these jocose primates spend their time foraging and lounging about. Naruto, as one macaque became known, stirred quite the controversy. Donning an unforgettable smirk, she hijacked the trigger of photographer David Slater and snapped a selfie. The media went apeshit.

Excluding apes, we’re posting nearly 100 million selfies a day. Every second we feed our egos by uploading another one to Instagram. A true sign of the times is that more of us perish from selfie-induced deaths than shark attacks. Our selfie infatuation is simply a reflection of the love affair we have with ourselves. We seem to think (or at least behave) like we’re more entitled than any other living thing.

![](1*QC2rd-Hz7lAUoQboYWly2w.png)

The hoopla surrounding the monkey selfie was not about what can be done to help an endangered animal. It was whether or not Naruto should hold the copyright to her self portrait. But when you’re being hunted for bushmeat, royalties are not top on your priority list.

## Non-Stop Noogenic Neurosis

So what is exactly is it that makes us human? From ancient Greece right to the present day, contemplative souls have inquired. There is little agreement on the answer. With the rise of artificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning engineers scurry, albeit aimlessly, to best codify morality. “We are moving into a world where we care less about how other people regard us than how AIs’ do,” chimes media theorist Douglas Rushkoff.

Meanwhile, tech-philosophers have a field day spouting how we can supercharge our abilities, upload our brains to the web, and even cheat death to become [transhuman](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/06/no-death-and-an-enhanced-life-is-the-future-transhuman). In the brief time that we’ve graced this earth, our staggering technological progress has seriously misguided us. We do not play a starring role.

![](1*KKCJqMHzE_9SQ8HdRu7GEA.jpeg)

Self-centeredness at scale is an ontology that places us at the centre of it all. Asking what makes us human in the first place misses a trick. It’s as if revealing the answer might explain, and justify our behaviour — both bad and benevolent. Every day we’re *becoming* more human.

A fundamental characteristic of our humanness is our regard for life. It’s here, in the nature of how we connect to one another, to any and everything in the universe, that we rise to be better humans.

What stands in our way, the friction we feel — is rooted in suffering. It’s hard to have a genuine concern for others when we live in states of mental confusion. This uneasiness, or *Dukkha*, is part and parcel of the reason we choose to separate rather than join each other.

Good mental health is the capacity to expand oneself autonomously as well as integrate with others. When we experience heartbreak or a health scare, how we feel, react, communicate, and come together is a hallmark of humanity. Interdependency without autonomy suppresses psychological growth and autonomy without interdependence results in narcissism. It’s in the space between which gives colours to our lives. And the ways in which we choose to trust, connect, and share are what give it different hues.

The trend, sadly, is towards isolation. Individuals clash over adverse ideologies and nations tear themselves apart. The icing on the cake is our Westernised program of lacking — endlessly wanting more in order to fill our emptiness. Small wonder it’s hard to *just be*.

Nowhere is this more evident today than in Japan. In the face of the pressures of life, upwards of a million individuals have completely withdrawn from society. *Hikikomori*, as they are known, have turned inwards and become ‘post-modern hermits.’

It’s not just big in Japan. *Noogenic Neurosis*, a term coined by Holocaust survivor and psychologist Viktor Frankl to capture existential frustration is widespread. It manifests out of the millennial malaise, the *provisional existence* of gig workers, the demise of religious institutions, and social feeds that continuously reminding us of what we don’t have. Small wonder anxiety, depression, suicides, self-harm, and opioid use are skyrocketing.

Existential angst is no longer reserved to a mid-life crisis or traumatic events — it’s a long and constant murmur lurking in the shadows. Suffering has become part of everyday life. And as we unflaggingly, “Suffer more often in the imagination than in reality,” Seneca would surely be rolling his eyes.

## Yawning and Inflated Egos

The resurgence of stoicism is evidence that we’re searching to live deeper and richer lives. Amidst an unknown abyss, the stoic lens helps us craft a different story — one where we adopt whichever attitude we so choose. If thoughts create our realities then perspective-hacking is the s*kill du jour*.

![](1*JiqSCqonDye03TchUcWNJA.gif)

How then might we swiftly, and easily, learn to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes? Enter yawning. This underplayed way that primates, including humans, communicate is a sure-fire sign of empathic concern. [Studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277815089_Contagious_yawning_and_psychopathy) show that the more self-referred one tends to be, the less they’ll yawn amidst a staged ‘secret yawner’. When we catch a yawn, it’s indicative of being in tune with the emotions of others. This is not to suggest we have a global *yawn-in*, it merely shows the subtle ways that empathy acts as the glue that holds us together.

Philosopher Rene Girard proposes that all what we really want is what others want. As memetic creatures, imitating others is simply copying their desires. This dependence on each other is core to our existential state and wholly a consequence of the circles and cultures we move in.

The precise mirroring may look different but will follow the same rhythms whether indigenous people of New Guinea or investment bankers of New York. Limbic resonance, the ability to attune to one another’s emotional state, feels good. Knowingly or not, we all sync to the tribe.

When we lack exposure to a variety of life experiences it can lead to intolerance. “Empathy is not imagining how you might feel in the place of another. It is imagining and trying to understand what the other person feels,” writes Elizabeth Segal, a professor of social work at Arizona State University. With [social empathy](https://aeon.co/essays/a-sophisticates-primer-on-empathy-and-its-limits), we can stretch interpersonal concern to others and inflate our compassion. In other words, perspective-hacking helps us gel with different cultures and avoid bad tribalism.

So if we become ourselves by mirroring others then the question is who exactly do we want to model? The Dalia Lama wouldn’t be all too bad. Yet it for the most part that we’re heading in the other direction. It’s getting harder for more and more to step into another’s shoes.

![](1*Kn5_K3r85hWIwmpQqYDXXA.jpeg)

A self-love movement continues to flourish with unhealthy narcissism the side effect. We’re mirroring each other in all the wrong ways resulting in a cesspool for anxiety and compound interest for the ego. This is only exacerbated by Instalikes and the compulsion to post that perfect crushed avocados. The more we’re preoccupied with ourselves, the less we tend to care for, or give to, others.

## Soulful Connections

So where does this leave us? Slipping into a nihilistic rut is just a cop-out. If we want to connect on a deeper level than catching a yawn we do so in joining together in our shared suffering. The most potent form of human connection arrives when we are vulnerable — open with our mental confusion. It’s a fundamental human impulse to come together and when we do so — it’s a way of alchemising our way back to the innocence of the *Garden.*

Being human enables us to reflect on the past (often as revisionists) and project into the future (typically as optimists). Language and imitation allow us to learn lessons from our ancestors and from one another in real-time. We can actually [*bind time](https://rushkoff.com/books/team-human-book/)*, something no other species can do.

Still, we continue to strip the planet bare of resources. It’s getting so toasty here on planet earth it will soon become uninhabitable. The apex of our shared suffering may be the end of the human race. We have the intelligence, technology, and wealth to repair this world but what we lack is the collective will. Our ideas, our stories are not taking hold to spur us to immediate action. Leaving the mess we’re making today for another generation to clean up tomorrow is just plain baloney.

![](1*fEf9BaWwylFNAlZ6zUanng.png)

Instead of focussing on how we are different than other species and from each other — we could direct attention to how we’re so much the same. Our shared story now is that we have a brief amount of time to get our act together.

While we decide between ordering oat or almond milk lattes more than a billion people go hungry. We are not the stars of the show but supporting actors in the grand conspiracy of the universe.

A system reboot is long overdue. It’s time to see anew. We let go of the stories we have invented and invested in for thousands of years. Our masterful sense-making abilities can then play a new symphony. In this global concert, we love more than we fight, give more than we take, and connect more than we alienate.

## A Warm Bath For Our Collective Brain

When scientists sequenced the genome of chimps they found that humans are 96% the same. Still, we were more concerned with an endangered selfie than species. The welfare of Naruto’s tribe played second fiddle to an intellectual property debate.

Considered a pest by some, pets by others, and a delicacy yet by others — the monkey selfies eventually made a difference. Eco-tourism has improved the welfare of the apes and locals now see them in a more favourable light.

![](1*--vBQQOrUhTxRtYuT5qOHA.png)

There might be something that makes us unique. Perhaps the late Stephen Hawking had it right:

# Writers&#58; This Thought Leadership Platform Helps Me Pull In An Extra 60,000 Views Per Month

## Writers: This Thought Leadership Platform Helps Me Pull In An Extra 60,000 Views Per Month

### It’s probably not what you’re thinking.

**By [Jack Martin](https://twitter.com/Mr_JackMartin), staff writer**

Nowadays, everyone wants to know how to become a [Thought Leader](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/jack-martin/what-does-the-term-thought-leadership-mean/).

The strategy is actually pretty simple: add value to your industry by [sharing what you know](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/jack-martin/from-your-first-blog-post-to-industry-authority-this-1-tiny-shift-will-make-all-the-difference/) on a regular basis.

The goal is for people to recognize you as an industry authority, leading the charge in your space. Sharing personal experience stories and giving advice about your area of expertise — which, coming from a leadership position, is unprecedented value to peers and industry newcomers alike — is how to make that happen.

Frankly, a lot of people understand that formula. Following it isn’t the hard part.

## The hard part is knowing where to broadcast your content.

Aside from pushing out valuable content on a regular basis, Thought Leaders need to build a following, gain more exposure and generate consistent views, shares, comments — which takes tons of time and effort. Imagine if you’re spending all of those resources on the wrong platform, in front of the wrong audience?

If your most valuable insights wind up in the wrong places, your path to becoming a Thought Leader will be even more of an uphill battle than it already is.

That’s why so many industry leaders miss the mark when it comes to Thought Leadership marketing.

Again, most people **know** the benefits of becoming a Thought Leader and **know **that adding value is the key to compelling content, but they have no idea *where to* *publish*. And when they’re not seeing much of a return for all of the time spent trying to position themselves as influencers, they end up losing faith in the process altogether.

Fortunately, there’s a platform with hundreds of millions of visitors who not only appreciate valuable content, but *thrive* on it.

## Quora.

For those unfamiliar with the platform, Quora is an online Q&A community with hundreds of millions of users.

Anyone can create an account for free and contribute to the [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Martin-189) community by asking a question or answering an existing one.

It’s an SEO powerhouse and extremely conducive to long-form written content — the type of content successful Thought Leaders use to establish their influence.** **And with power players like the CEO of Invento Robotics [Balaji Viswanathan](https://www.quora.com/profile/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%9C%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D-Balaji-Viswanathan), marketing guru [Gary Vaynerchuk,](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gary-Vaynerchuk) and 44th U.S. President [Barack Obama](https://www.quora.com/profile/Barack-Obama-44) all actively using Quora, it’s about time you utilize the site for your own Thought Leadership strategy.

Here are a few ways [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Martin-189) can increase your influence:

## 1. Build an organic following.

If you want to be recognized as an authority in your industry, you need an audience.

Quora is the place to build it.

The site has 200 million unique monthly visitors and over 100 million active users. Every day, millions of visitors and regular Quorans interact, asking questions, finding answers, or simply educating themselves by reading.

Beyond that, Quora is an extremely user-friendly platform. You’re able to follow topics based on what you know and what you’d like to know more about. Your feed is catered to your interests. And with tens of thousands of questions being asked on a daily basis, you have the opportunity to join conversations in your industry — and start new ones — where millions of people are already talking.

For example, let’s say you’re the founder of a tech company and want to generate buzz around your business. What makes more sense from a marketing standpoint: pitching a byline for a one-off piece Forbes piece, or directly contributing to Quora’s Technology network of 53.4 million people?

![](0*cBXRCth0Mm-AIu75)

Even if you’re a company leader in a relatively unheard of niche market, there are plenty of opportunities to add value by contributing answers to general questions like:
> ***What are the biggest lessons you’ve learned in the corporate world?***
> [6.4k people are following this question](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-biggest-lessons-you-have-learned-in-the-corporate-world).
> ***What is the best advice for a young, first-time startup CEO?***
> [5.7k people are following this question](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-advice-for-a-young-first-time-startup-CEO).

Even a question as simple as, *“What is one thing I can learn from you today?”*** **has over [**2,000 followers**.](https://www.quora.com/What-is-one-thing-that-I-can-learn-from-you-today)

If you’re serious about separating yourself from competitors and are looking to build an organic following, you need to leverage Quora.

## 2. Gain access to unlimited exposure.

I’m a writer on Quora and have been an active user since 2016.

I’ve personally answered over 200 questions on the site and have interacted elsewhere by asking questions, upvoting great answers, and commenting and sharing compelling content. But as of late, my work and personal life have gotten in the way of writing, and I haven’t been able to publish very much on Quora.

Yet, I still have over 60K views in the past 30 days — which is currently my average monthly viewership.

How is this possible, if I haven’t been publishing a lot of content?

### Quora’s algorithms — that’s how.

Like any site, Quora is constantly looking for ways to generate more traffic.

Quora bots search for answers that are well-received, pushing that content to the top spot underneath a question that’s been asked.

For example, I’m big into nutrition and took it upon myself to answer a question regarding the dangers of sugar consumption. There were over 100 answers to the question already, but I decided to go ahead and share my personal story anyway. My answer was extremely well-received (600k + views), and it’s now the first answer that appears under the question, “*How dangerous is sugar to our health?*”

![](0*jJf8S4bsxiKkLU9h)

On top of this, Quora merges similar questions, bringing the followers of those questions together. This creates a huge opportunity for organic exposure, especially for FAQs like the ones I mentioned a bit earlier. I still generate regular views on my ‘sugar’ answer because people are constantly asking new questions on the implications of sugar on our health, which end up getting merged into the question I’ve already answered. So every time someone asks about sugar on Quora, my views go up.

But that’s not the only opportunity for exposure.

Aside from everything that happens directly on Quor, there are a few key ways to reach a large audience that happen off the site.

What most people don’t realize about Quora is that they have columns on major publications — and they’re constantly looking for originally material to use on those columns.

Don’t believe me? Here are a few:

[Quora’s Forbes column](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/#6ee3d1304a0d).

[Quora’s Inc. column](https://www.inc.com/author/quora).

[Quora’s HuffPost column](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/publishers-725).

All of the content used for these various columns originated as Quora answers. And when you’ve been published into one of their columns, those credentials appear on your Quora profile, like so:

![](0*iPOtdLVwgV_lnTU1)

And if all of *that *isn’t enough, the Quora publishing team puts out regular digests, sharing the best content on a regular basis. A few of my answers have been sent to digests of 10K, 500K, and even over 1,000,000 people.

If exposure is what you’re after, make Quora your best friend.

## 3. Guarantee a positive ROI.

When it comes to written content, marketers and PR teams first think to pitch bylines to popular columnists on major publications. But aside from being able to say, “I’ve been published on *Inc.*,” there isn’t much of an ROI — the average number of views per article on Inc. is less than 500. Plus, *anyone *can say they’ve been published in *Inc.* or *Forbes*

In fact, very few platforms produce a positive ROI for paid media on a consistent basis.

Quora practically guarantees it.

The site recently launched its paid media platform, giving users the opportunity to boost their answers for higher engagements. And unlike Facebook or Twitter, you don’t need to forfeit a ton of dough to reap the benefits. A little goes a long way.

Putting $5 behind a well-written answer to a question with a large following can generate 5,000+ views, easily. What would you rather do: pay over $1 per view for an *Inc.* feature, or pay 1/10th of a penny per view on Quora?

## The answer is clear.

Five to 10 bucks on Quora can potentially land you 10x the amount of views a columnist at a major publication can get you, for one 100th of the price.

If you want to become a Thought Leader, using Quora is a great way to get your name out there — and it practically guarantees a positive ROI.

# The Hidden Dangers of Confusing Attention with Accomplishment

## “person holding black camera lens” by Devin Avery on Unsplash

Here’s a fundamental truth about creating compelling work that many don’t get: **attention and accomplishment are incredibly different animals, and confusing one for the other will cause you to delude yourself into thinking you’re making progress towards a goal.**

You can do work that people naturally feel compelled to talk about. Or you can attempt to get people to talk about your work. The first is much harder than the second because it requires deep work and a focus on mastery instead of metrics. Unlike the latter, it doesn’t give you rapid feedback loops or instant applause. It forces you not to confuse attention with accomplishment.

## Successful Creators Who Don’t Use Social Media

Some of the most well-known writers don’t use Twitter or Facebook. But people are talking about them on Facebook.

* Seth Godin doesn’t use Facebook. But, lots of people share Seth’s content on Facebook even though he doesn’t use the platform.

* Cal Newport doesn’t even have a social sharing plugin installed on his blog, yet it’s incredibly popular.

* Michael Lewis has had a thriving career as an author, and he doesn’t use social media

When Tim Ferriss asked Seth how he deals with overwhelm, he didn’t offer a productivity hack. Instead, he shared his essential priorities. One of those priorities was to show up and write a blog post every single day. To honor that commitment, he doesn’t watch TV or use social media which gives him the time to do something rare and valuable. I think all of us who are fans of Seth can agree that we’d much rather have him write a blog post every day than be active on social media.

## The Illusion of Productivity

Study after study has shown that all social media tools are designed to be addictive, thanks to variable rewards, and an endless fire hose of information and dopamine hits. But the hidden danger is the false sense of productivity we get from using these tools. It feels as if we’re getting something done, even when we’re not. I can’t tell you the number of times that I’ve been with my family over the last few years, claiming that I had “work to do,” even though I just was posting stuff on Facebook.

“Whenever you recognize a task or project as completed, your brain releases a load of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is responsible for generating feelings of accomplishment, satisfaction, and happiness. This release of dopamine not only makes you feel good but also motivates you to continue completing tasks and extend that pleasant feeling,” says Francisco Saez. “The same process occurs when you use social media, even though you’re not getting shit done.”

## The Illusion of Accomplishment

The day I wrote a status update about my book deal, I got hundreds of likes and comments congratulating me. One of the things that [Ryan Holiday](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday) said to me an interview was that he never talks about a book until it’s finished because you’re receiving congratulations for something you haven’t even done yet. This deludes you into thinking you’ve accomplished something when there are still hundreds of hours of work in front of you.

In his recent article on the [two things you should be doing instead of social media](https://medium.com/personal-growth/two-things-you-should-focus-on-instead-of-social-media-4b3dd86bef7b), [John P. Weiss](https://medium.com/@johnpweiss) said the following:
> # *Social media success is a side effect of quality, not the cause. You can pretty your Instagram account all you want, and upload all kinds of lovely pictures on your Facebook page. None of that stuff, by itself, will make your art or business take off.*

Weiss’s writing is exemplary of this. It’s likely you’ve read one of his articles because they frequently become popular. For a former police officer to become a skilled cartoonist requires deep work.

This doesn’t just happen to creatives. It happens to startup founders as well. They might get featured in TechCrunch because they raised a round of funding. But, that doesn’t mean they’ve accomplished anything. They still have a business to build. In his *How to Start a Startup Podcast*, Sam Altman warns founders not to get caught up in their press.

## Satisfaction that Doesn’t Last

The two most popular things I’ve ever posted on Facebook were pictures of my [finished books](https://amzn.to/2KwnEPS). For about a day, I was insanely popular on Facebook. But, the hundreds of likes and comments I received did almost nothing to move the needle on book sales. And 24 hours later, I was an afterthought.

Attention, instant applause, and the satisfaction they provide is always temporary. The only way to sustain it is to seek more. Post another selfie, compose another clever tweet, or craft another poetic status update. Satisfaction is an insatiable beast that you have to keep feeding.

## Measuring Meaningless Metrics

I was recently having a conversation with my friend Mike about how much less time I’m spending on Facebook, and he asked: “Does using Facebook make you money?”. I knew it didn’t. It barely moves the needle on the most critical metrics in our business.

**Confusing attention with accomplishment causes us to measure meaningless metrics. **Likes, hearts, and comments don’t do shit for the bottom line of business. They don’t allow you to keep the lights on, put food on your table, or pay for things you need. Seven hundred dollars in your bank account is far more valuable than 700 likes on your Facebook post.

If you think a social media platform is necessary to sell your books as an author, don’t delude yourself. All you’re doing is feeding your ego with likes, hearts, and selfies with you holding your book.

The number one driver of book sales for any author that’s not already a celebrity is email. You could spend several thousand dollars on Facebook ads, however, you’d sell more books if you just bought thousands of dollars worth of books and gave them away.

Sometime this summer, when I was searching for a roommate, I met a girl who wanted to be a writer. She had a substantial presence on Instagram. Every one of her posts was getting 100’s of likes and comments when she posted a picture or video. And it’s precisely this kind of attention that is incredibly dangerous because it creates the illusion of progress towards her goal of becoming a writer. She’s not the only one who has done this. She just happens to be the one that came to mind as I was writing this.

Just because somebody is wildly popular on social media, it doesn’t mean they are rich or successful. This became quite clear to me when I was having breakfast at a dinner with my friend Brian, and he pointed out one of the waitresses who had a massive Instagram following. I’ve also heard stories about “social media celebrities” who are baristas at Starbucks. Don’t be fooled by the carefully edited and deliberately curated avatars of people. Remember, there’s a lot you don’t see.

The internet gives every one of us a microphone. We can either waste the potential of the internet by seeking instant applause and uploading selfies, or we can do something that matters.

One of the biggest reasons I dedicated an entire section in [An Audience of One](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733) to eliminating digital distractions was so you could spend more time doing something that truly matters.

## Self Obsession, Narcissism and a Toxic Psychological Environment

The most important book I’ve read in 2018 is *Selfie: How We Became Obsessed With Ourselves and What It’s Doing To Us*. Confusing attention with accomplishment gives us an over-inflated sense of self-importance.

People are so concerned with their image that the majority of pictures they posted were of themselves. The impact of this kind of narcissism should be deeply disturbing to all of us.

In her interview with Oprah, Julia Roberts mentioned that she’d recently joined Instagram. Her niece posted a picture of them hanging out on a Saturday morning. People commented on how bad she looked and how terribly she’d aged. Even as a 50-year-old woman who has had an incredibly successful career, she told Oprah that reading those comments hurt.

## Endless Comparison and Decreased Happiness
> # *What we see are studies that show social media is associated with diminished well being and lower life satisfaction because people are always looking at people with better lives” — Will Storr*

[Social media fuels anxiety, envy, and comparison](https://unmistakablecreative.com/how-our-use-of-social-media-fuels-comparison-envy-anxiety-and-depression/). But we overlook the fact that we’re comparing ourselves to an illusion. We’re seeing nothing but the highlight reels of people’s lives. We judge our happiness on a relative scale, based on how we stack up compared to other people. Social media skews that scale because there’s always someone who has done something more impressive than you have.

A few days ago I was interviewing Jennifer Miller about her new book *Mr. Nice Guy*. She’s had a long career as a journalist and author of four books. When I asked her if she had ever felt envious of other authors who have sold more books, she said, “Yes, that’s why I quit social media.”

One of my friends suggested that I should explore the reasons why seeing other people’s achievements on social media triggers envy. Personally, I think a much better use of my and any another creative person’s time would be to eliminate the trigger and put that energy into deep work.

## Unintended Consequences

It’s likely that we will see a mass exodus from social media over the next year. Between addictive productive design, mental health issues, behavior manipulation, filter bubbles, and long-term damage to our attention spans, and turning us into the cognitive equivalent of athletes who smoke, and it’s no surprise that Mark Manson referred to [smartphones as the new cigarettes.](https://markmanson.net/smartphones)

As someone who used to smoke when I drank, I’ve noticed how rare it is to see someone smoking a cigarette these days. I can’t help but think that a similar fate awaits many social media platforms, eventually becoming digital graveyards on the internet.

Social media may not cause cancer, but that doesn’t mean it’s harmless:

* A Facebook group for the event I planned became a substantial source of drama; gossip eventually led to dozens of burnt bridges and the end of many friendships. When I asked [Danielle LaPorte](https://medium.com/@DanielleLaPorte) about Facebook in a recent interview, she called it a “playground for vitriol”.

* The endless dopamine hits from talking with somebody I dated long distance sent me into a spiral of depression that derailed my life for more than a year and almost caused me to run my business into the ground.

[Attention is the currency of achievemen](https://unmistakablecreative.com/why-attention-is-the-currency-of-achievement-2/)t, and Mark Zuckerberg has become a billionaire by capturing yours and selling it to advertisers. **It’s worth considering what you might accomplish if you stopped confusing attention with accomplishment.**

# The Driving Force Behind Personal Growth Isn’t Goal Achievement. It’s This&#58;

## 

When it comes to goal-achievement, you have probably failed more than you’ve succeeded:

* *Have you really made it to the gym every day so far this year like you said you would?*

* *Have you really been spending less time on social media after promising you would do so?*

* *Are you sure you haven’t taken just one little bite of pizza since you said you would quit eating bread?*

Think of all the short-term goals for personal growth you promised yourself you would follow through on, similar to the ones mentioned above. Maybe it was that you would read more, or take more walks, or drink less coffee. You probably said something like, “If I do *this* every day, or do *that *every week, or *these things* every month, I will be a better version of myself in no time.”

And when “no time” finally came around, you realized you had fallen off the wheel.

Now you’re deciding if it’s even worth it to get back on.

### To answer in short: Yes, it’s worth it.

Now here’s why.
> # Anyone who says they’ve achieved every single goal they’ve ever set is a liar.

Not to sound negative, but the mental, physical and emotional strength necessary to keep every single promise you’ve ever made with yourself—especially little things like ‘make bed every day’ or ‘floss every night’ or ‘read a book a week’—is virtually impossible to harness.

Maybe you keep that promise for a few of those things, but tackling every single one of them on a consistent basis, without fail, is far-fetched.

For example, my new year’s resolution was to write every single day. Over 8-and-a-half months later, I can tell you I’ve failed—and I did so awhile ago. There were a couple of days that I didn’t publish any new original content, or work on personal writing, or write in my journal, or any other form of writing whatsoever.

I’ve done more writing in 2018 than I’ve done in my entire life up to this point, school included. But on the few days I missed the marked, I felt *incredibly* guilty.

And that’s the point.

### The real reason we set goals for personal growth is not to succeed at every single one of them.

Of course, it would be fantastic and extremely impressive if you did, but that’s not why you tell yourself you’re going to “do this every day” or “do that twice a week.”

You do it for the ***guilt*** you feel when you *don’t* keep your promise to yourself.

## Guilt is—in part—the driving force behind personal growth.

It’s sort of backwards to think about, but makes a lot of sense when you really look at it:

* You tell yourself you’re going to the gym every day. When you finally slip up and skip a day, you feel guilty, prompting you to get back into the gym and work even harder.

* You tell yourself you want to spend less time on social media. After a few weeks, you feel yourself falling back into your old habits, so you delete Facebook and Instagram from your phone completely.

* You have a late night with your friends and end up eating a bunch of pizza after staying away from bread for almost 6 months. The next day, you eat even healthier than you had been doing to compensate and vow never to do that again.

### All of these changes in personal growth are a result of guilt.

Often times, we end up accomplishing way more than we give ourselves credit for.

I mean, for instance, if you went from going to the gym once a week to going every single day for 3 months straight before you slipped up and missed a day, that’s a huge lifestyle change you *should *be extremely proud of.

But what sticks out in our minds is the fact that we missed a day. It’s the only thing we can focus on: that we failed. And it eats away at us until we do something to make up for it. When that happens, realize it happens to everyone, but go make up for it.

Of course, this isn’t to say you should use the inevitability of goal-failure as an excuse when you don’t follow through on something—that would eliminate any feeling of guilt whatsoever, causing *total *and *complete *failure.

Just know that when you miss the mark on some of those short-term, personal growth-type goals, you’re not alone.

Highlight the positives that came out of your initial attempts and hop right back into it.

# Can you effectively raise a child without yelling?

## Can you effectively raise a child without yelling?

### **Is it real or reasonable to consider never yelling at your children?**

I remember watching an interview where a woman said **she couldn’t recall a single time her father yelled at her.**

I thought to myself, *“Wow when I’m older I want to be a father like that.”*

My father yelled at me quite a lot so the concept that one doesn’t have to raise their voice to discipline their children intrigued me.

In my opinion, it’s okay to yell in a controlled matter. *“Anthony, dinner is ready!”* or *“What the heck were you thinking Anthony when you decided to burn your action figures in the kitchen sink?!” *For the record, because they lost the war… and because I like fire.

But yelling should come in controlled flashes.

It shouldn’t be one long uncontrolled rage. Things get said that can’t be taken back. And whatever goal you may have achieved as a parent in the short-term will create far more long-term problems.

Better to calm down.** Take a deep breath. **Ask questions. And then if punishment is required to give the sentencing in a fair dispassionate manner where both sides felt they had a chance to communicate.

The interviewee then went on to say that a subtle sign of disapproval from her father was enough to make her behave herself.

Kids want to make their parents proud so realize that and you’ll realize you don’t have to go over-the-top with your disapproval for your child to get the message. And might I add that like dogs, it’s far more effective to reward positive behavior *(treats, toys, and praise) *than it is to punish negative behavior.

# How I Get Shit Done Despite Having ADD&#58; Here’s What You Can Learn From My Experiences

## Photo by Charlz Gutiérrez De Piñeres on Unsplash

In my 20’s, after some challenges at work and the possibility of getting fired from yet another job, I went to see a psychiatrist and told him about my issues:

* Throughout the time I was in college, I couldn’t focus on a lecture and ended up with a lousy GPA.

* I couldn’t sit still in a meeting for more than about 20 minutes before I completely zoned out.

* Despite the low volume of work I was assigned, I made mistakes, and many things frequently slipped through the cracks.

After my appointment, I got a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder. Despite medicating myself, I still hated my job and my performance didn’t improve very much. Eventually, I left the job I was in and went to business school.

In terms of my attention span, not much has changed:

* When we have team meetings for Unmistakable Creative, my team members know that they’ll lose me after about 20 minutes. They have to occasionally say, “Hey Srini, have we lost you?” The nice thing about running a company is you can say yes to that question, not get fired and ask them to hurry up. Kingshuk, our content and growth strategist, even says “You kind of suck in meetings.” He’s not wrong.

* When I’m at a conference that is nothing but sessions all day long, I end up going back to my hotel room because I can’t pay attention.

* If I’m dating a girl and she insists that we talk on the phone daily, I know that it’s a recipe for disaster. It also drove my ex-girlfriends crazy. Personally, if I saw you yesterday and you’re coming to my house again today, I think a phone conversation is unnecessary. The irony of this, of course, is that I have conversations via Skype for the interviews on Unmistakable Creative multiple times a week.

The one thing that has changed however is my ability to produce. Despite my short attention span, I’ve managed to do the following:

* Write multiple books

* Record 600 Interviews

* [Read 100 books in a year](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-read-100-books-in-a-year-d7b35660ebd1)

* Write 100’s of articles

So, what exactly changed? I learned how my brain works and have designed my days to get the most out of them. Part of why I’ve had to develop repeatable systems for my creative work is because of my short attention span. So what can you do if you have a short attention span?

## Plan Your Days Based on Your Attention Span

Every one of us has times of day when our ability to focus is at its best and its worst.

The reason I’m so vigilant about spending the first hour of my day on high-value activities is that my attention span is highest right when I wake up in the morning. I’m able to get a disproportionate amount of work done in the first few hours compared to the rest of my day.

So how do you take advantage of this when you wake up?

1. [**Plan your days the night before.](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-planning-your-day-the-night-before-drastically-increases-your-productivity-5f12c678b384)** As I’ve said before, this leads to a significant increase in your productivity. It also reduces decision fatigue.

2. **Wake up early:** When it comes to your attention span, not all hours of the day are created equal. By beginning your creative work early in the morning, it’s more likely that time will be completely uninterrupted. Your mind is also not too active yet, which makes it much easier to focus on whatever you’re doing. And you haven’t depleted your willpower by making lots of decisions. It’s much easier to read 50 pages and write 1000 words first thing in the morning than it is later in the day.

**3) [Don’t turn your devices on first thing in the morning](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-you-shouldnt-turn-on-your-devices-first-thing-in-the-morning-640f4d76e26e).** With the exception of using the Calm app to meditate for 10 minutes, I don’t use my phone for the first 2–3 hours of any day. Once I’m done with the meditation, I put my phone out of sight.

If you’re driven and dedicated to sharpening your creative process, I’ve put together a deeper look into my best methods [in this very actionable PDF](http://eepurl.com/cKDY2b).

**4) Do the most important thing first.**

Given that I’m working on an outline for a third book, the most important thing that I do every morning is writing. The creators of the productivity planner pose an important question that I urge you to consider when it comes to planning your days.
> # “If the only thing I got done today was this, would I be satisfied?”

That’s a great litmus test for identifying your most important task. Note: The same approach can be taken for night owls. The only difference is that you’re staying up late instead of waking up early.

## Intensity of Focus Matters More than Length of Time

[One focused hour a day](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-power-of-one-focused-hour-a-day-6147d80c3910) of uninterrupted creation time will do far more for you than 6 hours a day of unfocused and perpetually interrupted creation time. Say you do 5 hours of uninterrupted creation time for a week and you use that time to write 1000 words each day. By the end of the week, you’ll have 5000 words. If you repeated this process over 52 weeks you’d have 250,000 words.
> # *Distractions and interruptions have unique impacts on your brain. While both can shake up your short term memory cup, making you forget what just happened, interruptions are far worse than distractions. Distractions disrupt the connections between the middle frontal gyrus and the seeing brain (visual cortex), but they don’t obliterate it, so your brain still remembers whatever you were doing and you can come back to it easily. When you’re interrupted however, switching tasks derails you, and this connection falls apart. Although distractions can reduce your productivity, if you do not tag and filter them, interruptions can be even more disruptive. — Srini Pillay*

One of the ironic upsides to a short attention span is that it gives you an ability to focus intensely on things. With intense focus and deep work you’ll get more done in less time, experience more flow, and you get an almost disproportionate increase in production capacity. What takes the average person 3–4 hours you can often do in 45 minutes.

Most of our time management issues are really attention management issues. But if you can work in intense bursts of focus, you’ll be amazed by your progress. When it comes to creative work, face time is far less relevant than production capacity.

## Use the Pomodoro Method

One simple way to work in intense focus blocks is to use a tool like the productivity planner and the Pomodoro method. You decide on a task and then decide how many 25 minute spurts you’ll work in. Whatever you do, don’t multitask. Not only does it inhibit your ability to get into flow, it forces you to start the Pomodoro over. Here’s a snapshot below of the productivity planner.

## Don’t Bite Off more than you Can Chew

Often, we bite off more than we can chew. Our days get wasted because, in an effort to get everything done, we get nothing done. Our attention spans are somewhat limited and we inevitably hit a point of diminishing returns during our day. This is why you should limit the number of items on your to-do list.

Say you have 20 items on your to-do list every day. That’s 100 items in the week. Let’s say you only get 2–3 done each day. At the end of the week, you’ll have done about 10 out of the 100 items. On the flip side, let’s say you limit yourself to your 5 essential priorities. At the end of the week, you’ll have completed 20 activities and because you’re actually finishing everything on your list, you’ll start to gain momentum.

## Downtime is a Critical Ingredient

Believe it or not, downtime improves your attention span. When we check email multiple times a day and use social media excessively, we become the cognitive equivalent of athletes that smoke.

One way to take advantage of downtime is to develop a daily meditation habit. On the mornings when I skip my meditation practice, my focus tends to be a bit more scattered.

It’s also important to have a shutdown ritual if you’re serious about doing deep work. I turn off my devices from 7 pm to 9 pm. Increase focus in the morning and less anxiety are two great benefits of reducing your screen time. Pick a time when you’re going to shut down and don’t use your devices after that.

## Designing Environments and Experiences Conducive to Focus

One of the biggest mistakes we make when it comes to our attention span is to push too far beyond our cognitive capabilities. It’s a bit like going to the gym and trying to make the jump from lifting 25-pound barbells to 80-pound ones within a day.

Ridiculously long meetings, 8 hour work days, and conferences where people spend from morning until evening in sessions with a carb loaded lunch are unfortunately all too common.

In order to really get the best out of our attention span, we have to design experiences as much as we do create a task list. When I talk to people who plan events, I encourage them to think of themselves less as meeting planners and more as experience designers. The same applies to your day to day.

When it comes to your physical environment, reduce or eliminate anything that’s competing for your attention. If you don’t need something for the task at hand, consider it a distraction.

When I worked for an online travel company, we had a meeting every Monday. More often than not, the only reason we had this meeting was because it was Monday. As a remote employee, I dialed in from Costa Rica for a meeting one Monday, and listened to our marketing team discuss the broken air conditioner in the office for 45 minutes. If you find yourself in meetings like this, buy a copy of Al Pitampalli’s book *Read this Before your Next Meeting* for everyone on your team.

We were never meant to sit at a desk for 8 hours a day staring at a screen. We’ve imposed the working structure of the industrial revolution on schools and work in the information age. Cal Newport says, “The way that we do knowledge work today is similar to the way we built cars before the industrial revolution.

This isn’t really an issue of attention span as much as it is an issue of a poorly designed environment that’s not conducive to creativity, productivity or focus.

Part of the reason I’ve been able to produce the volume of work that I have is that my days are designed in such a way that I don’t spend all day in front of my computer. Most of what I do gets done in 2–3 hours a day of deep work.

If you want to get the most of out of your employees, don’t measure face time, measure their output. What gets measured gets managed and you might get people measuring face time at the expensive of work that actually matters.

## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation

It’s hard to talk about attention span without looking at the role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Author Dan Pink’s research shows that we reach a point of diminishing returns rather quickly with extrinsic motivation. You can see his explanation in the video below.

When I was in my 20’s, I held a number of sales positions where there was always the potential for more money. But those positions all lacked three essential factors for motivation: autonomy, purpose, and mastery.

Today, all 3 of these factors are part of my work. One of the easiest ways to fix a person’s attention span is to make sure that they are intrinsically motivated by the work that they do. When you love what you do, it’s far less of a struggle to focus than it is when you hate what you do. Often when people are not motivated, it’s because they don’t find their work engaging. When you mismatch talent and environment, what you end up with is subpar performance.

## Nature, Flow, and Attention Restoration Theory

It might seem strange, but I’d also say that surfing has played a significant role in strengthening my attention span. Nature has a positive impact on creativity.

There are probably a few reasons for this.

The most obvious one is that action sports are a direct gateway to flow states. When you’re in flow, you’re usually enjoying yourself so much that it’s actually difficult to become distracted. Anytime I get out of the water after a good surf session I can write for a few hours, and my best work emerges. As I’ve said before, when you’re stuck mentally, move physically. The other thing that happens when we exercise is that we get rid of excess energy and anxiety that often gets in the way of our ability to maintain our attention span.

According to attention restoration theory, people can concentrate better after time spent in nature. Case in point, I finished this article and one of the last sections of my manuscript after a 2-hour surf session. Maybe the founder of Patagonia was onto something when he said: “Let my people go surfing.”

A few years ago, a short attention span was not being able to focus for 30 minutes. These days, it’s amazing if people can focus for more than 5 minutes. We read more status updates than we do books. It’s easier to compose a caption for Instagram than it is to write something with depth. People can’t finish reading articles let alone books.

But here’s the good news about all this. If you can [sustain your focus for 30 to 45 minutes](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-deep-work-helps-you-get-more-done-in-less-time-39de3f5e9ae6), you’ll have a big competitive edge. On the surface, a short attention span might appear to be a disadvantage. But with the right systems and habits, you can turn it into a disproportionate advantage.

# American Built Clothing&#58; Truly An American-Made Original

## 

An unabashedly honest and perpetually fired up Nick Carson started American Built Clothing in 2012 with no business experience and a lot of passion. A Marine veteran, he wants to sell to customers who trust “Made in the USA” products to provide durable materials and quality work.

The reality is that buying American has always been a core cultural and economic value among American customers — and too few clothing manufacturers. To meet these consumer demands, Carson is producing American-made and USA-themed quality jeans, shirts and more.

Nick, who served his country with distinction, lead a recent conversation with the statement that “the words American Built, they meant something to me” explaining that they’d always made him feel he was “part of something greater than myself.” With American Built Clothing, he aims to spread a positive message of “be proud of what you wear, be proud of where you’re from.”

### **Nick And The Marines**

Nick trained to become a Marine sniper. It was his dream since ninth grade. When he finally realized this dream, he was deployed twice to Japan and once to Iraq and was wounded in service. For all of his incredibly brave efforts, he received a Purple Heart.

Nick indicates he was wounded in Iraq on August 11, 2004. He explains that, “Shortly after being wounded, I got word that our battalion was running a Sniper Indoc…. This was going to be my only chance to become a sniper, so I wasn’t going to let this opportunity pass me by. I healed up as best as I could and took the Indoc, and ended up being one of the top seven Marines that went on to sniper school. Out of all the Marines that started the Indoc and went on to sniper school, three of us passed. Between the war in Iraq and the sniper training, the only way I wasn’t going to succeed [was] if I died.”

In spite of his success in the Marines, Nick had trouble adjusting to “normal” life. Discharged from the service — one never leaves the Marines — in 2006, Nick says, “I was living a destructive lifestyle.” He worked odd jobs, but he was drinking heavily and fighting. Nick didn’t care if he lived or died. But, things soon changed when a friend approach him in 2012 with an idea.

![](1*UVMXQFGnpR5YNadMi_966Q.jpeg)

### **A Whole New Mission**

Nick’s best friend, Navy veteran KC Kensley, brought him an idea that became American Built Clothing. He and KC had always hated buying things made overseas. After some research, they found they could start an all American-made clothing brand and spread a positive message while doing it.

He had no business experience, let alone experience in owning a clothing brand. Nevertheless, as a veteran, spreading a positive American message seemed like a no-brainer. Because of that, Nick just ran with the words “American Built” and told himself he would learn along the way and solve the problems as they arose. He echoed, “I won’t quit!” And with that, American Built Clothing was born.

![](1*1RHw_xmHHqwRUG1TtRT29A.png)

### **American Built Believes American-Made Is The Only Way To Be**

When Nick uses the term “truly American-made,” he means it. Unlike some competitors who use the expression as merely a marketing hook, Nick indicates that with American Built Clothing, “The cotton, the making of the shirts, the inks, the equipment we use, and all of us doing the work are all American made. I don’t cut corners to save a buck!”

Along with the commitment to truly American-made products, American Built Clothing is also committed to supporting those who have and continue to serve in the military. In keeping with that idea, he gave us his top tips for those looking to transition into the civilian workforce after military service:

* Go to work immediately. Sitting around doing nothing is unhealthy.

* Build a support system surrounding yourself with family and friends.

* Network with other vets to check on each other.

* Remain positive.

* Stay physically and mentally active to avoid the rabbit holes of depression.

* Value small victories.

* Appreciate what you have and move forward.

As well, he advises veterans and military spouses to “gain as much knowledge and experience as you can in the business you want to be in before starting your own. Work for companies in your same industry before taking off on your own.” Nick also cites business consultant, Steven Kuhn, and Aubrey Marcus’ book,* Own the Day, Own Your Life*, as influences on his approach.

Throughout Nick Carson’s life his love of country has always been a cornerstone to who he is. And, it’s clear that with American Built Clothing, this love is as strong as ever. When it comes to his business, Nick says, “I started at the bottom with nothing so there is only one way I can go and that is up.” After being wounded in Iraq and honored with a Purple Heart, it would be easy to suggest that Nick’s commitment and determination will virtually ensure nothing will stop him from achieving his goals.

# Sucking at something is the first step to being Sort ofGood at Something

## https://img.memecdn.com/jake-the-dog-on-sucking_o_799995.jpg

We have this misconception of successful people that everything they create is amazing. But, nothing could be further from the truth. One of the most significant sources of resistance for any creative is the belief that everything they produce has to be good. As author Anne Lamott famously said that all good writing begins with terrible first efforts.

## **False Starts**

Even though I’ve been writing 1000 words a day for more than five years, I still have plenty of false starts. Sometimes my first 900 words are false starts. None of my sentences connect to the ones before and nothing I’m writing sounds coherent. I am usually writing in the words of my friend Sarah Peck, “god-awful essays that nobody wants to read, myself included.”

We resist false starts when it comes to creative work because we mistake them for failures. As a result, the false start prevents us from doing anything at all. But a false start is better than standing still. Action creates clarity, movement creates momentum, and both lead to progress, result in a cycle of motivation and consistency.

It’s exactly how this article started out. For the first 900 words, I was writing down whatever came to my mind. But I couldn’t expand on any of my ideas. So I kept jotting down more ideas. As Seth Godin has once said, the key to having good ideas to have lots of bad ideas. To become a prolific writer, you have to be willing to have false starts, half-baked ideas, bad ones, and incoherent ones.

Bad creative ideas are like the dirt that you have to shovel before you hit gold.

![](0*j9jVB3qOhRSKHfEf)

## **Half Baked Ideas**

Some of my best writing is the result of half-baked ideas over the course of multiple weeks. Half-baked ideas give you puzzle pieces. After accumulating enough puzzle pieces, you’re able to complete the puzzle.

People resist half-baked ideas because they think that their creative process has to be linear. They don’t realize that ideas need time to bake. This belief kept me trapped for years. But when [Jennifer Louden](https://twitter.com/jenlouden) told me an interview “your structure, has to be linear but your process doesn’t” my creative output skyrocket.

The most popular thing I’ve ever written was the result of dozens of half-baked ideas over multiple writing sessions. What started out as nothing other than paragraphs and status updates eventually turned into my article about [what we should have learned in school but never did](https://medium.com/the-mission/what-we-should-have-learned-in-school-but-never-did-88450ce83963). I didn’t realize what I was creating until I had enough puzzle pieces to put the puzzle together. I took the same approach to my ultimate guide to mastering your craft.

## **Creating for the Trash Can**

In his book, Unthink, graffiti artist and author Erik Wahl describes what he calls “creating for the trash can.” When you’re creating for the trash can, you know you can throw something away if it isn’t good. This allows you to approach every day as a blank page. If you what you created today isn’t good, you can come back tomorrow and give it another shot.

* All writers have lousy writing days even if they’ve written multiple bestsellers.

* All painters have lousy painting days.

[When I interviewed Elle Luna for the Unmistakable Creative](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/a-journey-to-the-crossroads-of-should-and-must-with-elle-luna/), she said this about her creative process. “I still throw plenty of work away.”

Regardless of the art form, people who are masters of their craft have days when their performance is subpar. But they understand the profound power of consistency, so they just come back tomorrow.

## **Shitty First Drafts**

In his book Do The Work, Steven Pressfield tells the story about writing something awful that suddenly seems brilliant when he looks at it the next day. We judge our work both harshly and quickly. Often we judge it while we’re creating it.

* You might be drawing and thinking “this is shit.”

* You might be writing and thinking “this is nonsense.”

But as the term “shitty first drafts” implies, work that is shit is just a part of the creative process. It’s not necessarily a reflection of your skill or capabilities.

Any author who has worked with a publisher will tell you that a manuscript goes through dozens of revisions before it’s approved for production.

They don’t see the endless redlining and comments that say “what does this mean?” as a reflection of their value. They recognize that t is just part of the process.

As I’ve jokingly told friends, the secret to my writing process is that 90 percent of everything I write is shit. I rarely write anything worth reading. I just write a lot.

## **Develop the Discipline of Capturing Ideas**

As I said in my new book, [An Audience of One: Reclaiming Creativity for its Own Sake](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733), we don’t have a shortage of ideas. We lack the discipline of capturing them.

![](0*PoQYBqx4Oy79pg6l)

A few weeks ago a friend told me about Airtable, and within a few days of using it, I was a super fan. I have two editorial calendars in Airtable.

The editorial calendar for our podcast has all of the following:

1. **The schedule for upcoming episodes**

1. **The status of episodes (recorded or scheduled)**

1. **The sponsor/advertiser for the episode**

1. **Ideas for potential guests**

I use a similar editorial calendar for my writing, which has all of the following.

1. **Schedule for an upcoming post**

**2. Status of something I’m writing (in progress, staging, etc.)**

**3. Ideas for new articles**

The other thing I do is capture all of my highlights and underlines from the books that I’m reading in Evernote. Your brain is a terrible place to store information, and by capturing your ideas, you’re free up your cognitive bandwidth to come up with new ones.

## The Virtually Nonexistent Cost of Bad Ideas

We’re gradually moving towards what the economist Jeremy Rifkin defines as Zero Marginal cost.

A platform like Medium is a perfect example of zero marginal cost.

1. First, it costs nothing to be a writer on the platform.

1. Second, you can publish something shitty today, and it’s not going to cost you anything to come back and try again tomorrow.

Over last 20 years, the gap between creativity and technology has become much narrower, driving the marginal cost of expressing our creativity closer and closer to zero.

It used to take weeks and thousands of dollars to build a website. Today, thanks to tools like Squarespace, anyone can build a decent website in a matter of hours for less than their monthly coffee budget.

Look at the early work of any successful creative, and you’ll likely find that it’s awful in comparison to what you know them for today. But that didn’t stop them from doing their work. Every creative act planted a seed for their body of work.

As [Reid Hoffman](https://twitter.com/reidhoffman) has famously said, “if you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you shipped too late.” Progress is far more useful than a level of perfection that prevents you from shipping. Don’t underestimate the value of bad ideas. Sucking at something is the first step to being sort of good at anything.

# 5 Essential Ingredients for Building a Lifelong Creative Practice

## 

If there’s one thing that all of my friends who are prolific creators have in common, it’s that they approach their creative work as a practice. It’s something they do on a regular basis, regardless of whether they’re writing a blog post, trying to meet a deadline for a book, or producing something for one of their clients. Even if they don’t necessarily have an outcome in mind, they engage in their practice.

* [Sarah Kathleen Peck](https://twitter.com/sarahkpeck) is always writing something. If you’ve ever met her in person, you’ll notice that if you’re at a place where you can sit down, she’s scribbling something.

* George Lange, who has photographed everyone from rockstar to presidents, takes pictures every single day of his life. In a conversation on the Unmistakable Creative, he told me about photographing children getting on and off a school bus. Because he’s approached his photography as a practice, it’s allowed him to create a lifetime of unforgettable memories.

In his book, Turning Pro, Steven Pressfield says the following about a practice:
> A practice implies engagement in a ritual. A practice may be defined as the dedicated, daily exercise of commitment, will and focus intention aimed, on one level at the achievement of mastery in a field, but on a loftier level, intended to produce a communion with a power greater than ourselves — call it whatever you like: God. mind, soul, Self, The Muse, the superconscious.

How do you build a lifelong creative practice?

## 1. A Space in Which You Create
> # It doesn’t really matter what or where it is, as long as it is yours. I don’t necessarily mean that it has to belong to you. Only that, for the time you’re working you have what you need. — Dani Shapiro

Nothing impacts your behavior as much as your environment. Having a space specifically for your creative practice is essential. It doesn’t have to be big. It doesn’t have to be fancy. It can be a room of your own, your cubicle, a chair at your kitchen table, or a table at your favorite coffee shop. Whether you want the equivalent of a new age gifts shop on your desk, you want to hang motivational posters on the wall, or you’re a minimalist, create a space that lights you up. What matters most is that it yours and that it inspires you. When you have a space for your creative practice, eventually the environment and your behavior get linked.

## 2. A Time

By having a time for your practice, you tap into [the profound power of consistency](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-profound-power-of-consistency-3f1a361bb8fd) and start to build momentum. It also allows you take advantage of the fact that your cumulative output matters more than any individual day or piece of work.

I don’t sweat lousy writing days or articles that don’t resonate with my readers because I know that I’ll have another shot at the same time tomorrow or with the next article I publish. Every day is a blank page.

While I do believe calendars are more effective than to do lists, I use a combination of both. As you’ll see in the image below of my Best Self Journal, I have deep work blocks set aside specifically for this purpose.

![](1*A2SNcUgVij6J1y1CQhni8w.jpeg)

If you schedule a specific time for your creative practice, you’ll be much more likely to follow through on it.

## 3. An Intention

When I sit down to work, I have one intention: hit my word count for the day. I do that because it’s the one thing that’s always in my control. I never know if I’ll have a good idea, if I can articulate that idea, or if any of what I write will usable.

The idea for this post came to me while drinking my afternoon coffee. Despite writing 2000 plus words in the morning, most of it was incoherent psychobabble.

If you’re a person who dreads writing shit that you think nobody will want to read, I encourage you to consider these words of [Amber Rae](https://twitter.com/heyamberrae):
> # You want to accumulate pages, not judgments.

A good intention, allows you to[ focus on the process, not the prize ](https://medium.com/the-mission/focusing-on-the-process-instead-of-the-prize-28437467d365)and frees you up to create without judgment.

## 4. A Ritual

Every creative practice needs a ritual. A ritual serves multiple purposes. First, it preserves willpower and reduces decision fatigue. It’s easy to forget that every little thing we do is a decision that depletes willpower over the course of the day. Having a ritual eliminates several decisions, and helps you to preserve your willpower and cognitive bandwidths. And much like the space in which you create, when you go through a ritual consistently, the ritual and your desired behavior will get linked.

Every morning I follow the same routine. I brush my teeth, set the coffee to brew and meditate for 10–15 minutes. By setting the coffee to brew first, I know that I’ll get a reward for my meditation practice with a hot cup of coffee. After that, I read for 30 minutes to an hour and write for an hour.

There’s no “right way” for a creative ritual. If you have to drink green tea, burn sage, and pretend to worship goddesses of religions other than your own to get your creative juices flowing so be it.
> # It’s yours so you can make it as batshit crazy as you please. Just don’t kill anything.

## 5. A Lifelong Commitment

When your creative practice becomes a lifelong pursuit, you have the power to become a master of your craft. It stops being about one book, one piece of art, or one moment in time. Instead, it becomes about building a body of work and a personal legacy. We build a creative life by having an ongoing artistic practice and commitment that is lifelong. Most authors write every day long after their books are published. And most of them would probably write even if nobody was reading.

When my first book came out, somebody asked what I was going do on publication date. I said, “the same thing I’ve done every day for the last five years, write a 1000 words.”

While a space, time and intention might sound restrictive, constraints like these give you creative freedom. When you don’t have to think about these things, you can put that energy into the work itself.

If you establish an ongoing creative practice, you’ll start to realize that it energizes, revitalizes, and sustains you. Over the course of a lifetime, it transforms from an obligation to a privilege.

It ’s something that you keep doing, even if the only person who benefits from it is you, even if it’s only for an [Audience of One.](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733)

*On August 7, my new book, [AN AUDIENCE OF ONE](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529598912&sr=8-1&keywords=An+audience+of+one+srinivas), hits shelves! In it, I explain how the work we do in private, without outside input or distraction, can plant the seed for the most resonant and impactful projects in the world. I’m hoping the ideas in it will lead to some of your most rewarding work — I know the process of writing the book certainly led to some of mine.*

# Why You Should Consider Doing A 4 day Workweek.

## Image Credit: Keptelenseg

I recently had an epiphany: what if working 4 days a week was the answer.

This idea came about because I’ve been attempting to pivot my career in a different direction and it’s taking a toll on me. I’m trying to ensure that my side hustles can continue on in an effective manner.

I also want to take up an opportunity that allows me to expand into a new field and work with a company I admire.

This whole process came to an abrupt halt when I figured out that there wasn’t time for everything. Then, an idea came to me: **What if the answer was a 4-day week?**

Some companies allow you to work compressed hours that means you work a longer workday, so you can take a day off.

Other companies allow you to take a pay cut for the one day you’re not working.

## Why work 4-days?
> A 4-day workweek lets you spend more time on your side hustles. For some of you, you want that side hustle to become your main source of income.

For others like me, you want to have your primary career and your side hustle. Both scenarios are good.

Having an extra day that you dedicate to working on your own projects adds an immense sense of fulfillment. I’ve been experimenting with the 4-day workweek for a while.

Initially, I took one day a week off as an annual leave day to see what it felt like. While this probably doesn’t work long-term, it will give you a taste of the lifestyle that is available to all of us.

On the day I had off each week, I stayed at home and concentrated on my blogging.

![Image Credit: [Sala Kryszek Art & Writing Competition](http://www.ojmche.org/educate/education/sala-kryszek-art-writing)](1*XKCHh5ViaWlqROpt7p_w-Q.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Sala Kryszek Art & Writing Competition](http://www.ojmche.org/educate/education/sala-kryszek-art-writing)*

I posted new articles, edited up and coming articles, reached out to fellow bloggers and setup a few new income streams.

**I trialed this lifestyle for a month. That was enough for me to see the benefits.**

Each of us can be crippled by a full workweek because often we don’t get time to work on our side hustles.

Working before and after work is all good but for some people, this is not practical. They may have a commute in the morning or come home from work exhausted from all the stress.

## Rules of the 4-day workweek:

1. No lounging around on day five (save that for the weekend)
2. Set clear goals for your day off
3. Work the normal hours you would do at your day job 
4. Only work on your side hustle/ passion (don’t get sucked into shopping or paying bills)

I found that without discipline, your 4-day workweek is useless. It ends up putting you further behind and that will only make you feel worse.
> # “Your day off each week is the time where your destiny is shaped and your dreams can be achieved. Don’t give up these huge payoffs for Netflix, junk food and gossip”

## What did I learn from the 4-day workweek?

![Image Credit: [The Context Of Things](http://thecontextofthings.com/2014/05/02/lets-say-you-shifted-your-organization-to-people-working-4-days-a-week-10-hours-a-day-every-weekend-is-a-three-day-weekend-could-this-help-employee-engagement/)](1*E32Htp6kuPCbRic_LSxwbA.jpeg)*Image Credit: [The Context Of Things](http://thecontextofthings.com/2014/05/02/lets-say-you-shifted-your-organization-to-people-working-4-days-a-week-10-hours-a-day-every-weekend-is-a-three-day-weekend-could-this-help-employee-engagement/)*

## 1. I worked harder on the days I was at work.

That’s right — hard to believe I know. The days when I was at work, I became even more obsessed with being productive because I wanted my day off to be fully immersed in my side hustles.

I said no to lots of meetings, didn’t do random coffee catch ups and got really good at deleting emails that didn’t serve my 4-day a week career goals, outcomes or KPI’s.

## 2. It broke up the week.

Placing your day off right in the middle of the week is the best time slot. It stops you from living a long weekend which will make you lazy on a Friday.

Having your passions scheduled for the middle of the week gives you the motivation to start and end your week — it’s a two for one combo!!!

**Changing energies between different industries and different types of work completely changed how my workweek felt. I got good at batching similar work tasks and felt more motivated overall.**

## 3. Use a change in career to negotiate your 4-day week.

Negotiating a 4-day workweek is best done when you’re making a career change.

The decision-maker of your new career is much more likely to agree if you include your proposal as part of the salary package negotiation.

Make it clear why you’re wanting a 4-day workweek and set the expectation that you’ll be even more effective — not less.

![Illustration by [Erin Taj](http://erintaj.com/Gallery)](1*o8FkEth7lOkxcBwjIbEYtQ.jpeg)*Illustration by [Erin Taj](http://erintaj.com/Gallery)*

## 4. It can become the foundation for your own business.

In my case, the 4-day workweek became the seed for my side business. In a short space of time, I was able to say yes to some part-time consulting and this pivoted my career in a completely different direction.

I began to use my talents differently and discovered other practical ways to earn a living.

I truly believe that a 4-day workweek can even lead to a path of entrepreneurship for some as well.

## Final Thought.
> The answer to building your startup, creating a side hustle or working on your passions is not to quit a 9–5 job or do a 360-career change that could end up as a disaster.
> The answer to all of your career challenges is to experiment with a 4-day week.

Use a few days of holidays to experiment and then follow the rest of the steps in this article if the experiment works for you.

Doing more of what you love will take you to places you’ve never imagined.

You deserve it so why not give a 4-day workweek a go?

# Why I read Physical Books And Start Most of My Writing By Hand

## “books on brown wooden shelf” by Susan Yin on Unsplash

According to an article in the New Yorker, “Moleskine-style” notebooks have been produced since the 1850’s, by small French bookbinding companies, and distributed in Paris bookstores. They were used by Picasso, Hemingway, Van Gogh, and the like. (“Moleskine” refers to the traditional oilcloth binding; moleskines are not made out of moles’ skins.)

Even though the company was started in 1997, the popularity of the notebooks paradoxically soared with the emergence of blogs. In his interview on The Unmistakable Creative, former PR director Erik Fabian described the Moleskine as a “platform for your imagination”.

Over the last 10 years, and more than 700 interviews, there are two patterns that I’ve noticed in my friends that are prolific and poetic writers:

1. **They write in physical notebooks**

1. **They read physical books**

[Sarah Kathleen Peck](https://twitter.com/sarahkpeck), [Amber Rae](https://twitter.com/heyamberrae) , and [Ryan Holiday](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday) all share at least one if not both of these patterns. Amber and Sarah make music from their words. Ryan has written 6 books in 6 years.

Until late 2013, I did most of my reading on a Kindle. At the start of 2014, I interviewed Amber and [Dani Shapiro](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/dani-shapiro-perils-pleasures-creative-life/) on The Unmistakable Creative.

* Even though I’d already read the book on Kindle, I immediately ordered a physical copy of Dani’s book *Still Writing*: *The Perils and Pleasures of a Creative Life*. To this day, I return to it regularly, using many quotes in blog posts, and am inspired with ideas for my articles. It has more underlined passages and sentences than any of my other books. After that interview, I also switched exclusively to reading physical books.

* I resisted writing in a physical notebook because my handwriting is terrible. Sometimes, I even have a hard time reading it. But Amber encouraged me to fall in love with my chicken scratch, and I have started all of my writing in a Moleskine ever since.

Since making these changes, I started to notice two patterns in my own life:

* **I retain far more from reading physical books than I ever have from Kindle or audiobooks**

* **Physical writing in notebooks has made me more present, productive, and prolific as a writer**

The benefits of reading physical books and writing by hand far outweigh the costs of being slower and taking up space.

## Writing by Hand
> # *The fever is lost on the screen. The evidence of the mind making the thing-made visible in the cross outs, the thick rewriting of words over other words, the fanciful sketches- a cloud, a camel, a man in a hat-that seem to ride the waves of language, the places where the pen grows dark and forceful, nearly stabbing in its intensity- **Dani Shapiro, Still Writing***

A physical notebook is one of the best distraction-free writing tools because there’s nothing else competing for your attention. You have no choice but to be present and focused. You’re also forced to slow down because you can’t feverishly jot down every thought that comes to mind.

If you’re somebody who does your writing early in the morning, it keeps you from turning on your devices first thing in the morning. And it prevents you from starting your day on the internet, which damages your brain.

“When we write by hand, we’re forced be more economical and strategic with our language, crafting notes in our own words. To do that, we have to listen more closely, think about the information, and essentially distill others’ words and thoughts through our own neurological filtration system and onto the page,” says [Ryder Carroll](https://twitter.com/rydercarroll) in his new book *The Bullet Journal Method.*

If you’re not convinced, try the following exercise:

1. **Write down a quote from one of your favorite books, podcasts, etc. on your computer and riff on it for 10 minutes.**

1. **Repeat the exercise, but this time use a physical notebook instead.**

Chances are that you’ll notice a big difference in the speed at which you think and a better ability to manage your attention.

Your behavior is linked to your environment whether you’re consciously aware of it or not. If you set your notebook out the night before, sit down at your desk, or wherever you choose to write with a pen in hand, eventually the notebook and your writing habit will be linked.

I can trace every book idea, creative project, and breakthrough back to the pages of one of one of my notebooks. I had the idea for using surfing as a metaphor for life and business years before I wrote [*Unmistakable: Why Only is Better Than Best](https://www.amazon.com/Unmistakable-Only-Better-Than-Best/dp/1101981709)*.

The pages of a notebook are fertile soil for creative ideas. So you should always carry one.

## Reading Physical Books
> # *“The physical realness of books contributes to our ability to enter the space where we can dwell un-judged with our hard-won thoughts and multilayered emotions and feel we have found our way home.” — [Maryanne Wolf](https://medium.com/@maryanne.wolf)*

Physical books are heavy, take up lots of space, and they are not necessarily convenient. I’ve filled 3 Ikea bookshelves in 2 years, and new books show up at my apartment every few days. The only reason I wish I had a bigger apartment was so I could have a room just for my books.

Nothing else competes for your attention when you’re reading a physical book. This helps you sustain your attention for more extended periods, and makes it much easier to avoid sources of distraction. Despite the popularity of both Amazon and the Kindle, people still go to bookstores and buy physical books.

When I met Tucker Max for the first time, I noticed that his house was filled with books from wall to wall. Ryan Holiday also has a massive physical library and has said this about it:
> I’ve purchased a fair amount of Kindle books. Do you know how many times I have “flipped” through those books after I read them? Or looked at the notes I took? Never. I don’t even remember which ones I bought. If there were no other reason to prefer physical to digital, this is it.

Both of them have had incredibly successful writing careers.

## Reading on Screens and The F-Pattern

If you’ve read this far down the page, ask yourself how much you remember. Better yet, see if you can recall anything significant from all the things you read on the internet this week.

Chances are it’s not very much. When you read on a screen, you scan more than you read. Your eye movement follows what is known as an F-pattern. **The inevitable result of scanning is that you move from deep reading to shallow browsing.​**

In a world, where we are inundated with digital input, texts, notifications, pings, buzzes, pops, and more, going analog isn’t just a productivity hack. It’s a form of meditation and mindfulness. Reading physical books and writing by hand are two of the best available methods we have today to reduce the impact sources of distraction that we have in our lives.

# Self-Improvement Has Become An Extreme Sport — It Doesn’t Have To Be.

## Image Credit: PXHere

What we’re told we must do each day to develop and be successful has gone out of control. We have endless lists of habits that we’re supposed to do.

These never-ending lists of habits are not possible for any human being to do and we end up feeling guilty.

Self-improvement feels like an extreme sport.

You’re supposed to:

* Drink bulletproof coffee with MCT Oil

* Take a freezing cold shower

* Fast for entire days and not eat

* Read an endless list of books that are supposed to make you successful

* Exercise every day

* Eat protein within 30 minutes of waking up

* Listen to podcasts whenever you’re in an elevator, in an Uber or in-between meetings

Not sure about you, but all of these habits bundled together sound impossible.

## There’s no time for the mind to rest.

Endless lists of habits give the mind no time to rest. You’re always ON and can’t think about life.

Without time to do absolutely nothing, we end up joining this extreme sport called habits without often realizing it.

We end up on auto-pilot.

![Picture Credit: Chris Pritchard/PA](1*4I4xOe7XAJdaRkeLDWImYQ.jpeg)*Picture Credit: Chris Pritchard/PA*
> We follow the ‘Habit Sheep’ to the never-ending promised land that we’ll likely not reach in this lifetime.

Screw that.

## There’s always another habit you missed — FOMO.

You can never win. Who likes a game they can never win?

The constant pursuit for the next habit doesn’t end. All you have to do is troll Medium, LinkedIn or Quora to see people’s obsession with habits.

The temptation to feel like you’re not achieving success because you’re not taking cold showers is ridiculous.

*Did Nelson Mandela take cold showers?
Did Rosa Parks take cold showers?
Did Martin Luther King take cold showers?*

There’s plenty of normal people that have never had a cold shower and have still done incredible things.

You’re not missing out on habits just like you’re not missing out on internet fame or business success.

Success is available to you at any time when you understand yourself and a few brutal life truths.

## We get left feeling we’re not enough: we are.

The comparing game with habits that you hear on podcast interviews is a dick measuring contest you can’t win — so stop trying.

The only thing that happens when we compare habits is that we get left with the feeling we’re not enough. You think to yourself *“If only I started that one habit I’d be where he/she is.”*

That’s not true. Don’t lie to yourself.
> # “All of us are enough just the way we are and no amount of habit hacking is going to change that. Do you. Be you”

## I’m all for habits but let’s get practical for a sec.

Everyone’s version of success is different. Therefore, everyone needs different habits. Different habits apply to different phases of your life.

When I was in startup land the habit of reading business articles made sense. Now I couldn’t give a rat’s ass about what the next unicorn startup is doing.

When I began writing, listening to podcasts about blogging made sense, but now it doesn’t.

If you’re a fitness nut, then cold showers and the timing of when you consume protein might make sense. For me, I’m not into sport, so I just eat when I feel hungry — simple right?
> There’s no need to adopt everyone else’s habits. Find the ones that work for you and use them for as long as they serve your goals.

![Lizzi Bougatsos, *The King’s Virgin*, via Rae Wang for Art Observed](1*P9atucMfrcBqubr8UxkR3A.png)*Lizzi Bougatsos, *The King’s Virgin*, via Rae Wang for Art Observed*

## Don’t let ‘habit hacking’ control your life.

There’s more important things to worry about.

I’m sure many of us want to be like Tim Ferriss with his extreme habits, but that would be boring. Let Tim be Tim and you be you — love ya Mr Habit-Hacking Ferriss!

# The Deceptive Power of Starting Small

## Photo by Drew Hays on Unsplash

As a culture, we underrate the value of starting small and overvalue grand ambitions. This is reflected in graduation speeches, book titles, and celebrating those with aspirations to make a dent in the universe. But in doing so we do ourselves a great disservice. Our most ambitious goals appear to be so daunting that we never take the first step.

Starting small creates inertia, builds momentum, and leads to visible progress. As computer scientist and entrepreneur Paul Graham says, “The way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things.”

[Ryan Holiday](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday) writes in his book *Ego is the Enemy:*
> A few years ago, one of the founders of Google gave a talk in which he said the way he judges prospective companies and ideas is by asking them if they’re going to change the world. This is fine, except that’s not how Google started — Larry Page and Sergei Brin were two Stanford PhD’s working on their dissertation). It’s not how YouTube started — its founders weren’t trying to reinvent TV; they were trying to share funny video clips. It’s not how most true wealth was created, in fact.

Grand ambitions cause people to be delusional optimists. They make decisions based entirely on possibility without considering the probability of their success.

I had a prospective client who was interested in working with me who had the goal of 10,000 dollars a month in passive income within two months. He had no online presence and no credibility. The probability of this outcome even if he hired me was low.

My first online course was [Yaro](https://twitter.com/yarostarak)’s Blog Mastermind. My dad paid for the course. Because I was on a payment plan, I didn’t get the whole course at once. I only got one lesson a week.

And this was brilliant on Yaro’s part. The assignments were simple things like buying a domain or installing a WordPress plugin. By doing one small thing every week, I ended up finishing the course, which became the foundation for my work today.

I never had plans to start a podcast. The first iteration of The Unmistakable Creative was nothing more than an mp3 file linked to a blog post with some bullet points. I was trying to complete an assignment in an online course. By starting small, I was able to make little bets, get feedback, and determine what my next steps should be.

When I planned our first conference, I started small. I had nothing more than a landing page with 3 sentences and email capture form. By starting small, I protected my downside. I kept raising the stakes and within 6 months an idea that started in a Moleskine notebook was a sold out event.

If you’re struggling to [transform ideas into results,](https://unmistakablecreative.com/ideas-results/) start small. By starting small, you can accomplish amazing things.

## Break Big Goals into Small Manageable Parts

![Photo by [Glenn Carstens-Peters](https://unsplash.com/@glenncarstenspeters?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*BuwPAhoZGBi16waE)*Photo by [Glenn Carstens-Peters](https://unsplash.com/@glenncarstenspeters?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

Break an ambitious goal into small manageable parts and it becomes less daunting. When Bill Walsh landed his job as the coach of the San Francisco 49-ers, they were the worst team in the NFL.

Walsh didn’t set a goal to win the Super Bowl. He broke the turnaround into small manageable parts.
> # I directed our focus less to the prize of victory than to the process of improving — obsessing, perhaps, about the quality of our execution and the content of our thinking; that is, our actions and attitude. — Bill Walsh

He instituted what became known as “standards of performance”. Players had to wear suits and ties. Everybody had to be at practice on time. He applied these standards of performance to every aspect of the organization, from how people answered the phones to football practice. Within two years, they won the Super Bowl and went on to win two more in his ten years as Head Coach. The little things you do repeatedly lead to big changes.

Come up with your own standards of performance. Decide when and how you’re going to tackle the small manageable parts of every goal.

## Developing a Habit

What James Clear defines as [identity based-habit formation](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/proven-way-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones-james-clear/), is developing a habit of breaking the goal down into small parts or Atomic Habits. Instead of the goal of losing 30lbs, write down a list of all the actions you’d have to take.

* **Buy gym clothes.**

* **Set them out the night before.**

* **Drive to the gym.**

* **Walk in.**

* **Stay for 10 minutes.**

* **Subscribe to a healthy meal service.**

Take one of those each day and you will eventually build the identity of the person you want to become.

## Writing a Book

> # *You simply keep putting down one damn word after the other, as you hear them, as they come to you. You can either set a brick as a laborer or as an artist. — Anne Lamott*

You’re not going to sit down and write a best-selling book in one sitting.

If you want to write a sentence, start with a word. If you want to write a paragraph start with a sentence, If you want to write a page start with a paragraph. If you want to write a chapter start with a page. This simple idea has been a central part of how I’ve written 100’s articles and multiple books.

While I’ve applied this framework to writing a book and an exercise habit, you can apply it to anything. When you break any goal or habit into small manageable parts, you create inertia. With inertia, you gain momentum, which is the lifeblood of every business or creative endeavor.

## One Small Thing Every Day

Imagine you have a creative project like [our upcoming conference](http://www.unmistakablecreative.com/reality). If you look at the countdown timer you’ll see I have 291 days to make this happen. If do one small thing every day, by the time the event rolls around I will have done 291 small things for one massively ambitious thing.

For those of you who are married or have kids, you already know how to do this. Y**ou’ve planned a wedding and given birth to a child. I’m guessing you didn’t show up on your wedding day or drive to the hospital to give birth without some sort plan.**

Just apply that same framework to a creative project. If you can bring a human to life, I think you’re completely capable of bringing an idea to life. Small actions accumulate.

## Think in Bets

![Photo by [Dylan Clifton](https://unsplash.com/@originspoker?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*I1jHrTERs5gFmPXk)*Photo by [Dylan Clifton](https://unsplash.com/@originspoker?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

I learned from professional poker player Annie Duke that we can [make better decisions by thinking bets.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/how-to-make-better-decisions-by-thinking-in-bets-with-annie-duke/)

1. Write down the possible outcomes for your decision.

1. Assign a probability to each outcome.

1. Consider the long term consequences of the outcome.

Thinking in bets enables you to see potential futures. It’s also a way to take small risks and keep raising the stakes until you can take big ones.

In the Summer of 2014, my life was in a tailspin. I was suffering from a great deal of depression, and my financial situation was precarious. But I moved out of my parent’s house thinking that I could make it all work. The probability of my success was low. And I didn’t think about the long term consequences.

## Take Consistent Actions

There’s a profound power to consistency. When you take any consistent action, it’s inevitable that it will produce a result. It may not be a positive result, but a false start is better than standing still.

Whether your result is positive or negative, you’ll learn something. With every step forward, the view changes. You’ll see what you couldn’t before. And if you do something consistently, it will go from an item on a to-do list to a habit you don’t have to think about.

## Honor Your Commitments

![Photo by [Cyril Saulnier](https://unsplash.com/@c_reel?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*OZvftJ0nHUmPVIiS)*Photo by [Cyril Saulnier](https://unsplash.com/@c_reel?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

Honoring your commitments gives your words power. When your words and your actions are aligned, you tap into the power to speak things into existence.

If you want to manifest big things, take action on small things. Start by honoring the commitments you’ve made to yourself. If you’re struggling to get through the items on your to-do list, make a smaller one. Then, honor the commitments you’ve made to others. It could be something as simple as replying to an email when you said you would.

## Track Your Progress

![Photo by [Kelly Sikkema](https://unsplash.com/@kellysikkema?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*Q2wxdVs6VS5ECCcR)*Photo by [Kelly Sikkema](https://unsplash.com/@kellysikkema?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*
> As you successfully reach milestones in your projects, you should celebrate and surround yourself with these achievements. As a human being, you are motivated by progress. When you see concrete evidence of progress, you are more inclined to take further action. — [Scott Belsky](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky)

If you don’t track your progress it might feel like you’re not making any. It’s hard to stay motivated when you feel like you’re going nowhere with your efforts. By tracking your progress, you celebrate small wins and you don’t have to delay gratification.

The little things we do repeatedly lead to big changes in our lives. It is millions of minutes, hundreds of hours, and thousands of days that lead to a 10-year “overnight success”. Don’t underestimate the power of starting small and sticking with it.

# Why Your Creative Idea Isn’t All That Original (And That’s A Good Thing)

## 

Here’s an uncomfortable truth: Your amazing, original idea — the one you swear is going to transform the world — is not all that original.

At least not in the way that you think.

And that doesn’t mean it’s not going to transform the world.

We tend to think that outstanding creative works or amazing disruptive innovations sprang forth into the world wholly original and unique to that industry. We think that they came from nowhere and their mere arrival changed everything.

It’s quite simply not true.

As I’ve written about in [*The Myths of Creativity](https://amzn.to/2vD1bMz)*, the truth is that all ideas are combinations of pre-existing ideas. And most often “disruption” happens when an existing idea (or a new combination of existing ideas) migrates from one field to another.

If you think about the creative world, what’s the most innovative, amazing, successful movie franchise in history?

Star Wars.

The original Star Wars isn’t actually all that original. (And obviously many have argued that the newest ones aren’t that original either). Star Wars is a combination of spaghetti westerns, some Flash Gordon serials, Akira Kurosawa samurai films, mixed in with a little World War II fighter jet scenes and some Muppets. That’s about it. George Lucas mostly just threw movies and genres he loved watching into a cinematic blender and out came the Skywalker saga.

We see the same thing in business. The most disruptive innovation most people are talking about right now (and have been for years) is still Netflix. But what did Netflix really do? All it did was borrow the subscription model from newspapers and magazines and apply it to DVDs. That’s it. After “disrupting” DVD rentals and putting places like blockbuster out of business, it realized that the internet was ready and able to provide an on demand model similar to what cable companies had already been using. Both of its “disruptive” moves were really about taking an existing idea and serving it up via a new channel.

This idea — that ideas are combinations of pre-existing ideas — is so important because many of us believe that huge, amazing, disruptive ideas belong on a pedestal to be observed, written about, and almost worshiped as something that only a few blessed people would be able to spring forth. But if all ideas are combinations of preexisting ideas, then anybody can do that. If creativity is really about being playful and combining new things, then it’s a skill anyone can develop.

What matters is what you pay attention to. What matters is what you’re inputting. What matters is what you’re consuming and combing. George Lucas made an incredible combination of ideas because he was consuming so many different, diverse ideas.

If all ideas are combination of preexisting ideas, then your first job is to realize that anybody can do this. And your second is to realize is to be a student of creative ideas far more often. That way you can come up with more creative combinations.

All ideas are combinations of preexisting ideas. So go start combining.

# You Are Addicted to Social Media

## Photo by David Sager on Unsplash
> *We need the water of stillness with which to nourish our creative selves. Repeatedly artist, writers, scientists, and philosophers have written of this need, not only for this process of creating but within the work itself. — Anne De Le Claire*

The value of silence in a world full of noise is underrated. We need to be able to hear and listen to the expression of our soul’s calling. But drowned out by the cacophony of status updates, text messages, and selfies, we lose touch with ourselves. We lose access to the depths of who we are and the capacity for the kind of reflection and solitude that allows us to create beautiful art and come up with groundbreaking ideas.

*When was the last time you went a day or better yet an hour without checking Facebook or updating your status?*

*When was the last time you didn’t just play this digital game of mad libs where you fill in the blank with whatever attention-seeking thought just crosses your mind?*

*When was the last time you were so immersed in an experience or moment that you didn’t have any need or desire to upload it to Instagram?*

In losing our capacity for solitude, we lose our creativity, our humanity and so much more.

I see this in my community, I see it in my friends and I see it in myself.

What exactly is so important in the lives of strangers on the internet that broadcasting to them is more important than connecting with the person in front of you?

If you’re honest, that picture you’re about to upload, that status update you’re about to write is optional. You’re putting the currency of your attention into a slot machine, pulling the lever and hoping it comes back with more likes, more hearts, and more emjois. You’re sacrificing your time with the person in front of you to be validated by people you’ve never met.

*Suffering from depression, quit social media.*

*Stuck in a trap of envy and comparison, quit social media.*

*Can’t get shit done on your most important work, quit social media.*

This social currency is worthless. Last I checked you can’t pay your bills with Facebook likes or hearts on Instagram. You’re not a reality TV star, so why do you live like one?

We rush through our lives, treating every interaction as a meeting, or item on a to-do list, one more person to swipe right on, meet and discard.

I was having dinner with my parents and two of their close friends. I asked how often they see each other in person: twice a week. And they talk every day.

My mom and her friend will call each other if they don’t hear from one another.

Pam Slim and Desiree Adaway talk every day.

Meanwhile, the high school kids in Starbucks are texting each other from the same room. WTF?

My friend’s daughter ate shit in a puddle in front of her school when he dropped her off one morning. This was after my attempt to convince her of the virtues of digital minimalism.

I don’t see anyone twice a week. People don’t respond to text messages for days at a time. Nobody I know picks up their phone if you call them. They’re all “really busy.”

I see a friend to play NBA 2k19. What does it say about us as people that we’ll update our fucking status multiple times a day but we don’t put nearly as much importance as seeing each other in person multiple times a week?

I’d rather hear your voice than get a text message. I’d rather see you face to face than through the window of your Instagram feed. It’s one of the big reasons we’re banning smartphones and laptops at our event in April. We want to create an environment where people connect, not add each other as “friends.”

One of my listeners set me up on a date with her friend that didn’t go well. A YEAR later she sent me an Instagram message asking if I wanted some feedback… When I mentioned the year later part she said: “you know life gets in the way.” A year. Think about that. What does it matter a year later?

But maybe it’s not life that’s in the way. Maybe it’s that we need to become get more connected to our humanity and less connected from our devices.

I suggested the idea of a book club to the people in a Facebook group. Nobody was interested. But dozens of people kept posting in the group throughout the day.

Because it doesn’t carry the social stigma or being addicted to heroin or cigarettes, our social media addiction is considered acceptable behavior. But what if you lit up a cigarette as many times as you pick up your phone when talking to someone? How well do you think that interaction would go?

Every generation thinks that the one that comes after them is going to hell. But, for the first time, this is something that has validity.

Digital natives avoid face to face conversation, attempt to resolve conflicts via text, and treat digital interactions as a substitute for human contact. Not only that, no other generation has had similar access to technology that manipulates behavior while their brains are still developing.

Sure the MTV generation might have turned into a bunch of rebels and misfits. But that’s different than people losing the ability to have a conversation with another human. It’s the first generation that’s at the risk of losing their humanity.

The all you can eat buffet of information provided by the internet has turned an entire generation into “digital fat kids” and the cognitive equivalent of an athletes who smoke.

Some people argue that we will adapt and evolve to a world filled with selfies, status updates, and swiping right on the people you would fuck. But, there’s a more important question we have to ask.

Is this how we want to evolve? Is this a reflection of what we value as a society?

When we begin the quantify the value of our lives in the digital currency of hearts and likes, that’s the beginning of the end.

Walk through the world. Whether you’re at the library, airport, or in line at the grocery store, people have been transported to the world within their phone and disconnected from the world around them.

Do we really want to live in a world where people can’t look each other in the eyes, resolve conflict face to face, and realize that there’s a human on the other end of every digital interaction? The long term consequences of will be dystopian at best, detrimental to society at worst.

Unlike heroin addicts, social media addicts aren’t shooting up, lying on the street. While they don’t have the appearance of a typical junkie, they have most of the symptoms. Try spending an hour without your phone. If you experience any withdrawal symptoms, that’s the digital equivalent of addiction.

If you’re reading this, ask yourself one question. Were you planning to be on Facebook at this moment? If not, then it’s not much different than a cigarette break. You’re addicted. It’s not like smokers schedule cigarette breaks on their Google calendar. It’s a compulsive behavior that happens automatically.

This addiction is costing you. It’s costing you progress on your goals, and connection with the people in your life. It’s costing you happiness and well being. Is that a price worth paying for validation and attention that masquerades a connection and affection?

Quit. You might be surprised by how little you’re missing.

# 3 Ways To Make Decisions As Quickly As A CEO

## 

CEOs are known for being quick on their feet — for coming up with the correct solutions to the most pressing problems exactly when they’re needed.

But how, exactly, do they do it?

For most of us, when we have to make decisions, we agonize over them. We wonder what the repercussions of the decision might be years down the line, how it might hurt our lives, how it might affect our business. Then, we look back and think, “*Oh, I probably could have done that better.” *Sometimes, we’re straight haunted by the decisions we make, holding on to them, obsessing over what we should have done instead.
> **One reason for this is we conceive of decision making as black and white, consisting of a right and wrong option.**

But the truth is, there’s more to it than that. And those who seem to be *great *decision makers understand that nuance, and they use it to their advantage — *especially *when making big, life-altering decisions.

Here’s how.

## **1) You must realize that decision making is not black and white, and that your heart and emotions are attached to decisions.**

The choices we make in life — whether personal or professional — are never actually binary. They’re also never simple in their impact. Inevitably, when we hit these proverbial crossroads, when we choose one road over the other, there will be *plenty *of consequences. Our choices *do *impact our relationships, our home lives — everything impacts *everything.*
> # And you know what? That’s a good thing.

Or, at least, it’s not a bad thing. It’s inevitable. And as such, we shouldn’t obsess over a choice at hand just because it implicates other areas of our lives.

Give yourself a break, in other words. Most choices are going to have unseen implications. That’s just reality. Allow yourself this understanding, and stop focusing on what might go wrong, or what could go wrong.

## **2) Instead, focus on what could go right.**

Let’s pretend we’re back at that crossroads. To the left is the choice to quit your job and start your own business. To the right is the option to stay at your current job and continue enjoying the consistency of guaranteed healthcare.

We have a tendency in such moments — precisely because so much is on the line — to focus in an outsized way on everything that could go wrong. How if we go left and start our own business, we might fail.

But as we know, there are *always *things that *could *go wrong — in every single decision we make.
> **So instead, we should think about and inform our decision making processes with insight into all that could go *right.***

This is what should drive us. Which path at the crossroads poses more potential benefits? It sounds like a simple switch, but it actually makes a big difference. Focusing on the positives creates, in turn, positive energy, which makes us more creative and more genuinely inspired. It encourages clear thinking. It even opens up a more clear line of communication between your mind and your gut — allowing you to *feel *your way to the right, more correct decision, as informed by your core values and your capital-B Big Goals.

## **3) Notice if you’re making a decision around what your idea of “perfect” is.**

Finally, you must give yourself the freedom to change your core values — your conception of what’s preferable — if they no longer make sense.

For example, it may be the case that you’re staying in a bad marriage because your Catholic upbringing has led you to believe it’s wrong to end a relationship.

What you need in that instance is the confidence and the self-awareness to recognize that those Catholic values? They’re hurting you. I’m not saying you should ditch your conception of morality entirely. Rather, we shouldn’t blindly follow our perception of what’s right and wrong. Humans grow. We evolve. Part of becoming a great decision maker is recognizing when your perhaps outmoded models of thinking and morality are holding you back.

None of this is easy, mind you. It can be soul-testing, trying to reflect on which life-long perceptions of yours might in fact be incorrect, or in need of fine-tuning. It’s hard forcing yourself to overcome your innate tendency to see the worst in every hypothetical as opposed to what’s possible.

As such, you won’t be able to make these adjustments quickly. But you will over time, with constant practice and diligence. And if you work it long enough, and have the self-awareness and acuity of those CEOs we all admire, you *will *become a great decision maker. The only person stopping you is yourself.

# Two Traits of Every Successful Entrepreneur and Creator

## Photo by Alexander Redl on Unsplash

In 2010, my friend Sid Savara sent me the following email:

*You should go full speed ahead on the blogger interviews- and really dedicate yourself to it. I think your interview series would be extremely successful if you made a completely separate blog for it. Your personal development writing and other people’s guest posts are good, but the interview series-man. That is the stuff that really sets your blog apart.*

An hour later, I bought the domain [BlogcastFM.co](http://blogcastfm.com)m, installed WordPress, and shortly after, I sent him a reply with the mockup of the web site and said, “Is this what you had in mind?”

That was how the Unmistakable Creative and everything that I’m doing today started.

So often we avoid an action out of fear. We worry so much about getting it wrong that we don’t start at all. If you’re going to be creative, innovative, and do things you’ve never done before, it’s inevitable that you’ll get things wrong. But if you see failure as data rather than destiny, you’ll be free to keep moving forward.

There are two qualities that set successful entrepreneurs and creatives apart from other people. I’ve seen it in myself with my most successful projects, in my guests, and I’ve seen it in my team members:** a strong bias towards action an the ability to execute quickly.**

## 1. Execution Speed

![](0*zqTD6en25eNbrCU0)

When it comes to a bias towards action, time and speed are critical. Technology makes it possible to go from idea to execution faster than any other time in history.

This raises the execution bar. If you’re spending months or weeks on something, someone else is doing it in days. You can build a web site in an hour and a landing page for an idea in minutes. In his course [*How to Start a Startup](https://startupclass.samaltman.com/),* Sam Altman said the following about the most successful companies Ycombinator has funded:

*Every time we’ve talked to them, they’ve gotten new things done.*

The amount of time you think something should take is more imagined than real. In general, human beings are terrible at this. They either underestimate or overestimate how long something should take.

According to Parkinson’s Law, we complete a given task in the time that we’ve allocated for it. You might think something is going to take a week. But if you challenge yourself to finish it in a day, you’ll either finish it in a day or get really close.

When I wrote my first book with a publisher, my editor Stephanie asked if I could deliver it in 6 months. I thought “Well, I write 1000 words a day so it shouldn’t be an issue.” I also thought I was revising and expanding my self-published book. But I wrote a whole new book from scratch. Because I committed to delivering it in 6 months, I never assumed the deadline was negotiable.

Imposing false constraints raises execution speed.

## 2. Action Leads to Clarity

![](0*euJE0CAqPrjJJV1_)

Navigating ambiguity and uncertainty are inevitable parts of building a company or working on a creative project. As Elle Luna says of the Crossroads of Should and Must, you’re in a situation where “nothing is guaranteed but anything is possible.”

But if you take any kind of action, you’ll gain clarity. With every step forward the view changes.

A few months ago, we opened up a writer’s retreat for our readers. And only one person signed up for it. Initially, I thought it was a failure. But after working with our client for a weekend, I realized it would be more effective as a VIP experience for 1 person. Because we only had one client, we were able to go deep with him and as a result, did almost 6 months of work in a weekend.

With any action, even if things don’t turn out how you hoped they would, you learn something. You’re able to use that data for future decisions.

## 3. Perfection leads to Procrastination

![](0*GcWnTKyb5YWjuBY-)

Perfection is an illusion.

**First, it’s subjective.** There are books that have sold millions of copies that have 1-star reviews. Plenty of people didn’t think those books were anywhere near perfect. People don’t always notice, but plenty of traditionally published books go to print with a typo or two. You have to be willing to embrace the painful feedback or deafening silence that comes from putting your work out into the world.

**Second,** the longer you keep saying something isn’t perfect, the longer you procrastinate from putting it out into the world. Remember, the key to increasing the quality of your work is to increase the volume of it. The only way to do that is to ship, rinse, wash, and repeat.

**Third**, most of what we ship today is digital. That means you can ship something and always go back and improve. The first version of the web site for The Instigator Experience was 3 lines of copy, a date for the event, and an email capture box.

It’s better to ship something that’s 85% ready than it is to perfect something that never sees the light of day. As Reid Hoffman says, “If you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve shipped too late.”

## 4. Just the Right Level of Imperfect

![](0*iIEq6SiAygTHpiPt)

My friend Alice coined the term “just the right level of imperfect”. We avoid our imperfections, yet that’s where some of our greatest gifts lie. Our imperfections make us human. When we don’t act out of fear of imperfection, we deny the world and ourselves, and some of our greatest gifts.

## 5. Start Small and Leverage The Power of the Progress Principle

![](0*X7qYTmEj8oHCNqTZ)

There’s [profound power in starting small](https://unmistakablecreative.com/starting-small/). First, it makes action less daunting. Second, it creates inertia, which leads to progress, and momentum. It’s like executing on a thousand small things that allows you do one big thing.

Last year, I produced a day long course for Creative Live. The thought of presenting an entire day of content was incredibly daunting. Buy, my producer gave me the analogy of a pizza. You make dough, add the sauce, put on the cheese and keep adding ingredients, and you have 12 weeks to do it. So I broke it up into hundreds of small parts and was able to create my course on designing systems for creativity.

1. Break a big project up into as many small action steps as possible.

1. Give each action step a deadline. This is where you want to stretch.

1. Aim to cross one thing off the list every day.

Surfers catch waves in the water, not standing on shore watching the ocean. As I said in [*Unmistakable: Why Only is Better Than Best](https://www.amazon.com/Unmistakable-Only-Better-Than-Best/dp/1101981709),* speculation has never been the catalyst for transforming ideas into reality. A bias towards action and the ability to execute quickly is what [transforms an idea into a result.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/ideas-results/)

# Self-Help Books On Their Own Don’t Work — You Need These 3 Things.

## Image Credit: Unsplash/Dmitry Ratushny

In 2011 I was told that I could just read self-help books to get out of my own head and escape a very dark period of my life.

I read self-help books for two years straight. I read books like:

* Think And Grow Rich

* Unlimited Power

* The 4-Hour Work Week

* How To Win Friends And Influence People

While I felt a bit more positive, my life didn’t change from reading these self-help books. That’s the delusion that many people fall for. Books on their own are not enough.

### You need these three things:

## 1. People

The change for me happened in 2013. I began hanging around different people. I dumped my loser friends — including my best friend who was addicted to drugs and would pretend he wasn’t.

**I tried to save these friends but they wouldn’t change and I realized I needed to save myself first.**

I started hanging around people like Joel Brown (Founder of Addicted2Success) and I got myself some older mentors who’ve done cool stuff I hoped to achieve.
> # “The self-help books I read helped plant the idea of having the right people around me, but that idea alone was not enough”

Making the difficult change of getting rid of toxic people and finding the right people was not easy. It took every ounce of my willpower to not give in to mediocrity.

![](1*YDvHQ5kZitynoheaFni-2A.jpeg)

Without the right people, books will only help your strategy.

## 2. Full immersion

Self-help books only exist in your head. What I realized in 2013 is that I need a fully immersive experience.

To change your life, you need emotion. Emotion comes from being fully immersed in an experience with your sight, touch and sense of smell.

**You have to physically feel the change not just read it.**

By watching a few videos on YouTube during a day off from my call center job, I somehow discovered Tony Robbins. He wasn’t like anyone else I’d ever heard speak. I made the decision to go to one of his events.

At this point in my life, I didn’t understand the idea of being fully immersed. It was more of a sense of curiosity that led me to attend his event.

At this event, I got to listen to many of the ideas I’d learned in many of the self-help books I’d consumed in the two years prior. The difference this time was that I had four days of not stop immersion.

For breakfast, lunch and dinner all I ate for four days was self-help lessons and it really helped me. Suddenly, I felt the dark clouds of mental health issues starting to lift.

The first day I was required to physically move past my limiting beliefs by walking on fire.
> **Being burned as a child made me very afraid of this experience. Self-help books taught me that I could do anything if I believed I could.**
> **That all sounds nice snuggled up in bed with your pink socks on, but that advice doesn’t mean shit when you’re standing in front of burning hot coals and about to walk on them with your bare feet.**

The quickest way to experience a major change in your life is to cram the process into four straight days where that’s all you do and you’re fully immersed, utilizing every emotion and sense you have.

## 3. Action

The self-help books gave me ideas, new thoughts and strategies: they didn’t help me take action though.

Many people read these miraculous self-help books and get all excited. That’s where it ends.
> # “Self-help books mean nothing without action”

![Image Credit: [Paul Blow](http://www.paulblow.com/)](1*WDgOzBVCCrvtFXRNRTWH4Q.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Paul Blow](http://www.paulblow.com/)*

I took action by not only reading self-help books but by signing up to write my thoughts down on a blog. I committed to this weekly habit and took action. I did so from 2014 until right now.

It was this action that shaped my entire life and caused the change I was looking for. The seed for this idea was learned through many books although that wasn’t enough.

Action is the hardest step because you have to move forward often with no experience what so ever. I’d never written publicly before.

*I thought my spelling and grammar sucked.
I thought my ideas were mediocre.
I thought no one would listen.*

Taking action was the only way I could move past these limiting beliefs. I didn’t get the courage to take action from self-help books. I got the courage to take action by realizing that taking action, learning, and then repeating would eventually take me to where I wanted to go (away from the darkness).

The habit of reading is nice. The habit of action is game-changing.

## Self-help books can be addictive.

These books sell you a dream and make you believe anything is possible.

I’m all for inspiring people. That alone won’t help you though. Divide your time between the following:

* Reading self-help books to gain new ideas and strategies

* Finding the right people to be around

* Getting fully immersed in change

* And taking massive action without being obsessed with the outcome

Self-help books on their own don’t work.

These four steps do work based on my experience.

# There's sand in your eyes.

## Photo by Susanne Suju.

*Ah, what are dreams?,* he wondered out loud. It was a rhetorical question, but she took it up, as always.

Dreams are declarations.

Declarations?

Yes. A way to announce yourself, if you will.

To whom?

To yourself. The moment that’s done, it’s all done. Everyone knows. All anyone ever has to do is to meet you and they’ll know the dream you chose.

How do you do that?

There you go with the questions. I love you for it, but there’s no math to this. Or at least not the kind of math we know. If you ask me how, I can only say by the energy you’ll be emanating.

I never took you for a New Age kind of girl.

I’m not. Most of New Agers talk of energy as if it were a slave at your disposal, a dumb thing to shoot at other people or wield like magic. That’s not what this is about. The energy other people feel from you is not something separate from you. It, in the most basic sense, is you. It’s no different than a child playing in the wet sand.

I don’t think I’ve ever been so keen to listen as I am now.

You’ve never known somebody as listenable as I am.

If it were anyone else, I’d have a hundred ways to make fun of that sentence. Since it’s you, I‘ll just ask you to continue. Wet sand?

Yes. It’s pliable, mouldable, it yields, it’s soft, there’s no harm to be found in it. With the help of a red bucket, a little girl will maybe make a tower. Or she’ll use the star shapes to scatter stars everywhere, sprinkling them through her fingers. Or maybe she’ll listen to her father’s instructions and create something that makes much sense to all the adults, just not to her. There’s many ways to approach wet sand, just as there’s many ways to approach life. The imprint the girl leaves in the sand is just like the imprint I make on the people and the world around me. It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that things are the way they are, unchangeable, or changeable only by people bigger than me.

Which would be nearly everyone, seeing how short you are.

Very funny. Still, you’re right, but only in the most narrow, physical sense. To go back to the energy I mentioned before, think of the toy shapes the child brings to the sand beach: stars, crabs, towers, grids, and many others. She has many choices at her disposal, and the wet sand will in the end reflect her choice, whatever it is. That’s the beauty of it, that the sand doesn’t really care. It is good for one thing, and one thing only — to reflect the choice the little girl makes. Whatever it is, whenever it’s made. The energy people feel coming from you is the equivalent to choosing a toy shape from your own toy bag. You reach inside, rummage through, pull one out and that’s what you become. We are a lot like wet sand, or plain water — there’s immense power inside us, but it must be given shape. The tricky part is that the water will take just about any shape, leaving the burden of responsibility squarely on my shoulders. Should I pull vanity out of my toy bag now, that’s the shape I’m imprinting in the sand, that’s the container I’m pouring my water in.

Which is when you become the choice you’ve made?

Exactly.

I understand. Where do the dreams come in though? You said before dreams are declarations, but I always thought them as nothing more than flights of fancy. A way to flee the world. A way of coping.

That’s where you went wrong.

Thanks.

I’m serious. Before I said that dreams are declarations, but they’re more like physical exercises. They’re a way to explore the very boundaries of the person you are. They present you with always the same challenge — how outrageously satisfying can you imagine your life to become, while still rooting that imagination in reality?

What’s the use of that? The more outrageous my dreams, the deadlier their collision with reality, roots or no roots. No matter how much I dream of flying, I won’t grow wings.

![Photo by Sommi.](0*FJgKZ0vOp53CuMBa)*Photo by Sommi.*

That depends entirely on your definition of wings. If I told you that you have been in a flying car a hundred times by now, you’d think me crazy. Every child who has read a piece of science fiction has felt the coolness of the idea of a flying car, which is why everyone’s still slightly disappointed at the sight of these boring boxes on wheels. But a flying car is just way to transport things or people through air, isn’t it? So don’t we have flying cars already, in the shapes of airplanes and helicopters? Maybe yes, maybe not. Depends, you see, how you define a flying car. How you define your wings.

Never thought of it that way.

Almost no one does. And as for the collision of dreams with reality, that’s a very real concern, but not with dreams per se. There’s both a thin line and a world of difference between dreams and one of their extremes — delusion. It’s one thing to pick a star shape out of the toy bag, and quite another to pick the crab shape and pretend it’s a star.

What’s the other extreme?

The inability to explore yourself. Somewhat like playing in a football field, but only ever choosing to stay within your own penalty area. Yes, it’s safe, but the chance of own goals is disproportionately larger. And nothing hurts as much as own goals do.

Football fan?

Nope. It is a handy metaphor though, isn’t it?

Yes, yes it is.

Why’d you ask what I thought dreams were?

I didn’t. It was a rhetorical question.

Right.

Can I ask you one more rhetorical question?

Think you don’t quite get the point of rhetorical questions, but go ahead.

What happens when the high tide comes and takes away all you’ve done in the sand?

You begin anew.

That easy?

No, not that easy. It’s just the truth. The high tide doesn’t take anything away — instead it always, again and again, provides the smooth sand for you to make your choices in.

# The Simple Trick To Get Better At Small Talk When Networking

## 

A lot of people feel like they’re bad at “small talk” and still more dismiss it as a cultural relic leftover from a time when we weren’t supposed to comment on politics, religion, or any other deep and meaningful information (though that politics prohibition could probably stand an encore). Advice on small talk could be summarized as a collection of random tips to keep the conversation going while also keeping it from going to deep.

But the real goal of small talk isn’t just to exchange polite pleasantries. **The purpose of small talk is to build rapport and connection**. And you do that by probing to find “*uncommon commonalities*” — those things two people have in common with each other that aren’t likely to be shared by others in the room. So, if you’re in a room of programmers, a shared love of Battlestar Galactica isn’t likely to be an uncommon commonality (unless maybe you’re talking about the original series). But if you’re in a room of Battlestar Galactica fans, and you meet someone who also happens to have been a former college athlete, that’s a little more rare (not saying athletes can’t also be fans of great sci-fi…just that’s it’s safe to say in for most rooms that former athletes are in the minority).

As I found when [researching my new book](http://amzn.to/2up15sv), these multiple and rare commonalities can led to what network scientists call “*multiplexity*” — connections where there is an overlap of roles or affiliations from a different social context. And research findings [suggest that we seek out and prefer relationships where there is more than one context for connecting with the other person](https://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI3431176/).We want relationships with multiplexity because they [tend to be richer, more trusting, and longer lasting](https://hbr.org/2011/04/building-a-network-that-works).

What does this have to do with small talk? Everything.

Most people’s instinct in small talk situations is to stay at a surface level and ask scripted questions like “what do you do?” But, multiplexity suggest we do the opposite. Ask probing questions about the other person. Ask what they’re deeply passionate about. Ask where they grew up. Ask what excites them the most right now. Ask them their favorite superhero (you can learn a lot about people by asking them who their favorite superhero is and why). Ask questions that are likely to uncover shared interests, experiences, or connections.

Getting better at small talk isn’t challenging and can even be fun…just keep looking for the uncommon commonalities.

# How Simple Preparation Propelled Eminem to Stardom—And How You Can Do The Same With Your Goals

## source

We all know it pays to be prepared.

We’re aware that if we want to create opportunities for ourselves—and beyond that, if we want to *capitalize *off of those opportunities—we need to constantly be working toward our goals. We realize the importance of creating monthly, weekly, and daily habits around achieving our dreams.

Again, we ***know ***these things.

## Yet it seems when opportunities arise, the majority of us are never actually prepared.

We recognize the opportunity for what it is, but are caught flat-footed and left thinking, *“I wish I would have just put the time in the past couple of months.”*

If this sounds like you, you’re not alone.

Millions of people—including extremely successful people—once struggled with or are currently struggling with self-discipline. Some can’t even identify a significant goal they want to achieve*.*

The thing is, even if you *do* know what you want to accomplish, continually developing your skill set and practicing your craft is tough—really tough.

Even if you know deep, *deep* down you’re meant to be the next Oprah Winfrey or the next Michael Phelps or the next Ruth Beta Ginsburg—and if you understand the necessary time commitment it takes to even reach that level—it’s *still incredibly difficult *to stay consistent and work toward those goals on a daily basis.
> # Why?

## Because we’re scared of the uncertainty.

We’re scared that what we’re doing right now is a waste of our time.

We don’t know for a fact we’re going to achieve our goals—we’re just hoping that the time we’re putting in pays off. We try our best, but eventually our inspiration fades—we become less disciplined. We tell ourselves “there has to be another way” and slip into the bad habit of looking for a quicker route to success.

But giving into that uncertainty essentially guarantees you never achieve your goal.

Even if you claim you’re still “looking” for ways succeed at what you initially set out to accomplish, you’re going to fail if you stop actually producing.

Why?

Because you stop *preparing.*

## Eminem is the perfect example of someone who understood the power of preparation.

It’s essentially what brought him his accolades.

Growing up in a trailer park on [Eight Mile Road](https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/eight-mile-road)—a notoriously dangerous Detroit strip—Eminem had to overcome a lot of adversity to *even make a living *(let alone become a world-renowned rapper)*. *His mom was a drug addict, and he was horribly bullied as a kid. Yet, he had a gift with words, passion for hip-hop, and an undeniable work ethic.

He knew how important it was to be prepared for a big opportunity.

His ***preparedness*** is what single-handedly propelled him to stardom.

Eminem released “The Slim Shady EP” in 1997. After years of trying to make a name for himself—living paycheck to paycheck and spending what little money he had on studio time—this was his first project that finally caught the eye of a major player in the music industry, Jimmy Iovine.

Iovine sent Eminem’s tape to Dr. Dre—the hottest producer at the time and arguably one of the best ever to ever do it—and Dre loved what he heard.

He personally invited Eminem to his studio out in L.A. for a “tryout.”

## This is where Em’s preparedness came into play.

Studying all the best rappers in the game, reading encyclopedias, dictionaries, and thesauruses to expand his vernacular, battle-rapping at underground venues to showcase his talent, and doing so for *years *is what allowed Em to capitalize off of the opportunity he created for himself.

Upon his arrival at Dre’s in-home recording studio, the Doc decided to play Em a snippet of a beat he had recently been working on.

Only a few seconds passed before Eminem shouted: “Hi! My name is…”

Within a few hours of them first meeting, Dr. Dre and Eminem created Em’s first major hit *My Name Is, *which became the intro song off of his first LP.

The song went certified 2x Platinum.

Had he not been prepared for that visit, he would have gone back home to Detroit with nothing but a cool story of the time he met Dr. Dre.

## It’s tough to work toward your goals when you’re not reaping any immediate benefits.

It’s hard not to look at what you’re doing as a waste of time.

But some of the most successful people in the world were in the very same position as you at one point. They had no money to their name, no measurable success, no notoriety—some of them didn’t even have any *talent.*

But they understood the ***power of being prepared***, and realized that their time was best spent *working *toward something as opposed to *wishing for *something.

Don’t underestimate what you’re doing right now.

Even if you don’t feel like you’re “achieving” anything, you’re doing yourself a huge favor by getting prepared.

# Do This If You Want To Dramatically Increase Your Odds of Success

## Tip…Don’t bet the house on Bitcoin

![Photo by [Austin Distel](https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*AuK3d8UjJNkP_sNv)*Photo by [Austin Distel](https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

My calves felt like someone had covered them in gasoline and lit a match. I could almost feel my chest collapsing on my lungs. And I would have given my firstborn for a sugary drink.

I looked at my watch.

![The medal in question](1*A2C-XHWksDe4yVWjYd4VPA.png)*The medal in question*

Still 13.1 miles to go.

I was a long way from the finish line of the 2016 Dublin City Marathon, but I was done.

I couldn’t understand what was happening.

For months before the big race, I’d run eighty-plus kilometres a week, all of them hard.

Tempo sessions. Intervals. Long runs. Recover runs. I ticked all the boxes.

I was confident I was fit enough to run the marathon in three hours, thirty minutes — some thirty minutes faster than my personal best.

Now my body was falling apart.

So I stopped running and began to walk.

A runner is never more despondent than when he or she has to walk.

I shook my head and tried running again, but I managed only another 500 metres before slowing down.

For the next two hours, I ran and walked to the finish line.

I looked up at the red timer hanging above me: 4 hours, 1 minute.

When they handed me a medal for finishing, I took it off in disgust.

A year or two beforehand this race time would have delighted me.

Since then, I’d invested countless hours in the track and on the roads to hit a target time for my third marathon…and I was half an hour late.

Runners hate to be late.

I didn’t know it then, but I’d trained too hard for my fitness levels and left nothing in the tank for race day.

I’d trained way beyond a margin of safety.

## What is a Margin of Safety?

![Benjamin Graham, one of Warren Buffet’s mentors](1*0cqiBsqY6RpcToH8J00vzw.jpeg)*Benjamin Graham, one of Warren Buffet’s mentors*

In 2016, I’d never heard of Benjamin Graham.

Graham was an American investor and economist. Born in the U.K. in 1894, he warned no investor can ever eliminate the risk of being wrong.

They can, however, insist on never overpaying no matter how exciting the investment. He called on investors to use a margin of safety.

It’s essential, the gap between the cost of an investment and its intrinsic or natural value.

Think of a margin of safety like a seat belt.

Ideally, you’ll never need to put it to the test, but having a margin of safety in place helps prevent potential misfortunes and even disasters. It also allows for imprecision and mitigates bad luck.

In my case, I should have reduced my weekly mileage and run a little slower in the weeks leading up to the Dublin City Marathon. That way, my legs would have felt fresh on race day.

## How Warren Buffet Earned Millions With a Margin of Safety

![Warren Buffet knows how to apply a margin of safety](1*DmtXNBJZYGfdwsQx1bLUOA.jpeg)*Warren Buffet knows how to apply a margin of safety*

Benjamin Graham passed away in 1976, but Warren Buffet cites him as a key influence.

In a remembrance for Graham, Buffet wrote,
> “[Graham’s] counsel of soundness brought unfailing rewards to his followers — even to those with natural abilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while following counsels of brilliance or fashion.”

Investors like Buffet worry about risk. They don’t want to lose all of their money on a single or risky investment. When evaluating a company or investment, Buffet always applies a margin of safety.

For example, in the spring of 2002 Buffet read the annual report of PetroChina. He determined the Chinese oil and gas company was worth $100 billion. The company was selling for $35 billion.

Buffet calculated a margin of safety of $65 billion, so he bought PetroChina for $488 million and sold it in 2007 for a $4 billion profit.

## Managing Risk in the Real World

Of course, we’re not all Warren Buffets in the making, but successful professionals still apply a margin of safety to their work.

Rather than investing all of their money in a single stock or even a cryptocurrency, successful investors pick multiple stocks, funds and coins.

This way, if one coin or stock drops, investors are less likely to lose because their other investments are unaffected.

In other words, loss avoidance is the cornerstone of their investment philosophy.

Smart business managers knows how far they can allow sales to fall before breaking even. This potential fall represents their margin of safety.

Similarly, engineers design bridges to carry weight in excess of what’s permitted on the bridge itself. They also design tall buildings and skyscrapers that sway in wind streams and turbulence without collapsing.

The Eiffel Tower, for example, sways up to 13 centimetres in the wind to the alarm of many new visitors.

## The Problems With Having No Margin of Safety

A greedy short-term investor would have put all of his or her money into Bitcoin this past December when it was worth nearly $20,000. However, he or she would have lost half of the investment by the end of January when Bitcoin plunged below $10,000.

In fact, several day traders from South Korea posted pictures online of their smashed laptops, monitors and even baths.

Instead, a more prudent investor would have invested only 5 to 10% of his or her assets into cryptocurrencies as a whole. Alternatively, he or she would spread their investments over several coins, like Ethereum.

This way, they’re less likely to feel like smashing up the bathroom because of Bitcoin’s dramatic price drop.

You might not be an aspiring Warren Buffet, but you can still apply this mental model to many real-life situations. The trick is to keep away from activities where you have little to gain and everything to lose.

## How to Apply a Margin of Safety to Your Work

Long-distance runners typically put in anywhere from 50 to 150 miles a week while training for a marathon. This weekly mileage forms part of a three- or four-month training block, and it varies depending on how much punishment their bodies can take.

After a certain point, diminishing returns sets in for every athlete. These extra junk miles carry no psychological benefits. They also dramatically increase the athlete’s chance of injury.

So if you’re training for a marathon, finish each training session with something left in the tank. Thanks to this margin of safety, you’re less likely to feel exhausted and want to walk on race day.

(Never walk!)

You’ve little to gain by sweating out another ten or twenty miles a week. You are, however, far more likely to pull a hamstring or calf muscle and even miss the big race due to overtraining.

If you’re running a small online business, keep two or three month’s worth of cash reserves in your bank account. This way, if you face an unplanned expense or revenues fall, you’ll still be able to pay your bills.

If you invest all of your cash flow in Facebook ads, how will you pay for web hosting or your email service provider if those expensive advertising leads don’t convert?

Even if you don’t care about investing, cryptocurrencies or Facebook ads, you still can apply a margin of safety to other kinds of work.

If you’re a busy corporate executive, commit to your boss and team that you’ll deliver a key project by a certain date. Now you’ve little to gain by working on this project right up until the delivery date. Instead, push yourself to finish it early. This way, you have a margin of safety if something unforeseen happens.

A margin of safety is useful for creative work too.

For example, many freelance writers struggle to pay the bills because they rely on a single gig or client. If the editor doesn’t have a commission, the writer has to scramble for new work.

Plus if you get the flu or an editor cancels next month’s job, how will you keep your editor or your bank manager happy?

Instead, you could write for three or four publications or clients rather than relying on one. You could also cultivate a habit of outlining ideas for future articles in advance so you’re not overworked. These ready-to-go outlines and additional income sources represent your margin of safety.

## Master Your Inner Game

It doesn’t matter if you’re an investor, business person, athlete or artist; you will always face factors outside of your control.

The market could rise or fall, your editor could cut his or her budget for freelancers, or it could rain heavily come race day.

Take heart from Benjamin Graham.

He wrote that “investing isn’t about beating others at their game. It’s about controlling yourself at your own game.”

Whether you’re an investor, athlete or artist, you can still control your inner game.

Train hard enough to achieve results but not so hard that you increase your risk of injury.

Keep a bank of ideas so you don’t have to worry about problems like feeling blocked. Develop more than one source of income.

And don’t bet the house on Bitcoin.

Calculate what’s at risk and the cost before investing time, energy or money in a project. Always pay less than you think something is worth. Be realistic about your expectations for the future rather than indulging in idle fantasies.

I didn’t achieve my target race time in 2016, but I learnt how to manage risk a little better, and that’s more valuable than any medal.

# 8 Productivity Strategies You Can Use To Take On The Most Hectic Days

## 

There’s no such thing as a slow day when you’re an entrepreneur.

To me, the most anxiety-producing days are the ones where a lot of people need my time. These are days filled with a never-ending stream of meetings, calls, requests, and interactions — with little time to reflect in between. And when the work backlog keeps rising, and I don’t have a minute of “think time” to myself, it can be easy to start operating in a reactive (and not proactive) state.

I love people. I actually thrive when managing teams. But part of being successful is finding ways to remain calm and clear during hectic moments of the journey. When my days get crazy and difficult to manage, I use a series of productivity hacks, mental tricks, and other strategies to make sure I’m achieving *progress*, not simply motion.

Here are some of my favorite strategies for staying grounded and productive during a hectic day:

### **1. Block out time for everything, not just meetings.**

Try putting everything you need to accomplish on your calendar. For example, I might block off ninety minutes to develop a plan for a makeup testing panel (my startup, [NakedPoppy](https://nakedpoppy.com/), is a clean beauty company), or an hour to work on recruiting. Blocking time also prevents me from spending more time than I think the task is worth — when the time is up, it’s time to stop.
> # I even block off time on my calendar to think.

I set aside “think time” at least three times a week. “Think time” means no phone, no peeking at Slack, and no checking emails — just deep thinking and concentration. I learned this “deep thinking” approach from Victoria Treyger, a wonderfully successful former executive turned venture capitalist.

### **2. Do one thing at a time. Period.**

When you’re extremely busy, there’s the temptation to multitask.

Have you ever had that moment when two people are texting you, someone is sending you Slack messages, and someone else is trying to get you on the phone? When it happens to me, my initial impulse is to jump from one to the other and answer everyone as quickly as possible.

But I try to fight that instinct and instead focus on each conversation to give it the attention it deserves. For example, if I’m on a call, I try to be 100% present. That means no texting or looking at email.

When you multitask, you end up with two (or more!) suboptimal results. Give all your attention to a single interaction at a time, and the outcome will be better.

### **3. Start each week by writing down 1–3 actions that will move the needle on your business.**

At the beginning of each week, I write down the top three actions — in priority order — that I need to take to move the business forward. I revisit them daily to keep my focus.

The work that matters most is rarely the quickest or easiest. It could be recruiting key talent, launching a new initiative, or raising money.

It’s easy for these larger efforts to get pushed to the next day, and the day after that, and so on. So I make sure that the first thing I’m thinking about each morning is one of my top priorities.

### **4. Scan your calendar in advance. Optimize when needed.**

Don’t let another person, no matter how trusted, take full control of your time. It’s YOUR time. Scan your calendar in advance and re-calibrate if needed.

For example, maybe there’s a non-urgent meeting that requires a level of thoughtfulness you can’t summon on a crazy day. Reschedule the meeting. The key is to do the rescheduling well in advance. That’s far more gracious than running late, being distracted, or postponing at the last minute.

### **5. Resist the temptation to put off certain internal meetings.**

This might sound like it contradicts the previous point. But try and resist the temptation to delay internal meetings when team members need your input in order to move forward.

I want my team to feel happy and valued, which in itself advances the business. And they often just need a quick clarification to be more focused and productive.

Even on the craziest days, remember that your leverage comes from your team. Help them be more productive, and you’ll amplify your accomplishments.

### **6. Set your perspective at the beginning of each day.**

This matters.
> If you start your day with a mentality of, “I have way too much to do today!” you’re setting yourself up to feel overwhelmed.

To counter this, I say to myself, “I have plenty of time to do what needs to be done today.” This mindset helps me open up my body and mind to accomplish what matters most. I can then take a deep breath to prioritize, break tasks down into manageable chunks, and block off the calendar time to get them done.

### **7. Never skip self-care.**

When you’re stressed out, it’s easy to skip the things that keep you sane. But don’t forget that the success of your business or career is closely tied to your wellbeing.

My co-founder, Kimberly Shenk, is a marathon runner, and she taught me to think of exercise as a meeting that cannot be rescheduled. My morning routine is to come down the stairs and exercise before I have the chance to tell myself, “Maybe not today.”

I treat meditation the same way. If it’s a crazy day, and my mind is really racing, I tell myself that meditating for even three minutes is better than not doing it at all. And if you don’t have three minutes, you don’t have a life.

Finally, I never shortchange myself when it comes to sleep. I get my eight hours. For me, productivity depends on feeling rested. I’m fortunate to have few physical distractions during the day — no pain, sleepiness, or brain fog — and believe that for me it’s the result of prioritizing sleep, meditation, and exercise.

### **8. Don’t forget to enjoy it.**

When I’m at my most overwhelmed, I remind myself that I’m lucky.

I’m co-founder and CEO of a company I love, which is a passion project as well as a business. What a privilege it is that I have this busy, exciting day, surrounded by people I enjoy.

When I start to feel overwhelmed, my favorite way to ground myself is to remind myself that it’s a marathon and not a sprint. Make sure you have a set of tools (I hope some of my suggestions will help you!) to give you the mental and physical fortitude to succeed.

# 8 Success Factors Even More Important Than IQ (Infographic)

## 

Cracking the question of what factors will best lead you to success can help you focus on the right areas of your personal development and make you more successful in your career, business, and life in general. After all, [you don’t have a lot of time](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/23-best-productivity-hacks-of-the-year.html). You want to focus your efforts where you can have the most impact.

We’ve been conditioned to believe that smart people who work hard are bound to succeed. In fact, if you’re super smart, you should be able to write your own ticket, so to speak.

But is intelligence really the most critical success factor?

Not necessarily.

In fact, research suggests that intellect may not define success nearly as much as we’ve thought. Being smart can take you far, but emotional intelligence may be [even more important than an exceptional intellect](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/these-5-character-traits-inspire-happiness-and-success-even-in-tragic-times.html).

[Dr. Arthur Poropat](https://www.griffith.edu.au/health/school-applied-psychology/staff/dr-arthur-poropat), senior lecturer at Griffith University, conducted reviews on the “Big 5” personality factors: conscientiousness, openness, emotional stability, extraversion, and agreeableness. People with [high levels of these traits](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/where-will-your-personality-lead-you-infographic.html) were more likely to achieve high grades than people with high IQs.

Other research from the Carnegie Institute of Technology found that emotional intelligence is a far more important success factor than standard intelligence when it comes to your financial success. In fact,[ 85 percent of financial success comes from people skills](http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/faqs/) and just 15 percent comes from technical knowledge.

If you weren’t gifted with an exceptionally high IQ, you can still[ dominate in your field](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/4-major-personality-types-amp-ideal-careers-for-each-one-infographic.html), as these positive personality traits can be learned, built, and strengthened over time.

In the infographic below, Headway Capital takes a look into the eight critical success factors that are even more important than being a smartie. Have a look at how self-regulation,[ a growth mindset](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/8-success-factors-even-more-important-than-iq-infographic.html), resilience, passion, empathy, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and social skills can all help you define success in your own life and drive your career (or business) to greater heights.

# How to Stay Fit Without Going to the Gym | 30 Day Pushup Challenge

## How to Stay Fit Without Going to the Gym | 30 Day Pushup Challenge

### How Urinals, Rubber Bands, and Coffee Shops Help Me Stay Fit

I walk 10,000 steps a day.

I wanted a fitness challenge that would do for my upper body as walking does for my lower body.

Pushups are like *upper body steps*.

And the beauty of pushups like walking is that we can do them virtually anywhere!

![](1*yxSMcN6zHucRb7YPUfX89g.png)

For my 30 day pushup challenge I did four **25 rep sets**. I did one set after waking up, two in the afternoon, and one before my evening shower.

As a **habit trigger**, I usually did my afternoon sets after using the toilet *(and for the record, before washing my hands)*.

![](1*Q0_cKLirx6yYfcPriQI_WA.png)

Pushups give me a boost of energy so that when I return to my desk I feel an increase in focus.

At the start of the challenge I could do 34 pushups at one time, I can now do **40 ***{I know that’s not particularly headline catching, but if you can’t do more than 20 at a time then I imagine you’ll see an even greater improvement}*. And a female even mentioned to me how my arms looked bigger. Now I find myself unconsciously flexing before the opposite sex…

![Just kidding… it’s quite conscious](1*oVup1CFqO3y1flJOHtZxig.png)*Just kidding… it’s quite conscious*

And keep in mind I stopped going to the gym during the duration of this challenge so I was surprised to see any progress at all.

This goes to show that I don’t need to set aside a solid 30 minute chunk of time to see positive results from exercise* (although I’d still contend it’s beneficial to do a longer workout regularly)*.

Moving forward, I’ll continue with this challenge for the immediate benefits of increased focus and energy, as well as for the long-term benefits that comes with fitness.

## Will you give this pushup challenge a try?

Here are some ideas to modify this challenge to your liking and lifestyle…

* Instead of aiming to do 100 pushups a day, aim to do more or less?

* Instead of 25 reps do more or less?

* Do as many as you can in one rep each day for 30 days?

* Lift your legs up to make it harder or lift your chest up to make it easier?

* Attack different parts of your chest and triceps by varying where you put your hands. I stuck more with traditional military-style pushups by putting my hands at shoulder width.

I’d also suggest doing the pushups in public places to expand your *comfort zone. [Tim Ferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss) *suggests laying on coffee shop floors, but I say,* “Why stop there when you can get in some good reps?!”*

![](1*vHTBliXWda70Ru-pJ_5N-w.png)

And to improve my tracking capabilities and give myself a greater sense of accomplishment, I’d wear rubber bands on my right wrist.

Each rubber band represented a set of 25 pushups.

After I did a set, I moved a rubber band to my left wrist.

Therefore before I took my evening shower all four rubber bands should be on my left wrist.** **If not, then I break down into pushup position to do as many as I need to hit my 100.

![](1*ZvMi-JuNWy4EnulqiGKz4A.jpeg)

If you really want to get fancy you can get different colored rubber bands so each color represents a different exercise: red = 25 pushups, yellow = 30 squats, blue = 50 jumping jacks.

This way even on our busiest days we can get a work out in.

There’s also [research](http://tim.blog/2017/01/23/the-one-minute-workout-designed-by-scientists-dr-martin-gibala/) to suggest that short bursts of exercise staggered throughout the day is better than one long traditional workout.

And lastly you can use them for self-defense!

![](1*tDr-nOsRrjDE4HDXQBOijQ.jpeg)

Either way, experiment with what works for you, I enjoy the rubber-band technique so… ***Back away and no one has to get hurt!!***

# 3 Effective Workshop Tactics to Align Your Team Around Your Organization's Vision

## When Designed Well, Team Meetings Can Deliver a Hefty ROI

![](1*3LCet_SqVRIY2rdumIvxyQ.jpeg)

Workshops and team meetings are valuable ways to build team alignment and unity, and — when designed well — they deliver a hefty ROI. Future State Client Portfolio Director Zoe Dunning has been leading results-oriented workshops for more than 15 years. Here are some of her tips for designing successful workshops that benefit everyone on your team.

![Naval commander Zoe Dunning, center, a Future State client portfolio director, recently received the Military Appreciation Award from her alma mater, the Stanford Graduate School of Business.](1*rkDlLXNZRVT_evDbrRS2XQ.jpeg)*Naval commander Zoe Dunning, center, a Future State client portfolio director, recently received the Military Appreciation Award from her alma mater, the Stanford Graduate School of Business.*

## **The Right People, the Right Place.**

The first and probably the most important consideration is to be sure you have the right people at the event. You want to have decision-makers who can make decisions right then and there. Also make sure there is a broad representation of all stakeholders so you know the feedback you’re gathering is truly comprehensive.

Another consideration is where you host the event. Even though doing it off-site may cost more from a facility perspective, you usually get better results because people aren’t getting distracted by jumping back to their offices or running into other people they work with who can catch them in the hall.

## **Prepare, and Prepare Your People.**

Doing a few key things before the event can help ensure it’s set up for success. First, connect the right people from your organization with the event facilitator to advise in the design of the workshop. There’s a better likelihood of achieving your outcomes if you provide upfront time and input on the workshop design.

Second, consider the use of pre-reads. Short prerequisite material can help make sure everyone comes in with a common understanding so you can use the time discussing solutions and ideas, rather than educating everyone. The pre-read should take no more than a half-hour to read.

## **Remember Accessibility and Diversity.**

First, recognize we all learn differently. Some of us are visual learners, some are audio learners, some learn by doing. And most of us do best with a mixture. So you need to incorporate multiple ways of engaging and training people. You can’t just speak it. You need visuals — preferably posters on walls, or a graphic recorder, definitely not death by PowerPoint. You will also have people who need to practice it, do an exercise, to embed the understanding.

Also consider that some people are introverts and some are extroverts. Make sure exercises aren’t all just group discussions; build in time for individual reflections on questions, let people share ideas in small breakout groups. Pose a question just before a break or lunch so they can think on it, not just react. A good workshop provides varied opportunities for people to contribute in different ways.

Finally, be aware of who’s in the room. Cultural perspectives differ. Some cultures have different norms around cold-calling or team dynamics. Ask questions. And if you have a truly global team and people are traveling internationally, take into account jet lag and attention span, and be sensitive to that; don’t start at 8 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. on day one, no matter how much work needs to be accomplished. You’ll only get 50% of the team’s attention.

# How To Figure Out What The Hell You Want To Do With Your Life

## “An overhead shot of two people planning a trip with a map and a laptop on a wooden surface” by rawpixel on Unsplash

I’ve sat here at a Starbucks 10,000 miles from home staring out the window for 45 minutes.

This is my third blog post of the day.

I’ve been writing up a storm and I want to tap the hell out.
> # I’m here in the Philippines (I’m American), on a three month trip in Southeast Asia. I am a digital nomad. I recently started [vlogging](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8nN0X9k1JO3IlYUEPtA83g), but I’m more “popular” for my work as a writer here on Medium with [21,000 followers](https://findingtom.com/how-gain-medium-followers/).

To many I’m “successful,” but to be honest with you sometimes I wonder what the hell I’m actually doing.

But, you see, that’s not what I should be focusing on. That’s not what you should be focusing on either.

## 1. What You ‘Want To Do’ Is A Moving Target

What I wanted three months ago is NOT what I want now.

Hell, three years ago I would’ve flipped out at the thought of making full-time money as a freelance writer.

Now that very idea is nauseating.
[**Why I’ll Never F****** Freelance Ever Again**
*To set the record straight — I owe a lot to freelancing.*medium.com](https://medium.com/swlh/why-ill-never-f-freelance-ever-again-4325889492df)

The fact is that we change so much.

We don’t arrive at our goals, kick our feet up, then do what we ‘want to do’ every day for 40 years until we die.
> # We arrive, figure out that what we wanted has a lot of flaws, then we end up wanting something else that’s sort of related to what we wanted at the start, but not really.

For instance I became a freelance writer three years ago because I wanted freedom to work on what I wanted when I wanted.
> I realized soon after that all I REALLY wanted, though, was creative expression. Freelance writing gave me that, but only on a very small scale (since you have to write about what the client wants you to write about).

So I got into blogging.

This gave me a sh*t ton of creative expression, and now I’m into filmmaking — which lends itself to even more creative expression.


I’m starting to realize now that I want to tell the stories of others that don’t necessarily get to be told. I want to help people find a voice, in other words.

In short, my goal is evolving..

This leads me to my next point.

## 2. Chasing What We ‘Want To Do’ Now Always Gets Us Closer To Our Personal Legend
> “One’s Personal Legend is what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.

*-***Paul Coelho***, The Alchemist*

As I’ve chased my ambitions to the ends of the earth (while working from my laptop), I’ve realized that every time I accomplish what I want, I want something else.

But I don’t leave empty-handed.
> # I learn so much about myself and realize that I simply need to “focus the camera” a little more to catch a better glimpse of what I’m ACTUALLY aiming for.

Make sense?

From freelancing to blogging to filmmaking I’ve realized lots of things about myself. I believe with every evolution I undergo I’m getting closer and closer to my own personal legend.

Maybe I’ll never quite realize it, but at least I got close to it — and sadly that’s something a lot of people fail to do.

Here’s a little more from The Alchemist that defines a “Personal Legend” further..
> # “At that point in their lives (youth), everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives.
> # But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend….whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your mission on earth.”

I’ve laid the ground work. What we want is not a destination. What we want isn’t even THE destination in the first place..

Getting closer to our personal legend (purpose) is.

## How To Figure Out Your Purpose..

If you clicked on this article, chances are you feel a little lost right now.

Here’s how to get clarity on what you should do..

## Step 1: Forget Money And Forget Reason

When I got out of college I was in a hurry to become a contributing member of society.

Translation: **I wanted a job**.

But why did I want a job, really? The answer is I had lots of student loans to pay off, and I needed a job to pay them.
> After about 20 failed job interviews and taking, like, 10 different death blows to my confidence, I started daydreaming about freelancing.

In the meantime I took a job at Panera Bread in hopes that I would become a manager one day/work in corporate. I was getting paid $8 per hour alongside high schoolers. I was 22.

I felt like complete and utter sh*t, so I quit after my third week and dove headfirst into freelancing.
> # It was an absolutely horrible financial and logical decision, and my Mom hated the idea, but it was easily the best/most important decision I ever made.

I never made more than $400 in one week from freelancing, but I was never happier.

Lesson:** When the voice in your head is telling you that you need to get the hell out of a certain situation, listen to it. Damn the money and damn reason.**

**Trust yourself.**

## Step 2: Do Sh*t That Scares The Hell Out Of You
> [Quitting Panera](http://findingtom.com) and deciding to freelance wasn’t enough. It was an uphill battle. Every day I had to get on the phone with clients, pitch potential clients, and basically get a lot of rejections.

I’m an introvert, so this was hard.

It scared me to turn work in to clients. It scared me to get rejected. It scared me to hop on a live phone call knowing that if it went south I’d probably be in a REALLY crappy financial position.

But this helped me grow.
> # I promise that doing stuff that scares you is always horrible in the moment. There’s no getting around it. You feel awkward and weird and unnatural, but trust me these are good feelings to have.

It means you’re growing.

It’s almost like you SHOULD feel bad if you aren’t feeling challenged/awkward/weird on a day-in and day-out basis.

This is the next step. You must go through a trial by fire.

And guess what? Facing fears is a battle you’re never going to win. You will never stop developing new fears and you’ll never be able to stop coming face-to-face with them.
> It was scary for me to go on a 5-month road trip alone. It was scary for me to do this 3-month trip in Southeast Asia. It was scary for me to make the jump from freelancing to pursue blogging full-time.

But without facing my fears I wouldn’t be where I am now.

It’s hard to do this at first, and even if you fail at facing your fears that’s okay. At least you’re failing.

Many people don’t even play the game.

## Step 3: Honestly Believe That You Can Do This

Facing fears is hard, but it does something really really awesome to you..
> # It helps you see that your fears aren’t that big and scary after all. Then when you actually surmount them, you feel invincible.

You puff out your chest and ask “What’s next?!”

Then life smacks you in the face again.

I told you before that I had zero confidence after failing 20 interviews. I felt like I had absolutely nothing to offer the world.

When I went out on my own, and forgot reason, and started facing fears, I started developing more and more confidence.
> With every accomplishment, I felt like I was just laying another brick on the foundation that was my confidence.

After a while I started believing that I could actually do more and more.

Then I landed a gig [writing for the Huffington Post](https://medium.com/@tomkuegler/how-writing-took-me-from-waiting-tables-to-contributing-at-the-huffington-post-b0402fea2145). Then I wrote a viral article. Then I interviewed the guy who wrote Disney’s “Princess And The Frog.”

Yeah, it was insane!

In 2 months I made more progress as a writer than the last 10 combined, and I really felt like the sky was the limit.
> # The biggest key to success I think is honestly believing you can do anything. I reached this point in late 2016, right before I got started writing here on Medium.

I felt on top of the world before I gained just 1 of my 21,000 followers — and that’s honestly what helped me do everything I ever could’ve wanted as a blogger.


You have to get through steps 1 + 2, though, before you can arrive at having more confidence.

## Step 4: Work Hard As Fudge

I’m trying to not curse as much in my articles.

After I got back from my 5-month road trip I started writing on Medium. I had big plans to travel to Europe the following year and continue traveling. I had so many plans..
> But none of them worked out.

Why?
> # Because for the next year and a half I’d spend 8–12 hours of basically every day working. I’d work with my Mom, I’d work for clients, I’d write a blog post every night and spend 30–45 minutes answering every single comment.

You see, I had confidence, I conquered my fear of fear, and I was done focusing on money, but one LITTLE thing remained…

The effing work.

Knowing the path in front of you and getting started down it with lion-like ferocity.
> I didn’t know it then, in October of 2016, but the next year and a half of my life would be a bunch of identical days played back over and over again until I went to the Philippines in May of 2018.

Wake up. Write until my eyes bleed. Eat lunch at McDonalds. Write some more. Eat Dinner. Respond to emails/comments until 9–10 PM. Go to sleep. Repeat.

Never leaving my house. Never spending more than $60 per week.

Truly minimalistic living, pouring my heart and soul into this.

I honestly can’t pick out many days as truly memorable because they were all basically the same to me. These were the dark months of my life — the ones that I’ll never remember because every day was the same. They were a big price to pay to get right here.

But worth it.

You gotta put in the work.

## Step 5: Do Not Get Comfortable, Continue To Innovate

This is the most important step.

After I booked my flight to the Philippines, I felt really on top of the world.
> I had over [20,000 Medium followers](https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/290945?v=7), I had a successful online course, I created a system that would make money for me as I traveled anywhere I wanted..

But being content with that would’ve gotten me no closer to my personal legend.

I took up filmmaking on my birthday in March because I wanted to continue to follow my ambitions. I knew starting a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8nN0X9k1JO3IlYUEPtA83g) would be hard and require a lot of work, but I still wanted to do it.

I still try to innovate here on Medium also, as well as my personal wordpress blog and other social media channels.

This is getting me closer to my personal legend, which, as I said at the start of this article, is REALLY what we should be chasing in the first place.
> # My personal legend is still unknown to me. I want to tell stories. I want to inspire. I want to help people live a life that they want. I think that’s the closest I’ll get to describing my true personal legend.

But who knows..

As I film more, as I write more, and as I travel more, I’m sure I’ll find things out about my personal legend that I don’t know now.

All I know is I had to get through every one of those five steps to get here — on the cusp of figuring myself out and feeling as if I’m living life to the fullest.

I have a clearer direction. I have more confidence. Isn’t that what we want in the first place?

If you follow what I told you in this article, you’ll get there too.

# How EvaBot Is Leveraging Data To Build The World’s First Data-driven Gifting Platform

## 

Everyone gives gifts. Gifting is one of the fundamental ways humans build relationships. The best gifts are extremely memorable but require a lot of time and effort. Gifting is also a soft skill, which is difficult to learn. Because of this, many of us are not able to leverage gifting to grow our relationships and businesses.

When I first moved to the US, I faced a difficult challenge: I needed to build relationships with new people and I needed to do it quickly before my savings dried up. I knew sending gifts would help convey my gratitude and my sincere desire to build a lasting relationship. But I was *not a great gifter*. As you might expect, trying to have a conversation with someone in a way that would reveal personal information, and then using that information to send a surprise gift, sounded like an invasion of privacy and felt *really awkward*.

And, thus, [Eva](https://evabot.ai) was born. The hypothesis behind Eva is that humans are more open and transparent with machines than with people. Therefore, a gift recipient (a.k.a the ***giftee***) should be more comfortable sharing their tastes and preferences with a bot than with another human being.

After shipping more than 20,000 gifts, we can confidently say that our hypothesis was correct. 99.9% of giftees who begin a chat with Eva complete the chat, which is significant given that this is a completely new behavior. No one has ever accepted gifts like this before. Below are some of the responses from the giftees after chatting with Eva. We receive thousands of such responses every month.

![](1*ipnC4_TBNKKWLcB4hjalSA.png)

### Pains of modern-day gifting

We live in a hyper-connected digital world. We can instantly connect with hundreds of people in our lives. But the downside is that we often don’t have the time to really get to know these people and build stronger relationships. One common way to build and strengthen relationships is through gifting. But gifting comes with several pain points that were not being solved until Eva came along. Let’s take a look at these pain points, and how Eva addresses each one:

1. It is *time-consuming* and *logistically difficult* for businesses and professionals to get to know their clients and send highly personalized gifts (at scale). **Phase-I** of Eva was designed to solve this pain. It allowed businesses to send personalized gifts to clients by sending a single email or text. It condensed the lengthy and difficult process of learning the giftee’s preferences, choosing the perfect gift, sourcing and purchasing the gift, packaging the gift, and delivering the gift into a **single, simple action**.

1. Learning people’s preferences can feel *awkward*. People don’t always feel comfortable sharing their preferences or other personal information with another person. Eva solves this pain by allowing giftees to chat with a friendly bot, making the experience fun and allowing Eva to choose a perfect, personalized gift.

1. Even if you know something about the giftee’s preferences, it can still be *very difficult to choose the perfect gift*. The best gift always has a surprise element, but it also has to be something they aren’t likely to already own. For example, an Amazon Echo might be a great gift but chances are fairly high that the giftee already has one ([nearly a quarter of American households already own a smart speaker](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/30/17914022/smart-speaker-40-percent-us-households-nielsen-amazon-echo-google-home-apple-homepod)). **Phase-II** of Eva will focus on solving this pain by creating a gift suggestion engine for gifters who already know some information about the giftee. Thanks to the robust data Eva has collected during Phase I, we will be able to recommend highly-rated gifts for specific giftees based on information provided by the gifter.

1. *Packaging and delivery are difficult and time-consuming* for individuals and companies to accomplish at scale. A nice gift handed over in a nondescript gift bag or with a bow slapped on it doesn’t send the right message. Ideally, the packaging will reflect the quality and personality of the gifter, and including a personalized note is key. In addition, gifts that are not hand delivered should be trackable and the gifter should be notified about the delivery so they can follow up with the giftee. Eva has addressed this pain by making [branded boxes](https://www.evabot.ai/branding) available to companies and individuals, as well as offering personalized notes to be sent with each gift. By sending a gift through Eva, the gifter knows exactly what gift has been chosen, what the packaging looks like, and when the gift is delivered.

### Why is it so hard to create an end-to-end gifting product which solves all the above pain points?

Until Eva came along, no one was solving all of these pain points. Several gift options or business gifting start-ups try to solve some of them. For example, gift cards solve the problem of sending gifts at scale but it’s impersonal and not memorable. Plus, it puts the onus on the giftee to pick something, converting the gifting experience into a shopping experience.

Some gifting startups try to solve a few pain points, but they are mostly solving the logistics problem by replacing humans with humans. No one is building an end-to-end product to solve all the above pain points. So, why hasn’t anyone been able to solve this yet?

Our answer? A lack of data. In order to truly solve all of these pain points, you need data. And until now, that data has been hard to come by. Here are the types of data needed to solve these pains, and how Eva has gone about bridging this gap.

1. **Gift preference data:** We may have shopping data for many categories of people. But shopping preferences cannot be counted as gifting preferences. We do not purchase for ourselves the same exact things we most appreciate receiving as gifts. We need data on what people love to receive as gifts.

1. **Contextual data:** The gift itself is important. But the context in which the gift is given matters a lot, too. Specifically, gift preference data should be indexed based on a) the occasion for the gift, and b) the relationship between the gifter and the giftee. Based on the context, the gift, packaging, and personalized note should change. No platform today claims to collect such data or use such data to improve the gifting experience.

1. **Gift feedback data:** No recommendation engine can work without a feedback loop. To date, no one (except Eva, of course) has figured out how to take giftees’ feedback on every gift and then use that data to make future recommendations even better.

![Eva takes product feedback from the giftees](1*akSnQg8tcUShHSepsG_GVw.jpeg)*Eva takes product feedback from the giftees*

**4. Logistical data:** Important dates for every giftee, such as birthdays, house-anniversary dates, latest addresses, etc. must be stored in the context of all of the above data. Such data usually exist in silos over multiple CRMs.

### How Eva is collecting and leveraging the data to build a #datadrivengifting platform

We started with testing the hypothesis that a giftee will share their preferences, address and even their birthdays with Eva, more readily than they would with a human. This helped us collect the **gift preferences, contextual and logistical data.**

![An example showing how giftee chats with Eva to share gift preference data](1*RPaFfmzcKAuZ233btWwrjQ.gif)*An example showing how giftee chats with Eva to share gift preference data*

When each gift is delivered we captured **feedback data** from the giftee. We did this not only to understand which products are the most popular but also to make sure every giftee is extremely satisfied.

![An example showing how Eva takes feedback from each giftee to make sure they are extremely satisfied](1*3Oaq-0f0GTHlN6qR5K4CcQ.jpeg)*An example showing how Eva takes feedback from each giftee to make sure they are extremely satisfied*

### Vertical focus

Most gifting companies start with a very broad focus like consumer gifting or business gifting. We realized that focusing on a much more specific use case would allow us to collect better data and build a superior experience. We started with specific industries, such as real estate, mortgage, and loan companies. These organizations have similar gifting behaviors and often work closely with each other. This has allowed us to collect data on specific use cases, such as closing gifts, house-anniversary gifts, and thank you gifts for referrals.

### Innovative gift catalog philosophy

Instead of building a massive gifts catalog, we focus on providing better gifts by combining a small number of high-quality, artisanal and unique products. Building our catalog this way helps us in three ways:

1. With a smaller catalog, we ship more of each product. This allows us to collect a lot more feedback data on each category and each product than we could if we had thousands of products in our catalog.

1. Because we have more data for each product, we can train our gift recommendation engine better. This allows us to ship gifts that giftees are more likely to love.

1. Because we ship more of each item, we are able to build deeper relationships with each partner. Providing value to our partners and building those relationships allows us to offer high-quality gifts to our customers.


### Moving Forward and Expanding

Phase I of Eva was focused on making it *fast *and *simple* for businesses and individuals to send personalized client gifts at scale while making the process *less awkward* for both gifters and giftees. This helped us collect a ton of important data as described above.

Phase II of Eva is focused on **leveraging the data** we have collected to build the most comprehensive gifting platform. This means people who want to send a gift will be able to use the information they know about the giftee to get recommendations. For example, the platform will be able to recommend a specific gift box for a *tech-savvy coffee lover who has a pet and just bought a new house, *or for *a chocoholic from New York who has two young kids *[Check the example below].

![“Explore & Buy” feature showing powerful gift suggestions based on our data](1*nut-ZFThCcHnnDBuIkET7A.gif)*“Explore & Buy” feature showing powerful gift suggestions based on our data*

We believe the future of gifting will be driven by data and [Eva](https://evabot.ai) is at the forefront of it. If you’re excited about what we are building and want to learn more about our **data-driven gifting** approach, please let us know in the comments below.

# The Power of Setting Goals You can Accomplish in 90 Days

## “man holding pen pointing on calendar” by rawpixel on Unsplash
> # *The great thing about having a 12 week year is that the deadline is always near enough that you never lose sight of it. It provides a time horizon that is long enough to get things done, yet short enough to create a sense of urgency and a bias for action. — **Brian Moran, The 12 Week Year***

[Time is the most valuable asset at your disposal](https://medium.com/the-mission/time-is-the-most-valuable-asset-at-your-disposal-417c0a3f71eb). You can always make more money. But the one thing you can never get back is your time. One of our biggest misconceptions about time is how long something should take. We don’t see that we are the ones who determine how long we think something will take. To our detriment, we usually overestimate the time and make slower progress towards our goals.

According to Parkinson’s Law, we fill the time allotted for a given task. Last year, when our content strategist Kingshuk was overseeing one of our first course launches, he had a long list of things that needed to get done. When we asked him how long it would take, he said two weeks. I challenged him to condense the timeline of the things that he thought would take 2 weeks and try to accomplish them in 2 hours.

* **What if you only gave yourself an hour to do something that usually takes a day?**

* **What if you gave yourself a day to do something that usually takes a week?**

* **What if you gave yourself a month for something that usually takes a year?**

A few months ago, a friend recommended a book called **The 12-Week Year**. The premise was simple: give yourself 90 days to accomplish a goal that would typically take a year. In his own 12 week year, my friend Steve Daar signed his biggest client and had one of his most profitable quarters ever.

In 2013, when I was working with my first mentor, and in 6 months we:

1. **We planned and sold out a conference,**

1. **I published a book that became freakishly successful,**

1. **We rebranded and redesigned a website.**

In that process, we went from 600 dollars in the bank in June to $125,000 in the bank by December. While the results were nice, the most valuable lesson I learned from that period was about how fast we could move if we were deliberate.

The biggest problem with setting yearly goals is that you have no idea what your life or your business will look like a year from now. It also causes people to set gargantuan unrealistic goals, ultimately paralyzing them with fear and preventing them from taking any action.

## **1. Constraints Make Your More Resourceful**

With any constraint, whether it’s time, money, or people, you’re forced to become resourceful. If you only give yourself 90 days to accomplish a goal, you’re forced to manage your time more efficiently. In the long run, resourcefulness is more valuable than resources. Resourcefulness is something you can rely on even when you don’t have resources.

## **2. Become an essentialist**

If you want to accomplish a goal in 90 days, you have to say “no” to everything that’s not aligned with your essential priorities. This requires what Reid Hoffman has described as “relentless prioritization”. If something isn’t directly aligned with whatever you’re trying to accomplish, it doesn’t deserve your attention.

## **3. Manage Your Attention**

[The state of your attention determines the state of your life](https://unmistakablecreative.com/state-attention/) and most time management problems are attention management problems. Start by reducing the competition for your attention:

* Use distraction blockers like Rescuetime

* Work with distraction-free tools or in full-screen mode, so you’re forced to single task

* Unsubscribe from everything that is not adding value to your life

* Take a long break from using social media. During the 12 weeks my friend Steve signed his biggest client, he stopped using Facebook completely

[Attention is the currency of achievement](https://unmistakablecreative.com/why-attention-is-the-currency-of-achievement-2/). Since you’re trying to achieve a goal in the next 90 days, treat your attention like gold.

## **4. Develop the Right Habits and Systems**

[Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement](https://unmistakablecreative.com/habits-are-the-compound-interest-of-self-improvement/). What you do today plants seeds for who you will become a year from now and ten years from now. By the time I got my book deal in 2015, I’d been consistently writing 1000 words a day for almost three years. With any goal, there are going to be things that are out of your control. Habits allow you to focus on what you control: your effort and your actions.

## **5. Condense Timelines and Set Deadlines**

Take a look at the time you’ve given yourself for something and condense it. When you condense the timeline for something, your behavior will inevitably change. Since you have less time, you’re likely to manage both your time and your attention more effectively.

When I signed the book deal for my first book, [**Unmistakable: Why Only is Better than Best](https://amzn.to/297YjPz)**, my editor asked me if I could deliver the manuscript in 6 months. We thought I was going to be revising and expanding my self-published book, so I said yes. By the time we finished the outline, it was clear that I’d be writing a brand new book from scratch. Because of the condensed timeline, my behavior changed, and I delivered the first version of my manuscript to her in 6 months.

There are times you already do this. You’ve probably noticed that you get more done on the days when your schedule is packed, or it’s the week before you go on vacation. Condensed timelines increase your velocity and momentum.

## **6. Measure Your Progress**
> # *Measurement drives the process. Effective scorekeeping is essential if you want to execute well and perform at your best. **— Brian Moran***

Visible progress is one of our greatest motivators and measurement improves performance. Unless you measure your progress, you’re going to have no idea whether you’re on track to hit your goal. By measuring your progress, you’ll get more insight into how you should be spending your days and when your behavior needs to change.

For example, let’s say you have a goal to hit 25,000 words in a manuscript, and one month in you’ve only managed to write 3000 words. It’s quite clear that at your current pace you’re going to miss the mark. You’ll have to write 11,000 words over the next two months.

Measurement gives you this kind of clarity, and a lack of clarity is the biggest inhibitor of progress toward your goals.

## **7. Design the right Environment**

One of the reasons I’ve hammered the impact of environments so much in most of my writing is because I’ve seen just how transformative the right environment can be. Nearly everything I’ve mentioned above is in a way deliberately designing each of [the 9 environments that make up your life](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/the-9-environments-that-make-up-your-life-with-jim-bunch/). Your physical spaces, the equipment you use, and the apps you use to get your work done are all environments. Designing your life begins with designing your days, and you are the architect of those days.

When you only give yourself 90 days to accomplish a goal you’d typically give yourself a year for, you have a different operating rhythm. You’re less compelled by mildly entertaining distractions and more attracted to deep [work.](http://work.in/) In the same way that a piece of paper catches fire in the hot sun when you place a magnifying glass over it, limiting your focus to what you could do in 90 days ignites the spark of achievement.

# 7 Essential Traits for Anyone Who Wants to Build a Career in the Arts

## Photo by RhondaK Native Florida Folk Artist on Unsplash
> # *The Hero’s journey and the artists journey are real. They come with the promise of change, of passion, fulfillment, and self-actualization, and they come with the curse of Eden — “henceforth shalt though eat they bread in the sweat of thy face” — which mandates unrelenting toil and labor. The struggle never ends. It never gets easier — Steven Pressfield*

A career in the arts is filled with perils and pleasures, lingering in obscurity, and moments in the spotlight. There’s no outline, sequence of steps to follow, or collection of advanced degrees that ensure a secure future and guaranteed paycheck. There are no well-lit paths or clearly marked destinations. It’s the kind of pursuit that will cause people to question your sanity and encourage you to do something more practical.
> # ***The only good reason to pursue a career in the arts is because you can’t imagine doing anything else.***

It is by all accounts a life, not just a career, in which nothing is guaranteed, but anything is possible. To navigate such a life, a person must either possess or develop a particular set of essential qualities.

## 1. Patience

The fact that we can go from idea to execution in a matter of minutes has made unparalleled amounts of creativity possible. But it has also resulted in impatience and unrealistic expectations. People want opportunities before they are ready. They want the attention of an audience before they’ve earned it. They want to produce masterpieces before they’ve taken the time to master their craft. As [Todd Henry](https://medium.com/@toddhenry.ac) said “attention for your work is not a birthright. It has to be earned.” In a world driven by access to instant validation, vanity metrics, rapid feedback loops, and frenetic shallowness, patience is in short supply.

When I started my first blog in 2009, a book deal was the unicorn and metaphorical mountaintop for bloggers. In the years that followed, I watched many bloggers take low advances, sign with publishers who churned out books like McDonald’s churns out hamburgers, often a result of nothing more than the ego-driven desire to see their name on a book cover. In some cases, the publishers did little more than send a PDF about how to market their books. Most of them haven’t written any books since. I even know a writer who recently signed a contract, in which SHE paid the publisher.

* Sometime in 2012, I had a conversation with a woman who helped aspiring authors get book deals. After an hour of talking, she kindly informed me that I wasn’t ready. This forced me to be patient and ended up being a gift. It gave me the time to develop the necessary habits to finish a book and ultimately led to a much more lucrative book deal.

* [Ryan Holiday](https://medium.com/@ryanholiday_44799) had worked for authors like Robert Greene, [Tucker Max](https://twitter.com/TuckerMax), and [Tim Ferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss) when he was 19 years old. His second book The Obstacle is The Way didn’t take off until, almost 3 years after it came out.

* When Dani Shapiro [described her career](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/dani-shapiro-perils-pleasures-creative-life/) to me, she said her first 3 novels came and went without a trace. 3 books without a trace. Imagine the patience required to persist in such circumstances. As she herself said in her beautiful book Still Writing “Who would sign up for such a life? Most days it seems like lunacy.”

The long game is a dying art. Impatience and unrealistic expectations are becoming the default narrative. The greatest competitive advantage you have as an entrepreneur is a long-term view, and the most significant competitive advantage you have as somebody who wants to build a career in the arts is patience

## 2. Persistence

My old roommate left an incredibly lucrative finance career to pursue his dream of becoming an actor in Hollywood. He’s been a bouncer at clubs, done telemarketing, and whatever it takes. Every year he shares an update about the Hollywood resume: “9 years and still here, 10 years and still here.” That’s the kind of persistence and grit that’s required to build a life in the arts.

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had been working in the movie business for 10 years by the time Good Will Hunting was released. They wrote the movie to create jobs for themselves. In a conversation with photographer Sam Jones, Matt Damon said: “if I can talk someone out of doing this in one conversation I know they’re not cut out for it because it’s so hard.”

The adversity of broken hearts, failure, and rejection, are all par for the course. Our adversity can make us break us. It can give us chapters to write or colors to paint with. As I’ve said in my [new book](https://unmistakablecreative.com/audience-of-one/), it’s all material.

This kind of persistence and art that rewards its creator long after the average person quits is admired but rarely encouraged. After all, persistence doesn’t promise any guarantees of being commercially successful. But without persistence, it is virtually guaranteed that you won’t be commercially successful.

## 2. Tolerance for Uncertainty

A creative career is unpredictable and uncertain. Sometimes we don’t know where our next dollars will come from or if they will come at all. This is the case with famous movie stars, best selling authors, and anybody else who has built a career in the arts.
> When we set our hopes on this life, we are staking our future on the contents of our own minds. On our ability to create and continue to create. We have nothing but this. No 401(k), no pension plan, often no IRA, no plans- god knows-for retirement. We have to accept living with profound uncertainty. — Dani Shapiro, Still Writing

We watch our friends settle down, start chapters of their lives that we should have started by now, while secretly dreading that it’s all going to fall apart, that we’re going to end up shuffling in a robe in a nursing home, wondering why we didn’t just go to medical school, law school or some other practical societally approved career choice.

But if we were interested in a life characterized by a predictable certainty, we wouldn’t have chosen this path in the first place. Like a surfer falls in love with surfing because every wave is different, an artist falls in love with her art because every day and every piece of work is different.

## 4. Humility

The effort is what we control. The results are what we don’t. But any of us who have created something can’t help but think about the results. In reply to his own words about this Ryan Holiday replied: “easy to say, hard to do.”

And it is hard to do. It’s the hardest thing to do. None of us who make something for public consumption want our work to linger in relative obscurity. **Separating the effort from the results of your work is a delicate balancing act of living in the moment and keeping your eyes on the horizon. **But when we lose this balance, our eyes become fixated on the horizon. We live in perpetual pursuit of a distant dream.

I’ve seen this in aspiring writers, I’ve seen it in myself, and I’ve seen it in people whose books have sold thousands of copies. There’s not a single one of us immune to the havoc that our ego-driven attachment to the results can wreak on our creative work.

Success should never determine how we show up at the page. The reality that you are very much a beginner again every time you sit down to write. What you bring with you are habits, experience, rituals, and routines. But your ego and your accolades must b checked at the door. Whether it’s winning a Pulitzer, making the NYTimes Bestseller list, or Oprah singing your praises, you must always return to the blank page with humility. The ocean punishes surfers who don’t respect its power. The muse punishes artists who don’t appreciate its gifts.

When we let success determine how we show up at the page, our ego gets a seat at the table. We create to impress instead of connect. We sand off rough edges in search of approval and validation. We mimic the people we place on pedestals in hopes of replicating their results. It’s the antithesis of unmistakable.

It’s easy to get high on a supply of your own bullshit in a world where you can provide the world a steady stream of your latest achievements which are followed by people’s praise in the form of hearts, likes, comments, and shares. Social media causes us to overestimate our importance and underestimate the toxic impact that our ego can have on our work.

Anytime somebody mentions the words like well known or big platform to me; my response is usually “my barista at Starbucks doesn’t give a shit who I am. I’m just another schmuck buying a coffee from a girl whose job is much harder than mine.” I once saw a podcaster in line at a coffee shop. Nobody asked him for an autograph or asked to take a selfie. They just took his order.

It’s tempting say to yourself, I’ve busted my ass for 10 years. I’ve been patient and persistent. There’s a difference between believing you deserve something and a sense of entitlement. Driven by a sense of entitlement, it’s easy to overlook the role that luck and circumstance have played in getting to where you’re at.

I always have to remind myself there were a thousand other writers my editor could have found on Medium the day she stumbled on my article. I had parents who could afford to send me to college, and have never been in a position where I had to figure out how to keep the lights on or put food on the table. These simple things we often take for granted are in fact a form of privilege. Without humility, you can lose sight of this.

**It’s easy to overestimate your importance and forget your humble beginnings when a moment in the spotlight blinds you and your ego.**

## 5. Discipline

In a life and career that is inherently uncertain, discipline gives us a sense of certainty. Regardless of the money in the bank, the size of the audience or books sold, disincline and a creative practice keep uncertainty from morphing into chaos. This is just one reason I believe that professionals create on a schedule. With creative discipline we plant seeds:

* We show up every day

* We practice

* We do deep work

The fruit that results becomes our body of work. With discipline and consistency, we move into states of flow and bliss, as we start to dance on the edges of mast

## 6. Focus

One of the questions I’ve been asked more than a handful of times during interviews about [my upcoming book](https://unmistakablecreative.com/audience-of-one/) is “what do I do if I have too many interests?” There’s nothing wrong with having multiple interests. It becomes problematic when you don’t engage in any one of them long enough to either produce a result or give you valuable data points.

When you put a magnifying glass over a piece of paper in the hot sun, it eventually catches fire. But if you lift that same magnifying glass and put it over multiple pieces of paper none of them will catch fire. Our ability to focus is essentially the same. In 2013, my mentor had me make a list of the ways I made money:

* Book marketing

* Social media for a pro surfer

* Freelance writing about online marketing

Then he said, “do you want to be doing any of these things 5 years from now.” I said no, and he encouraged me to stop doing them. Shortly after that, I finished a self-published book, launched a conference that sold out in two weeks, and finished a substantial rebrand that led to the Unmistakable Creative.

A few nights ago my friend Steve Daar and I were playing video games, and he told me about the concept of the 12 week year. The premise was simple. You pick 3 goals and focus on nothing else for 12 weeks. This forces you to be deliberate about your priorities, and it intensifies your focus.

The ability to focus on one goal for an extended period is essential if you’re serious about building a creative career:

* **Writing a book takes almost 2 years of working on the same thing every day.**

* **For the leading role in a movie, you not only have to memorize your lines, but you show up to shoot and work 12 hour days for a hundred days in a row.**

Great creative work, the type that you can build a meaningful career off of requires focus.

*Measuring your success by factors outside of your control will only lead to frustration. [AN AUDIENCE OF ONE](http://Measuring your success by factors outside of your control will only lead to frustration. AN AUDIENCE OF ONE helps you see the successes you might be denying yourself. Get your copy August 7.) helps you see the successes you might be denying yourself. You can [download a free chapter here.](http://Measuring your success by factors outside of your control will only lead to frustration. AN AUDIENCE OF ONE helps you see the successes you might be denying yourself. Get your copy August 7.)*

## 7. Love for the Work

If your sole motivation for a career in the arts is fame, attention, and validation, you will be profoundly disappointed. A few weeks ago Oprah was having a conversation with Tom Brady in which she said the following:
> # *Everybody wants to get rich really quick. They want to get rich through a Youtube post. Or they want to get paid. I talk to 15-year-old kids who are talking about their brand. I was telling a girl the other day “you’ve got to do something before you have a brand.” The brand comes out of the work that you do.” — Oprah Winfrey*

Unless you genuinely love the work, everything I’ve mentioned above will be intolerable:

* **You’ll want to quit when it gets hard.**

* **You’ll crack in the face of uncertainty**

* **You’ll make choices about your work for all the wrong reasons**

When you start a creative career, you dream of the day you’ll be successful. Of seeing your name in lights, your picture on the cover of magazines, or whatever accolades that once appeared so elusive. But anyone who has become commercially successful with their creative work will tell you that the spotlight rarely lives up to your expectations. Even if it does, the sense of fulfillment you derive from it won’t last. The reward of being commercially successful with your creative work is that you get to keep doing that work. It is an infinite game.

The real work of a creative career happens behind the scenes, out of the spotlight with nobody paying attention. Someday it might reach an audience of millions, but when it’s all said and done you’re doing the work for an [audience of one.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/audience-of-one/)

# Feeling Burned Out? So Was I. Here Are 5 Ways To Reinvigorate Yourself

## 

Chances are, you’ve experienced career burnout at some point.

It makes you feel listless, unsure of the value of your work. You go through the motions and count the hours.

Personally, I’ve been burned out twice in my career. Once, I was finishing my medical residency and was unsure if I really wanted to continue in medicine. The second time, I was at the end of my tenure at the biopharma company Cubist Pharmaceuticals. In both cases, I accomplished what I set out to do — and it was time to move on.
> # All burnout starts with a sense of wanting to move on.

Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer — authors of *The Progress Principle: Using Small Wins to Ignite Joy, Engagement, and Creativity at Work* — studied that [what motivates employees](https://hbr.org/2017/02/if-you-want-to-motivate-employees-stop-trusting-your-instincts) isn’t necessarily the money or the work hours. It’s the feeling of making progress.

**When you feel stuck, you’re in the wrong environment. You long for something else, something new, and you lose motivation.**

Not sure if that’s you?

One tell-tale sign of burnout, besides frustration with work, is putting more energy into other areas of your life. People do this because consciously or unconsciously, they realize it’s futile to keep focusing that energy on their job when nothing is happening.

If you’re feeling something similar, here are a few ways to get yourself out of that funk:

## **1. Understand whether your burnout is clinical or environmental.**

I immediately think of burnout from a clinical viewpoint. Depression, weight loss, anxiety are serious issues that need to be taken seriously. If you’re suffering from any of these, get professional help.

But the burnout I’m talking about in this article is environmental.

It’s the type of burnout that can be immediately alleviated just by changing your environment — a new role or new company, for instance. This type is what people generally talk about when they’re stuck in a job and not making progress.

Before you start looking for relief, know what you’re actually getting relief from.

## **2. Work toward any type of progress.**

When I was experiencing burnout near the end of my time at Cubist, it wasn’t because I hated my job. I grew up there. I loved the company and the people.

But I did think it was time to move on because the place had become too familiar, and I wasn’t learning at my ideal rate. So I started looking around for new opportunities. It just so happened that the company got acquired at that exact time I was experiencing a lack of motivation. Immediately, I started thinking about what I could do next.
> # It was amazing how quickly my energy levels spiked when I started considering the future — starting from scratch, new experiences, new environment. It felt like progress.

If you’re experiencing burnout, take some time and examine whether there are ways to get that feeling of progress back in your current role.

If you can’t, it’s time for a change.

## **3. Find the right timescale for the project.**

People only stay excited about one goal for 24 months before [their motivation](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-maintain-motivation-while-working-toward-your-ultimate-goals-4373e478c0e5?source=user_profile---------43------------------) starts to dwindle. I’ve seen this repeatedly, so I almost instinctively think of hard projects in 24-month periods.

If you know a project is going to take longer than that, you need to find metrics and smaller goals that help you feel like you’re making progress. Otherwise, the wait for that long-term payoff will cause burnout. You simply won’t be able to sustain your momentum.

If you can’t find those smaller achievements, then it’s up to you to create them for yourself. You will likely have to look to personal, intrinsically motivating goals such as the acquisition of new skills.

## **4. Find your place in the big picture.**

One of the most common complaints in white collar jobs is that people feel like a cog in a wheel, and they’re not really sure what they’re turning.

When you can’t see how your job is affecting everyone else around you (and the company as a whole) in a meaningful way, burnout is imminent. Even the most stimulating tasks become downright tiresome.

Unfortunately, most managers don’t instinctively understand how important it is for their reports to see the value of their work and how it relates to the purpose of the company. If you’re in that situation, map it out. It typically just takes a few iterations and feedback.

Often times, you can be re-energized by a single conversation.

## **5. Motivate yourself by keeping track of the end goal.**

At the beginning of [a long-term project or goal](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-get-people-involved-in-and-committed-to-your-company-goals-ed35693bd68e), encourage yourself by tracking how much progress you’ve made. This lets you look back and think, “Okay, I’ve come this far in a relatively short amount of time.”

Toward the end of a project, your motivation has to switch gears. You’re looking forward to finishing at that point, so you have to start focusing on how little is left to achieve.

### I think of it like running a long-distance race.

In the beginning, I’m focused on the miles I’ve put behind me. That’s the motivation. But the closer I get to the finish line, the more I envision crossing it — and that’s what gives me the energy to kick it into high gear.

No matter your job, you’ll feel burned out at one point in your career. But if you recognize what’s happening and deal with it in a healthy manner, then it doesn’t have to become a lasting state that drags you down.

# Survival Traits of Resilient, Successful People

## Develop Strategies that Make you Better in the Workplace, in Relationships, and In Your Daily Life

![8994653Young woman lying and looking at the sky @ Dubova](1*wR4OaBiNXuG1zSnXmWoeYA.jpeg)*8994653Young woman lying and looking at the sky @ Dubova*
> # “Do not judge me by my success, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.” — Nelson Mandela

If there’s one common theme in life, it’s that resilience is the necessary life force that helps us stay flexible, buoyant, and strong.
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience) defines resilience as “the ability to cope with change,” and “being able to withstand or recover quickly from difficulties.”

Resilience rears its head when change happens. One stage of life ends, and another begins. It can happen gently and predictably through natural stage-of-life occurrences, like an empty nest, aging, or retirement. Or, change happens unexpectedly from incidents like loss, divorce, financial struggle, or health.

Life events, planned or unplanned, drive the cycles of change and contribute to the evolution of *you*. We can struggle and resist for awhile, but ultimately you just have to figure it out and move on to the next part of your life.

### Why do some people bounce back, and others don’t?

It’s resilience. As the head of my business, I’m forced to consistently stay motivated and weather any challenges that present themselves. In my personal life, I’m faced with daily decisions and adaptations of what the day brings.

It’s within our nature to be resilient. Just look at the tiny seedling growing from a crack in the cement. It can’t help but thrive!

Your business life has cycles of change too. The economy might dictate doom, but resilient people remain focused and flexible. They know the importance of keeping up with current practices and technology to ride the highs and lows.

### Let’s explore how to develop strengths and practices for becoming a resilient “you’…

### **1. Develop perpetual optimism.**

Let optimism prevail. How you handle the past and present will predict your future. Optimists tend to bounce back faster from painful experiences than pessimists. According to Psychologist [Charles Carver, Ph.D](http://www.prevention.com/mind-body/9-traits-optimists-have-in-common/slide/1)., “They stay in the struggle because they expect the ship to right itself.” They are adaptable and don’t stay down too long. They rebound and begin again.

Don’t dwell on problems, focus on solutions… and quickly. Visualize what it will feel like once the problem is solved, then take the very next step to solve it. You don’t have to know the whole solution, just take it step by step.

### 2. Listen to understand.

There’s a difference between listening and understanding what you hear. When someone is telling you something, it’s easy to nod, comment, and answer back. But, it’s another thing to truly understand what that person is telling you. Comprehension only takes place with active listening and the right questions.

![21427933@ andrewgenn](1*4jTJPQm9-wTTREMRoz3fvA.jpeg)*21427933@ andrewgenn*

This is the key to resolving those “difficult conversations.” Unless you really hear and comprehend, there is no way to come to a conclusion.

In an [article](https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/he-who-speaks-controls-the-conversation-but-not-if-you-use-this-tactic-ec3e49a3ba91) by [Dave Schools](https://twitter.com/DaveSchoools), he used the phrase “cognitive incision” when describing a technique for maintaining control of a conversation. I think it brilliantly describes the perfect dialogue when both parties are using this technique.
> “Cognitive Incision is the ability to see through social facades and cut straight to the truth. [It…] means you as the listener are keeping up, following along, and analyzing everything that’s being said. In your mind, you are cognizant of the conversation, are aware and knowledgeable of the subject.” -[Dave Schools](https://twitter.com/DaveSchoools)

When two people are listening this way, the right questions escalate the exchange to higher levels. This technique not only solves those “difficult conversations,” but it also deepens the connection you have.

Who knows… it might just bring about the next great idea, product, or collaboration.

### 3. Let intuition guide you.

Listening to your own thoughts is critical, too. Eckhart Tolle, the author of **A Whole New Earth,** described the process of writing his best selling book as *listening in stillness*. He first allows himself to become focused and aware of his thoughts as they arise. Then, Eckhart writes the words when they come. He doesn’t force or prod, he listens, and they flow.

![19348001Businesswoman thinking @ peshkova](1*LVSvmRmu3gAYBcDlkwVP2g.jpeg)*19348001Businesswoman thinking @ peshkova*

I’ve implemented this process many times when I write, and I sometimes think… *where did that revelation come from?* When you write, practice waiting for the thought to arrive in your consciousness. The words are there if you listen.

This idea can enhance other creative projects, too. Don’t just make the next brush stroke in your painting… wait for your intuition to guide you. If you listen, it will tell you where it belongs, and then lead you to the next stroke, and the next. That’s the difference that launches the genius in you. Just ask Picasso.
> “I begin with an idea, and then it becomes something else. ” — Pablo Picasso

### 4. Collaborate with others to launch ideas into the stratosphere.

When you interact with others, you’re allowing your brain to see new possibilities. It’s the interactive moment when a simple thought becomes revelatory. It’s when ideas fly and explode into new ideas.

As a writer, my work is often solitary. When I read my first draft out loud to someone, is the moment it soars. I see the things that don’t work, and the places for interjecting new ideas. I watch how they react, and their perspective helps me fine tune it. It makes my work better.

The same goes for my husband’s company that creates hotel and restaurant dinnerware and glassware. My husband listens to the chefs… some of the top names in the industry, and then he gets his design team creating. Together they develop products that help chefs deliver a “wow” experience.

### **5.** **Do something to revitalize the “stalled” mind.**

The sameness of life sometimes seems so dull. Creative people often need a “pattern interrupt” to get the juices flowing again. A pattern interrupt is a technique used by psychologists to change thoughts, behaviors, or situations. It interrupts the particular behavior, relinquishes the power of it, and redirects it to something positive.

![11884152Woman standing outside florist @ monkeybusiness](1*uJG3167SDyxpvm2viAAiRg.jpeg)*11884152Woman standing outside florist @ monkeybusiness*

Sometimes work or daily life feels so stifling it sputters and stalls. If you’re feeling stuck, do something different. Sign up for a floral arranging class. Go for a picnic at the beach. Bake a batch of chocolate chip cookies and share them with a friend over coffee.

Or… go all the way and book a tech-free vacation for you and someone you love.

### **6. Consider how you show up in the world.**

Your appearance is the first thing people notice. A huge part of looking great is self-care. It’s a fact we need exercise, sleep, and healthy eating to be at our best.

How we dress is one more aspect of looking great. When we’re grocery shopping, at spin class, or at work, we’re assessed within seconds. I frequently run into clients at the gym or the grocery store. When you look good, you feel good. It doesn’t take much effort to put on a nice workout top and pants instead of a torn tee shirt and sweats. Your next potential client or even soul mate could be the one you meet over peaches in the produce section.

Many people have heard me speak on this premise before, including a good friend of mine who is a producer in the entertainment business. He told me he heard my voice as he ran out of the house to the gym one day… “Michael, you never know who you’re going to meet. Always look your best, even in gym clothes.”

He went back into his house, showered and re-dressed for success. That morning during his workout, he met the head of a prominent network. He connected with her, pitched his idea, and it’s now in production.

If you thought your next great opportunity might be waiting at the gym, the grocery store, or the coffee shop, do you think you’d take a few extra minutes to look your best?

### **7.** Accept f**ailure as a guide to success.**

Failure is an essential lesson in learning how to bounce back from difficult times. Keep careful watch over feelings of failure. It can be a destructive force and keep you weak and small.

Look at failure as a guide to your future. It tells you what *didn’t* work. When a reporter asked Thomas Edison, “How did it feel to fail 1,000 times?” Edison replied, “I didn’t fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps.”

Resilient people know the next failure puts them one step closer to success.

### **8.** **Keep your “child heart.”**

Child’s play was vital to your development. Did you send “play” away when you became an adult?

![35798169@ poznyakov](1*bf6XE0YOJ3h68SuVQZpxMg.jpeg)*35798169@ poznyakov*

Remember when you built sand castles at the beach, or splashed finger paint on giant sheets of butcher paper? Did you mold animals with clay?

Then, it didn’t matter how good you thought it was, or what others thought. You did it because it made you happy.

Return to playing! Find something easy and creative to recapture your “child heart.”

When I feel stressed, I often paint ceramics, do calligraphy, or gather flowers from my garden to brighten my home. It soothes me.

It’s time to return to the delighted child you once were, where your eyes are full of curiosity, and your heart is full of awe.

### **9.** **Sometimes we need help. Ask for it.**

If you’re struggling in your personal or professional life, consider this the perfect time to create your Dream Team. Make use of your friends, a coach, a therapist, a mentor, or enroll in a program that will guide you.

My whole life changed when I surrendered to the fact *I needed help*. I use the word “surrender” because my unyielding pride kept saying, *I should be able to do this on my own.*

In nature, when a female elephant is sick or wounded, the other females form a circle around her. They protect her, nurture her, and watch over her until she’s strong enough to stand on her own.

This is how my circle is. When my son died unexpectedly, they were all there, circling around me until I could stand on my own.

There are times we need help. Ask trusted friends for support and in turn, be a good friend to them.

Enlist mentors for specific guidance and create professional alliances for business help.

When was the last time you said, *can you help me? *Draw from your pool of strength… your Dream Team.

### Note to self: Every time I thought I couldn’t survive, I did.

Yes, you will bounce back and survive. Recognize your challenges as the beginning of the next chapter in your life story. Lean into it and armor yourself with the *shield of resilience*.

After my son died, I could only see a future of despair, but his loss forced me to uncover a new *me*, a new life.
> *“Resilience is accepting your new reality, even if it’s less good than the one you had before. You can fight it, you can do nothing but scream about what you’ve lost, or you can accept that and try to put together something that’s good.”* -Elizabeth Edwards

Each challenge forced me to discover my strength, and each time I was called to tap into my resilience (because everyone *is* capable) and survive.

### Resilience is the only prescription for restoring the soul’s potential.

Learn to bounce forward and dare the new chapter to emerge. The chapters of our lives are a series of choices.

Choose resilience. It’s there inside of you, waiting to emerge at a time when you need it most. It won’t let you down. You’ve got too much life still waiting to live.

# The 5 Mental Traps Every Founder Falls Into — And How To Avoid Them

## 

There are certain mindsets every founder has to actively work to avoid, like pressuring yourself to personally touch every project, believing you have to be “killing it” at all times when you’re talking about your company to others, and feeling like you can never rest. I’ve personally made all 3 of these mistakes (and every other mistake you’ll see here), and each one can really take its toll.
> # Looking back, it’s easy to say I shouldn’t have made these mistakes, but when you are in the thick of it all, it’s all too easy to fall into one of these traps.

Here are five of the most dangerous mental traps I’ve fallen into — so learn from them!

## **1. Saying, “I’ll just do it,” if you see a teammate moving too slowly and you feel like you can do the work faster yourself.**

This is the mistake I find myself making most often.

It’s especially prevalent among founders of early-stage startups, in those situations when you’ve hired a new team member to take over some part of your job for you. The truth is, a new hire will need time to ramp up, to learn the job — and of course, during that learning period, they won’t be able to complete the tasks you used to do as fast as you can.

But that doesn’t matter. Taking over their workload is the opposite of what you want to do, because it will prevent them from ever being able to run their domain autonomously. That will, in turn, prevent you from ever being able to scale your company.

And it’ll have other side effects, too. Stepping on your new teammate’s toes damages their morale — especially if they’re already suffering from a bit of Imposter Syndrome. And it wastes money in opportunity cost, mostly in the long run.

Let your new hires struggle so they grow — at least for the first few weeks.

## **2. Measuring hours, not progress**

In the startup world, it’s annoyingly common to overhear people bragging about how often they get to the office early or stay there late.

That literally means nothing.
> # Unlike in Corporate America, that facetime doesn’t matter here. All that matters is progress.

Here’s what I’ve learned: I would rather have my team sleep later and leave earlier if that means they are sharper and more productive when they’re in the office. What matters are deliverables. To measure someone’s contribution to a growing company or cause, you need only look at things like:

* What they accomplish

* If they hit roadmap goals or deadlines

* If they’re a reliable and respected team member

Of course, founders often behave in ways which prop up this fallacy, too. I try and avoid doing that by creating daily checklists for myself, and measuring my day in accordance with what manageable tasks I’ve accomplished or made progress on during the day.

Ultimately, being goal-oriented — as opposed to hours-oriented — is how you align conceptions of “productivity” with success, for both yourself and your team.

## **3. Feeling like you can’t take a break**

Many founders routinely push themselves to the point of exhaustion in running their company — mentally sprinting 18 straight hours a day, never allowing themselves to stop, sleep, or take a vacation. They feel it’s what they need to do. I’ve even seen founders post about their “work ethic” on Instagram or Twitter as a way to get some social validation that what they are doing is “extra-ordinary”. Nothing gives you motivation these days like that late night “like” or “retweet.”

But in reality, that’s unproductive. Burning yourself out makes you less effective. The startup life is a marathon — not a sprint. And despite some of the very strange and very brilliant people you’ll meet along the way, we aren’t all robots (or cyborgs)…yet.

If you find yourself constantly inundated with tasks or action items that seem to *force *you to work without ever taking a break, take a step back and reflect. Often, you’ll find that you’re taking longer than you likely need completing certain tasks because you are:

* Distracted (not all emails need to be answered right away)

* Mismanaging your time

* Not giving yourself enough “deep work” time
> # It’s about being purposeful. The old adage really does ring true: work smarter, not harder.

That also means allowing yourself to take breaks.

## **4. Trying to be the “cool boss”**

There’s a fine line between being the “boss” and being a friend. When you’re running an early-stage startup — beholden to your team, investors, and to yourself — it’s always better to be the former.
> That means, essentially, being (painfully) honest in your constructive criticism and coaching.

It’s good to be friendly, but feigning honesty will have drastic consequences, both personally and company-wide. Among other things, it will:

* Promote an overtly political company atmosphere in which your team is competing not to be productive or valuable, but to be a member of some founder “inner circle.”

* Eat away at you personally, since the problems you fail to call out are never being remedied. This will eventually cause you to resent that person to the point of wanting to fire them.

* Cripple your product, since the feedback loop is broken.

* Prevent your company culture from growing into one of honesty, transparency and constant feedback, which is what you need.

When you need to have hard conversations, just rip the band-aid off. Be direct and say what you need to say. It’s the only way things will improve. And, truly, as long as you remain professional with your feedback, nobody will fault you.

The truth is, your team will — and should — fault you if you’re not doing your job.

## **5. Thinking you need to tell everybody things are going great all the time**

Founders might be more guilty of this mental trap than any of the others. Talk to a friend or colleague who’s starting a company right now, and ask them how it’s going. 99% of the time, you’ll hear: “It’s going great.”

Not only is this often dishonest, but it has other unforeseen consequences, too. It can:

* Piss people off, since most of the time it comes off as disingenuous or as you stroking your own ego.

* Preclude you from receiving what might be very valuable advice or help, since those who could give it to you won’t think you need it.

* Decrease your credibility — especially after people find out things actually *aren’t* going great, even though you told them the opposite just a short while ago.

Personally, I push myself — at this stage in my career — to be completely honest when answering this question. “You know what? Shit’s *hard *right now.” Saying that to people at the very least is honest, and better yet, might help me form bonds with others who’ve gone through the same struggle.
> # At the end of the day, everyone involved in the startup grind makes mistakes.

That’s to be expected. What’s important is that you don’t make the mistakes you can avoid.

That starts with avoiding these mental traps.

# 60% Of College Students Admit To Smartphone Addiction — Here’s One Tactic To Change That

## 60% Of College Students Admit To Smartphone Addiction — Here’s One Tactic To Change That

*“Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life” — ***Jerzy Gregorek**

I had the privilege of speaking to one of my favorite writers a few weeks ago, New York Times best selling author, [Greg McKeown](https://gregmckeown.com/book/). Greg got in touch after he stumbled across an article I wrote about [my recovery from addiction](https://medium.com/the-mission/15-years-addicted-to-heroin-5-years-addicted-to-life-heres-what-s-changed-5fb74cc0c767). To say I was shocked was an understatement, but I managed to keep my excitement in check — I think. We had a fantastic chat, and discussed many topics including living in the moment, self-observation, [digital minimalism](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/575667/digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport/9780525536512/), and the hidden dangers of success.

We then moved onto smartphone use, and how many people today walk around in a trance-like state, glued to their phones. I’ve seen people walk into lampposts, bump into each other, and even cross the road, all whilst gazing at their phones. As our conversation progressed, unbeknownst to ourselves, we had painted a picture straight out of Doctor Who — people walking around like zombies staring at their phones.

What struck me most, however, I was guilty of the very same thing.

It’s fast becoming an epidemic.

### Disturbing facts

The core issue of smartphone use is the highly addictive nature of social media, with some users displaying behaviors similar to [substance abuse](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/substance-abuse#1). This includes preoccupation with phones, excessive time spent on phones, and using phones in inappropriate places, such as driving. Symptoms of smartphone addiction are also comparable to substance abuse, including withdrawal, losing track of time, failed attempts to cut back on use, and using a phone as a coping mechanism.

As a [former addict](https://medium.com/the-mission/15-years-addicted-to-heroin-5-years-addicted-to-life-heres-what-s-changed-5fb74cc0c767), and [current PhD student](https://brianpennie.com/research/) studying [addiction and online research](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Pennie/research), I dug deeper, and was astonished with what I found.

The number of [mobile phone users worldwide is **5.1 billion](https://wearesocial.com/uk/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018)**, with [**3.2 billion** regularly using social media](https://wearesocial.com/uk/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018). With the current world population standing at **7.7 billion**, these figures are alarming.

As I delved into the [scientific literature](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9), it got worse. Problematic smartphone phone use, which often develops into social media addiction, is related to impaired self-esteem, poor work performance, and relationship issues. Physical health and [overall well-being are also compromised](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9).

![](1*OAE2tX7T9zQViPt1HiQkVg.jpeg)

Other [disturbing facts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4291831/) include:

* 60% of U.S. college students consider themselves to have a smartphone addiction.

* 35% of people think about their phones upon waking, **whilst only 10% think of their significant other.**

* 71% of people sleep with (or next to) their smartphones.

* 44% of 18–24 year old’s have fallen asleep with their phone in their hand.

* Nearly 40% of people NEVER disconnect from their mobile devices.

These are shocking statistics, yet smartphone addiction is fast becoming the ‘norm’, rather than the problem. As I reflected on these issues, the words of [Jiddu Krishnamurti](https://www.jkrishnamurti.org/) never seemed more relevant: *“It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.”*

### Aha moment

This brings me back to my Skype call with Greg, which had a profound impact on my thinking. I can’t remember the exact details, but during our conversation, I became fully aware of my problematic phone use — it was a true aha moment.

My own smartphone use is not straightforward. I’m passionate about writing and public speaking, so any future success is dependent on social media engagement. I don’t aimlessly browse social media; I only use it for work, so I thought I was immune from it’s seductive pull. But I was wrong, I was consumed — maybe even more so as it determined my future, or so I thought.

A core message from Greg’s book [Essentialism](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382) involves eliminating non-essential things from your life. I thought of myself as an essentialist, but I wasn’t, not with my phone anyway. It was a major distraction, and the seeds of smartphone addiction were firmly planted. I was unfocused, distracted, and my lack of awareness on the issue was troubling.

*“We cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change” *— Sheryl Sandberg

### How to beat smartphone addiction

With this realization, Greg reminded me about the “90-percent rule” — a tool from his book — and how it can be used to reduce smartphone use. The 90-percent rule provides a clear metric for deciding between “a yes, and a no.” You assign a numerical value to a decision, and anything less than 90 (even an 89) is a “no.”

When used in the service of problematic smartphone use, all apps get deleted, and in terms of value, they have to score over 90 to reclaim their spot. This might seem extreme, but as Greg says in his book: *“we need to see the difference between things that are good and things that are exceptionally good… it’s an important distinction in a world exploding with options.”*

I proceeded to delete every app off my phone, and over the next 2 days, I individually rated them on the value that they offered. Music and learning apps were no-brainers, and made it straight back in. So did WhatsApp, scoring over 90 due to its necessity and ability to connect. [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brianpennie78/), where I like to post quotes, also made the cut. You can only do that from your phone — smart move — so it sneaked back in by default. Nothing else made the grade, with some scoring surprisingly low.

It’s been 28 days since my smartphone cleansing, and the absence of social media, especially [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brian.pennie), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-pennie-1b1837b7/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PennieBrian), has made an astonishing difference to my life. My focus, productivity, and decisiveness have drastically improved. All my social media engagement is now on my laptop, which has its own issues, but is far more manageable.

### Take away message

1. The reality of smartphone use is shocking, with 60% of students admitting to addiction, and 71% sleeping with their phones.

1. You need to wake up to your addiction, and with [greater self-awareness](https://medium.com/@brianpennie/change-is-possible-heres-how-1d8bc1ac4796), you’ll get your aha moment; then you can’t help but change.

1. To implement change, we need to be ruthless in a world exploding with options. I strongly recommend the 90-percent rule — it works, big time.

![](1*GzUW9gi9yZ_bDT0gEQnnYg.jpeg)

The picture above is the home screen of my new-look phone. Useful apps have been relegated to the second page — it feels cleaner. The quote is to remind me that I made the right choice, and the burning match points me towards the present moment, another core feature of essentialism.

It was a hard choice, but I will be a slave to my phone no more — it’s on my terms now, thanks Greg.

# Waterproof Technology is Killing Your Creativity. Here’s How&#58;

## 

Some of the most successful people to ever walk the planet—Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, J.K. Rowling—have been quoted saying their biggest and brightest ideas came during alone time.

The good thing is, we’re a more health-conscious population than we’ve been in the past. We’re starting to get a better understanding of what it means to be healthy, realizing proper eating and 8-hours of sleep *actually *matters. More people are partaking in things like yoga and meditation to get that much need “time away” from this busy thing we call life.

We now understand: **Personal time is good for personal growth.**

But escaping from the hustle-and-bustle of everyday life is *extremely *difficult in the Digital Age.

## In fact, it’s nearly impossible.

We *hardly ever* get time to ourselves anymore unless we deliberately block it out. And even when you think you’re alone, you’re probably not—I’m willing to bet your smartphone is on, and within arm’s reach.

I recently listened to a TEDx podcast featuring Manoush Zomorodi talk about her concept of “bored and brilliant,” which is also the title of [her book](https://www.amazon.com/Bored-Brilliant-Spacing-Productive-Creative/dp/1250124956/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1533692490&sr=8-1&keywords=bored+and+brilliant).

What Zomorodi illustrates is that, with our constant connectivity, we’re losing our ability to become bored—boredom being the a breeding ground for creativity. If we’re “bored,” we pull out our phones and scroll endlessly to entertain ourselves, failing to recognize that boredom is actually what keeps our creative juices flowing.

I took it upon myself to measure my own levels of boredom and sure enough, found that whenever I was “bored” I whipped out my phone and opened Instagram or some other social platform. Every time I was in line for coffee, waiting to hop on Skype with a colleague, walking my dog or even going to the bathroom, I had my phone in-hand and was consuming some sort of content for entertainment.

But there was one place—one glorious place—where I *couldn’t *have my phone in-hand. A place I’ve always deemed my personal ‘escape from everything’ room. A place so private, I have no choice but to be with my thoughts.

## The shower.

Ahh yes—the shower.

The place where ideas flow faster than the stream of water above. The place where you practice hypothetical conversations between you and your boss and rap Lil Wayne verses to a crowd of 50,000 screaming fans (in your head). The only place where you can make the argument your voice sounds like a mixture of Rihanna and Adele, with *just* a hint of Prince .

The good ole’ shower. It really is the last frontier for idea generation—and it’s about to be obliterated by waterproof technologies.

Soon enough, we’ll be shampooing and scrolling simultaneously without worrying about our phones being destroyed. With the popularity of waterproof devices steadily increasing, we’ll no longer have that crucial time to ourselves on a daily basis, destroying our creativity in the process.

If you think, ***“Oh that’s ridiculous. I’d never be on my phone in the shower,”*** think again. I’ve facetimed friends—iPhone X owners—without knowing what they were up to, who have answered my call *while* *in the shower*. And of the people I know who own the most recent Apple Watch, all of them have admitted to keeping it on while showering to avoid missing messages, calls, or emails.

Waterproof technologies solve a lot of problems—I’ve dropped my phone in the toilet, in curb-side puddles, and once in the Mediterranean Sea—but those are the problems *meant *to be solved. Those scenarios are the very reason waterproof tech was created.

But beware: just because your new smartphone or smartwatch can come into the shower with you, doesn’t mean it should.

That personal time is way too important for creativity.

# 4 Self-Help Tips You’ll Want to Avoid

## 

Self-help is often thought of as a good thing, right? And, in most cases, it is. But, as I’m going to outline shortly, some pretty common self-help advice can actually mess up your goals and stop you from becoming a better version of yourself.

This is because not all advice is created equal. Some of it, although well-meaning, can actually make you go off track, and could potentially do more harm than good.

These self help myths listed below are some that you should think twice about following.

## 1. Shoot for Perfectionism

Now, you may think this sounds like a worthy goal to aim for.

But, you’d be mistaken.

[Perfectionists](https://www.lifehack.org/621368/how-perfectionism-secretly-screws-you-up) are almost never satisfied with what they are working on — so they end up spending far longer to complete something that they should.

For example, I’m sure you’ve come across perfectionists at your workplace. When they’re tasked with creating a PowerPoint presentation or writing a report, they somehow manage to take two or three times longer to complete these things than other members of their team.

The problem is, they often get stuck in the murky world of details. And because of this, they’re driven to constantly re-evaluate, change and edit their work. And, the amount of time they’ve spent trying to perfect something could be better spent elsewhere… after all, nothing is actually perfect, so it’s pointless to strive for it.

Perfectionists are actually trapped in a mental prison of their own making.

If you have perfectionist tendencies, I recommend doing the following:

* **Abandon the ‘All or Nothing’ mindset** — instead of only doing things you know you can do perfectly, open yourself to taking actions that you’re neither good at or comfortable with. This will enable you to continually grow your skills and experience.

* **Aim for 95% perfection** — do this, and you’ll complete your tasks in an accomplished and professional way. And, you’ll also complete them in a timely manner. It’s seeking to make something 100% perfect that will kill your productivity and output.

* **Set realistic goals** — instead of dreaming too big (like wanting to be an overnight success), set your goals at an achievable level. When you do this, you’ll boost your confidence, while keeping your feet firmly on the ground.

* **Focus on the big picture** — as I mentioned earlier, perfectionists often get caught up in the details. To avoid this, I suggest always keeping your eye on the bigger picture. For instance, if you’re creating a document for the proposed purchase of new software, make sure that you only include the necessary details. Too much information is a waste of your time — and also the time of the other people working on the project.

Next up, is the common self-help belief that…

## 2. Multitasking is Key

I’m sure you’ve heard or read about the so-called power of multitasking many times in the last few years. It appears to have become quite a trend.

But, I’m not one for following trends that lead to failure.

Multitasking may appear to be the holy grail of productivity — but for 98% of workers, it’s actually [the complete opposite](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/you-think-you-can-multitask-think-again.html).

That’s because these people practice defective multitasking methods that look like this:

* Trying to do two things at the same time.

* Constantly switching to new tasks without completing the original things they were working on.

* Rapidly cycling back and forth between tasks, which gives the illusion that they are among the 2% of effective multitaskers.

The truth is, that human brains aren’t designed to do this kind of ‘cognitive shuffling’. It just leads us to a messy and confused mental state riddled with something called ‘attention residue’. This means we are distracted by thinking about one task while working on another.

There have been some interesting studies on multitasking, which have revealed that:

* Constantly shifting between tasks can cost you about 40%, or 16 hours, of your working week. That’s the equivalent of losing two work days every week![1]

* Multitasking can cause you to perform as though you’ve lost 10–15 points on your IQ score. In other words, you won’t be as smart or as effective as you could be.[2]

In my opinion, multitasking is not just overrated — but it’s actually dangerous to your productivity.

It’s much better to simply focus on the task at hand. Complete it. And then move on to the next one.

This next tip is is one that is constantly talked about on chat shows, in newspapers and in the self-help book section…

## 3. Aim for Work-Life Balance

What do you think about when you hear the term ‘work-life balance’?

A dream existence where you work 20 hours per week and have the rest for your leisure and pleasure?

This is how most self-helps gurus try to sell it to you.

But, not me.

I have a very different view on work-life balance — it’s called [work-life *harmony](https://www.lifehack.org/837848/ditch-work-life-balance-and-embrace-work-life-harmony)*.

Healthy work-life harmony should start with finding your purpose. And, once you’ve found it, you’ll naturally enjoy the work you do, and it will no longer be a case of dividing your life into:

* The bad stuff — work

* The good stuff — free time

With a purpose to drive you, you’ll be enthusiastic and passionate about what you do, and you’ll work whatever hours are necessary to reach your goals. And, your enthusiasm for your work will naturally carry over into your free time.

As an example, imagine that you’ve worked for 12 years in the administration department of a local insurance company. You go in every workday to process claim after claim after claim. You find the work soul destroying. But, you keep doing it, as it pays the bills.

One day, however, you decide that there must be more to life. And this sets you off on a period of self-searching, which ultimately leads you to come across what you’d really like to do with your life: traveling the world on behalf of a charity helping to help people.

After unearthing your purpose, you feel strongly driven to make it a reality. It takes you almost six months, but in the end, you land a job with an international charity organization that helps people around the world impacted by natural disasters.

The job takes you to dozens of different countries, and you enjoy every minute of your work. It’s satisfying and rewarding. And, away from work, you love to tell your friends and family all about your trips.

Your purpose has renewed you and given you the perfect work-life harmony.

The final self-help tip I want to talk about is…

## 4. Never Procrastinate

High-achievers are go-getters who never procrastinate.

Or are they?

In my experience of working with dozens of successful entrepreneurs, prioritizing your tasks is much more important than worrying about procrastinating.

Let me explain what I mean.

You’re working on an email to a colleague about a meeting that is due to take place next week. But, as you’re typing the words of the email, your desk phone suddenly rings. It’s one of your major clients, and they have an urgent need for your company’s assistance, and they’re happy to pay top dollar to get the work done.

In this case, do you:

**A:** Tell the client you’ll get on it shortly, but then go back to writing your email to your colleague.

Or

**B:** Tell the client you’ll deal with their request immediately, and then come back to crafting your email once the high-priority task has been completed.

Well done! I’m sure you’ve picked the second answer. And, it’s absolutely the right thing to do.

Sure, you’ll be procrastinating when it comes to your email, but you’ll also be helping to complete a much bigger goal that has an urgent deadline.

As you can see, procrastination has its place when you learn to prioritize your tasks.

I hope my article has helped open your eyes to some of the self-help delusions that are constantly propagated. If you follow these delusions — inevitably you’ll end up feeling deluded!

Instead, follow my tried-and tested methods that I’ve outlined above. They will guide you to surefire success in all areas of your life.

As American philosopher and psychologist William James once said:

“Truth is what works.”

# Where You Live May Be the Most Important Career Choice You Make

## 

What does it take to succeed? You may have heard the adage “it’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” And there’s truth to that. But before you can find the *who*, you first have to find the *where*.

I’ve [written before](https://goinswriter.com/success-community/) that every story of success is really a story of community. But community is not just a group of people. It’s a place.

This was one of the central ideas in my latest book, [*Real Artists Don’t Starve](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Artists-Dont-Starve-Strategies/dp/0718086260/). *You need a [scene](https://goinswriter.com/rule-scene/) where you are challenged to do your best work.

So how do you find one?

### Genius Is a Team Sport

First, let’s be clear: *You don’t do your best work alone. No one does. *In the words of [Keith Sawyer](https://www.amazon.com/Group-Genius-Creative-Power-Collaboration/dp/B0012OMFAG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530202074&sr=1-1&keywords=group+genius), genius is a group effort, not the result of any single person’s accomplishments.
> # Genius is a group effort.

What looks like a stroke of insight is often the accumulation of years of hard work from multiple individuals. Not only are we influenced by the work of others. Our [environments shape who we become](https://www.getthegloss.com/behind-the-brand/why-willpower-doesn-t-work-and-what-to-do-instead) and therefore what we do.

So if you want to do better work, the best thing you can do is put yourself around those who are already doing that work.

When we look at the lives of successful artists, writers, and creatives, we don’t just see a collection of serendipitous moments. We see a series of events and connections that allow a person’s work to thrive. We see strategy.

Often, these events are more intentional than they seem. It’s not just luck that leads to success. It’s choice. And one of the most important choices you can make is where you choose to live.
> # It’s not luck that leads to success. It’s choice.

### The Rule of the Scene

Surrounding yourself with successful people does not just happen. In fact, I would argue that more often than not a person finds herself in the right place at the right time because she put herself there.

We all need the right environment to challenge and inspire us to do our best work, and in this article I want to show you how to seek out such a place.

The Rule of the Scene, as I call it, says it’s easier to go where creative work is already happening than it is to will yourself to be more creative.

There are three elements necessary for a thriving creative scene:

* The right **people **to influence and challenge your work.

* A **place** to gather and connect with those people.

* A **purpose** for gathering so that you continue to connect.

That’s what you need to create a scene. Now, let’s explore how to find one.

### The Hemingway Strategy: Join a Scene

In 1921, a fledgling writer named Ernest Hemingway moved from Chicago to Paris. He went there to join a group of expatriate writers and artists living on the Left Bank, because an author he admired told him it was where the most interesting people in the world lived.

In Paris, Hemingway met a group of creative minds unlike he had ever before see. By living there, he was influenced by them and in less than a decade would become one of the most famous authors of that century.

None of this was an accident. Where Ernest Hemingway lived and who he became are related. Joining a scene is not just about moving. It’s about finding the place and people you need the most to succeed — and who hopefully need you, too — and becoming a necessary part of that community.
> # Joining a scene is not just about moving. It’s about becoming a necessary part of the community.

Hemingway went to Paris to learn from established literary giants and follow in their footsteps. And what better classroom for a young writer than Paris in the 1920s, where you were likely to bump into James Joyce at a cafe or Pablo Picasso at Gertrude Stein’s weekly gathering of artists?

He went to the place where creativity was already happening and reaped the benefits of such move.

You can do the same today.

### It’s Not Just Who You Know

Paris in the 1920s was what historians call a “[genius cluster](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/01/160124-genius-geography-cities-athens-silicon-valley-booktalk/),” a term used to describe areas that produce inordinate amounts of creative output. Often, these places are a surprise to us, as with Florence being the birthplace of the Renaissance or Silicon Valley launching the Information Age.

But sometimes, if you’re paying attention, you can discover these opportunities as they’re unfolding. This is what I believe Hemingway did — he saw the genius cluster happening and decided to join it. We can do the same, because all around us, we find scenes:

* Each year, aspiring actors relocate to L.A. and New York in search of their big break.

* Musicians move to Nashville to try and “make it.”

* Hopeful entrepreneurs find themselves in San Francisco or Austin to chase down a dream of launching a startup.

Scenes abound. Our job is to recognize the right places for the work we want to do. Not all scenes are created equal and where you choose to live will affect the work you do. So consider each potential place with care.

In the case of Hemingway, he intuitively grasped his need for the right teachers to help him write the way he wanted. He also recognized the importance of gatekeepers in establishing him as a prominent literary voice. All those things he needed, he found in Paris.

But he didn’t just move to Paris to join those influences. He became a part of their community by teaching Ezra Pound to box, by helping Gertrude Stein get published, and by lending his editing skills to a literary magazine.

He didn’t just move. He *joined* the scene. This is an essential part of the process: It’s not just who you know that leads to success. It’s who you help.
> # It’s not just who you know. It’s who you help.

All these efforts allowed Hemingway to rise to the top of a list of young writers who had all flocked to Paris with similar aspirations. But today, we remember one man’s name above them all — and it’s because he made the most of an opportunity when others did not.

**If you’re trying to find a scene to join, consider the following:**

* What do you really want to do?

* Who is doing that kind of work right now?

* Where can you find the most influential voices in your industry, and how can you help them?

Go where those people are, even just temporarily, and find a way to join the scene. It just might change everything.

### The Brönte Strategy: Create Your Own Scene

Almost every time I talk about scenes, someone asks: “But what if I can’t move? Do I have to relocate myself halfway around the world to find my scene? Am I out of luck?”

Not necessarily. Not all of us are able to pack up our things and move at a moment’s notice. That’s not always the best strategy, anyway.

Sometimes, we need to leave home in search of new opportunities. Other times, the smarter strategy is to stay put and create a new scene. Let’s look at a group of writers who did just that: The Brönte sisters.

In the early nineteenth century, Haworth, England was a small, rural community devoid of literary opportunity. Patrick Brönte was a clergyman and widower who had moved his daughters there to keep them guarded from exposure to the outside world. To pass the time and amuse themselves, the children told each other stories.

One day, one of the girls found a poem written by her younger. The older sister shared that she, too, had been writing in secret. Before long, all three sisters — Emily, Charlotte, and Anne — confessed to being closet writers and began a literary collaboration that would last a lifetime.

The sisters went on to write some of the most influential works of English literature, and it all began in a small village, far from the reaches of civilization. These young women didn’t have to leave home to find their scene. Because for every Hemingway in Paris, there’s a Bronte from Haworth.

Sometimes, the community we need is closer than we think.

### Make the First Move

You need a scene. That much is clear. You need a place where you will be challenged and inspired to do your best work. This requires all of us to get out of our comfort zones.

For some of us, finding a scene may mean a move across the room, as was the case with the Bröntes. For others, it may mean a move overseas, as in the case of Hemingway. In any case, you’re going to have to get a little uncomfortable to find the right people and place for your work.

You must move. Standing still is not an option. Everyone wants a scene, but someone has to go first.

**If you’re trying to create a scene and wondering if such a thing is possible where you are, do the following:**

* **Pay attention.** Look around and see if others are doing the kind of work you want to do.

* **Go first.** Find a way to to bring people together around a common interest — maybe it’s a meetup or a book club — and see what connections are made.

* **Keep people connected.** Use a Facebook group or Slack channel to keep folks in touch with each other in between meetings so the next time you gather it’s a reunion, not an introduction.

This is always how scenes are formed. We all want to be seen and heard and challenged. But most of us are waiting for someone *else* to take that first step. To offer the excuse for us all to come together. To move.

Maybe that person can be you.

### The Gale Strategy: A Scene within a Scene

Let’s look at one final and more recent example.

Every year, Eric Gale, a blogger and author comes to a small conference in Nashville called [Tribe Conference](http://tribeconference.com).

He doesn’t just show up for the event, though. For three years in a row, Eric has hosted the unofficial meet-up for local writers in the area, many whom are there just for the conference.

No one asked him to do this. No one is paying him. He just saw a need to bring people together and took the initiative. He was hungry enough for connection with those who had similar goals and interests that he decided to do something about it.

And for three years, people have followed Eric’s lead. He did what so many of us want to do but are often too afraid to do. He saw an opportunity and took action. He created the community he needed.

This is the third strategy to consider: Build a community off of an existing community. Create a scene within a scene. Instead of going and finding a scene that requires you to permanently relocate or trying to create a local group, start by doing a little of both.

Find a scene that already exists and build a smaller community within the larger one. Use an event or reason that people are already gathering and turn it into an opportunity to connect at a deeper level and stay connected.

Who knows what it could lead to.

### You Need a Scene

As my friend [Ally Fallon](https://allisonfallon.com/) once wrote, people not only live in places, but “places live in people.” A scene shapes you, makes you into the kind of person you become. To summarize, here’s how you find one — whether you do this far away, nearby, or in your own hometown:

1. **Find your place.** Go where the work is already happening and put yourself out there. Join that community. Buy a ticket to that conference. Do whatever you need to do to get there.

1. **Find your people.** Become a part of a community by helping others, filling whatever needs you can. Be relentlessly helpful and watch as others follow your lead.

1. **Find your purpose.** Come up with a reason for gathering on a regular basis. Create an excuse for people to keep coming back together, whether it’s a group project or just a larger “why” behind what you’re doing.

Where you live will have significant impact on the work you do, the life you live, and the person you become. So choose that environment wisely. Because once you find your scene, everything changes.

Have you found your scene yet?

# The Risk and The Reward

## The Risk and The Reward

### Why You Have To Take (Smart) Risks
> # “If you take no risks, you will suffer no defeats. But if you take no risks, you win no victories.” — Richard M. Nixon

![](0*bopDSNKvusw-85_c)

### **Food For Thought**

## **The Risk And The Reward**

Ask any successful person how they came upon The Moment, that particular place in time when they made it, and you’ll get a bunch of different answers. We’ve all seen it. At panels, at Q&A’s, in interviews — the Entrepreneur, the Actor, whoever The Success might be — gets asked the same question: how did you do it? As though there’s a formula.

As though there’s a code we can crack, a way to circumvent the real common denominator of their success: risk.

Because we don’t like risk. In theory? Sure. As a board game? Sign us up (as long as there are snacks and worthy opponents, of course). But in real life? With our real careers? Nah.

So we ask this question over and over. We look around the edges, hoping for a different way in. But CEO of MakeSpace, Rahul Gandi, says it best [when he says](http://bit.ly/2JoBjwt) that entrepreneurs have to make those decisions not once, not twice, but every day.

“When you’re in those moments and you put everything on the line, you know when you walk out of them — that decision might not work in your favor and you may lose everything. When you’re an entrepreneur, you’ve got to make those decisions every day. If you’re too afraid to take those risks… you [won’t] take the step to do it.”

If you want to be on the other side of the microphone —

Or behind the podium —

Or at the top of that cooperate food chain —

Stop looking for the safe way in, because it’s a dead end.

The only way to make it is to step out of your comfort zone.

It’s where the magic really happens.

No, not music. Soda.🥤

Flashback to the early 1940s before the U.S. entered WWII. Shipping has stopped between the U.S. and Germany, and companies like Coca Cola aren’t sending supplies to their international counterparts. Left with no soda to sell, the German Coca Cola distributors decided to come up with their own concoction. They called it Fanta, an abbreviation of the German word for imagination, and the German citizens loved it.

After the war ended and shipping resumed between the two countries, Coca Cola discontinued Fanta. But a decade later, as pressures mounted from their competitors, they revamped the formula and brought it back, creating the Fanta we all know and love today.

# Authentically Amazing

## 

Imagine if you felt about yourself the way you feel about your crush or someone you fell in love with. Life would be pretty good. You’d always enjoy your own company and you would never feel the need to have relationships to fill any gaps in yourself. In fact, nothing you do would be done out of insecurity. How could it? When you love yourself, you are not insecure. This is not meant to be conceited or to give you a free pass to ignore the areas where you can improve. Vanity and narcissism come from fear. What I’m talking about comes from love, the kind that is fully accepting. It means you don’t quit on yourself when you’re in a hole in the ground. You accept yourself just as much in a shack as you would in a mansion, with a college degree or without one, etc. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t strive to reach your goals. This means your goals are forged out of a deep respect and love for bettering yourself, not because you think you’re worthless in the absence of what you define as achievement. It’s a very subtle difference but it is *all *the difference.

This can be a difficult space to reach, especially because most people do not live this way, but during the fleeting moments when I have achieved this state of being, my life feels so different — and so much better. I don’t care anymore about making people like me because I like myself enough. And when I feel this way, I am fully in touch with my intuition. I don’t worry about how others see me because I know my worth and I love myself the way I am. Anyway, I could never really know how someone else sees me; I can only live in accordance with my personal truths and trust that the right people will cross my path. There’s always another open door. And sometimes there are no walls at all, so no doors are needed.

Then I discovered something amazing — because all the energy that I had wasted on worrying about my image was now available to me, I could use it to really be myself and to connect with people — to truly listen and be present. These types of interactions leave me feeling good and they leave me with a sense of fulfillment rather than an addiction to filling an emptiness that only grows every time it’s satiated with insincerity. The best relationships are not made because we have found someone who completes us, they are made when we find someone who compliments our personal values, truths, and expressions. And we are best complimented when we are authentically expressing our wholeness.

I have recently experienced a really painful heartbreak — I’m still experiencing it — but what it did for me was totally demolish the walls I had built around myself. As I tore through another box of tissues, I tried to find a way out of the hurt. And what I found was that a big part of the problem was that I was desperately trying *not* to feel what I needed to feel. So I let myself fully feel this pain rather than trying to push it away. I didn’t let my life crumble —I openned myself to all the good in my life while also allowing myself to feel the pain of what I’d lost. The hardest part is not accepting the loss, it’s accepting myself as I am even when I feel anxious or scared and even when those feelings sabatoge the things I’m trying to gain. By lifting the lid and diving into heartbreak, all the walls I’d built around myself started to crumble. When I let myself feel, I opened myself up. And once that started to happen I naturally began moving closer to my authentic self. I can’t say for sure that I know who I am but I know what makes me feel good and I’m trying to do more of that. My logic was that I’ve already experienced the most emotionally painful thing so what else could go wrong? F**k it. But I combined that with a compassionate attitude toward myself and the intelligence to not *totally* f**k it. But still, f**k that sh*t. Life is too short. All we have is right now. Why waste our amazing, unique, never-going-to-be-this-way-again lives being someone else?

Another thing I’ve discovered is that our biggest fears are the doorway to our most important life missions. The bigger the dragon, the bigger the pot of gold it’s hiding. If I don’t struggle I won’t truly appreciate the value of what I gain. Earlier today I was reading about Gandhi and how he had a debilitating fear of public speaking but this made him become a very good listener and eventually develop into the wise leader that he became. Look at the flip side of your fears. Those are your hidden talents. If you’ve found your life mission already, keep going.

Breathe. Everybody has felt what you feel. You aren’t the first, you aren’t the last, and you aren’t the only.

# Don't Keep Your Superpower Hidden

## 

*Originally published by [Christopher Lochhead](https://twitter.com/lochhead), host of the [Legends and Losers Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/legends-losers/id1204044507?mt=2), and [Heather Clancy](http://heatherclancy.com), editorial director for [GreenBiz.com](http://GreenBiz.com),* *in their book, [Niche Down: How To Become Legendary By Being Different](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FLKJJQQ).*

If you really and truly solve a problem in a new way or you solve a problem that people didn’t even know needed to be solved, then by definition the market is not ready for you.

The market must be taught to accept you, and it’s your responsibility to be that teacher.

After all, you’re trying to reswizzle people’s brains to see the problem you’ve defined through your eyes, and then to look to you and your company for the solution.

Christopher’s previous career as a public tech company Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) — in the early days of the digital everything evolution — offers a great illustration of how this process of market conditioning looks for youpreneurs or for those of you niching down on your own.

He made sure the world understood that he was a different kind of CMO, not just another pushy pitch person with insights about how to create great messaging or to reinforce a company’s relevance within an established market. Christopher’s POV was:** “I don’t solve the problem that most marketing executives solve. I help design and dominate categories.”**

By adopting that mantra, Christopher distinguished himself as unique.

He went from being one of thousands of tech-marketing people scrambling to influence sales in the rapidly expanding information-technology industry to being one of the world’s first technology category designers.

Here’s how a typical conversation between Christopher and a CEO considering his skills would go. (We know, because he was there.) “Look, Mr. CEO. If you’re lucky, you can find a good CMO who keeps the trains running on time, fills the sales pipeline with qualified prospects, builds your brand and works well with customers and analysts. And if that’s what you’re looking for, you should go hire that person. Not me.”

By now, that chief something-or-other would be intrigued or at least incredulous. We can hear the inner dialogue: “A marketing executive telling me to hire someone else? Aren’t those sorts of things table stakes for what I need? Hell, I’ve got to hear more. This guy could solve a problem I didn’t even realize I had… until now.”

Exactly!

And Christopher would continue with this argument: “I know how to do all that, *but that’s not where I add value.* As you know, in every company’s life, particularly in the tech business, there’s often a 24-month window where it’s going to get into a very serious category battle — who’s gonna dominate this emerging space? I have a black belt in that. I know how to design and dominate categories, and I know how to take existing categories and redesign them to tilt the market agenda to our advantage. That’s my superpower.”

**When you have that type of conversation, you’ve just changed the playing field.**

Context is everything.

Ask yourself, are we having the right conversation?

When the conversation was around this question, “Can we wash our hands with water?” There was an answer. Soap.

Or “bar soap” after the designers of “liquid soap” pulled a niche down. And liquid soap became a new category when the question changed to “Can we wash our hands with water in a way that is not disgusting and wasteful?”

Ta-da! A new category is designed.

As GOJO has proven, you can reposition and destroy your competition **by exposing a problem your prospect couldn’t articulate or maybe even identify**.

From there, you show your customer — whether that customer is a consumer or another business professional — how you’re going to solve her or his problem.

Niche down.

**Every market category works the way it does now because it got designed that way, either accidentally or on purpose.**

No one knew why they needed an iPhone until the late great Steve Jobs showed them. But once he and Apple conditioned the market to see the problem that its “smartphone” solved, the market clamored to get their hands on the solution.

He redesigned the problem.

And that was the [beginning of the end](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-blackberry-fell)[40](ms-local-stream://EpubReader_F0600BEEAE08433DBE12AF2C04A8B28A/Content/OEBPS/Niche_Down-9.xhtml#footnote-052) for a very worthy mobile-technology company that hails from the Great White North (aka Canada), the former Research in Motion (aka RIM).

Its BlackBerry, while it was a very worthy gadget and beloved by the tech sales set, faded into has-been status because Apple changed the idea of how average humans should interact with their mobile-communications device. Instead of pecking away with your thumbs at a teeny, tiny keyboard, why not just touch the screen to navigate through messages and applications? So much simpler and more intuitive!

The BlackBerry primarily solved a mobile-email problem. Jobs created the smartphone category by designing a piece of technology that addressed a different problem — how to live a mobile life. That required computing, communications, millions of niche apps, and a glass, touch-screen experience. All in one device, not several different gadgets.

The BlackBerry went from looking awesome to looking like a Ford Edsel.

Apple didn’t compete in a traditional way. It did not get into a feature or price war like most tech companies do. It redesigned the definition of a mobile phone. It had a different point of view.

RIM’s big mistake was assuming that Apple’s “consumer” product couldn’t possibly matter to its core customer base, businesses and government agencies. To be fair, the BlackBerry wasn’t knocked out immediately, it staggered around the ring for almost a decade, mainly because of its rock-solid security software.

But what RIM’s executive team failed to intuit was that many people would decide they didn’t want to bother using two different mobile phones — one for their “professional” existence and one for their “personal” life. Back in 2007, when the original iPhone arrived, the line was already blurring for many people, and the iPhone made the boundaries even murkier.

Since the legendary “1984” advertisement that introduced the original Macintosh computer, Apple has set the standard for advertising technology, and its early campaign for the original iPhone continued that tradition.

The [“Hello” teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bvfs4ai5XU#action=share) spent a few moments establishing the telephone as an indispensable and ownership-worthy device, by showing celebrities like Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe and Sarah Jessica Parker greeting callers, and then cutting to a ringing iPhone.

After the official launch, Apple didn’t waste time on spots espousing the device’s groundbreaking specs, even though there were scads of them. Rather, it leaned on videos that showcased the gadget’s usefulness for the thwarting the ordinary-yet-crucial challenges of everyday living, like [looking up the phone number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=26&v=6huMPq-iWeY) for a nearby seafood take-out restaurant or for helping ordinary people lighten the load in their briefcases and knapsacks [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&v=o_fA9NXdtmA) from an early testimonial series.

It took less than one decade for Apple to sell [more than 1 billion](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/07/apple-celebrates-one-billion-iphones.html)[41](ms-local-stream://EpubReader_F0600BEEAE08433DBE12AF2C04A8B28A/Content/OEBPS/Niche_Down-9.xhtml#footnote-051) iPhones. All because the company conditioned people to equate this brand-new category — a touch-enabled smartphone that also doubled as a media player and an Internet-access tool — with the iPhone.

**Conditioning the market is the opposite of going to market.**

Going to market means playing by someone else’s rules on someone else’s playing field. *The game is automatically rigged* — anyone aside from the category queen is going to fail until someone steps in to design a new category.

Conditioning the market is the process of teaching the market to think about a problem and a solution in a very particular way. Your way.

# If You Want to Design Your Life, Start by Designing Your Environment

## “empty desk near curtain” by Hutomo Abrianto on Unsplash

A few nights ago I was teaching the first session of our Fearless Writer’s workshop. One of the common challenges people had was maintaining some semblance of consistency. It was the same problem I had before 2013. But once I understood the impact that environment has on behavior, and started to design my environments for my desired behavior deliberately, my daily writing habit became automatic.

* I don’t have superhuman discipline or willpower.

* I have to [get shit done despite having ADHD](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-i-get-shit-done-despite-having-add-heres-what-you-can-learn-from-my-experiences-a602a028855c)

* I have to [get the most of out the first 3 hours ](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-first-3-hours-of-your-day-can-dictate-how-your-life-turns-out-8373540330e7)of my day because my attention gets shot to hell after that.

Designing your life begins with the designing your days, and designing your days starts with designing your environment. By designing the right environment, all of our desired behaviors become automatic.

## Design the Environment for the Habit

*Our behavior is not defined by the object in an environment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the influence of environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couches where he watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work — [James Clear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear), Atomic Habits*

Many people try to use willpower and motivation to adopt a new habit. But the supply of both is limited. When I first learned about [The 9 environments that make up your life](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-9-environments-that-make-up-your-life-357d23f4a8af) from my friend Jim Bunch, he said: “if you get fanatical about designing environments, the environment will do the work for you.”

* As somebody who wants to write every day the essential elements for my environment are a pen, a notebook, some noise cancellation headphones, and a place to do my writing.

* If you’re someone who wants to exercise every day, the essential elements for your environment would be authentic shoes and gym clothes.

When you design the right environment for your desired habit, the environment, and the habit will get linked. When I start the music on my headphones, sit down at my desk, sip my bulletproof coffee, and crack open a notebook I know it’s time to write.

## Decide on the Habit

[Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/habits-are-the-compound-interest-of-self-improvement/) They are the building blocks of every goal that you want to accomplish:

* **If you’re going to lose weight, you need to develop an exercise habit**

* **If you’re going to write books, you need to build a writing habit**

* **If you want to learn an instrument, you have to develop the habit of practicing that instrument**

Figure out what your goal is. Then ask yourself what the habits of a person who has accomplished that goal are?

Early in my writing career, I set a goal of selling 1000 copies of a self-published book. But I had no idea how I was going to accomplish that goal.

[Julien Smith](https://twitter.com/julien) had one of the most popular blogs on the internet, had written a best-selling book, and worked with Seth Godin on the Domino project. In a conversation on the Unmistakable Creative, he told me that he wrote 1000 words a day. That’s when I realized the habit of a person who sells 1000 copies of a book is writing 1000 words a day. In the 6 months that followed, I self-published 2 books, one of which sold 1000 copies, the other which became a best-seller, and eventually led to book deals for[ An Audience of One: Reclaiming Creativity for Its Own](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733) sake and [Unmistakable: Why Only is Better Than Best.](https://www.amazon.com/Unmistakable-Only-Better-Than-Best/dp/1101981709)

## Reduce the Activation Energy

I was first exposed to the concept of activation energy when I read Shawn Achor’s book the Happiness advantage, and it’s had a profound impact on my ability to change my behavior. Activation energy is the number of steps between you and the desired action for behavior.

In the case of my desired behavior, writing, the activation energy includes the following steps:

* Finding a pen to write with

* Getting out a notebook

* Finding a book to read

* Turning on my headphones

Instead of doing it when I wake up in the morning, I put my notebook, pen, and headphones on my desk the night before. This reduces the activation energy and increases the likelihood that I’ll follow through on the habit. Additionally, because I’m not making any decisions, I preserve my willpower for what matters most, the writing itself.

By reducing the activation energy for any desired habit or action, you increase the likelihood of following through on that habit or action.

## Leverage the Power of Visible Progress

One of the main reasons we lose motivation to maintain any habit is because we don’t track our progress. Visible progress is one of our greatest motivators, and the simple act of measuring our progress increases our motivation and the likelihood that we’ll continue with any habit. This is why businesses track their metrics, meditation apps measure streaks, and athletes track their stats. Measurement doesn’t just improve performance; it increases your motivation.

In an Audience of One, I recommended a few ways to measure your progress. The simplest one was made famous by Jerry Seinfeld when he encouraged a young comedian to put up a calendar on his wall and mark an x for every day he wrote jokes. Eventually, there would be a chain, and the goal was not to break that chain.

When you design the right environment, you create the conditions for making the desired habit automatic. Your habits are a byproduct of your environment, and your life is a byproduct of your habits. If you want to design your life, start by designing your environment.

## Account for Energy and Design for the Aesthetics of Joy
> # *If your environment makes you feel stable, balanced and grounded, you’re more likely to feel confident taking measured risks and exploring new opportunities. Other people may notice your calm, unhurried demeanor and be drawn to you. **—Ingrid Fetel Lee***

As I’ve said before, everything in your environment has emotions and memories associated with. Those emotions and memories are positive or negative. They’re living you up or bringing you down. Designing an environment that inspires you can add a great deal of joy to your life. That’s one of the reasons I have framed prints of former Unmistakable Creative guests, a four agreements poster, and a Tibetan prayer flag in my room. As Dani Shapiro jokingly wrote in her book Still Writing “if the writing thing doesn’t work out, I could open up a new age gift shop.”

## Move from Default Choices to Deliberate Ones

When I first moved into my apartment a few years back, the low water pressure from the shower was driving me crazy. After about 3 months it finally occurred to me that if I changed the shower head, the water pressure would get better. I ordered a new shower head on Amazon, replaced the old one, and much to my delight a the new one was like a firehose in comparison.

For the most part, everything in our lives is set on default. Most people never change the ring on their phones or the default settings of the apps they use. In our conversation at CreativeLive, [Chase Jarvis](https://twitter.com/chasejarvis) asked me about common threads between the 700 people I had interviewed. One of them was that everything their lives is a deliberate choice.

Designing environments means making deliberate choices about everything including the clothes you wear, the food you eat, people your surround yourself with, and the information you consume. What you consume will determine what you create. So make it a deliberate a choice. When you become deliberate about designing your environments you become the architect of your reality

# How To Become Someone You Don’t Recognize.

## A before and after of me.

It sure is possible not to recognize yourself.

**The photo on the left is me** blind drunk about to go to a rave party, having made a lot of money the month prior from a startup.

**The photo on the right is me** eight years later giving an inspiring speech at Etihad Stadium to an audience full of leaders and several people I admire.

Everybody tells me I’ve changed so much.

I think change is for the better.

## Before the change:

The person I was on the left spent most of the weekend hanging around the cool kids. They all liked me for my nice BMW, DJ career and carefree attitude.
> **While I never took drugs, they did. They smoked a drug called ice every weekend.**

It destroyed their lives. They became drug addicts. I could have become like them. Luckily I didn’t. I found meaning and changed instead.

It wasn’t easy, but I ended up never talking to any of those friends again.

One year after this photo was taken my startup dream came crashing down.

I walked away from it all and realized that I had a severe mental illness. It was this battle with anxiety that caused me to be a drunk and act like an asshole in the first place. Instead of trying to solve the problem I attempted to cover it up.

**Status, cars, money and drugs were what I used to avoid the problem.**

## After the change:

The person I was on the right (taken earlier this year) eats healthy, rarely drinks, reaches millions of people through regular blog posts, reads lots of books, is wise with money, leads a team of digital marketers for a 900 person listed company, and most of all — have overcome mental illness.
> I spent every day since the photo on the left was taken trying to be a better person and figure out how I could help people in the process.

I didn’t come to this realization on my own.

I’m not that smart, unfortunately.

Through the process of reading what the most impactful people on the planet do, I saw a pattern. I’d have to be an idiot to miss it after reading so many books.

1. You must learn to deal with fear

1. You must have a meaning beyond your own existence

1. You must be patient, focused and work on your goals every day

Once I discovered this pattern, I began writing about it every week. I posted articles on my friends Wordpress Blog. No one really paid attention. I didn’t care. **I was paying the price of discovering a meaning for my life** and that was enough of a reward. Little did I know it was going to change other peoples lives.

Fast forward to when the photo on the right was taken, and I was reaching millions of people every month as a blogger. I never could have thought that I’d write so much and help so many people.

Being vulnerable and seen as a leader in front of so many people, scared the crap out of me. I nearly didn’t get on stage at Etihad Stadium. Then, I remembered the pain of what it was like to be the person on the left. I didn’t want to be that scared person any longer.

The key difference between the person on the left and the person on the right was this:

* The person on the right wasn’t selfish

* The person on the right overcame mental illness through understanding the power of thoughts

* The person on the right didn’t give up

I can’t even recognize the guy on the left anymore. He died many years ago.

It’s possible to become a completely different person. I’m living proof and I’m not special.

Find what is meaningful to you.

Tackle whatever challenge you’ve been avoiding.

Then you’ll change.

# 3 Ways to 10x Your Personal Development

## 

How much you learn is based on the perception of where you are currently at and the end goal. A test usually can confirm what you were taught.

However, most things in life do not culminate into a test: learning to be in a relationship, learning to be content and happy, learning to love each other, or learning how to be responsible. Most of these things are life skills that you know you have achieved when you have “avoided” disasters.

For this type of learning you can 10x your personal development by doing the following:

### #1 Cohort (or group) learning

Get into a group of like-minded or same stage people. The most important thing is to have the same general goals and values. This happens a lot in support groups, recovery groups and startup accelerators. It is no wonder that AA, Divorce Care, weight loss groups and even startups are done in a group.

This helps with three things:

**Accountability. **It’s one thing to face yourself in the dark, it’s another thing to face others in the light. When facing something that you have to take a day at a time, it is good that over time there should be progress towards your goal. The accountability of meeting on a regular basis helps keep yourself honest as well as your peers.
> # The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it. — John 1:5 (The Bible)

**Success is relative.** Oftentimes with personal development, success is not necessarily relative to one another, but rather each person has a different success metric. However, having others can help you move faster towards your inner goal of where you want to be.

Comparison should not be made on each other’s goals nor even how quickly one reaches their goals, but how fast one moves towards achieving them.
> # Success is more about the slope than the y-intercept.— Paul Buchheit

Therefore it is not where you begin, but where you end.
> # Where you start is rarely indicative of where you end.

**Encouragement. **More often than not the thing you are facing is harder when done by yourself. Life is meant to be lived in a community and it is no wonder that loneliness is the number one killer of people, or that people with strong community bonds live longer.
> # Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. — Ecclesiastes 4:9–10,12 (The Bible)

### #2 Focus on one thing

Choose one thing to do and focus on that. In AA it is getting to sobriety. In Weight Watchers it is losing weight. In Y Combinator it is growth. This goal is large and meaty, and many ways to get there. That is by design. This way you can choose paths but they should all feed into what you are trying to do. It becomes the most important thing for the group to focus on.

Having that one goal enables a group or person to focus. It is amazing what type of focus that one goal can do for a group of people.

As an organization gets larger, a strategy in reducing feedback loops is to introduce a “[rally cry](https://www.tablegroup.com/imo/media/doc/AdvantageThematicGoal(8).pdf)” for the entire organization. The purpose for the rally cry is to focus the organization on one thing to create momentum. Netflix it was “Defeat Blockbuster” and for every Blockbuster that closed, a pin would change color on the US map to denote its eventual decline. For our organization our rally cry was “51% of traffic off of Facebook”. We reported on this weekly, it was top of mind and in a few months, we had achieved this goal. Within 6 months, all employees plus a guest were taken to Tahoe as a reward trip.

A [rally cry](https://www.tablegroup.com/imo/media/doc/AdvantageThematicGoal(8).pdf) is a goal that is the most important thing that needs to be done for the organization to succeed. It is usually time boxed. It reduces your feedback loop to just one thing, which creates a sense of urgency, focus, and purpose for a group of people.

### #3 Timebox

There should be a beginning and an end (or milestone) to the program. Continuously meeting together without a show of progress can be debilitating and leave someone spinning in circles. There should be a clear sense of how long the program is to help kick start and focus yourself for a period of time.

This is why bootcamps are only 6 weeks, accelerator programs are 3 months and organizational rally cries are 6 months.

A deadline creates momentum and urgency. The time frame forces yourself to push yourself to the limits and surprise yourself on what you can do in that amount of time. At the end of the period you can look back and measure movement. And, when tackling personal development, movement is the ***one*** thing that matters.

So next time you are looking to lose that extra 10 pounds, exercise more, or start your company — consider joining a group, focus on one thing for a period of time. You may just surprise yourself on how far your limits are.

# 5 Reasons why you should move to Salesforce Lightning right away!

## 

Salesforce Lightning is the Salesforce embracing the 21st century. With intuitive tools and services to automate business processes along with external application integration, the Lightning Platform is your one-stop shop for robust CRM attributes and interactive UI that make your work all the more delightful.

The defining features of Salesforce Lightning are the interactive tabs, activity timeline and homepage components; all of which streamline your workflows and put the right things at the right place to maximize the productivity of your sales, marketing, and service teams. But despite all these fancy new features, organizations are still pondering if its the right time to migrate to Salesforce Lightning. This is due to a number of reasons, large organizations can’t risk jeopardizing their operations, Lightning still has a long way to go concerning tasks accessible in Salesforce Classic and the fact that most people just don’t know where to start. If your reason is the latter, pick up that phone and call us now, we provide complete [**Salesforce Migration](https://www.rolustech.com/salesforce-data-migration)** services with the most effective (ETL) tools that ensure complete data mapping, integrity, and security.

When Lightning first came out, it really had limited functionality and the questions over its functionality made sense. However, that is no longer the case. Over the last couple of years, Salesforce Lightning has added a whole bunch of new features that arguably make it a better fit than Salesforce Classic. Read on for the top 5 reasons why this is the right time for you to make the jump.

## Sales Automation

Two words, Sales Path and Kanban View. **Salesforce Lightning** redefines the sales process with these two features that make selling a walk in the park. If you’re a former sales rep or familiar with the art (read: misery) of selling, you know that’s saying something.

Think of Sales Path as an in-built sales coach. It shows all opportunities in the sales pipeline with recommended steps you should take. This streamlines sales actions, with sales reps making decisions faster and more accurately. Sales Path also defines Sales processes that ensure a structure and protocol for sales reps to follow.

Kanban View gives sales reps a simplified view of the opportunities in the pipeline, actions can be taken in real time with a drag-and-drop feature, easily moving them through different stages in the pipeline. Kanban View also includes real-time updates with all corresponding actions to steps i.e. calculations etc updated automatically.

## Salesforce Einstein

[**Salesforce Einstein](https://www.rolustech.com/blog/salesforce-einstein-intelligent-future)** is a mainstay in Salesforce Lightning, an artificial intelligence powered by deep machine learning, predictive analytics, and natural language processing. Sounds complicated but very simple. Salesforce Einstein works in the background like a diligent observer à la Sherlock Holmes, and learns everything from data and actions to behaviors. Based on this, it presents your sales reps with recommendations, customer insights and predicts outcomes. Salesforce Einstein provides quality analytics that put you one step ahead of your customers.

## Lightning App Builder

Lightning App Builder is that one door in Salesforce to a completely customized experience. It comes with a drag-and-drop feature that makes it very simple to create pages by picking components from the component library. According to Salesforce, the component library contains over 300 components, all of which can be quickly integrated with Salesforce. Similarly, specific needs can be met by browsing the AppExchange containing over 500 apps at present. The Salesforce Lightning App Builder significantly reduces customized app development for Salesforce

## Mobile Ready UI

Mobile is the future. Flexibility when it comes to work will drive product adoption and success for industries because people need the ability to take action on the go. Salesforce Lightning does just that with its cross-platform UI and design that allows a near seamless shift between desktop and mobile. With Salesforce Lightning, your sales reps can be in constant contact with leads and customers 24/7. According to Salesforce, the mobile app has increased productivity by 35% already.

## Increased Productivity

Lightning comes with numerous smaller features that nonetheless massively increase productivity. These components that sit under the radar add substantially to Lightning’s importance. You can use the following components in Salesforce Lightning:

* **News & Insights:** A component that can be dropped into any part of the application. It crawls the web for potentially important details about prospects and customers. It also shows relevant industry news to keep your sales team informed on updates.

* **Auto-Fill & Duplicate Prevention:** It crawls the Salesforce database for potential data and auto-fills sections based on that. It also prevents potential duplicates but automatically pointing it out.

* **Chatter Streams:** Combine team members into one stream and monitor their updates.

## Our Two Bits!

Salesforce Lightning comes with numerous features that are set to define the Salesforce Platform in the years to come. Sooner or later, it will eclipse Salesforce Classic as the go-to platform. Salesforce has maintained that and with each new update bringing in more features from Classic, the stage seems to be set. If you’re not inclined towards a complete migration to Lightning but also don’t want to be left behind in terms of productivity, we suggest opting for a mix of Lightning + Classic for a preliminary period before making a complete shift. This will provide you ample time to understand the Lightning platform.

# Freedom is the enemy of creativity, limitations are its saviour

## How staying inside the box can help you think outside it

![](1*eX41oayl6RPik8eCmuvSzg.png)

## **Introduction**

It’s a common misconception that freedom gives you the space to be a better creator.

Most creative endeavours take place within a restricted budget and those that have an abundance of talent and finances often fail to create anything original.

Limited environments actually foster more creativity than free and open ones, given that you already know how to perform your particular skill.

I’m going to convince you, using case studies and scientific analyses, that putting restrictions on your creative process is more beneficial than bottomless freedom.

Let’s get into it.

## **Embrace your limitations**

In his *TED Talk*, ‘[Embrace the Shake](https://www.ted.com/talks/phil_hansen_embrace_the_shake)’, Phil Hansen tells the story of how he developed a shake in his hand after years of repeated pointillism.

The shake meant that all his lines were squiggly, all his dots looked like tadpoles, and grasping the pen tighter to compensate for it gave him joint issues which made it hard to hold anything.

After leaving art behind for a few years Hansen went to a doctor who told him he had nerve damage, and after looking at his squiggly lines, said: “why not embrace the shake?”

Hansen started drawing scribble pictures and although it wasn’t necessarily the type of art he wanted to create, he realised he could still be an artist in spite of his condition.

![Still from Phil Hansen’s TED talk 2013 — ©Phil Hansen](1*EwzCZUTRjGpa2NJMB3WzTg.png)*Still from Phil Hansen’s TED talk 2013 — ©Phil Hansen*

His interest in the ‘fragmentation of images to create a bigger picture’ element of pointillism never left him and he decided that if he made bigger pictures, his hand wouldn’t affect them so much.

Once he finished school he went to a shop, bought as many art supplies as he could, sat down to create, but his ability to think outside the box was crippled by the overabundance of choice.

Hansen thought back to his jittery hand, “embrace the shake”, and realised that he should quit trying to think outside the box and get back into it.

He decided to drastically reduce the supplies and tools he used. He painted an [image of Bruce Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbvSms-1yj4) by dipping the side of his hand in paint and karate chopping the canvas.

![Bruce Lee — Karate Chopped Paint — ©Phil Hansen](1*MF5kqFcwkBT5HNcEmkoqiA.png)*Bruce Lee — Karate Chopped Paint — ©Phil Hansen*

He took these limitations one step further by creating images that destroyed themselves shortly after completion. He called the installation ‘[Goodbye Art](http://www.philinthecircle.com/goodbye-art)’ and created pieces using spit out food, frozen wine, and candles.

Hansen’s shaky hand, and subsequent embrace of limitations, forced him to think outside the box and create art he never would’ve even tried to create had those limitations not been imposed.

In 1995 a study titled ‘[Learned Variability](https://www.academia.edu/11747570/Learned_variability?auto=download)’ researchers examined the effect of physical limitations on rats. They found that rats who only have their right leg free come up with more varied ways to perform a given task than those with full control over their limbs.

Their primary thesis for this behaviour is that the rats with only their right leg free had to develop more steps, and more approximations, than those who had full range of motion.

Enforced time constraints from work commitments have the same effect. When you’re under pressure to complete a task because you don’t feel you have the time necessary to write well, you have to think of new, more interesting, ways to write.

Sometimes you have to put yourself inside the box to think outside it.

## **Budget your creativity**

Limiting the amount of money you spend on a project can also force you to think of new ways to create.

Filmmaking might seem like an elite hobby, reserved for those with huge financial backing, yet some of the best films ever made were filmed with extremely low budgets.

A great example would be the recent *Netflix* series [*Stranger Things](http://uk.businessinsider.com/stranger-things-budget-2016-7/#no-green-screen-was-used-to-create-the-series-alternate-dimension-its-actually-just-fog-and-ash-4). *In this show the Duffer brothers had to make a lot of compromises due to a very low budget.

The two brothers wanted to film the show in a coastal town but couldn’t afford to. Because of this restriction they came up with the idea to create their own fictional town, like Stephen King’s Castle Rock, instead.

I personally loved the town of Hawkins and couldn’t imagine the show taking place in any other location.

Complex CGI is very expensive so they made some other compromises which gave a unique quality to the show.

They put an inch of water on the floor and hung up black curtains for the incredibly creepy ‘void’ scenes; they used actual ash and fog for the ‘upside down’ scenes; and they used a minimalistic ‘slow-swelling synth’ for the intro, all to save money on CGI.

![Eleven traversing the Void — ©Stranger Things](1*rA33-gRKpZVg_UYlKczO9A.png)*Eleven traversing the Void — ©Stranger Things*

Again, these restrictions show how putting pressure on yourself to perform within certain boundaries forces you to think outside the box.

However, you don’t have to wait until you’re in a situation where your finances are low in order to benefit from this phenomenon, you can impose the restrictions upon yourself.

[M. Night Shyamalan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voaaUeughDk&ab_channel=SWAY%27SUNIVERSE) took this exact approach when he filmed his recent 2016 smash-hit *Split. *Instead of using studio funding, he funded the entire film with his own money which kept him on edge and forced him to come up with novel solutions the same way the Duffer brothers did.

He said: “The reason I do it is so I can get that tension, that thing, so that every second is mine. It’s my money, it’s my thing.”

Shyamalan also used a crew of amateur filmmakers because he wanted to remember what it was like to be a beginner. It seems to have worked out well as the show received rave reviews from critics, one of which, *Screenrant*’s [Sandy Schaefer](https://screenrant.com/split-movie-2017-reviews/), called it “the best M. Night Shyamalan creation in recent memory.”

In a 2013 study aptly named ‘[How Do Financial Constraints Affect Creativity?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpim.12129),’ the effect of financial restrictions were tested on people’s ability to perform creative tasks such as product ideation and product repair.

The researchers found that: “at least under certain conditions, the use of financial constraints might constitute a promising approach to foster new ideas’ generation, one that leads to more creative outcomes despite using less costly inputs.”

The results are pretty conclusive, yet, what are these “certain conditions” the study refers to?

## **Ground your work in facts and the rules of your trade**

It’s clear from the last two sections that restrictions in tools, supplies and overall finances put our brains into an innovation mindset. But, in order to excel under these limited conditions, we have to understand how to create within our field and ground our work in fact.

In his *Sirius XM* [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voaaUeughDk&ab_channel=SWAY%27SUNIVERSE) Shyamalan wanted to use the inexperience of new blood to bring his filmmaking back to its roots, but, he makes the caveat that they had his well of knowledge to draw upon and guide them through.

When referring to science fiction films, [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7tV7v71k-I&ab_channel=Fox5NY) often distinguishes between the good and the bad dependent on how close the films were to the actual science.

*Interstellar* is a good example because they had Kip Thorne, an esteemed theoretical physicist, on board as executive producer. He made sure that all the fictional scientific elements were as close to the actual laws of physics as possible.

Tyson often quotes Mark Twain as having said: “get your facts straight first, then distort them as you please.” Suggesting that in order to come up with creative fiction, you need a factual anchor.

The same goes for understanding the rules of your craft. My favourite quote on this comes from Strunk and White’s [*The Elements of style](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33514.The_Elements_of_Style), *the best book on English rhetoric out today.

Strunk said: “It’s an old observation, that the best writers sometimes disregard the rules of rhetoric. When they do so, however, the reader will usually find in the sentence some compensating merit, attained at the cost of the violation. Unless he is certain of doing as well, he will probably do best to follow the rules.”

Again we see the theme of sticking yourself inside a box, in this case the rules of rhetoric, to be able to think outside it. By grounding yourself in facts and rules you are able to push yourself beyond their boundaries.

Hansen didn’t suddenly become a great artist when he got the shakes, he’d already studied the rules of art and practiced his skills in pointillism before he suffered the restriction.

The same goes for any creator, learn the skills of your craft first then bring on the restrictions.

## **Conclusion**

Creativity is not born from freedom. If you really want to push yourself beyond your limits you have to learn a skill, absorb its rules, learn where the limits lie, and exceed them.

The best way to surpass these limits is to barricade yourself in them and look for the beams of light shining through the cracks.

As Hansen said in his *TED Talk, “*sometimes you need to be limited in order to become limitless.”

# The 3 Books That Have Made Me A Better CEO

## 

It’s common knowledge by this point: all CEOs need to read — often.

But with that being said, not all books are created equal. They don’t all provide us with the same sort of actionable wisdom, training, or insight. Moreover, certain books will resonate more meaningfully with some people than they will with others.

In this sense, identifying one’s most critical literary influences is a subjective task — but there’s value, too, in reflection, and in sharing the [books that have shaped you](https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-4-best-books-written-by-authors-weve-lost-in-2018-c8846c4daf41). We can all learn from each other.

With that in mind, here are the three books that have each helped make me a better CEO at my company, [BookBaby](https://www.bookbaby.com/).

## **“Tipping Point” by Malcolm Gladwell**

Gladwell’s debut book changed the way I think about marketing.

In “Tipping Point,” Gladwell explains how ideas spread like epidemics. He describes the “tipping point” as the moment of critical mass, where an idea goes from interesting to a few people, to necessary for everyone. He examines the key elements required of reaching critical mass — where its viral effect becomes unstoppable.
> According to Gladwell, there are three kinds of people who can help push an idea to this point.

First, there are “connectors” — people with massive social networks. Then there are “salesmen” — people who boast about ideas they love with contagious positive energy. Finally, there are “mavens” — people who collect information in order to be an authoritative source of insight for their network.

But there’s even more to do it than that. Without “stickiness,” for example — a concept Gladwell defines as something about an idea that makes it memorable — no idea will ever reach critical mass.

Marketers lapped it up, thinking they now had a blueprint with which to better promote ideas.

But how I interpreted Gladwell’s premise was different. I didn’t see a simple cause-and-effect relationship. Instead, Gladwell impressed upon me the idea that if you want something to go viral, you should focus on making something so great that people who see it will need to share it. Or, in other words, Gladwell taught me to focus on [making great content](https://medium.com/@stevenspatz4/the-5-books-any-entrepreneur-writing-a-book-must-read-b77d85c061ee) with an eye only for making something great, as opposed to making something popular.

A product, idea, or story that’s authentically great is inherently stickier than some SEO-focused ploy concocted by a marketing department in New York.

## **“Great People Decisions: Why They Matter So Much, Why They Are So Hard, and How You Can Master Them” by Claudio Fernandez-Araoz**

An organization is only as good — or as flawed — as its people. The ability to hire, manage, and retain great people is one of the most important skills executives can have.

This was one of the chief lessons I took from Claudio Fernandez-Araoz’s book “Great People Decisions” — a comprehensive resource for leaders who want to improve at finding and growing great employees.
> # Fernandes-Araoz’s argument is this: the majority of us are not equipped with the right tools to make great people decisions.

Executives receive little formal training in making such choices, often because of the false belief that this skill is not learnable. But this is a misnomer. Executives should dedicate energy every day to helping their employees achieve their true potential.

According to Fernandez-Araoz, hours spent in this pursuit are an important investment. The potential to grow, lead, and flourish is what truly attracts the best people — especially of today’s generation. If you’re not offering that, other companies will.

Internalizing this truth was eye-opening for me, to say the least. Archaic approaches to people management simply no longer suffice.

## **“Noble House” by James Clavell**

James Clavell was a prolific writer from Sydney, Australia. He penned screenplays for a number of acclaimed films, including The Fly, The Great Escape, and To Sir With Love. But it was his Asian saga of novels — including the blockbusters “Sho Gun” and “Tai Pan” — that brought him literary fame.

“Noble House” was the climatic fifth book of the series. It’s set in Hong Kong in 1963. The action spans scarcely more than a week, but these are days of high adventure: from kidnapping and murder to financial double-dealing and natural catastrophes. It also details the intense and traumatic decisions one fictional CEO needs to make as part of his career — the deals, transactions, and tough choices that emerge daily in his work.

Besides being a breathtaking read, “Noble House” proved instrumental to me because it inspired me to start a company when I was very young. I knew that the work of executives was probably not as thrilling as it’s depicted in “Noble House,” but the problems the characters face seemed so fascinating and nuanced. The work seemed exciting.

More importantly, perhaps, the book introduced me to an important mindset that has helped shape my philosophy about business. I call it “The Culture of the Long View.”

It’s epitomized by the audacity and purpose with which Asian cultures depicted in Clavell’s novel approach large life challenges. Essentially, they make tremendously ambitious plans, and they march toward them, one step at a time.
> # This far-forward way of thinking influenced how I now approach big problems. It taught me to nurture long-term plans even in the face of short-term obstacles.

Now, this last choice might strike some as unusual. But many legendary CEOs find wisdom in fiction books. Jeff Bezos, for example, says he learns more from novels than nonfiction.

At the end of the day, though, the truly important thing for executives to internalize is this: you need to read. Yes, you might be busy. But your outputs will only ever be as effective or as intelligent as your inputs.

Without quality inputs, you’re limiting yourself unnecessarily.

# Constrain Yourself! It’ll Help You Focus Faster

## “turned on Focus signage” by Stefan Cosma on Unsplash

Are you having trouble deciding on your priorities for the year?

Or maybe you’ve dozens of tasks in your to-do list app but feel unsure how to get going, never mind what to work on first?

The right constraint can help you find your focus and achieve your goals faster.

Don’t worry, practical constraints are about more than eating porridge or wearing a grey T-shirt every day.

## Time

Try the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) to get more from your valuable working hours.

Get a timer, set it for 30 minutes, and work on your most important task until the buzzer sounds. Then, take a short two-minute break before returning to your most important task and resetting the timer.

Ideally, stack these sessions on top of each other until you [finish the task](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-spend-your-working-day-wisely-and-actually-get-things-done-2824628e31d6) at hand.

## Design

A web designer once told me many entrepreneurs go “color and font crazy” when building a site or presentation. His advice?

Pick two and certainly no more than three fonts, colours, and heading styles, and stick with them. Design software [Canva](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/) can help you with this.

Limiting your options will help you avoid feeling overwhelmed by the array of fonts and colors at your disposal when creating a presentation or webpage.

## Word count

Let’s say you need to write and submit an important report by Friday afternoon.

Rather than spending all week crafting *War and Peace*, use the constraint of 500 or 1,000 words to decide what to include and exclude.

As an example, I once worked with a chief marketing officer who said he didn’t have time for 50- or 100- page reports and preferred two page summaries.

Your time-strapped readers might thank you for applying this constraint.

## Theme

Don’t agonize about what to do every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and so on. Instead, pick a theme for each day and stick to it.

Spend Mondays on customer research, Tuesdays on product development, Wednesdays on marketing. And so on.

Having a theme for individual days related to your work will give you mental clarity about what to do and when.

## Priorities

Many entrepreneurs have trouble deciding on their priorities for the entire year. Instead of feeling anxious about what you will or won’t get done over the next 52 weeks, pick your top three priorities for this month or even just this week.

For example, one online entrepreneur told me he’s spending the third quarter of 2018 optimizing his website for search and lead generation. He’ll still work on other tasks, but they’re secondary.

## Tools

These days, we can pick from more productivity and business tools than ever before. Managing the logins and passwords alone is a job in itself.

Instead of wasting time learning [new tools](https://medium.com/@BryanJCollins/how-to-use-your-tools-so-they-dont-own-you-b94257d93e75) or clicking “Reset password,” pick one for the job at hand, for example a single design application or word processor. After all, done is better than perfect, and you can always try a different tool (and a more memorable password) next time.

## Inputs

According to consumer researchers [Moreau and Dahl](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23547233_Designing_the_Solution_The_Impact_of_Constraints_on_Consumers'_Creativity), reducing your inputs might help you become more creative.

So if you’re feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information on your desk, refine and reduce it to what’s essential. Rather than reading dozens of reports and papers, pick two or three of the most relevant ones and concentrate on those.

## Focus On Getting To Done

It’s fun to riff on Mark Zuckerberg’s choice of attire once you understand that constraints are useful productivity tools.

Choosing a practical and relevant constraint should help you focus on what matters and work through a to-do list faster. Now, pick just one.

**Ready to supercharge your productivity?**

I’ve created a cheat sheet that will help you FOCUS immediately. Follow this and you’ll accomplish more than you can imagine.

# The Evolution of Rock

## From The King of Rock’n’Roll Onward

![](0*eVAYN39jTljUN0Fq)
> # “Rock and roll music, if you like it, if you feel it, you can’t help but move to it.” -Elvis Presley

### **Food For Thought**

## **The Evolution of Rock**

*Throughout time, music has been used as a way to connect people, express feelings, and tell stories. This week’s newsletters will highlight some of the most well-known and little-known musicians, music facts, and genres. Today’s theme: Rock.*

The term rock’n’roll first emerged in 1951 when [Alan Freed](https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/alan-freed), a Cleveland radio host, used it to describe the R&B music he played on the station. Taking the music that he found to be growing in popularity, Freed hosted the first-ever rock’n’roll concert, called the Moondog Coronation Ball. Freed’s music taste quickly became well known and he took his radio show to New York where he could be heard in all the major cities across the country. Billboard magazine would later call him “the undisputed king of radio programming.”

At the same time, in a little recording studio in Memphis, Sam Phillips was testing an unconventional business model. Rather than seek out and record artists, he’d let anyone (literally, anyone) walk in and record. Musicians that no one else would record started seeing Phillip’s studio as a last-ditch opportunity.

Phillips loved music; he loved the imperfection of it. He didn’t want flawless pop artists to come through his studio. He wanted to hear deeper, more human, emotional music. He wanted to discover genuinely unique talent.

And it was with this open mindset that Phillips would go on to be the first to record Elvis, B.B. King, Howlin’ Wolf, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Ike Turner, and Carl Perkins.

In the 1950s, Freed in New York, Phillips in Memphis, and other artists around the country came to the same realization — there was a new underground genre emerging and it drew inspiration from R&B, Blues, and Country.

The stage was set for this new type of sound to take to the airwaves. In the next decade, rock’n’roll became the ‘pop’ music of the time, first gaining traction with the emergence of Elvis Presley, the King of Rock’n’Roll. Other artists also began to grow in popularity, people like Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, and Little Richard.

By the 60s, rock’n’roll had already started to expand into a more general genre that we now identify as ‘rock’.

And cue [The British Invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Invasion).

As the American rock scene exploded, the rock movement began to spread worldwide. In particular, musicians in Britain pounced on the new art form. Soon bands like The Beatles, Gerry & the Pacemakers, Freddie and the Dreamers, Animals, Rolling Stones, and the Yardbirds had found their own niches.

As with all great genres, rock began to cultivate several sub-genres. In the late 60s and early 70s, we had psychedelic rock (think Pink Floyd), glam rock (think David Bowie), roots rock (think The Eagles), and heavy metal.

The late 70s to 80s, we see punk rock emerge with bands like the Ramones, Sex Pistol, and the Clash. Alternative and grunge rock groups also appear, such as the Pixies, My Bloody Valentine, and Nirvana.

Today, rock continues to change. Popular today are pop rock and indie rock, but there are up-and-coming bands around the world with their own take on rock music.

Although rock has evolved a lot since the 50s, it has kept a similar format. Usually, it has 4/4 time signature, 3–5 band members, features the electric guitar, drums, bass, and keyboard, and the lyrics typically center on romantic love, social issues, or political themes.

Rock may come in all shapes and forms, but, as Elvis shares in the quote above, you always “can’t help but move to it”. 😎🎶

### **Deep Dive**

## **Music Has Changed, And So Has How We Listen**

Over the decades, music has evolved to fit (and in many cases, mold) the culture of the time. But how does *how* we listen affect *what *we listen to? From vinyl, to cassettes, to CDs, to downloading, to streaming… have these transitions changed the music experience?

### **The Story**

## **Think it, Build it, Ship it.**

It was 1997.

Danny rode his skateboard down the middle of the street with his boombox blaring. An old man on the street corner gave him a dirty look. Danny turned the volume up on one of his favorite Rage songs, “Bulls on Parade.”

The lyrics echoed through the streets. He laughed to himself as the old man kept staring. He was too busy skating to notice the car trailing behind him.

Danny reached his house, leapt up and popped the board into his hand in the middle of the street. The car behind him screeched to a halt and the horn sounded. It was the first time he noticed it.

He waved to apologize but the driver waved him over.

“I could’ve killed you!” shouted the driver.

Danny rolled his eyes. He lived in a small town and the driver looked familiar. Here we go… he thought. “Sorry!” He started to walk away.

“No come here!” shouted the driver. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you. I hear you design website home pages. How much would you charge?”

Danny sighed. He didn’t want to do another website. The money was good, but the only reason he’d done the others was to see what it was like to make one.

“I don’t know,” Danny said.

“C’mon. Tell me a price.”

Danny decided to say the wildest number he could to make the man say no. “$5000.”

The man studied him and grinned. “You got gumption, kid. Deal! My restaurant is on the corner of 7th and Elm. Meet me there this Saturday at Noon.” He drove away.

Danny couldn’t believe it, he was in business.

Napoleon Hill famously said, “Your big opportunity may be right where you are now.” Here was the young man’s big opportunity — right in the middle of the street…

# Why Blockchain Conferences Will Be Key To Mass Adoption Of This New Technology

## 

Last year, I dragged one of my longtime business partners to a local cryptocurrency conference in Los Angeles.

He loved the amazing speakers and great companies, but he was shocked by how small and low-budget the event was. Because the crypto space is young, many crypto gatherings are still relatively unprofessional and unorganized. But we’ve come a long way from the early days, when people brought their own lunches and sat around a table to talk about Bitcoin.

In order to change the conference landscape, my crypto company Hybridblock held 14 events in the last year alone — ranging from small meetups to conventions with 2,700 attendees — all over Asia. And our Hybrid Summit conference, [The Internet of Value](http://hybridsummit2018.com/), just wrapped up in Bangkok.

Our mission with these events is to educate people about blockchain, engage with local crypto communities, and showcase great companies and speakers. There really is an entry point for everyone: whether you’re a digital currency novice or a seasoned investor, you can walk away from these conferences with a tremendous amount of value.
> # There’s something magical about people coming together under one roof to learn, share, and get inspired.

Here’s why conferences are essential to mass adoption of blockchain technology.

### **Being at a crypto conference is a unique experience.**

Sure, it’s easier to watch a webinar from the comfort of your laptop. But there’s nothing quite like feeling the energy in the room, meeting people from all parts of the industry, and feeling excitement about the future.

Going to conferences teaches you things online classrooms simply can’t. By brushing shoulders with people in the same [physical space](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/technology/cryptocurrency-bermuda-malta-gibraltar.html), you gain a deeper understanding of who the players are, how the crypto space works and where it’s headed.

Conferences are an amazing melting pot of energy, and most are accessible to people from all walks of life. Whether you’re a beginner who wants to learn about digital currencies, a crypto enthusiast, or a blockchain entrepreneur hoping to raise capital, there’s a place for you to participate. At Hybrid Summit, we even had live translations for Thai, English, and Chinese, so language wouldn’t be a barrier to entry.

Although we rely on technology more and more, no machine will ever replace the need for human connection or harness the incredible energy created when like-minded people come together.

### **Conferences are also key to developing the crypto industry and spurring technological advancements.**

In such a young space, everyone is learning and maturing together. In-person events facilitate a vital exchange of ideas, and you never know what will come out of a conference. That speaker you meet, the concept you discover, or company you hear about can lead to something big.
> Major technological progress can stem from grassroots initiatives.

In every city — Los Angeles, Bangkok, Nepal, everywhere — the blockchain and crypto communities have small weekly meet ups. This local activity is the driving force behind mass adoption of the technology, so it’s beneficial to engage these groups and bring them together at conferences.

To appeal to everyone (from investors to government officials to individuals who just want to find out what blockchain is) our team offered an in-depth overview of the crypto scene at our latest conference.

Our agenda included many ways for people to absorb information: panels, breakout sessions, fireside chats, exhibit booths, private VIP areas, even a performance from a local Thai artist. I moderated a panel called, “Searching for the Next Unicorn.” And we organized an interactive session called “Blockchain Blitz” to cover the basics of blockchain in a gamified setting. Superstar speakers like Tom Lee and Cindy Chin also shared their insights on trading signals, regulation, pricing, altcoins, the ICO process, and the future of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Bringing together people and ideas in this way creates a cohesive community, committed to moving crypto to its next chapter.

### **Having so many people from around the world in one physical region is particularly valuable for a digital movement.**

Everyone benefits from the opportunity to network, make introductions, and find funding for projects. You can brush shoulders with industry heavyweights and pitch your idea to VCs you’d otherwise never have access to. Or you can meet your project’s next collaborator.

No matter what your goal going in is, you end up walking away from a good conference feeling happy, exhausted, and educated.

Each conference also has the potential to become the *de facto* center of the blockchain movement for that given moment in time. And depending on the region of the world you’re in, every conference is different. For example, HybridBlock is planning a big event in the Middle East for the end of the year. Unlike our conference in Bangkok, this one will be very sophisticated and luxurious, with a massive investor base of high network individuals looking to throw huge amounts of capital at projects.

Besides learning about the industry from experts, attending events can let you stay on the cutting edge of new developments and find partners to help you achieve your vision.

As the community becomes more cohesive, the crypto movement will only get stronger. And conferences are vital for building the momentum, relationships, and advancements necessary to reach mass adoption of blockchain technology.

# No One Wants To Eat Your Compliment Sandwich

## 

Have you ever eaten a compliment sandwich?

You know what I’m talking about. Sandwiching a piece of negative feedback between two pieces of unrelated positive feedback — between two compliments.

Somewhere, in some corporate training manual or some class on business communications, this idea of the compliment sandwich was created. The idea was that people would be more receptive to constructive criticism if it was sandwiched it in between two compliments — Never mind that compliments are playing the role of the bread and not the middle of the sandwich…which is usually what we name sandwiches after.

I’ve been on the receiving end of who knows how many and I didn’t necessarily think it’s that tasty of a sandwich. In fact, for most people, the compliment sandwich doesn’t actually make you more receptive to criticism. It just leaves them confused. Think about your own response. One minute they’re saying nice things about you, the next their insulting you, then back nice things again.

You don’t know if you’re about to get fired or if you’re going to get a promotion.

Thankfully, there’s a better dish to serve than the compliment sandwich. As I wrote about in [*The Myths of Creativity](https://amzn.to/2vD1bMz)*, the creative geniuses at Pixar have figured out a way to deliver criticism that actually works. And that’s important because they’ve got to deliver a LOT of criticism in the process of making a movie — a process that Ed Catmull described as “going from suck, to non-suck.”

Pixar borrows their technique from the world of improvisational comedy. If you ever take an improv class, you’ll learn that the first rule is to always say “Yes, and.” You’re always supposed to be building off of your fellow actors, and never telling them no. Even if you disagree, you’re always building.

At Pixar, they call it “plussing.” The way plussing works is that if you give a criticism, you also have to give a plus — a suggestion for how to fix the criticism you just pointed out. Then, after the issue has been discussed, the person on the receiving end has freedom to accept or reject the suggestion.

The beauty of plussing is that it doesn’t blunt the constructive criticism. It allows someone to hear what’s going wrong. But the plus gives them an opportunity to improve it. Plussing is not just tearing people down. Instead, it sends a subtle message. It’s says, “I care so much about the project and about you and about getting this right that I can’t **not**point out his flaw that I see…but I’m also going to try my hardest to help you.”

We’re really good at criticism. What’s harder to get through is that we care and we want to help. A compliment sandwich doesn’t serve up that message. So stop serving those sandwiches.

Start giving people a plus.

# The 1 Leadership Skill Everybody Overlooks

## 

There are several key leadership skills all great CEOs possess: honesty, humility, empathy, the ability to delegate. Smarts.

I’ve been blessed to work with, and for, a variety of leaders who possess these skills. [CEOs](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-writing-creatively-every-day-has-made-me-a-better-ceo-c719add3ba8c) of Fortune 500 companies. Editors of small Oregon newspapers. Today, I lead my own company — [BookBaby](https://www.bookbaby.com/), the nation’s eminent self publishing services company — but in developing and honing my personal leadership style, I’ve studied the people I’ve worked for in the past, analyzing what, exactly, made them so effective. What accounts for their ability to inspire, unite, *create*?
> **The answer I return to time and time again stems from what on the surface may seem like a surprising source: their ability to tell great stories.**

**Storytelling** is the most underrated tool in business. It’s certainly proved the most impactful tool in my management career. In fact, I believe that in order to be a truly great leader, you need to be able to tell great stories.

It’s unlikely you can run a successful, durable business otherwise.

## **Simply put, stories inspire.**

To tell great stories is to convey the intangible, articulate the ineffable, and, yes, inspire the dejected. This is because great stories revolve around people — who they are, what they do, why they’re important. Telling stories about your employees, for your employees, can be a powerful way of engaging with them.

Consider how much more impactful it is during an all-hands meeting to replace vague praise — “Good job on that quarterly report, Karen!” — with specific praise in the form of an engaging narrative: “Karen helped this new romance author achieve her dreams for her first book, starting with suggesting book editing, then with helping her understand why eBooks are preferred for romance readers. Now, she’s selling thousands of books on Amazon. Outstanding work, Karen!”

This is backed up by science. A large 10-year, 100,000-person study conducted by HealthStream asked employees what they need most from their employers. Respondents with the highest morale reported that their managers were effective at singling them out for recognition, often by way of telling stories about the great work they’d done.

## **Stories help teams and organizations bond.**

Speaking of science, Uri Hasses of Princeton University once conducted a study in which he analyzed brain activity in audiences as they listened to a speaker tell a story. He compared their brain activity to that of the speaker. He found that both the speaker and the listeners’ brains were operating and engaging on similar wavelengths when the story was being told, even though just one person was producing language — the others were merely consuming it.

What this proves is telling a great story is quite literally a means of connection, which means it can double as a way to [foster cohesion](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-making-your-employees-feel-valued-is-a-good-business-decision-d303a02abbd4) around a mission, a process, or a culture.

## **Storytelling is the best medium of communication.**

The best leaders I’ve worked for have articulated who they are and what’s important to them through stories.

To lead effectively, one must be identifiable as a real person. You must be relatable, approachable, and trustworthy. Telling stories about yourself or your experience is a great way to make yourself known like this.

Stories prove powerful in explaining impersonal things, too. Especially when it comes to conveying your views on delicate issues such as diversity, inclusion, or some controversial new strategy — explanations which require nuance, subtly, definitions of ideas and feelings which are inherently hard to define — stories almost *always* prove more effective than PowerPoint slides or Excel sheets.

## **That said, telling great stories is harder than you think.**

In his landmark book, *The Tipping Point*, Malcolm Gladwell identifies a key ingredient of telling great stories called, “The Stickiness Factor.” He defines The Stickiness Factor as “the quality that compels people to pay close, sustained attention to a product, concept, or idea.”

So what kinds of stories are “Sticky”? They’re the ones that prove:

* **Tangible and succinct.** No management-speak is ever wanted or needed.

* **Full of metaphors and analogies.** Strong, image-invoking language adds impact and broadens context.

* **Full of emotion.** Emotion drives many peoples’ decisions. Don’t be afraid to appeal to both the logical and emotional parts of the brain.

* **Surprising!** Want to make your stories *really* sticky? Include a plot twist or surprise. Studies show surprise triggers the release of adrenaline in the brain, which enhances memory formation.

At the end of the day, not everyone will be an incredibly engaging storyteller. It’s harder for some than it is for others. Yet the best way to improve — other than lending credence to the advice above — is somewhat simple: *start listening.*
> # The biggest barrier to telling stories at work is not having stories to tell.

Tomorrow’s leaders need to start collecting their own stories today. You never know when something teachable and memorable will happen to you. When it does, write it down, and file it away.

Who knows? Your next great story — along with the next, more impactful chapter of your leadership career — is likely waiting to be told.

# This Life Skill is More Vital to Your Happiness Than Any Other

## This Life Skill is More Vital to Your Happiness Than Any Other

### “While the valiant might lose many, many times, the object of the valiant is to persevere until victory.” — Eric Greitens

Here’s a harsh life truth that you’ll never hear in your formative years — there is a very high probability you will not discover what you truly want to do when you’re young. The life you want — the one that will bring you equanimity, joy and splendor — will reveal itself to you gradually throughout the course of your life.

This test of time will occasionally be glorious, and it will also challenge you to your core. Your quest to find yourself will lead you into hobbies, schools, jobs and relationships you couldn’t have imagined when you were young.

If it seems that things are taking “too long,” know it won’t be out of lack of desire or joy for life. It will take you time to learn what job, career, hobby or activity you will *choose *to fill your schedule. That thing that combines your passion with determination and a track record that says — *I’m good at this. I know it. And so does everyone else.*

That’s fine. In this age of “winning,” life is surely not won in just one month or one year. The journey of success is as old as time. Those who continue to grow in intellect, who search for knowledge, who *choose *to be lifelong learners, who never, ever, ever give up on finding happiness and success will win. And victory, or success, or fulfillment, however you want to name it, is defined and determined by you.

It always will be.

## The Good, The Bad and What’s Next
> # “Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th.” — Julie Andrews

No matter how much our digital, vastly interconnected world continues to push the limits of social judgment, pressure and identification, it simply won’t matter if you resist these temptations, and allow your mind to control your destiny. From there, once you’ve forged your plan, determined what it is you want and endlessly worked to become great at that thing — continue to keep doing it for all your days in this world.

That is a blessing. It’s a gift. You’ll only know it once you’re living it.

Don’t get caught up in trying to have things all figured out at once. The beauty of your life’s journey is that you’ll learn through the process of elimination what you truly love, and what isn’t worth your time. Through opportunities, simply by showing up and expressing a hearty interest, you’ll learn what inspires, motivates and lights the fire inside of you.

You’ll also learn what leads you to boredom, what frustrates you and what you know you struggle with learning and grasping. You’ll learn what you’re destined NOT to do. This is absolutely as important, if not more important, than what you love most. The sooner you discover this, the less time you’ll spend in pain, anxiety and hurt. You’ll avoid wasted time. And spend your time on the good stuff.

## The Thing is The Thing
> # Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements and impossibilities: It is this, that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. — Thomas Carlyle

Let me preface the rest of this piece with this very important statement:

Perseverance is sometimes mistaken. To never give up when you’re doing the wrong thing is foolish. Only a crazy person would continue doing the same wrong thing over and over again expecting a positive and different result. That, as the cliche goes, is the definition of insanity.

So it’s reasonable to say that perseverance is all about finding *your *right thing. Doing you and continuing through both the good times and bad. Adversity, setbacks and doubt will be no match when you believe in yourself and you understand that the “long game” is the only one worth playing. The instant gratification quick-win scheme you’re being sold is for the foolish and naive.

One of the beautiful things about perseverance is the more you buy-in to this all-powerful value, the more your thought about the beauty of life evolves. Life is magnanimous. You start to believe this and have this revealed to you once you become more optimistic about continuing to forge forward through the good times and the bad.

Speaking of evolution, I thought a fantastic example about one of the most famous figures in history was well suited for this piece. Most people know of Charles Darwin as the man who helped to establish the theory of evolution, which spoke about natural selection and where the species of life came from. Few realize just how long it took the man to get to the point of putting his work out for public consumption.

*On the Origin of Species* was published in 1859 by Charles Darwin when he was 50 years old. 50! Don’t be too harsh on yourself when you’re a little less than famous at the age of 28! Darwin traveled the world as a young man during his early-mid 20s, gathering much of the information he needed to form the basis of his theory.

Still, he had his own doubts. He had doubts on what others would think of his “radical” new scientific research. The man was far ahead of his time and skeptics were everywhere. But he believed passionately in what he was doing and he kept moving forward.
> Darwin’s five-year voyage around the world on HMS Beagle, which ended in 1836, provided him with invaluable research that contributed to the development of his theory of evolution and natural selection. Concerned, however, about the public and ecclesiastical acceptance of his deeply radical idea, he did not present his theory on evolution until 1858… The next year, [Darwin published his seminal work](https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-charles-darwin), “The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection.” Source: History Channel

Over 20 years after he made his way around the world, Darwin finally entered the spotlight. He loved nature. But he didn’t know where it would lead him. The man spent the bulk of his years following his voyage around the world writing on geology! It took him a while to find his thing.

Darwin continued to advance his hypothesis and seek worldly acceptance throughout the latter stages of his life. As the years passed, his research on evolution began to be accepted as fact by society. Charles Darwin meticulously researched something he was passionate and fascinated by, and persevered at a later age to advance a revolutionary breakthrough in biology.

## Know Who You Are So You Can Rise
> # You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. — Maya Angelou

In my own life, I’ve learned to grow and persevere against both personal and professional adversity. I’ve had my heart broken. I pressed forward and found the woman of my dreams. I’ve been rejected from publications where I’d like my writing. I’ve kept writing and found ones I love to write for. I’ve been fired from jobs. I picked myself up, dusted myself off, and dared to find the next opportunity.
> **Does this sound like you?**

I’ve used these moments as life-changing turning points. It’s driven me to become a bestselling author and family man. I forge forward every day, sometime in big steps, sometimes in small steps, to build a life I can be proud of, firmly on the foundation of what matters most to me.

Fame? Fortune? 450,000 Instagram followers or a millionaire founder of a super-successful tech startup? These lofty aspirations and titles are yours if you declare that you want to do them and continue working toward them each day with dedication, intelligent work and perseverance. Just know you should take your time. Know that even if this is what you want, it’s not going to happen right away. It may not reveal itself at age 19.

And that’s just fine. Life is more fun that way. There’s simply nothing as invigorating as continuing to get to know yourself, your growth as a woman or man, and the lifelong process of self-discovery that will lead you to love, happiness and stretching the limits of what you ever could have imagined was possible. Keep going and find yourself on this remarkable journey called life.

# Real Thought Leadership Breaks Down to This 1 Thing&#58;

## 

Thought leadership isn’t a race.

It’s not about who can share the most content on the most platforms in the least amount of time. Being heavily active in your industry doesn’t inherently make you a thought leader—not even close.

Real thought leadership revolves around one thing:
> # Providing your audience with quality content.

## Quality content is what separates real thought leaders from wannabes.

Pick any major industry and think of the outright leader (or leaders) in that space.

Whoever you thought of came to mind for a reason. They could be your greatest inspiration or your biggest competitor — or in some cases, both. Either way, they had an effect on you—otherwise you wouldn’t have thought of them.

I guarantee that person is contributing valuable content to their industry on a consistent basis

Maybe they write opinion pieces for major media outlets or live-chat their customer base on social. Maybe they dedicate one month every year to keynote speaking. Maybe they’re always on industry-related podcasts.

Regardless, everyone knows they’re leading the charge because of the quality and consistency of content they put out.

If you want to be on that level, you need to do the same.

### Quality = Unique | Valuable | Useful

Regardless of *how* you choose to contribute to your industry, your content needs to be unique, valuable and useful.

If what you put out doesn’t provide some sort of value—something your audience can use immediately or can’t get anywhere else—it’s a complete waste of time.

Think about it: how much content do you sift through every day? How many times have you deleted an email before opening it, scrolled past an article after reading the title or stopped listening to a podcast because you got bored of it and wanted to listen to something else?

You do those things when content isn’t unique, valuable or useful.
> So what makes you think your audience won’t do the same to you?

Whatever your industry, there are thousands—potentially hundreds of thousands—of people publishing millions of content pieces every single day. And every single one of those pieces is competing for consumer attention. If you want to be a thought leader you need to stand out — plain and simple.

You do that by publishing valuable, useful and unique insight as often as possible.

And if you’re wondering, *“Where the hell am I gonna come up with enough content to do that?”* don’t worry—it’s a lot easier than you think.

## Just share what you know.

This is something my mentor [Nicolas Cole](https://medium.com/@nicolascole77) constantly preaches here at [Digital Press](http://www.digitalpress.com).

Part of our philosophy is to help CEOs, founders, c-suite execs share what they know through executive writing. The goal is to establish them as thought leaders in their space through quality content—content that comes directly from client experience.

At the end of the day, your audience wants to learn from you—that’s it. If you’re an executive or a CEO or a serial entrepreneur, people want to know *how* you did it. They want to know what they need to do in order to get to that place.

### So teach them.

Tell them about the worst mistake you made as a founder, or about the time you landed your biggest client. Teach them skills you’ve learned along the way. Show them what it’s like to walk in your shoes, and how they can do the same thing with the right approach.

Too many wannabe thought leaders take another route. They try to advertise their company, brand, product or service, flaunt their “expertise,” and make people pay for the rest.

It’s entirely counterintuitive to everything you’re trying to accomplish.

People know when they are being sold to. The minute they feel that’s happening, they’re going to tune you out—remember: you’re competing for consumer attention. At the end of the day, they don’t *need* you—there are plenty of other resources they can pull from.

### Thought leadership is an extremely simple concept:

People follow people adding value.

Ask yourself if the content you’re about to publish adds value to your industry. If so, share what you know for free. And do it as much as possible.

The next time someone thinks of your industry, you’ll come to mind.

# The Right Way To Shock New Hires

## The shock I’m talking about isn’t the trauma-inducing kind. Although it might be to some.

![Photo by [rawpixel](https://unsplash.com/photos/v1VB91uuyaE?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/hire?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*lrqGH1l-0NDHCTVAyrXhhA.jpeg)*Photo by [rawpixel](https://unsplash.com/photos/v1VB91uuyaE?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/hire?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

The shock I’m talking about is the kind that helps new hires at startups become acquainted with a venture’s cultural urgency.

Set by the founder(s), this urgency is driven by one ever-present idea: We need to survive in the market long enough to achieve product/market fit.

While this idea is often communicated in terms of runway length or the proximity the next investment round, its implications aren’t usually felt as acutely by staff as by the founders. That’s not likely to change.

However, the founders can influence urgency in a different way.

## Urgency, Valuing Time & Rate of Learning

Every decision, experiment and dollar spent influences how long a venture remains in the market. For that reason, most founders think about urgency in terms of results. The number of conversions from marketing campaigns, deals closed by the sales team or product updates shipped.

And this is almost the right way to frame urgency.

However, it falls short because it doesn’t take into account two factors that are unique *and* different for every hire. First, how they value time and second, their rate of learning.

Not knowing about these two factors for each new hire usually means a founder’s call for urgency will be misunderstood or seem to fall on deaf ears. Even if the new hire’s desire is to respect the founders’ expectation to be (more) urgent.

And this is why I think urgency is a product of how someone values time and their rate of learning.

Assuming a new hire buys into the founder’s vision, they will arrive wanting to make an impact. If they think achieving their first milestone quickly equates to six months and their rate of learning is slow then it’s fair to say their impact will be (very) low.

This usually unfolds with the new hire investing four to six months in pursuing one or two key activities. These big bang efforts draw down on company capital, come with stories of how they worked at previous organisations and promise learnings upon the final milestone being achieved.

In contrast to this worse case scenario, a new hire is quick to set up a framework that validates hypotheses of the ways things are done today and another set of experiments to move the dial forward in the first 30, 60 and 90 days.

Implicit with the latter hire is a test and learn approach to cast fresh eyes on how business is done today. They are also focused on creating momentum in their job area. This is also inherently more cost-effective because they can course correct as they learn.

## Urgency Math

Here’s the rough method I use to assess each new hire.

Urgency = Value of Time + Rate of Learning assuming that:

* Perfect urgency = 20 (i.e. that of the founder)

* Value of time is a measure between 0 and 9

* Rate of learning is a measure between 0 and 9

* New hire will never eclipse the founder in terms of urgency

* Measurement is taken 4 times during a [12 week paid audition](https://philhsc.com/paid-auditions-playbook/)

A solid new hire might score 7 on valuing time and 8 for their rate of learning based on what they say in the interview process. 7 + 8 = 15, the urgency score. They will also score similarly during each checkpoint of a paid audition.

Measuring urgency over time is important. Think of it as a lead indicator of how consistently urgent the new hire will be.

This is a framework and providing you apply it consistently, the results will be helpful. But don’t overthink it.

Be concerned if a new hire consistently scores below 10. Be impressed if they score above 14 on average on a paid audition.

The first, worse case scenario hire would score well below 10 on average across the paid audition. And they probably shouldn’t survive the paid audition.

## Why shock?

Because people joining ventures, who come from a large company or government roles, have lost touch with the value of time and money. Their roles have often driven them to become a custodian of a function or department and less of a business builder.

That will sound harsh, but for the most part, it’s true.

This is not to diminish their work experience, network or skill set. They are important. But the consequence of being a custodian, managing budgets that don’t directly affect their hip pocket and investing time in large organisation politics is a divorce away from the two lifebloods of startup ventures, time and capital.

## Two tests

The first test focuses on time. More specifically, it is designed to (re)acquaint a new hire with the value of time.

The question is how much momentum will the new hire create each week in the first four weeks? In other words, you want to see how much the new hire can learn as quickly as possible.

So, ask them, ‘What sort of experiments do you plan to run to create momentum in your new role in the next 30 to 90 days?’

Learning comes from experimentation. And at the heart of experimentation is methodical testing, listening and observation.

Effective new hires are quick to frame hypothesis and sense check them with existing team members. Soon afterwards they present a plan to start testing. Within days they will be launching experiments and feeding results back to you and the team.

This test is not at the expense of a new hire getting settled, asking questions or understanding their new environment. The point is solid new hires do this and start experimenting very early in their tenure. I’ll also point out that this test is for startups. Parallel processing like this soon after someone joins a large organisation is difficult.

The ‘money test’ comes second.

This test is designed to (re)acquaint the new hire with the value of a dollar.

Give the new hire $50 and tell them that’s their stationary budget for the next six months.

They can go anywhere they want. Target, Officeworks, anywhere.

They will return with less than they expected and if this surprises them, the exercise was effective. This is particularly useful with hires who have just come from a large organisation where items like stationary aren’t usually given a second thought.

You can extend the money conversation by showing them [how founders think about money](https://philhsc.com/how-founders-should-think-about-money/) which I wrote about recently.

## The founder/new hire two-way street

While these tests are useful, the paid audition or probation period is the one time when new hires and founders can determine ‘fit’ with little blowback if it doesn’t work out.

While founders don’t want to be overly prescriptive so as to observe curiosity and industriousness, there is a need to determine ‘fit’ as quickly as possible.

Similarly, new hires don’t want to assume too much about the company they’ve just joined and they need time to observe, learn and reflect.

The point here is that while founders can observe the activities and actions of new hires, it takes conversations to unpack what they are learning, even if they are displaying extreme urgency. Don’t welcome them, set them tests or objectives and then check in with them in a few weeks.

Schedule time to speak with them at least weekly. Encourage them to ask even the most obvious question and invite them to query you on the hypotheses that lead you as the founder to make the decisions that have led the business to where it is today.

It will make the inevitable exercise of sizing up one another more transparent and productive.

## One last thing…

Hiring is difficult. We all get hiring decisions wrong from time to time and the financial and emotional consequences of those wrong bets can devastate a startup.

Experience tells me that urgency is a capability that startup hires need to possess to be successful. As a founder, the big idea of this post is to have a framework to assess urgency and the best way to put that framework into action is via [a paid audition](https://philhsc.com/paid-auditions-playbook/).

# My Table of Values&#58; This is Who I am in 22 Bullets

## A result of reading 100 books a year for 12 years & never letting being shy get in the way

![](1*-JdgZ0jRL9yfcoe7gJjg-w.png)

I’ve kept a table of my most important values for the past 9 years. I updated it often whenever I realize something that is true and important for me. 
It explains who I am extremely well and fast, so if you want to get to know me, here we go!

### Preface, the things that shaped my worldview most are:

1. I listen to ~100 books a year and have done so for the past 12 years.

1. I have an extreme bias towards action, especially when it’s outside my comfort zone, so I tend to have extreme experiences ([stolen laptop example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6frgmNjMX8), [building 36 products in college example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZs2Q08o9LI), [Forbes example](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-anti-startup-startup-podcast/id1403196193?mt=2&i=1000415452229)). These extreme experiences often result in me learning new things about myself that inform my values.

1. I love thinking about philosophy to understand myself, the world, and the meaning of life. I take time to learn what gives me energy and what makes me happy.

1. I won the lottery when it comes to parents, siblings, and friends.

## My Table of Values

1. Love is one of the most important things in life, and is one of the only things that, the more you give of it to others, the more you have to give — It is like fire, flowing from one candle to another without diminishing the original flame (in this case, enhancing it).

1. There is a way around every obstacle. All systems for example, have been erected by and are governed by people. As a result, there is a way of getting around any rule within a human ran system by contacting the person at the top of the governance structure and convincing them to help you or give you a special exception.

1. I believe, unwaveringly, that I am capable of doing anything I set my mind to — even things most people consider impossible, given enough time.

1. I believe that I have personal agency and the power to change the world and the situations around me. [1]

1. Going outside your comfort zone is a virtue and leads to growth. [“You cannot fail unless you quit”; “Your success in life can be measured by the number of hard conversations you have”]

1. Economics is not a zero sum game. [2]

1. I can [Create value](https://youtu.be/qBvQSjqowfg?t=57s) in the world.

1. Education and self improvement are a virtue.

1. Personal growth is a virtue. Any activity that makes me a better or a more capable person advances all three of my top goals (listed below), and thus is greatly encouraged.

1. Using my time unproductively is an anti-virtue. [3]

1. If, in a short unit of time I can significantly improve someone else’s life, do it. This usually happens in the form of helping someone adopt a habit, keeping them accountable, or introducing them to new resources or information.

1. Decision making necessitates information. The more perfect one’s information the better one’s decision making (for the most part).

1. Each person has a model of the universe in their brain. To make a great model/map I need to gather a lot of good information, then I need to organize this information into the most correct form possible. An excellent extrapolate-able model with little data (.SVG) is usually superior to a lot of data that is organized in good static form (.JPEG). Start by crafting an excellent model and then update that model constantly. Fill data into the model to flesh it out. [4]

1. Knowledge is like a tree. Building a great trunk will allow me to add branches easily. Once I have a trunk and branches adding leaves is easy and requires little memory because they just fit in place. If I don’t have a branch at a certain spot it will be almost impossible to retain a new leaf of information in that space. This is why re-reading books is sometimes extremely useful. Learning is all about growing my tree, improving my model of the universe, and iterating on this table of values.

1. I can take on groups and win: Just because a group thinks something and I think something different it does not mean that I am wrong and the group is right. Just because a group is competing against me as an individual it does not mean that the group will win.

1. If you smile at people (usually) they will smile back.

1. The world is big and diverse but in practice it is now small due to technology.

1. People by default are good and will help me if I ask.

1. I am one of the happiest people I have ever met (though happiness is difficult to measure). My hypothesis is that this is because of how much love I regularly shared with others, how frequently I feel gratitude and appreciation, that I’ve been able to overcome and achieve WHILE having struggles, due to how I feel and react when I do not meet goals I set for myself, because I prioritize self growth, because I feel such strong personal agency, and because I’ve turned smiling at strangers into a standard way of being, and because of my parents and siblings. In other words, due to most of the philosophies on this list.

1. When in real life I’m presented with two choices I need to decide between, there are almost always a third and fourth option that are also accessible (and sometimes more desirable), they just take way more work to achieve (and often luck). Most people **don’t realize** these extra options exist because of **how much work and luck** they would take to achieve. 
If I go for the third and fourth option, **often they will not pan out**, but due to statistics and how luck works, sometimes they will. So, sometimes instead of needing to decide, I need to **think outside the box, and then execute**.

1. In the case of really big decisions, working for the third and fourth option, even if I achieve them 1 out of 100 times can result in massive, life-changing wins.

1. **Goals: **I believe that the things that will bring me the greatest happiness and satisfaction in life as a whole are:
 A. Making myself the best person I can be, and raising kids who are greater than me.
B. Maximizing the love in my life — with my partner, family, friends etc.
C. Creating as much value as possible in the world and elevating the collective quality of life worldwide, most likely by founding technology companies in the short term and mentoring in the long term.
These three things are my top goals in life.

I wrote most of another article (which is gigantic)on how I came to these values. But I wanted to keep this short. If you message me I can share the longer article with you.

**Notes:**

[2] Economics is not a zero sum game? Will write a follow up post to explain this if I get enough requests for it.

# Why Historians Make the Best Innovators

## Why Historians Make the Best Innovators

Historiography is the study of historical writing. It’s the process of historians studying the works of other historians to understand not *what *happened but *how* people saw the events as, or soon after they happened.

The big question in historiography is not the details of the event, but how people around the event thought, and to what extent they were influenced by their home nation-states. The implications around determinism and how we learn from the mistakes of our ancestors are profound, and it’s worth exploring how the process of historiography, and the study of history in general can benefit us today.

## Historiography is the study of humanity observing itself.

Imagine if all of humanity was one organism. Historiographers in this organism would be our capacity to self reflect and observe our growth over time. They’d be our sense of spirituality.

Like philosophy, history gets a bad rap. Philosophy is about meaning. It’s about unifying the torrents of data that we’re inundated with, and parsing it into meaningful world-views which give our actions direction and weight.

In this respect, I firmly believe philosophy is a science. It isn’t a clean science like physics. Where eternal, consistent laws appear to exist — if only we could figure them out.

In philosophy we’re the atoms and understanding their interactions is messy because we’re messy. Because we’re not indifferent, consistent atoms. We’re complex, and we don’t fully understand ourselves, and this makes variable isolation and systemized scientific study challenging.

Like philosophy, history is often misunderstood. History is commonly seen as studying the past, so we don’t repeat our mistakes in the present. There’s some merit to that definition.

But it falls apart once we observe that the present really isn’t like the past. New exponential technologies, AI, globalization — perhaps we’re too different from the humans of “history” to learn much from their actions.

I prefer the following definition of history. (I’m paraphrasing [Yuval Noah Harari from Sapiens](https://amzn.to/2KzWVGU) with this following piece. Buy the excellent book if you want more like it.)

![](1*J9SQ1JdVMe1pSB-jePs1zg.jpeg)

## Charting the Seas of Time and Humanity

13.7 billion years ago, the Big Banged and our universe was formed. The fundamental features of this event, and it’s underlying rules came to be known as physics.

300,000 years later, matter began forming into more complex structures, called atoms, which sometimes coalesced into molecules. The interactions of these new structures is known as chemistry.

About 10 billion years later, on a rock floating near a star — certain molecules began to form and evolve into complex structures known as organisms. The study of these organisms became known as biology.

Then about 70,000 years ago — certain descendents of these primeval organisms began forming complex social structures. Like organisms, these social structures evolved and mutated over time into new and exotic forms, forms we call civilizations. The study of these social structures over time is known as history.

## History is messy because it’s a derivative of every other science.

It has the most variables to contend with, which makes understanding true cause-and-effect very challenging. The question — is whether like physics, our cultures follow consistent rules over time i.e. the rise and fall of dynasties, or Marx theory of cultural evolution past capitalism.

These are theories, but the key here is whether it’s possible for a theory to be “correct” in the same sense as Einstein’s E=MC2 is “correct”.

My theory is that cultures do follow rules. While change over time may appear to be random or haphazard and not follow patterns. If you zoom far enough out, the logical fault-lines show up.

### Civilizations rise and fall constantly and most of them don’t show up in our history books (which ones are absent may vary by region i.e. The Silla Kingdom in the Koreas?).

In terms of biology, each of these civilizations can be seen as an experiment in culture, where some go extinct while others prosper. As with species — 99.9% of cultures that have ever existed are extinct, and most (again like with species) failed quickly and left little-to-no trace.

Our current Western culture will definitely leave a trace, but it’s simply another experiment in how humans can organize themselves through a common story to try and meet our collective needs more effectively.

Before I close off with how history relates to innovation, I want you to consider how remarkable it is that you can go up to some random person throughout the West, and share an almost identical understanding of the world with them immediately.

Sure you may disagree about which political party should be in power, or on some other small details of modern life. But the big things; the existence of law, ethical codes, the use of money, property, the structure of families. Our individual deviation from the common myth is really, quite small.

To summarize thus far — history is the science of studying ourselves as we experiment, evolve and change, and historiography is a neat sub-field of history in which historians study ancient historians to understand their viewpoints and philosophies as they relate to the events they experienced.

![](1*-0xPLwIWo-VycJJfDiI4FA.jpeg)

## Why Historians Make the Best Innovators

Innovation is the creation of new products (things) or services (outcomes) that better meet some need than existing alternatives.

As [Eric Von Hippel observed](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-user-innovation-revolution/) — innovation is primarily done by people solving their own problems.

This can result in fascinating products like the skateboard — originally made from taking the wheels off rollers skates and attaching them to a wooden board.

However systemic innovation, innovation that solves complex problems that go beyond individuals and impact society — is beyond most individual users.

While we’re all users of culture, it’s the historians that are on the cutting edge of understanding culture and therefore are the ones most likely to invent new solutions to age old, or more modern problems.

Historians see society as one of many implementations, and like an engineer study how to manipulate different pieces to create different reactions. They turn complex systems into complicated, but understandable ones.

Historians make sense of the world, and put it terms of facts and figure i.e. data which can be understood as telling a story. Historians are innovators because they’re experts on people, and experts on change, and innovation is just controlled change.

So, my recommendation is — if you want to change the world. Speak with someone who understands what it is you’re changing.

In conclusion, I want to say that my argument here is not specifically about historians. I just like them, and thought they made a good case. My point is that true systemic innovation requires diversity, and it seems like most people I’ve spoken with who are trying to innovate — are doing so with a nearly identical group of people.

You need the perspectives people from different cultural, professional, and idealogical backgrounds bring to create groundbreaking products, services, or solutions.

# E3&#58; The Greatest Gaming Event in the World

## 

Since high school, I have been an avid gamer. From 2009–2013 I played competitive Call of Duty and was fortunate enough to win 6 online seasons, where as little as 5,000 or as many as 60,000 teams competed over 3 months. Having lived on the east coast for the majority of my life I never considered flying to E3, which is hosted in Los Angeles every year. Despite this, I bought a ticket on the final day and booked a flight for the following week — currently live in San Francisco so it is easier.

Over the last few years, I have attended dozens of conferences and E3 is by far the best one I have attended. Never have I said to myself, “Wow, I cannot wait for a conference next year.” Those of you who are not into gaming are probably thinking, “No, thank you.” Therefore, let me explain why video games exist in the first place.

## Why Video Games Exist

My parents would tell you that buying me an Xbox growing up was a mistake. It is a waste of time, you don’t spend enough time outside, and you are letting video games consume you. Well, much like anything in life, you need moderation. Here are a few reasons people game:

### Escapism

![Watching Arena of Valor during a quick break](1*7VOaiTVh_jGiGf4BGwc9kA.jpeg)*Watching Arena of Valor during a quick break*

Video games allow you to enter a world where you live through an in-game character and you have a reset/restart button. Many people find the real world boring, frustrating or stressful. With video games, you are allowed to enter a world where you create what happens and you can become anything you wish to be.

### Entertainment

When you live a busy life, are suffering from an illness, or simply need a form of amusement that is not Netflix, playing video games can serve as a way to relieve stress and entertaining. If you fill your time with something that makes you happy, why not do it?

![Watching Fortnite outdoors via Battle Rig](1*C5g7IsW6iRU9xpjAknBNRw.jpeg)*Watching Fortnite outdoors via Battle Rig*

### Camaraderie and Community

![The crowd/line waiting to play Nintendo games](1*fcfx2bhvo25aQBbM3S0zCA.jpeg)*The crowd/line waiting to play Nintendo games*

Playing a team-based game such as Call of Duty, Fortnite, or League of Legends, allows you to have an online community and camaraderie between you and your teammates. When I played competitive Call of Duty I had group chats with my team, we scheduled time to play together and communicated frequently — similar to the friends I know in-person.

## What is E3?

![A picture outside of the South Hall before 70,000 people stormed Downtown LA](1*X_hhlDsAMWozMYHFHqcCag.jpeg)*A picture outside of the South Hall before 70,000 people stormed Downtown LA*

For those of you unfamiliar with what E3 is, it is the Electronic Entertainment Expo. It is essentially an e-trade show for the video game industry that allows video game developers, publishers, and gaming hardware companies to introduce their new products and innovations to the public. This could be via a press conference, live talk by industry experts, or walking the exhibition floors which hosted 200+ gaming companies.

Only until recently did E3 offer a gaming pass — which is what I purchased and will be sharing my perspective from — which allowed gamers to enter E3 talks and exhibition floors.

## Highlights of E3

Now that we know why video games exist and the reason for 70,000 casual gamers and fanatics attending E3, let’s cover some of the highlights. The three events that stood out to me the most was a panel on how videos games inspired HBO’s Westworld, the Epic Games feature of Fortnite on the exhibit floor, and the overall “Hollywood” production of E3

### “Revenge of the NPC: Video Gaming’s Influence on Westworld

![Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nelson, Creators of Westworld](1*h8sjaHBBJD6MldTQDgC2iQ.jpeg)*Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nelson, Creators of Westworld*

Like many of you reading this, I am a massive Westworld fan. Whenever watching I constantly question the difference between those who are conscious and lack emotion. When you dive into the show you start to question your own life and purpose. If you have not watched Westworld, I HIGHLY recommend you do. Since this was a panel with the two creators of Westworld — Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan — I will share a few points I found interesting:

* Before writing Westworld, Jonathan and Lisa completed a nine-month research period where they played video games and sourced for inspiration. Inspiration came from games like BioShock, Portal, Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, Halo 2, and other sandbox and open world games. Inspirations range from walking into a city in Skyrim to the concept of a stray and finding the bugs in Halo 2.

* They spoke about the construction of the park. Sweetwater is the PG version of a game. Even if you are a bad player you can have a good time here; or you can venture off to more dangerous missions. They started with the character Hector and the further out you go the harder it is to win. Geography discards the nature of your adventure and Hector allows a player to experience this by baking Hector into a lot of narratives.

* One major theme in Westworld is gamifying reality. The Man in Black is an expert and despite this, he continues to play. He is frustrated and wants a real experience that actually threatens his life — the Host in Westworld cannot harm you. It is not about having a steady stream of wins but having meaning within. You want a give and take world because playing God is too boring.

* We need to reinvent the meaning of “Video Games.” It is more about an experience than calling it a video game. Finished game &gt; beat game.

**Fortnite on the Exhibition Floor**

![A picture of me and a shark on a harpoon — used in-game to gather materials](1*ilu8fiMbahe_MBCaiU9VrA.jpeg)*A picture of me and a shark on a harpoon — used in-game to gather materials*

Fortnite is a free battle-royale game that made [$296m in the month of April ](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/24/17390004/fortnite-battle-royale-money-made-revenue-300-million-april-2018)despite giving it away for free. 100 players drop from the sky hunger games style, the map gets smaller, and players fight until a winner is crowned. Epic Games is the developer of Fortnite and I spent countless hours taking pictures with their props, videos of me flying and dancing, and playing fortnite.

![Me and E3 Gamers after winning a round of squads on Fortnite](1*5SJMbXElNZWITH3S0y_8iw.jpeg)*Me and E3 Gamers after winning a round of squads on Fortnite*

The first game I played was with 3 random gamers from E3 on Xbox One. We dropped at Anarchy Acres, my 3 teammates instantly died, I killed 3 players and the fourth got me. During game 2 a few of us died in the middle of the game and one survived. He made it to the final 7 and then fell off the map — which I have never actually witnessed. Game 3 was all business. The three people I was paired with were really good and we ended up winning the game and 2500 vbucks. The thrill of winning at E3 left me filled with adrenaline.

### Hollywood Production of E3

![Nintendos MASSIVE screen highlighting their games](1*_Z8609fLBaTxSb71OINAIg.jpeg)*Nintendos MASSIVE screen highlighting their games*

All of the major gaming companies — Epic Games, Bethesda, Nintendo, Activision, etc. — had massive layouts on the exhibition floor. Activision had a 2-hour wait to play Call of Duty Black Ops 4 and Nintendo had a 4-hour wait to play Pokemon. The size of the lines were mind-blowing and I was amazed at the ~1-200 ft TV Nintendo used to showcase their new games.

In all the conferences I have been to I have never seen such great effort to attract people to a booth. The floor was mostly for gamers and had exciting staff bouncing around and chatting you up before you play. I would call E3 the Disney World of video games. It was incredible.

**Industry Trends**

![DisplayLink VR — holding a machine gun](1*pZK3Pu5ox1i7UiB-oIE8-g.jpeg)*DisplayLink VR — holding a machine gun*

* **Augmented & Virtual reality** — Pokemon GO, Oculus Rift, DisplayLink

* **Inclusivity** — expose kids to the beauty of being different

* **Mobile gaming** — Nintendo, Warner Brother’s Interactive

* **Streaming** — currently reading up more on [LumberYard](https://www.gamedesigning.org/gaming/amazon-lumberyard/) (Amazon’s new game engine) and Twitch integrations

## Tips for attending

![I have never played Resident Evil but this was too much to resist](1*oBU0UhvBAFdZQE9LlA4jMA.jpeg)*I have never played Resident Evil but this was too much to resist*

1. Bring a small bag with a strap to avoid having to pay $10 to check your bag before entering the venue. If you land and need to, you are allowed to check 1 bag for $10.

1. Pack a reusable water bottle to refill while inside.

1. Bring a tote bag to carry all of your goodies! Alternatively, you typically get one when purchasing merchandise from a booth.

1. On day 1 the line to enter the exhibit hall is insane. I would go for an hour after it opens and hope for the best.

1. I do not recommend waiting in line to play games if it is longer than 30 minutes. Hardcore gamers will disagree but I refuse to wait 4 hours to play Pokemon.

1. Dress for LA warmth but also realize inside the exhibit hall will be a bit chilly so I recommend a fleece or pullover.

1. Do not eat from the dining halls. There are a lot of food trucks and restaurants around the venue. One night I walked to Colori Kitchen and had incredible Italian food.

1. Some attendees recommend hand sanitizer but there are bathrooms everywhere.

1. Book an AirBnB nearby and take a Lyft/Uber to the convention center. All of my rides were <$5 and to LAX was ~$20.

1. If you are there to game, great. If you plan to meet people, bring your business cards!

1. Try each of the two halls and then dedicate most of your time to one. I found the South Hall to me much more entertaining — varies on gaming interest.

1. Understand that while we game there are deals being done with developers, publishers, and industry experts all around the area. Some booths are very exclusive and invite-only but it makes sense — respect it.

These are a few of the tips for attending and I hope to give a new perspective next year from an Industry Pass! If you have any questions, send me an email: brendanbarbato@gmail.com

# Why You Need To Follow Your Passion, Even If It Means Sacrificing Everything

## 

I worked a number of terrible summer factory jobs back when I was in my late teens.

Even then, I was terrified of getting stuck in one of those factories for the rest of my life. Without fail, all the guys on the line had back, knee, and shoulder problems. They were bored and unhappy, and all they did was wear themselves down a little more each day. The only thing I knew was that I never wanted that life.

While the work was awful, there was a silver lining. Those factory jobs were a big part of my realization that I had to follow my passion.

I get bored very easily, and I can’t do much when I’m bored. It’s just impossible. And I knew I couldn’t live life being bored because I’d never get anywhere. I’d never be able to do the things that excited me and motivated me to get better.

Life is short. Why not do things you’re actually passionate about?

## **Passion is contagious, so it’s easier to become successful when you’re passionate about what you’re doing.**

You can always tell when someone loves what they’re doing. There’s a spark in them that’s hard to miss.

For some people, like me, it’s selling. For others it’s creating art, writing, crunching numbers. It can be anything, but when you meet someone who has that fire in them, you feel the warmth. You know they’re putting their heart and soul into it.

If you walk into a store and some guy starts trying to sell you socks with a fake grin and zero passion for what he’s doing, you probably aren’t buying any socks that day. But if the salesperson is beaming at you, showing you all kinds of different socks, and telling you stories about his personal favorites, then you’re buying socks. No doubt about it.

The truth is, it’s tough to get really good at something you hate or that bores you. It’s possible, sure. But it’s a lot easier to be successful when you’re waking up each morning ready to take on the world.

## **Following your passion prevents you from getting stuck.**

Think back to a job you had that you couldn’t stand. Maybe you’re reading this at said job.

You go to bed at night, get a full eight hours, and yet somehow you can’t get up in the morning. You just lay there staring at the ceiling and trying to gather the willpower to put your feet on the floor. Contrast that with the feeling you get before a trip to Paris. Your flight’s leaving at six in the morning, and you only snuck in four hours of sleep — but you’re wide awake and ready to rock ’n’ roll. You could run to the airport if you had to.

Why is that?

It’s because you have passion. You have [a goal](https://medium.com/@SamRusani/why-goal-setting-is-the-difference-between-success-and-failure-in-life-and-business-fe4bd5b5c57c). *You’re going to Paris.*

If something is dragging you down — whether it’s a job, school, or the people in your life — you have a problem. If you can’t get out of bed in the morning, something’s wrong.

Pursuing a passion keeps you from getting stuck in that rut. I saw a documentary on Armin van Buuren recently, and he claims that after 25 years in the studio making music, he still goes into every new session feeling like a child and looking forward to creating new sounds and samples. That’s someone with a passion.

Negative influences, toxicity, bad relationships — a passion will give you the energy to say no to all of that and keep yourself from becoming stuck.

## **If you want something you’ve never had, you must be willing to do something you’ve never done.**

![](1*VshPtRK_CuwrPzXOvzMmIA.jpeg)

Following a passion means making sacrifices. It often means less time with friends and family and fewer late nights on the town.

The simple reason is that you have to put in extra hours and extra work if you want to build something beyond your J-O-B (Just Over Broke). And those hours have to come from somewhere. Something you’re doing right now will have to be sacrificed to some extent if you want to change what’s happening in your life.

Look, not everyone wants to do that. Some people are perfectly happy making a bunch of money for someone else as long as they’re getting a big enough cut to pay their rent or take care of their family. They enjoy the stability, and there’s nothing wrong with that.

But entrepreneurial types have a greater drive to build and grow something. They see the massive gaps and opportunities, and they don’t want to miss out on them. Once you step into that life, you’re always on, always looking for opportunities because you can’t afford to miss out on them. You’ve made it to the island and burned the boat behind you. No going back.

Forging ahead requires sacrifices, but if you’re following your passion, I guarantee they’ll be worth it.

# How Much Are Meetings Really Costing Your Company?

## 

They’re not only boring your employees and colleagues to tears — meetings could be costing your company millions.

In fact, a [2014 study by Bain & Company](https://hbr.org/2014/05/your-scarcest-resource/ar/1) found that on average, senior executives are spending more than two days a week in meetings. Further, 15% of an organization’s time is spent on meetings, a number that’s increased steadily since 2008.

Time is a precious commodity in any business. Just how much of it are you wasting on useless meetings?

Across the United States, [over $25 million is wasted per day](https://www.inc.com/laura-montini/infographic/the-ugly-truth-about-meetings.html) on meetings that just aren’t necessary. Each year, this results in $37 billion thrown away on meetings that simply aren’t productive.

Companies like Amazon are taking steps to reduce the financial impact of meetings. [CEO Jeff Bezos employs an odd but effective strategy](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/jeff-bezos-surprising-meeting-strategy.html) to make sure meetings stay on task and purposeful. He applies a simple rule: Don’t plan a meeting in which two pizzas aren’t enough to feed everyone.

Over at LinkedIn, they’re combating useless meetings by virtually eliminating presentations, requiring instead that any materials in need of consideration be sent to all meeting participants 24 hours ahead of time. [CEO Jeff Weiner firmly believes](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-linkedin-s-ceo-eliminates-useless-meetings.html) meetings should only last as long as it takes to get business done.

So how can you quantify the impact meetings are having on your organization?

Harvard Business Review just released a handy online meeting cost calculator to easily estimate how much your meetings are costing you.

Sure, you can probably tell that at least some of your meetings last too long (your co-worker snoring into his clasped hands at the far end of the table was a good clue). Still, changing the culture of meetings can be challenging, especially if that’s just how some in your company feel it should be done.

But by [quantifying the actual cost of each meeting](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/this-mathematical-formula-optimizes-success-in-life-love-amp-career.html) and presenting to your colleagues a dollar figure all can understand, you can more persuasively advocate for shorter, less frequent and more effective meetings.

Check out [HBR’s Meeting Cost Calculator](https://hbr.org/2016/01/estimate-the-cost-of-a-meeting-with-this-calculator) to see how much you’re spending on meetings — and how much your organization could be saving, instead.

# ‘Delivering happiness’ is no longer enough when it comes to your employees

## Photo by Manasvita S on Unsplash

During my gap year, I took an internship in corporate finance at one of the biggest French companies. I didn’t care much about the work we were doing there, but I was content to work with great people, I had a decent paycheck, and plenty of time to enjoy Paris with my friends after work. I was happy, but I had no drive to do my best work, let alone stay with the company for the long haul.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, in early 2017, [my co-founder was diagnosed with cancer](https://www.fastcompany.com/90248033/what-i-learned-about-resilience-when-my-co-founder-got-sick). Where we previously shared the responsibility of Front’s future, I now needed to fill his shoes, be a strong leader for the team, and make Front successful — if not for myself and the team, then for him. I was more driven than ever, and I understood how critical my work was to the company’s future. I was extremely anxious, working an unhealthy amount of hours to balance his absence, and definitely not happy. My work had more meaning than ever before, but I wasn’t in the right state of mind to truly deliver the great work I was driven to do.

I’d be hard pressed to say which of these two moments I prefer. Other than wishing my co-founder didn’t have to fight cancer, I don’t regret **at all** going through the hard times of 2017, but the pain wasn’t sustainable and I was looking forward to more peaceful times. I guess I want to be happy yet live a meaningful life, and I think I’m not an isolated case.

I see two things happening at once, and I believe they’re related.

1. First, highly-educated, upper-middle class [young professionals are working more hours than before](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/). This is significant, since historically, those who could afford to work less would not pass on the opportunity.

1. At the same time, these same professionals are desperately searching for their identity and life’s purpose. Increasingly, [for better or worse](https://hbr.org/2018/11/9-out-of-10-people-are-willing-to-earn-less-money-to-do-more-meaningful-work), they are hoping to find themselves in their work.

Whether it is a feeling of being stuck in a [“bullshit](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/8/17308744/bullshit-jobs-book-david-graeber-occupy-wall-street-karl-marx) [job”](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/8/17308744/bullshit-jobs-book-david-graeber-occupy-wall-street-karl-marx), the appeal of [Effective Altruism](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Altruism/dp/1592409660), the popularity of podcasts like [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/), or the rates at which people quit to join non-profits or [flat-out stop working](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/when-love-what-you-do-pushes-women-to-quit/563537/), one thing is clear: many employees today aren’t content with a 9-to-5 job that earns a good living. They want more. They want to do something meaningful. And more often than not, this drives them to work themselves to anxiety and burnout.

When did this happen? My parents, aunts, uncles weren’t obsessed with finding meaning in their work. A [fascinating hypothesis](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/) is that this is the next phase of a long trend that went from workers asking for **jobs** in agrarian and early manufacturing economies, to baby boomers striving to build **careers** that would culminate with them being appointed VP, SVP or CEO of a big company, to the current workforce aching for a **calling**, a vocation, work that would finally be meaningful and fulfilling.

At face value, this shouldn’t be problematic. We are wired to search for meaning in our lives, and yet many of the traditional outlets for finding that meaning are declining. For Millennials and even Gen Xers, [the most common religion is no religion at all](https://religionnews.com/2018/12/10/religion-declining-in-importance-for-many-americans-especially-for-millennials/). People are [waiting longer to start families](https://www.axios.com/demographics-parents-age-birth-kids-global-fertility-rate-3ff7ab87-c23f-4080-9458-fc4e10552830.html). When we aren’t finding meaning from personal sources, the pressure to align the biggest part of our days (our work) with our life aspirations (its meaning) increases. In a sense, the belief that work is central to one’s identity and life purpose has emerged as a new religion of its own. What’s unclear though, is whether growth-seeking, profit-driven companies are even equipped to provide their employees with meaningful work.

## **Are companies up for the task? The case of happiness vs. meaning**

A short definition of happiness is the state in which someone’s current needs and desires are met. In other words, if you’re in no pain right now, you’re happy. While happiness is concerned with the present, meaning is a way to connect it to the future. Something is meaningful if, were it not for its existence, things would be **worse**. Meaning requires motivation, the belief that the status quo is imperfect and should be improved, and that it’s worth suffering today if it justifies making tomorrow better.

Therefore it might look like happiness and meaning are mutually exclusive: you need to be at least slightly uncomfortable with the current state of things to find the motivation to do something about it, which in turn makes the whole process meaningful to you. So are these really the only two options available? To either have a job with decent pay and good work-life balance, yet is unfulfilling; or to find meaningful work at the expense of your happiness?

I want to believe that companies can rise to the challenge and deliver both happiness and meaning — although I suspect that in many cases, it’ll be an “either/or” situation. As an individual, that’s what I want for myself, and as a CEO, that’s what I want my company to offer. There is so much upside if we can crack this nut. Of course there’s [employee engagement](https://theenergyproject.com/why-you-hate-work-2/), increased [productivity](https://hbr.org/2018/11/9-out-of-10-people-are-willing-to-earn-less-money-to-do-more-meaningful-work) and even [profitability](https://www.ey.com/gl/en/issues/ey-beacon-institute-the-business-case-for-purpose). I see this [at Front](https://frontapp.com/blog/2019/04/22/five-reasons-why-front-is-a-great-place-to-work/) where employees credit their high engagement with caring about our mission and understanding how their work impacts that mission. It certainly wouldn’t hurt if millions of people could live fulfilled lives in the process.

I want to spend a good amount of time this year understanding how companies can provide meaning and happiness to their employees. Those that don’t will lose every single employee they would otherwise want to retain, while those that do will be able to harness the drive of people who truly believe that their work matters. Follow me on my quest.

# 7 Things I Did When Things Got Slow As A Freelancer

## 

A friend sent me a photo today.

It was a reminder of a project I did back in 2012 or 2013. I was a “Freelancer” at that time. Which really meant I was just doing whatever I could to make money. I was fresh out of school and attempting to build a book of business.

The problem was… I had barely had any.

When things got slow, I decided to simply start doing experimental projects that seemed interesting to me. They kept me creative when I had open spaces between client work.

And, they taught me a lot.

When in doubt… take action on something that interests you.

Here are a few things I tried.

**1. I “Donated” Power Strips to coffee shops with my brand stickered on it.**

That way, every time someone plugged in their laptop, theyd see my brand, secretly brainwashing them :).

I wanted to “power” the Columbus startup scene.

![](0*7TYmpzLNpfQ7IIBX.jpeg)

2. **As an experiment, I left wind-up Film cameras around the city with a note that said: *“Please Take a Photo and Leave it Where you Found it.”***

I then developed the rolls of film, curious to see what people had done with it. Did they take a landscape? Photos of their friends? Were the images interesting?

This guy took a selfie.

![](0*u4zCy5QHe-2qFqrW.jpeg)

**3. I printed a Newspaper with my Brand story on it. It was like a Physical version of my Website.**

I left it in places where they had Newspapers and Magazines.

![](0*oShKGYNFekgaK660.jpeg)

**4. I sent members of my personal email list a “Physical” version of my email that week, and I included a secret members-only “tattoo” for them to wear.**

People Instagrammed it. And maybe a few people asked them about why they had that on their skin?

![](0*8gSQoX4By0ei6TLi.jpeg)

**5. Instagram was fairly new at the time, and so I organized the first “Instagram-Meetup” in Columbus.**

I also got brand sponsors for free gear (camera tripods etc.) as well as a dozen red balloons for people to take photos of.

![](0*Ky9weJKON8SQUiYx.png)

**6. I sponsored coffee for that day at that same coffee shop. The first 100 people who entered the shop that morning got free coffee, on me.**

I negotiated with the coffee shop so that I only had to pay $1 per coffee (at cost for them).

This meant that I paid $100 to help make 100 people’s day better. Seems like good ROI to me…

![](0*N48CDLPa7z8iKUuA.jpeg)

**7. I hired Allie to do my personal brand logo.**

It’s counter-intuitive, but a good way to align yourself with other freelancers who are doing work you like, is to hire them for their services.

![](0*3-Pha6jPMDxgwAUv.png)

**We worked together on that logo project, and then shortly after I tried my next experiment, in which we started a project together called [**Death to the Stock Photo.](https://us19.admin.mailchimp.com/campaigns/deathtothestockphoto.com)

![](0*rCe3n9C9bOdZnao4.png)

— — — -

There are many companies that could use your creativity. But if you don’t have much work yet, you have to create your own stories to tell. Once I started meeting with people, I told them about these projects, and it was a great way to show them what I was about, and to become the “Hey, you’re that guy who did that thing with the coffee..” etc.

When things get slow, experiment. Find something that’s interesting to you and tinker with it, try it out.

Share about the experience. Involve other people, organize people, do something that snaps you out of a creative rut, and gives you a story to tell.

xx David

Oh, and P.S. Here is the photo he texted me today:

**The power strip is still there!! Looking like it needs a vacation.**

# How To Become A Person Who Finishes What They Start

## 

The distinction between being a professional and an amateur, is knowing when done is better than perfect.

Seeing the creative process for what it is*… a process.*

**And knowing that finishing and publishing are a crucial (and often overlooked) part of that process.**

Knowing when the moment has finally come to call it and officially finish what you begin, is not easy. It comes from experience and a feeling sense for your work and when it is developed enough to get a result, or express a message. But a time will come when you start yielding diminished returns.
> # But when this time comes, as the late Steve Jobs said,
> # “Real artist’s ship.”

![Steve Jobs, judging you.](1*c02AiXEi7C0LSnnozyZqYA.jpeg)*Steve Jobs, judging you.*

This is why when Apple releases a new product, it always gets updates *after release. ***Because the know that publishing is a part of the process.**

**And that nothing is finished, *until it’s finished.***

The benefits of publishing are obvious, but what are less often talked about are the consequences that most creatives deal with, because they don’t finish what they start.

*Loss of self-respect, lack of momentum, resistance starting new things, insecurity around sharing your work, and attachment to results are all symptoms of this larger problem:* **a fear of finishing what you begin.**

**If you find yourself in this category, there’s no shame in that.**

Just know that becoming the kind of person who finishes what they start is achievable when you exercise this skill, like a muscle. And when you do, eventually you will become eager to finish what you begin, and looking for the first opportunity to do so, because you know your best work comes only after publishing.

To help you do that, in this article, I share some of my best tips **for growing from a starter, *into a finisher.***

## **How to Make a Habit of Finishing**

![](1*MUGh2oC9HccatZ_7sYCm5w.png)

The creative process is often an isolating one.

Even in projects that require collaboration, you will still have to rely on yourself first and foremost.

**And the keystone to self-reliance is the belief in your own word.**

That is, the unwavering belief that when you commit to something, that you are the kind of person who is going to finish it.
> # Plato sums it up best when he said, *“Do thy own work and know thyself.”*

Knowing thyself, comes down to knowing who you are, and more importantly, who you are going to be when it matters most.

As a creative you need to know that you are the kind of person who finishes what they start, whenever they start something (even if that means being reluctant to start new things, because they will send you down a rabbit hole you will have to reach the bottom of).

If you are the kind of person who likes to begin lots of little projects and who fancies themselves a bit of an inspiration junkie — you are doing yourself a disservice. And more importantly, you are doing your creative essence a disservice.

From a practical standpoint, making a habit of finishing what you start will help you develop a well-rounded skill set to your craft. Many creators are good at beginnings, decent at middles, and bad at endings. Not necessarily, because endings are hard, **but because most creators *never make it to the end of their projects.***

But the true tragedy about not finishing the projects you start, is that you will slowly stop expecting yourself to finish things after you begin them.

**This not only leads to a lack of overall results and output, but also a fundamental lack of faith in yourself to follow through with what you say you’re going to do.**

You’re only as good as your word, *right?*

Which is why, you need to prioritize making a habit of finishing what you start, more than taking action on new ideas. It’s okay to have multiple projects at once, but know when enough is enough and to focus on closing those loops.

**Every open loop on project takes up subconscious processing in your mind, and diminishes your ability to focus on what is present.**

So, be reluctant to start new projects and make a habit of finishing what you do. Starting first, with your longest running projects. Then, you can think about what to do next.
> # ***Like the Greek playwright ***Euripides once said, ***“Do not plan for ventures before finishing what’s at hand.”***

## **Publish for Feedback**

![](1*vY8udZG3s-83eDt9OlLCIQ.jpeg)

One of the largest shifts amateurs make when becoming professionals, is when they **learn how to divorce their identity from what they make.**

Because if you identify solely with your work, your self-esteem and your ability to create more good work, hinges directly upon the feedback you get.

**If positive,** you will feel inspired and the next project will come easier (and overconfidence may still cause issues when you overestimate yourself).

**If negative,** you will associate the insults and reactions others have to your work, with yourself. Which will cause irreversible damage to your confidence in your craft.

**This is why your own identity as a creator needs to be completely isolated from the world of external praise, both negative and positive.**

It can be tempting to let praise come in, because it feels good, but when you do you let *all *external feedback influence your personal relationship to your work. Which is intractable. And will cause you to inevitably delay publishing what you create, out of fear for what others might think.

The trouble is, other people will always have opinions. And they will often voice them. There’s no way around this. So, instead of publishing with the hope of getting praise…

**Instead, publish your creations for feedback.**

And let the comments others have about your work be just that: *feedback.*

Take them into consideration next time, in the solace of your creative space, but never let the opinions of others grow to the point of being your motivation, or your resistance, to creating. Because at that point it’s too late.

And it doesn’t honor the truth, that you can update what you’ve created *after *you’ve published it, anyways.

## The Next Best Version

![](1*hnZCu9kN00-MvFqKRi7tdg.jpeg)

Another added benefit of publishing for feedback *(if you need one)* is that you will start to look at your creations as experiments *(not as accurate and whole representations or pieces of yourself).*

And each experiment as part of an ongoing process of trial-and-error and dialing-in of your message and style.

**The true super power of looking at your projects as experiments designed to gather feedback, is that you will *no longer fear criticism.***

You will know that everything you publish is only a draft, and you know that whatever comes of it will only serve to make the next iteration better. You know that you can always improve a concept with a version 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and onwards. And you have confidence in the part of you that has always evolved, always grown and gotten better over time.

So, get this version out there and get real-world feedback.

**Stop creating in an echo chamber and connect with your audience.**

They will serve their purpose and help you get better, not through their advice, but through the way they experience your work. Because they will see what you’ve made for the first time, with fresh eyes.

Which is an experience you, unfortunately, can never have.

They won’t see the hours put into it, the courage you had to begin in the first place and all the thoughts you have surrounding your work, which blind you to your own potential innovations.

**So, use that to your advantage.**

Publish for feedback.

Run your own experiments.

Improve and update to the next version, with confidence.

**And most importantly, *finish what you begin.***

# 3 Reasons Not to Read This Article on Reverse Psychology

## 3 Reasons Not to Read This Article on Reverse Psychology

This article has some real problems. It contains irrelevant personal information about me. It’s a list, a format that is getting to be a cliché (okay, already is a cliché). And I’m not a business expert, just a guy who has written a handful of (I hope) amusing books.

But still, I think you might find this article very useful.

That preceding intro was inspired by Adam Grant’s great new book [*Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XIYGCDO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1)*, which is full of interesting ideas, including the strategy of downplaying your idea when pitching a project. The old reverse psychology might have some science behind it after all (or at least strong anecdotal evidence and the blessing of one of America’s great business minds).

Before I get to that, some background: Adam Grant is a mensch. A professional mensch, in fact. He wrote the bestselling book *Give and Take*, which argued, essentially, that you don’t have to be an a-hole to be successful. In fact, being a compassionate and caring person — a giver — can actually help you in business. It’s worked for Adam — he’s got a PhD in psychology, is a professor at Wharton and consults for everyone from Google to the United Nations.

I loved *Give and Take*, and got to meet Adam in person (we both attended MTV’s video music awards a couple of years ago, and watched Miley Cyrus’s famously scandalous twerking. Our friendship was forged during a cultural crisis).

Adam’s new book is just as compelling as Miley’s twerking, and much more useful.

Here are three of my favorite points:

## **1) When pitching, try being brazenly humble.**

Adam writes about entrepreneur Rufus Griscom who created the parenting website Babble. When Rufus was pitching the site to Disney, he had a slide in his deck that read “Why Buying Babble Is a Bad Idea.” Disney ended up buying Babble for $40 million.

Acknowleding the limitations of your idea can be good for several reasons: It shows you’re realistic, that you are confident enough to be humble, that you are honest and not out to bamboozle them with a smarmy sales pitch.

Of course, it has its risks. If done poorly, it can make you seem unprofessional. But when it works, it’s a powerful Jedi mind trick.

I’m a big fan of downplaying my ideas. My latest project is to help connect the world in one [single family tree](https://www.ted.com/talks/aj_jacobs_the_world_s_largest_family_reunion_we_re_all_invited?language=en). I always acknowledge that in some ways this is a ridiculous idea. A lot of us feel we have too many annoying relatives to begin with. Who wants 7 billion more? But I talk about the upsides of the idea as well — like the amazing feeling knowing that you’re part of something bigger — and hope the positives outweigh the negatives.

## **2) Keep your day job.**

Being bold is a good thing. Being reckless? Not so much. Many successful entrepreneurs kept their day jobs much longer than you’d expect.

Phil Knight kept his job as an account for five years after he started selling running shoes. Steve Wozniak kept his engineering job at Hewlett-Packard for a year after founding Apple. Bill Gates is famous for dropping out of Harvard. But Grant points out, he waited to leave school for a year after selling his software program. Also, he didn’t drop out, he got a formal leave of absence. And his parents bankrolled him.

When I got my first big book contract, I was too much of a wuss to quit my day job. I’d come home from my job as an editor at *Esquire*, take a disco nap at 7 p.m. and then write until 1 a.m.

But Adam tells me I wasn’t being a wuss. I was just being a smart risk mitigator.

“The most successful originals are not the daredevils who leap before they look,” Grant says. “They are the ones who reluctantly tiptoe to the edge of a cliff, calculate the rate of descent, triple-check their parachutes, and set up a safety net at the bottom just in case.”

## **3) Cultivate Vuja De.**

We all know about Déjà vu — encountering something new, but feeling that we’ve seen it before. Vuja De, Grant explains, is the opposite. You encounter something familiar, but see it from a new perspective.

Consider the origin story of Warby Parker, the wildly successful online seller of prescription glasses. For all their lives, the founders accepted the statusquo: Glasses are expensive. They have to be. They’re medical purchases.

But then co-founder Dave Gilboa started looking at glasses with fresh eyes (sorry. Had to be done). While waiting in line at the Apple Store to buy an iPhone, “he found himself comparing the two products. Glasses had been a staple of human life for nearly a thousand years, and they’d hardly changed since his grandfather wore them. For the first time, Dave Gilboa wondered why glasses had such a hefty price tag. Why did such a fundamentally simple product cost more than a complex smartphone?”

He figured out glasses were hugely overpriced. There were plenty of ways to reinvent the process and make them cheaper.

I love the idea of Vuja De. I try to do it all the time. What parts of my life do I accept in their default mode, and can those parts be improved? If a Martian looked at the world, what would be most non-sensical?

In fact, one of my books was entirely based on Vuja De.

I wrote a book called [The Year of Living Biblically](http://www.amazon.com/Year-Living-Biblically-Literally-Possible/dp/0743291484/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1277955298&sr=8-1) in which I tried to read the Bible with fresh eyes and no preconceptions. My goal was simply to read it, and do what it said (including growing a massive and somewhat frightening beard).

Well, that’s it. I hope you liked the article despite its drawbacks. Oh, and there are a bunch of reasons not to follow me on LinkedIn. But please consider doing it anyway.

# On Health, Mastering Your Mind, Body, And Microbiome

## 
> # “Tell me what you eat, I’ll tell you who you are.” –Anthelme Brillat-Savarin
> “Researchers have known for some time now that the cornerstone of all degenerative conditions, including brain disorders, is inflammation. But what they didn’t have documented until now are the instigators of that inflammation — the first missteps that prompt this deadly reaction. And what they are finding is that gluten, and a high-carbohydrate diet for that matter, are among the most prominent stimulators of inflammatory pathways that reach the brain.” –Dr. David Perlmutter

To hear a deeper discussion on the following topics, listen to:

[The Mission Daily Episode 32: Food For Thought — Literally](http://bit.ly/2HIDIMW)

Gluten is Latin for glue. One of the most valuable things we’re taught in pre-school is to not eat glue. But sometimes the most important lessons get missed. The human intestines and brain are not meant for large or steady amounts of sugar, carbs, or gluten. These inputs cause inflammation and are beginning to be linked to just about every type of modern ailment imaginable such as: ADHD, depression, lethargy, dementia, and leaky gut.

If there are three inputs we can remove or reduce from our diet to completely revolutionize our health, they are sugar, gluten, and empty carbs. It’s easy to say, but in our society, getting clean from these inputs is incredibly challenging. We see the results of those inputs in the typical western diet. America is facing an epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and young people crippled with conditions caused largely by processed foods and a flawed food pyramid pushed on us from birth.

These poisonous inputs are preventing many of us from tapping into our full potential, learning ability, and willpower. When we seek to create, but consume raw materials that are poisonous, we enter into an endless cycle of disappointment, and often, depression.

The food pyramid was, at best, a clever trick by the corn growers’ lobby, government, and certain doctors to get people eating more gluten. In 1992, the U.S. government recommended a low fat, high carbohydrate diet to all Americans. The American Heart association followed suit in 1994. The food pyramid posters and “low fat” products went out en masse everywhere. The results? In 1990, there were around 6.4 million diabetics in the United States. In 2009, the number of diabetics exploded to around 21 million. Now, one person dies from diabetes every six seconds. These staggering numbers don’t even cover all the other physical and neurological ailments which arrive before and after diabetes.

So how do we find inputs that support our mission? First, we can create a diet that mimics that of our ancestors. There is no right answer, as long as you avoid the truly dangerous inputs (sugar, processed foods, and non-complex carbs including gluten). Whether you choose to create your own diet, or follow a time-tested and data-proven diet, it’s up to you. Here are a few ideas to get started:

![](1*vBJ5BW5qk4yVJXsrQQokZg.gif)

## What to eat:

* Fish that hasn’t been farm-raised

* Grass fed meats

* Healthy fats – preferably Omega 3’s

* Vegetables: Try to eat the full color spectrum (orange, dark green, light green, red, etc.), and go organic if possible

* Non-Sugary Fruits: Avocados, olives, eggplant, lemons, limes

* When choosing an occasional starch, pick sweet potato, lentils, brown rice, or other legumes

## What not to eat:

* White breads/white flour

* Empty Carbohydrates

* Sugar

* Excessive Gluten

* Processed foods

## What to drink:

* Liquids which have been tested for thousands of years:

* Water

* Coffee

* Tea

* Wine

* Lemon water: Try a shot of apple cider vinegar with lemon juice, and a teaspoon of honey in 8–16 ounces of water. Try this at 3pm in the afternoon instead of coffee- you’ll be amazed at the results.

## What not to drink:

* Fat-free milk

* Soda

* Fruit juices

* Sports drinks

* Energy drinks

What is unnatural and new usually hurts us, and what has been tested by time and evolution is usually much healthier. For instance, consider liquids such as water and coffee. They have been around forever; we know what we’re getting with each one. Now consider something like orange juice, which is just one more way for us to take in a huge amount of sugar under the guise of healthy eating.

It makes sense to begin by mastering these inputs because they affect everything: our thoughts, our brain and heart health, or lack thereof.

Starting anything new requires a huge amount of willpower. Instead of a complete diet overhaul, which takes monumental effort, sometimes it makes sense to get a small win first. A simple start towards a complete diet overhaul could be consuming as little sugar as possible for 30–90 days. The effects of this small win will likely be enough to spur on the next undertaking. Many people set themselves up for endless frustration by trying to do too much at once. A small victory is better than getting overwhelmed and quitting completely. A 90 day victory of swapping out sugar for healthy fats is still a victory.

So if a diet low in sugar and high in healthy fat is so effective, why don’t more people get started? One reason is that eating sugar and excessive gluten will give us an immediate, opiate-like reward, which makes them difficult to kick.⁠ One of the most powerful things we can do to reduce the sugar and gluten in our diets is to study the outputs they produce.

The very first outputs that gluten produces is depression and headaches. Our brains grow inflamed and all our energy is spent fighting these poisons. Then we become sick. Then diabetes follows. If we keep going, we’ll be on our way to dementia. The life outputs that sugar and gluten have been linked to are:

* ADHD

* Anxiety

* Chronic stress

* Chronic headaches

* Migraine headaches

* Depression

* Diabetes

* Epilepsy

* Focus and concentration problems

* Inflammatory conditions and diseases including arthritis

* Insomnia

* Intestinal problems, including celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, and irritable bowel syndrome

We can never expect a calm mind, decreased anxiety, less anger, fewer ups and downs, or more pronounced joys unless we control the inputs which fuel our bodies and brains. Carbohydrates, gluten, and sugar also deplete our brains of neurotransmitters vital to the regulation of mood. Consider this statement by Dr. Perlmutter:
> “When your blood sugar increases, there’s an immediate depletion of the neurotransmitters serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, GABA, and dopamine. At the same time, B-complex vitamins, which are needed to make those neurotransmitters (and a few hundred other things), get used up. Magnesium levels also diminish, and this handicaps both your nervous system and liver.”⁠

For more science behind how gluten and sugar affect our overall health and potential, read *Grain Brain* by Dr. David Perlmutter. The book profiles dozens of studies on the degenerative effects of carbohydrates, gluten, and sugar.

# Why Originality is Overrated

## 

Most creatives start out believing the myth that ***they need to be completely original.***

They believe that if they are not original, they will be ridiculed, shamed, and publicly humiliated.

But despite this belief, and the threat of social suicide, most creatives still start out copying the work of those that inspire them. They replay that melody, copy that product, study that painting, and write in their favorite author’s style.

**The reason for this is obvious**—*most people only find their own voice, after spending some time sounding like everyone else’s.*

When this goes well, they discover that there is art that only they can make, because there is only one *them.*

And that sometimes, people just need to hear their idea from their unique perspective. Someone they resonate with, or someone like them, and that’s all it takes to make an impact in their lives.

**So, instead of trying to be original, seek to be authentic.**

And in the process you may discover the key to making your message stand out amongst amongst the crowd and call out to those who need to hear it.

## Nothing is Original

The unfortunate thing about originality, is that *nothing is truly original.*

There are only very old things being rediscovered all the time, and over and over again.

Think about this… each human who has ever lived on the Earth has lived ~100 years worth of life experience at maximum (that’s very optimistic and assuming that they take care of themselves).

During this time, many common themes will continue to re-emerge again and again. Love. Loss. Sorrow. Hope. Metamorphosis. New beginnings. There’s only so many story chains that can unfold within the realm of what we human beings find meaningful.

**But the shapes those can take, when flavored with our own unique perspectives, and experiences, *are infinite.***

*(Just like how there are only 7 notes and 7 colors, yet an infinite number of melodies and pictures that can be made.)*

**That’s what it means to be authentic. **To create from your own experiences, from your own point of view. Without faking anything in the process, or pretending to be any way other than what you our. Proudly, simply, you. And many times it’s not the uniqueness of the message, but someone needing to hear it from someone they trust, admire, or relate to, for it to finally sink in.

So, instead of seeking to be original, and saying something that has never been said before,* **try saying something in a way that only you can.***

In the process, you may actually stumble upon unexplored territory and accidentally be original, as a byproduct (and not the aim) of self-expression.

But saying something in a way that only you can, will require you to embrace your personal truth, and become more vulnerable than you have ever felt.

And no one said it would be easy.

## **From Vulnerable to Invulnerability**

We are constantly bombarded with lies in the news, spam in the media, and sensationalism in advertising.

**So much so, that we are now hypersensitive to the truth.**

Now, we can smell something real, among a sea of more-of-the-same. When something was created from a place of truth and authenticity, *we can feel it.*

**Which means that when something is created from a place of truth and authenticity, it stands out to us amidst the seat of noise.**

But creating something from a place of truth means getting vulnerable.

Utterly, and totally vulnerable. Uncomfortably, so. Because when you create something from your truth, that means you are putting YOU on display.

You’re taking something raw, and private, and putting it out on the public forum. Exposing it to feedback, criticism, and maybe even praise.
> # You’re opening yourself up to the unknown and saying, *“This is me. This is my experience. Do with it what you will, or do nothing with it at all.”*

**This process is deeply uncomfortable.**

Every part of your brain that was wired for survival will try to put on the brakes and grind this process to a halt. It doesn’t want you to get naked and be put on display. **To your brain, social arrows hurt just as bad as real ones.**

But there’s a secret power to vulnerability, that only the brave discover.

**Which is that: ***when you acknowledge your own faults first, you can use them to your advantage and make yourself invulnerable to insults.*

When someone criticizes you, it only has power because of *your* reaction, or the reactions of others (which is dictated by your reaction anyways).

But when you are vulnerable and criticize yourself first, either when expressing yourself, or when taking responsibility for the reality of what is, **you take the only thing that can be used against you and make yourself invulnerable to it.**

This lesson is exemplified in the fantasy epic Game of Thrones, when
> # George R.R. Martin speaks through the anti-hero Tyrion and says, *“Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.”*

So, don’t waste precious time or creative energy trying to mask the truth, or trying to be original (which is often not the truth, either).

Instead, use what makes you unique to your advantage by acknowledging it and embracing it. Because when you make your weakness your strength, it can’t be used against you.

And better yet, it will help you stand out amongst masses of others who are too afraid to do the same.

# If You Want Confident Kids, Do This

## If You Want Confident Kids, Do This

### …then we’ll have confident adults that raise confident children.
> # “As kids we get used to asking for things, but somehow we lose this ability in adulthood. We come up with all sorts of excuses and reasons to avoid any possibility of criticism or rejection.”**– Jack Canfield**

When you go to a nice hotel:

…and go to the pool

…and eat at the bar

…you get looks if you have kids.

I look back confidently,
> # “Yeah, I’m THAT guy. I bring children to your secret lair to destroy it.”

It wasn’t really that bad, but this place only has…NINE ROOMS.

So…exclusive.

Actually, everyone was cool, but even the boys felt the eyes and mentioned it.

I taught them that when you feel uncomfortable because you’re not 32–52 and single with your shirt off and taking selfies alone with a selfie stick and trying to hook up (just joking… I didn’t say that…and I took more pictures than they did…but that was the vibe and there is nothing wrong with that either…it’s just more foreign to my kids than chillin’ with locals in Barcelona).

What I did teach them is that…

## 1. When you feel uncomfortable it doesn’t mean you have to leave.

*You have to get comfortable feeling uncomfortable.*

**There are way too many adults scared to go anywhere they haven’t been or do anything important because they feel uncomfortable.**

Tragic.
> # If we want confident kids, we have to teach them how to be comfortable when they are uncomfortable….then we’ll have confident adults that raise confident children.

## 2. Building confidence means LITERALLY going outside the comfort zone.

All is well. We had a blast. Kids hopped in the pool with me and the the cool crowd with Greek 🍸 and now I’m sure they’ll feel comfortable in other uncomfortable situations.

## 3. Confidence is about respect for self and others.

When I give speeches to large crowds (which is less scary than small crowds), I’ll whisper to myself before I go on “confidence, confidence, confidence.”

# Myth Busted&#58; Not Every Company Needs Venture Backing

## 

There’s a misconception in the Bay Area that if you’re starting a company, you *need* to raise outside capital to both operate and be considered *legitimate*. The process has been overly glamorized. Big rounds are celebrated, even though they don’t always translate into any exit, nevermind one that is meaningful for the founder(s).

I’ve always struggled to understand why peers and friends celebrate raising money, especially in their early stages (Seed and Series A).
> **At this stage, the only concrete thing you can “celebrate” is that you just gave away a portion of your equity, operating control, and the ability to draw profits from the business… permanently.**

One of the biggest questions my co-founder, Dennis, and I keep coming back to when thinking about our next company is whether or not raising outside capital is actually a good idea. Beyond committing ourselves and our company to the timelines and expectations of investors, raising money might not be smart from a logistical perspective, depending on the business we try to build next.
> # As Rand Fishkin has said, VC backing often makes a startup [grossly inefficient](https://www.atrium.co/blog/reconsider-vc-funding/), not to mention your relationship with your next investors will likely be longer than the average marriage.

Here is some insight into our current thought process and the questions we are asking ourselves as we make this decision:

## **Question 1: What type of exit are we happy with?**

* **VCs want huge exits.** Small exits just don’t produce returns VCs deem meaningful for their funds (even though they may be meaningful for the founders). So even if a founder has an acquisition offer they want to take, they might be prohibited from doing so by their investors, who want to hold out for something bigger.

* **VCs have the power to “drag along” founders into acquisition offers they don’t want.** I’ve seen this happen. It isn’t pretty. It’s often the result of a company not growing at an expected rate and the VC getting impatient due to their fund horizon.

* **Sometimes VCs claim to be “founder friendly,” meaning that if the founder at any time wants to exit, they’ll work with them to help the process.** But that might not always be exactly true. Consider it from the VC’s perspective: if the startup you’ve invested in proves to have rocketship potential, why would you want to exit early if your fund is depending on that company to bring in the lionshare of the return to your LPs?

What you need to be thinking about here is whether you want the freedom to exit smaller and earlier if need be, or if you’re OK riding a much longer rollercoaster like Dropbox did with its 10+ year journey to an IPO. Obviously it was an amazing outcome, but not every company is Dropbox.

## **Question 2: Who would our acquirer be?**

A nice acquisition — adjusted for time and life circumstances — may be much more rewarding for both yourself and your team than a long and grindy road to an IPO. Even a “small” exit, in addition to giving you some cushion to live on, also makes it easier to launch something new and bigger again in the future — not to mention raise money as a “second-time founder” if you choose to go that route.

Even with a “small” exit, having some cushion can put you in a much better position to think your next venture through instead of balancing building an MVP and putting food on the table. Without any logical acquirer in mind (hopefully you have multiple), you are essentially banking everything on a very low probability outcome of an IPO.

* **This is always helpful to think about, even from as early as Day 1. **With Dairy Free Games, Dennis and I started off knowing that our most likely (and preferred) acquirer would be a larger gaming company. This informed many of our initial strategic decisions — including whether or not to raise venture capital, from who, and the people we sought to meet and form partnerships with.

* **Who your acquirer might be will depend on what sort of business you’re running.** If you’re a services company, like a design team or recruiting agency, you have to consider why a company would want to acquire you, especially if you offer services already to them or their competitors. Why would they acquire you if they already have everything they need from you by way of your service, and by acquiring you, they effectively remove all other revenue that comes from offering services to their competitors?

## **Question 3: What type of business do we want to start, and how long would that type of business take to reach profitability?**

* Another reality of running a cash flow-oriented business — like a consulting agency, or a physical product-focused company, even, where you’re selling units at a healthy margin from day one — is that **you could actually be profitable quickly.** When that’s the case, it might be smarter to simply self-fund your operation and draw profits. If you know your business isn’t going to be profitable for some time, however, self-funding simply isn’t sustainable, even in the short term.

* **Now, if your ambition is to build and launch an MVP to gauge initial traction and later bring on a larger team to add critical features and scale it, the better route would be something of a mix:** self-funding until you can raise a large seed round or skipping straight to a Series A on much more favorable terms.

## **Question 4: How many full-time employees would we need to hire before we can reach a scale where we would be an attractive acquisition?**

* **Full-time employees are expensive.** In fact, for a software company, they’ll be your biggest expense early on. Before you actually start your first company, you’re really only thinking about salary as a primary expense. But as soon as you start hiring full-time employees — especially in the Bay Area — your expenses balloon. There’s more paperwork, benefits, payroll taxes, office perks, health insurance, legal expenses for setting up stock option plans, etc. All in all, it’s another 30% or so on top of the salary that each employee will cost you. Plus, if they don’t work out, then you have to consider severance. All of which is to say, if you need to hire a lot of full-time people to scale, you’ll likely need outside capital.

* Of course, that’s dependent on your personal financial runway — **if you’re Jeff Bezos, you can probably self-fund a 500-person team and sleep soundly**. But even if you are worth, say, $10 million liquid, running a five-person team can quickly eat away at that amount.

* **If you can scale something with just a few people or some part-time contractors, then you can likely self-fund until you decide not to.** Sites like Examine.com are maintained by a team of less than 5 people with a founder who spends more than half the year traveling, and they’re doing just fine. Ultimately, this will prove a *major *factor in determining whether you have the freedom to bootstrap, or whether outside capital will be a necessity.
> # At the end of the day, while raising VC is sexy and glamorized in in the Bay Area, in reality, it can be limiting and even damaging.

Sure, it can allow you things like access to key industry players, partnerships with portfolio companies, and good advice. But often times, you don’t actually need those things, especially while you’re still proving out your product-market fit — and more often than not, the contract you have to sign to obtain them simply isn’t worth it.

The sad reality is that investors promise the world during the “term sheet phase” (after all, they need to sell themselves to you to get deals done), but unless you show fast traction, it’s just better business for them to focus on their rocket ships.

The only way to determine whether or not that’s true for you, however, is to take a hard look at what you want to achieve, what sort of business you’ll be running, and whether or not self-funding is a realistic option.

# When the Ugliest Thing you can Possibly Imagine is the Best-Worst Experience of your Life

## Nicole Akers’ picture

It’s the most awful thing you never thought you’d do. That’s the catalyst I want you to get comfortable with and severely uncomfortable with all at the same time.

You never thought you’d eat someone else’s restaurant remains until you stomach aches so badly you know you must eat something to survive.

You are pond scum. Not Darwin’s scum that grew life from the disgusting stagnant water no one will bathe in, but lower than life. When you don’t deserve to live, but live is the very thing you must do…

What do you do then?

You must move, live, eat, breathe in ways you never imagined possible.

Gum on the sole of someone’s shoe is better than you. You’ve been stomped through a mud-puddle, bathed in someone’s excrement, and you want nothing more than a chance at dignity.

You are worthy of nothing. You deserve nothing. You are good for nothing. You are worse than pond scum. The very thing that gives life to the ugliest creatures is better than you.

What are you willing to do when death seems better than life?

This is exactly how we felt at times during our hike of El Camino de Santiago.

It is the best character-building experience of a lifetime and I recommend everyone go on the adventure.

Have an adventure, they say…

It’ll be fun they say…

Backpack 500 miles across Spain and you will be a changed individual. Leave the dog behind at Grandma’s. Grandma’s is a treat. Grandma will spoil you with treats and every “good” thing that should never enter your body. Grandma’s house is a fairy tale and no treats are on this trail.

This path has everything you never knew you needed. It has the gumption to survive, not just live. It’s the survivalist’s essential kit to life.

There is [wisdom in this journey](https://medium.com/publishous/a-bit-of-wisdom-im-learning-while-hiking-el-camino-de-santiago-ab2aa0e9c31e).

## Keep going-never quit

When you think you are at your wit’s end and can’t take another step you are wrong. You aren’t just wrong, you’ve diluted your very existence. When everything says “you can’t” and it’s not dark yet and the next Albergue is full and the bed you seek is playing hide-and-go-seek, you must go on. The Titanic version is cheap and romanticized in comparison to this. Your heart will go on after you die, and die you must, but not today. Today your family and your kids are depending on you to take one more step, and one more step after that. Because if you don’t the rocks and tree coverings are your dwelling tonight. You must dig down deep and discover The Little Engine that Could attitude. If you don’t keep chugging along, then everyone suffers because of you. When you don’t want to wear that skin you move despite the pain.

## Pain

Pain is weakness leaving your body. When every orifice cringes in pain and your callouses grow new skin you’ve reached a place of better. You are deliriously dehydrated. Your body aches for a bit of nourishment, but that is not all…

You have been caught behind enemy lines. You are naked, exposed, and every intimate detail is exposed. Go ahead, scream. I invite you to scream. It’s okay. They can’t hear you and no one is coming to save you. For the love of God… Who is God? You are left here to suffer. The cross? What’s that? It has blood on it and your blood is about to join it because you feel the weight of the pack, the frame, the headache from the stupidity that you ever thought you could do this. There is pain in your everything. The heel bruises pale in comparison to the stress fractures you’ve been hiking on for two days before you ever winced in pain because you must continue, or die.

Your fingernails and your toe nails have been pulled out. You’re bloodied, disfigured, hiding from the pain and to survive you must walk out, but The Way is paved with glass and you have no shoes. The delusions of pretty roads are just that…delusions. Still, you must succeed.

![Nicole Akers’ picture](1*jIaXC2HczGItcELZw3Q_kQ.jpeg)*Nicole Akers’ picture*

## Don’t give up

How is it possible to succeed when all you want to do is roll over, give up, and say you never should have started this journey? You’ve told enough people that they will laugh. For God sake, your own family wanted to take your kids from you before you began. If you quit now you will be a laughing stock. Or, they’ll hate you because you finished the task. Hate is hate and how is one kind better than another? You stop caring about everyone else and live this life for you.

When the sky is cloudy and it is going to rain you must keep going. There are rainbows ahead and you’ve got to keep going — one step at a time. You must continue. Continue we did. We reached the end. We died on the hill. We suffered on the cross. We went to the pilgrim church that signified the end of the journey. And, as we arrive at church the salt of the tears we cry are bitter-sweet. The physical journey is over and the new life is beginning. I’d introduce you to the new people we are, but we don’t quite know who we are yet.

We have been to school and received the credentials, our degree, if you will. This container holds the awards for our family.

![Nicole Akers’ picture](1*RrKM06E76TWtFMwmoaXcYQ.jpeg)*Nicole Akers’ picture*

The actual documents are in that tube, the actual credentials that we endured the journey with our girls, ages 6 and 12.

## What about you?

Have you been struggling with something, or have been on a journey of your own?

# Be The Early-Evangelist

## Be The Early-Evangelist

### Vocalizing Your Support
> # “There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up.” ― John Holmes

![](0*ZzcM4o-xzm5fun9X)

### **Food For Thought**

## **Be The Early-Evangelist**

Criticizing things is easy. Go on Yelp, and you’ll find a slew of one-star reviews. Goodreads is jam-packed with negative feedback. Click on any product on Amazon and you’ll find that someone was unhappy.

While we’re all about freedom of speech and consumer rights, we have an idea. A musing, if you will. Something we hope you’ll ponder today as you go out into the world.

Try and tell someone about something you love. Got a new phone case that’s saved you when your two-year-old dropped it in the toiled by “accident”? Share that! Love your new workout pants? Rave about them when your friend mentions how good you look. This goes especially for new products that are still trying to gain traction.

[In his recent interview with The Mission Daily](http://bit.ly/2X0qmaO), Adam Blitzer of Salesforce talked about how an “early evangelist” — a believer in his product who was very vocal with his support — helped save Adam’s early start-up. He painted a picture of what an “early evangelist” looks like: They are “the person who probably irrationally believes in you and believes in your mission with no skin. They have no stake, but they just love what you’re doing so much that they’re going to help you make it happen.”

Wouldn’t we all love that kind of support?

Heck yeah, we would.

So let’s make it happen — and it starts with us. We might not all know a small start-up that needs a boost, but we’ve got to start somewhere. Instead of focusing on the bad, go out and shout about something awesome.

The world needs more of that.

# The 5 Non-Coding Tests You Should Always Give A Candidate Before Hiring Them

## 

Here’s the truth: there are few decisions you’ll make as the head of a growing company that are more important than those related to hiring. Your company will only ever be as successful as your employees are effective.

The problem, of course, is that it’s almost impossible to determine which potential hires are going to further your company’s progress, and which are going to hold it back.

My co-founder and I have hired employees who looked incredible on paper — 10+ years of relevant industry experience, stellar educational background, impressive professional accomplishments — only to fire them six months later. At the same time, many of the hires who’ve been critical to our company’s success — whether they be engineers, designers, or project managers — were younger, less experienced, and less “polished.”

Over time, we’ve realized that the hires who grew into leaders and began driving results exemplified and shared certain intangible skills and mindsets that aligned with our values as a company.
> # What’s proved more important than an Ivy League education are things like passion, curiosity, grit, a desire to grow, and the ability to hit the ground running.

The question for other young companies thinking about this question then becomes: So how do you screen for these traits before making final hiring decisions?

Here’s what we did. Through a lot of trial-and-error, we developed a series of 5 tests that we make sure to run with every candidate during the interview process. The improvement we’ve seen in both performance and company morale is what made me want to write and share this.

So now, without further ado…

## **Test 1: Negative Feedback Test**

The first — and maybe the most important — test is one designed to determine whether employees are able to take and grow from negative feedback.

The reason that skill is so important is because the goal of young startups, ultimately, is growth. Constructive feedback is crucial to that end. Employees who understand that will accept criticism, learn from it, and use it to improve, since that’s really the only way to get better at whatever it is you do.

On the other hand, if employees are *not *receptive to negative feedback — if it affects their morale and performance, or if they refuse to believe that they’re wrong or in need of coaching — whether it comes from a boss or from a peer, they’ll have a harder time adapting and growing. Having a team member who refuses to take advice from their peers can hurt the morale of other employees, nevermind waste a lot of their manager’s time. The worst scenario of this happening is when your team is small and the responsibility to give feedback is now bubbling up to the founder, a founder who may or may not even have the knowledge or experience to give this kind of feedback (e.g. an engineer giving feedback on visual design).

To screen for this specific scenario, during the in-person interview, we make it a special priority to have the negative feedback come from a peer (somebody they would work with if hired). This has become a crucial gauge for us to determine how well they will work in a team without constant managerial oversight. Having a team of engineers or designers that can run autonomously and self-police is truly the dream of any founder.
> # This is not to say that we aren’t looking for the candidate to defend their opinion. But there is definitely a good and a bad way to defend it.

The good way will garner the respect of all their peers and create a culture of continuous innovation through iteration, and the bad will make it so that their peers simply stop trying to offer their feedback — which runs us into that dreaded aforementioned scenario where the responsibility to provide feedback falls on the already overburdened shoulders of the manager.

## **Test 2: Email Test**

The email test is designed to assess a potential hire’s commitment to the company, as well as how succinctly they communicate and organize their thoughts.

In short, we send an email to prospects after hours and request some sort of response or action from them, along with some kind of explanation or delineation of logic. We then assess both whether they respond — quickly — and how.

We do this because you can learn a lot about a person by how they write and structure their emails. But we also pay careful attention to the response time. At young startups, there are often a variety of fires that need to be put out at any given moment. You need your more foundational employees to be ready and able to act whenever called upon. If a prospect chooses* not* to respond to an important email for, say, several days — and, yes, this includes weekends and nights — we know they’re likely not the type of person we can rely on during tough times and likely not the right fit for a startup culture.

## **Test 3: Process vs. Product Test**

Here is another important trait we look for in employees: whether they’re free-wheeling and creative, or creative but more methodical in the way they accomplish important tasks.

Ultimately, creativity is critical, but so is consistency and dependability, and the more process-oriented person will give you the latter. They couple their creativity with a proven ability to execute — and they can then explain their reasoning with logic.

I’ve found that unless you screen for this, you end up with purely “product” people who are skilled at bouncing ideas around a room, but are less inclined toward execution. When you ask them, “Hey, great idea, how do you want to start doing that?”, they simply don’t know.

In the world of young startups, ideas are cheap. Execution is everything.

## **Test 4: Proactivity Test**

Next, we screen for proactivity.

We question: does the candidate follow up after the interview is over, or do they just go home? Are they asking questions during the interview? If you give them a project, are they able to make logical conclusions and assumptions based on research they go out and conduct on their own, or are they requiring a certain amount of micromanagement?

These questions are important because they show whether or not an employee can own processes reliably on their own. Employees at young companies need to carry their own weight. As much as we might want to, founders don’t have the time to micromanage or mentor.

## **Test 5: “Do They Give a Fuck?” Test**

Finally, we come to the “Do they give a fuck?” test — or, the free time test.

This is an assessment, essentially, of what candidates do in their free time and, more particularly, whether they’re passionate about the work. For us (as a mobile gaming company), that means looking for candidates who are playing games, building tools for games, or just generally learning more about games and game design in their time away from their desks. As a founder, you need employees — [especially early employees](https://medium.com/@dzdonov/you-cant-afford-to-ignore-these-4-soft-skills-when-hiring-your-first-employees-3ab67b80ad38) — to possess this sort of intrinsic passion about the work. If they do, you can rely on them to be there when you need them.
> # At the end of the day, these tests *work*. The things they screen for are important, especially for young startups.

Spotting them in a candidate — any kind of candidate — can save your company immense amounts of time and money. But even more importantly, these tests help founding teams more purposefully foster healthy and consistent company cultures — cultures that will sustain you through the inevitable ups and downs of startup life.

# Why Accomplishing Your Goals Won’t Lead to Long Term Happiness

## 

It’s possible you read that headline and had a WTF reaction. As a culture we glorify achievement. We create lists like the Forbes 400, Fast Company’s 100 most creative People, and The New York Times Best Seller. All of this fuels a multibillion-dollar self-help industry to which I’m sure I’ve contributed with my podcast and books.

Social media amplifies this by ranking us according to fan and follower counts. If someone posts a picture on Instagram, we can easily see how many people respond and how we line up in comparison. For many young people, this isn’t just an indication of their status, but a measure of their self-worth.

When I met one of our listeners last summer, she told me a story about one of her tutoring clients who came to her in tears. She was distraught because her friend had posted a picture of the two of them on Facebook that got 100 likes and she only got 2 likes for posting the same picture.

If there’s one pattern that shows up over and over in the people that I interview, it’s an internal shift of some sort. It’s decision to love themselves like their lives depended on it and realized that [the most important relationship they’ll ever have is the one they have with themselves](https://unmistakablecreative.com/this-is-the-most-important-relationship-youll-ever-have/).

This isn’t just spiritual new age mumbo-jumbo. Plenty of research and neuroscience backs it. So let’s talk about that.

## Hedonic Adaptation

When Sasha Heinz was growing up, she had a lifelong dream of getting into Harvard. She described it to me as the “myopic focus” of her adolescence. She applied early and was accepted. But after arriving at Harvard, the buzz wore off, and it became her new normal.

When I started my blog in 2009, I couldn’t imagine anything making me happier than getting a book deal. Then in 2015, it finally happened. It was not only with a publisher that had published the books of many of my heroes. It was a two-book deal. For about a month I was on top of the world. Eventually, it became my new normal.

If you’ve ever been in a relationship, you know that the first couple of months make you feel like you’re on cloud 9. You can’t stop thinking about each other. You walk around the world with a bounce in your step and an ear to ear smile on your face. But after a couple of months, it becomes your new normal.
> # When we want something that we don’t currently have, we assume that getting it will make us much happier. But what we overlook is the fact that even if we get what we want more than anything in the world, at some point it will become our new normal. And something else will take place.

* Graduating with honors takes the place of getting into Harvard.

* Making the New York Times Best Seller list takes the place of getting a book deal.

* Selling your startup for a small fortune takes the place of getting your first round of funding

**Because of hedonic adaptation, everything amazing eventually becomes your new normal.**

When we attempt to derive our happiness and well being from the accomplishment of a goal, we’re trying to solve an internal problem with an external solution. Even if you get what you want more than anything in the world, the problem still isn’t solved, and we get stuck on the treadmill of achievement. As [Nataly Kogan](https://twitter.com/natalykogan) said to me “happiness is an input into a great life, not a bonus you get at the end of it.

## Relative Scale

As humans, we judge things on a relative scale. When I was in 9th grade, I auditioned for the Texas All-State Band. What many people don’t know is that Texas has the best high school music programs in the country. It’s a breeding ground for professional musicians. The Texan obsession with high school football comes with high school marching band.

As a freshman, I had already overcome unlikely odds. My band director and private lessons teacher had forced me to try out for the all-region band that was for sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Because I was second chair, I advanced to the next round, which determined whether I would make the all-state band.

To me, the worst possible outcome was to miss all-state by one chair. If I came in dead last, it wouldn’t have upset me because I never had a chance. And of course, I missed all-state by one chair. And to this day I remember the name of the kid who beat me and the green beret he was wearing.

In [our interview on Unmistakable Creative](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/sasha-heinz-taking-human-performance-good-great/), Sasha Heinz shared an interesting observation about Olympic medal winners.

Getting to the Olympics in and of itself is an incredible achievement. But, if you look at the podium, the silver medalist is usually the least happy because they didn’t win the gold. The bronze medalist is just happy to be on the podium.

The relative scale by which you judge things and your reference group changes with every accomplishment.

My friend [Kamal Ravikant](https://twitter.com/kamalravikant) once jokingly said to me “In San Francisco, if you have 10 million dollars you feel poor because the guy living down the hall from you has 100 million. If you sell your startup for several million dollars, you’re rich, but you feel poor because your new reference group is other people who have sold startups and probably have more money.

For many years my reference group was coworkers and people I went to college with. But after I started Unmistakable Creative, my reference group became wildly skewed because it was people like [Tim Ferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss), [Ryan Holiday](https://medium.com/@ryanholiday_44799), [Danielle LaPorte](https://medium.com/@DanielleLaPorte), billionaires and other people who had done incredible things. Because of the relative scale and my new reference group, I didn’t consider getting a book deal that big of an achievement. It took me a long time to realize that my reference group gave me an incredibly distorted view of success and accomplishment.

## Obsessive Focus and the Loss of Identity

For many people who are on the path to becoming professional athletes or any other goal they work towards their entire life, their goal is their identity. When the goal isn’t reached their identity gets shattered.

From the time he was in high school, [steve magness](https://twitter.com/stevemagness) was on track to go to the Olympics. He was one of the fastest runners in the United States when he was a senior in high school. But he didn’t have the same level of success in college. And suddenly the goal that had defined his life for so long forced him to reconcile this loss of identity. Today he’s taken his wisdom, written an amazing book on peak performance and coaches college athletes to help them avoid his mistakes.

*One of our biggest misconceptions about happiness is that it’s an emotion. But it’s actually a skill that can be built. If you’re interested in building your happiness skills, check out our [Unmistakable Guide to Health and Happiness](https://unmistakablecreative.com/happiness), which is based on proven research and social science.*

## **The Benefit of a Goal is Who You Become, Not What You Get**

It’s process, not the prize that causes you to become the best version of yourself. This is why it’s often said that the value of reaching a goal is not what you get but who you become. The process of writing 2 books has turned me into a different person than I was 10 years ago.

* It’s taught me to develop habits, rituals, routines, and systems that will be a lifelong creative practice.

* It’s taught me [what we should have learned in school but never did.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/what-we-should-have-learned/)

* It’s taught me that [attention is the currency of achievement](https://unmistakablecreative.com/why-attention-is-the-currency-of-achievement/).

The list goes on and on. As an author, the part of writing a book I hate the most is being finished with a manuscript. Suddenly there’s a void in place of this thing I had to look forward to for the entire time I was working on a book. In many ways, the message of my upcoming book, [An Audience of One: Reclaiming Creativity for Its Own Sake](https://unmistakablecreative.com/audience-of-one/) is a reminder to myself as much as it is to my readers.

As long as your happiness is dependent on the belief that you’ll only be happy when you have accomplished some goal, you’ll always feel that something is missing from your life, regardless of how impressive your achievements are. Happiness precedes achievement, not the other way around.

When the achievement of a goal doesn’t determine your happiness, it’s easier to be grateful when you do get what you want. As Tim Ferriss said to me, “if you don’t appreciate what you have no, you’ll never appreciate what you get later.
> # There’s nothing wrong with having goals and dreams. But believing that any one thing will give us everlasting happiness is a recipe for profound disappointment.

On the other hand, there’s a profound peace and freedom that comes from not depending on external solutions to solve internal problems.

# Are You Moving Toward Your Mountain?

## Photo by Nitish Meena on Unsplash

My favorite commencement speech is by the author, Neil Gaiman. His elegant, yet simple call to action of, [*Make Good Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikAb-NYkseI)* has been a beacon for creatives everywhere.

The part of the speech that I find the most inspiring however, is when he gives the advice to always, *“move toward your mountain.”*

Gaiman’s life-goal, or his mountain, was to become an “author of books.”
> # *“And I knew that as long as I kept walking towards the mountain I would be all right. And when I truly was not sure what to do, I could stop, and think about whether it was taking me towards or away from my mountain.” -Neil Gaiman*

Knowing *what *your mountain is can be difficult. And even once you can see the peak, staying on the path can be even harder. **The biggest trap of all, however, is staying on the wrong path for too long.**

The way to the top of the mountain is always moving. The same path that gave you the courage to start climbing in the first place will eventually become dead end. The opportunity that made you feel like, *“Hey, I can really do this”* last year, may be the exact thing slowing you down now.

Last year, I knew I wanted to leave my full-time job and work remotely. I didn’t care much about what I would be doing, I just knew I needed some variety. I heard someone say, *“The average millionaire has 7 sources of income.”*

That sounds pretty good, I thought. I’ll just do that.

And so the side-hustles began. I was already pretty good at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/corey.mccomb/) and knew how to turn-a-phrase while using H-tags. I knew enough about email marketing to hold my own in conversation. Why not put those skills to use for others?

I began doing on-the-side marketing for farmers markets, yoga brands, and even a national dog toy company. I’d be getting a haircut and ask the owner if they had a website. *“No? Let’s get lunch next week.”*

I called these side-hustles my “life-rafts.” If my mountain was professional independence, I’d need seven life-rafts to comfortably float away from my full-time, 9–5 cruise ship.

**A funny thing happens once you tune your ears to listen for new opportunity. You hear it everywhere. What I thought would be a long voyage to the mythical seven seas wasn’t at all.**

I reached the mountain peak quickly and quit my full-time job. Success! Time to sit back and enjoy the view.

**Not so fast…**

My life-rafts took a lot of work to keep afloat. And because they all had uncertainty built into their lifespan, I was spending a lot of time just scouting out new life-rafts. What happens when one of these sinks?

I was also having a hard time learning new skills. There isn’t a ton of “on the job training” in the freelance world. My clients hired me to do things I already knew how to do. I didn’t have a group of peers or colleagues around to teach me new strategies. I started to feel stuck with what I already knew, which, *don’t tell my clients*, wasn’t all that much.

I realized that quote about millionaires didn’t include the detail that most of those seven sources of income are passive. And that having seven freelance clients at a time didn’t really equal the kind of variety I had in mind.

**My mountain hadn’t moved. But the path that helped me reach the first peak — leaving my full time job — was now leading me somewhere I didn’t want to go. What once moved me towards my mountain, was now taking me farther away.**

I made it my new goal to find one main source of income that would allow me to work remotely, teach me new skills, and still leave open enough brain-space to new welcome interesting opportunities when they came along.

The hardest part during this transition was saying no to all the shiny, new life rafts that kept floating by. Because I’d trained myself to be open to them, my world was abundant with opportunities that fit my *old goal*.

My inbox would be flooded with offers to work on some pretty nice life-rafts. Offers that, just a year ago, I would have jumped on. I haven’t always had the best relationship with money, so saying no income, opportunity, and new connections was difficult.

What saved me from spinning my wheels and chasing ghosts was Neil Gaiman’s question. For every new shiny opportunity that floated past, I’d ask myself, *“Is this still moving me towards my mountain?”*

Neil Gaiman goes on in his speech to say:
> # *I said no to editorial jobs on magazine, proper jobs that would have paid pepper money because I knew that, attractive though they were, for me they would have been walking away from the mountain. And if those job offers had come along earlier I might have taken them, because they still would have been closer to the mountain than I was at the time.*

**Everyone needs a mountain to climb towards. But when the path that started your journey turns out to be a cul-de-sac, don’t waste time circling around.**

Don’t be afraid to say goodbye to the opportunities that helped you get started on your journey. There’s always a new trail around the corner as long as you make space and tune your attention towards it.

And if you reach the top of the mountain and decide that the view isn’t as nice as you’d imagined, just look towards the horizon for your life’s next mountain peak and start moving.

# 6 of the Best Strategies to Ace Customer Engagement

## 

No matter what field you work in, customer engagement is just as essential as lead acquisition. In fact, [68% of marketers](https://c1.sfdcstatic.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/assets/pdf/datasheets/salesforce-research-fourth-annual-state-of-marketing.pdf) today say that their companies compete on the basis of customer experience.

However, many marketers still struggle with figuring out the best ways to keep their customers engaged; holding the attention of customers long enough to make an impact can be hard, time-consuming work. While old-school newsletters still have their place, they alone can’t cut it anymore in today’s competitive environment.

So, what can you do to differentiate yourself from the competition and keep your customers coming back for more? Let’s take a quick look at a few options that you can consider. Not all of these are easy and some may not suit the kind of business you run, so pick what works for you. While some options may not be cheap, losing loyal customers will be far more expensive in the long run.

## 1. Start an Employee Advocacy Program

Your employees are the face of your brand, and their interactions with your customers can go a long way in retaining them. If they’re excited by your brand and believe in the products you have to offer, the customers they talk to will feel that. Conversely, if they are demotivated or unhappy, your customers are definitely going to pick up on that negativity.

An employee advocacy program can help shape your company’s reputation and culture online. By having your employees share snippets of their work life on social media, they can help to build your company’s image as a great workplace with an honest, hard-working team. Not only that — you can even leverage the knowledge of your subject matter experts to create content that has depth and authority.

To encourage participation, you can maintain leaderboards and offer incentives to employees who post the most or get the most engagement. Shoe retailer, Zappos, is well known for their employee advocacy program — snippets of which you can see on the official [Zappos Culture Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZapposCulture).

## 2. Keep Customers Emotionally Connected

The best way to keep a customer engaged is to find ways for them to interact with your brand, even when they aren’t necessarily interested in buying one of your products. You can do this in a number of ways.

### Build a Community

Build a sense of community around your product or service using free tools, such as a designated Twitter handle, Facebook Group, or other online forums where people can meet and exchange ideas.

The idea is to draw your customers into a social circle that is based on the love for your brand or products. Not only are people in these groups more likely to continue buying your products because others are passionately sharing about them, but they’re also likely to recommend them to their other social circles. Their involvement in the community will ensure that they are fully aware of your latest offerings with little marketing effort needed from you.

As an example, BMW manages official “Owners’ clubs” that help their customers connect and learn from one another. Their clubs have grown a big reputation for offering exclusive content, advice, and rewards for car lovers who buy from their brand.

### Host Live Events

Hosting events,conferences, or webinars that will be of interest to your customers is a great way to engage them in a non-transactional setting. Many gaming studios take advantage of in-person events to meet and get feedback from some of their most loyal fans. For customers, it’s an opportunity to see what the company is working on, meet like-minded individuals, have their voices heard by game developers, or play demo builds of upcoming games.

[BlizzCon](https://blizzcon.com/en-us/) by Blizzard-Activision and [QuakeCon](http://www.quakecon.org/) by Zenimax Media both draw in thousands of attendees each year. And tens of thousands more people watch the live-streams of the events online. Attending larger conventions is also an effective (and much cheaper) way to engage with your fans. However, hosting your own event is a great way to keep the focus entirely on you and your products.

## 3. Gamify the Customer Experience

While gamification of a customer experience can be difficult, it allows you to engage customers using the sense of instant gratification.

Digital contests and giveaways are great ways to spur customer engagement for mutually beneficial results. For instance, hair accessories company [Whirl-a-Style hosted a web contest](https://zoomph.com/blog/webpages-built-with-microsite-builder/) asking customers to share their #WhirlMyStyle hairdos for a cash prize. The company earned tons of customer testimonials and marketing UGC at a very low cost.

Similarly, you can introduce badges or achievements for customers who’ve hit a certain milestone or completed a particular task while using your products. This is incredibly useful when it comes to making sure they use your product or services often.

Gaming is already well known for the concept of unlocking achievements. Companies like Fitbit and other fitness tracker makers have had good results by introducing similar aspects to their products.

![*Source: [Fitbit blog](https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-badges/)*](0*3kHrdX2qha7dX_aA.png)**Source: [Fitbit blog](https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-badges/)**

## 4. Target “Whales” for Customized Services

Loyalty programs are a great way to help keep customers engaged with your brand. But you can take it one step further with a tiered loyalty program. Identify customers who spend significantly more than average on your products and consider giving them some sort of V.I.P. status.

While more loyalty points or discounts are nice, customized services are even better. For example, access to a personal stylist at a clothing retailer who offers expert advice in styles suiting body types and personalities.

A personal touch is extremely valuable when it comes to instilling a sense of loyalty in your customers. While you may not be able to offer that to all your customers, make sure your “high-rollers” feel like they’re getting V.I.P. treatment.

## 5. Be Socially Responsible

Often maligned by older generations, millennials tend to be more environmentally and socially conscious than any other generation. (And considering that millennials are already [the largest generation in the labor force](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/11/millennials-largest-generation-us-labor-force/), their loyalty will soon determine whether your business lives or dies.)

Millennials are far more likely to support brands that not only offer valuable products but also support social or environmental causes.

Consider picking a cause that you are interested in and promoting it regularly in your marketing efforts. It can be anything you want as long as you care deeply and sincerely about it. The sincerity is important because millennials are better than previous generations at spotting disingenuous marketing.

For example, Leesa donates a mattress to a homeless shelter for every tenth mattress sold. They even plant a tree for every order received.

## 6. Streamline Your Customer Experience

This option probably takes the most effort to put in place. Depending on how your business operates, it could require small changes or a total overhaul. The key here is to reduce the number of steps needed to complete a transaction. This applies to both physical and online stores.

Every step required to complete a purchase increases the likelihood of customers walking away from a purchase. In stores, these could be long lines, a slow checkout process, or lack of assistance to help make choices.

Fast food giants like McDonalds have attempted to improve the experiences of their customers with the addition of self-service kiosks. These help to drastically cut wait-times without needing to increase staffing requirements.

Online, Amazon introduced 1-click ordering, allowing existing customers to purchase items with a single click. This uses billing, delivery, and payment information that’s already linked to their account.

![Source: Amazon.com](0*DboiaBH5pAhXaZ3T.png)*Source: Amazon.com*

Another great way of improving your customer experience and managing excellent relationships is to use a CRM tool. Tools like [Salesmate](https://www.salesmate.io/) allow you to keep all of your customers’ contact information in one place. You can use it to run email campaigns that include informative and highly-targeted content. You can even do timely follow-ups for any sales queries or interest they may have shown.

# Engineering Yourself (not the genetic way)

## Engineering Yourself (not the genetic way)

I always found it fascinating how some of the most impactful lessons in our lives are unintended consequences of deliberate practices. Spiraling from this bubble of calculated and purposeful actions, tangents of spontaneous phenomena emerge.

We dedicate years to pursuing degrees in clearly defined engineering principles at “elite” universities to one day have a conversation with a customer in the gelato shop you work for that suddenly sparks your curiosity in professional writing. Because of that one second we were late in catching the bus taken everyday to work, we meet the “love of our lives” in the Uber pool ride we’re now forced to take.

The bifurcation of Gwyneth Paltrow’s fate in the 1998 film, *Sliding Doors*, involving profoundly different relationship and career statuses is contingent on the seemingly inconsequential probability of catching a departing train. And the existence of “beautiful topography” in computers today is inspired by Steve Jobs’ decision to drop out of college and offhandedly audit a calligraphy class.

We are the ten clicks on suggested YouTube videos on the right or the deepest layers of Quora searches in. Interestingly, in comparison to the major events we place deliberate emphasis on or take action towards, these spontaneous occurrences are often overlooked.

They appear trivialized due to the lack of initial purpose.

However, these are at times most powerful because they give us the opportunity to become *one* of the permutations of who we *could* be. It brings vitality to some of the most creative and unexpected versions of ourselves.

Desire, purpose, and intention are the fundamentals that form the basis of who we are, but it is the spontaneity and then our reaction to that spontaneity that build the wings allowing us to ultimately take flight.

![Sliding Doors](1*JwyV3EjIR6fId64soypzbQ.jpeg)*Sliding Doors*

In a conversation I was having with my brother the other day over dinner, we were discussing what encompasses the attributes of “successful” students or employees, specifically in difficult classes and nowadays ever so hyped tech companies. We questioned what *exactly* sets those who achieve apart from those who seem to cannot.

Ultimately, we reasoned it down to the mindset.

He proposed that those who declare to themselves they *will* accomplish a set defined goal and then, working backwards from this destination, determine the specific steps needed to take, are elevated by this primed mentality. Those, that instead *hope* to achieve, become lost in a sort of “quantum superposition” between believing their hard work is effective and ineffective.

So, we have now arrived at the art of **reverse engineering**.

In reference to Steve Jobs, as mentioned previously, he claims that only looking backwards has allowed him to see that today’s “beautiful typography” of computers is a consequence of him dropping out of college and attending the calligraphy class.

Everything is so much clearer in hindsight because we have already filled the steps needed to reach our destination. The path has been delineated by what we have already done.

But if there exists a way in which we can create such a strong and concrete visual of the ultimate goal, then we can, with our minds, conceive a landmark from which we can begin to look with retrospect.

We can *reverse engineer* our way back to our current state.

Then maybe we wouldn’t have to drop out of college to undergo the revelation that the science of computers can be beautified by fancily drawn letters.

![(:](1*kuAsvoDLfVwA5v4KIMmWsQ.jpeg)*(:*

However, identifying specifically what you want, discovering all the possible ways to get to it, then determining the most optimal path is difficult. Many even fall short at the initial step of defining an end goal, possibly because we are not yet aware of our passions or because we fear the open-endedness of the problem we have now created for ourselves.

Last semester, I took a psychology class that admittedly, was primarily motivated by the humanity requirement needed to graduate. But out of the entire semester of learning about Freud’s extensive psychosexual analyses and the classical behavioral mechanisms, it was unexpectedly the final paper that I can extract from the curriculum as a pivotal moment.

Interestingly, it wasn’t the essay itself that was particularly meaningful but rather the paper I had stumbled upon in using to support it. I found the paper, *Know Thyself*, by John D. Mayer illuminative because it highlighted on a key aspect, that I only now recognize, as a critical step in the development of one’s ambition and process of reverse engineering.

That aspect being **personal intelligence**.

Personal intelligence, a transformative idea pioneered by Mayer, is the reasoning ability to accurately evaluate oneself and one’s reputation as perceived by others. It is a concept not taught in school and one difficult to deliberately practice.

The power of such an idea lies behind the correlation between heightened personal intelligence and bettered understanding of others. The stronger the perception of oneself, the more adept we are at unlocking the psychological world of another.

Ultimately, greater awareness of other’s limitations and our clarity of sight through the “mental models” of others results in a more harmonious interaction with them. With us being such inherently social creatures and leadership encompassing a dominant pillar in the workforce, this idea can be the catalyst of a thriving ecosystem.

As Mayer puts it brilliantly,
> # One key to personal intelligence is the ability to distinguish our perception of another from who the person really is.

This transcends our personal domain of successfully distinguishing our perception of *ourselves* from who *we* really are.

**Brutal honesty** with what we know and don’t know, what we want and don’t want, what we can and cannot do is the outcome of a bloody battle. Standing naked facing the mirror of self-reflection is paralyzing.

The fear of what we may find is often a barricade to the execution of such a practice.

![Know Thyself](1*iP9AlkR7Wq1qWMmSkmgkyQ.png)*Know Thyself*

And now, we make full circle.
> Personal intelligence, an unintended lesson of my psychology class, illuminates the course of reverse engineering. Our purpose and intent, pathways of reverse engineering, form the core framework of who we are, from which spontaneous phenomena can emerge.

Raw and precise understanding of one’s current identity leads to the robust visualization of a future self. A path, based on fickle self-knowledge, is misguided and falters in the face of, not even harsh circumstances, but of reality.

If you are a writer, don’t just love the *idea* of others falling enchanted with your words, but *write*.

If you are a student, don’t just *hope* that you will perform well on an exam, but rather identify the steps that *guarantee* supremacy of knowledge.

Don’t found a startup because of the *glory* of such a title, but because of your infinite *belief* in a meaningful product that will revolutionize the world.

Make hope obsolete through purpose.

# Here Are 3 Signs Your Team Is Happy — And How You Can Nurture That Every Day

## 

*There’s little that makes a company more successful than a highly motivated, externally focused team that’s stress-free and humming well.*

Everyone deserves to be happy at work. It’s not just the right thing to do; it’s good for business. Your company will become the best version of itself when team members feel great about working for you. There’s science to back me up here — [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328273571_Happiness-A_Business_Strategy) has shown that happy employees make better decisions and are more productive and creative. In other words, team happiness is good for the bottom line!

Here are my three favorite ways of taking a team’s “happiness” temperature, followed by what you can do as a leader to cultivate that happiness.

### **Sign 1: Team members are comfortable with passionate debate.**

People should not only be comfortable with debate, but energized by it.

Respectful debate drives innovation. People who challenge their teammates’ ideas improve each other and the company as a whole. Here are some signs that the team isn’t wrangling the very best ideas: People are either too nice to confront and challenge each other, or too competitive and eager to look smart.

Teams that are too nice are stymied by fear offending each other. When competition and eagerness kick in, people can be hesitant to share valuable ideas for fear of being put down.
> # With intention, you can create a culture where people embrace healthy disagreement.

At my startup, [NakedPoppy](https://nakedpoppy.com/), we have a rule that debate and challenging each other are encouraged — but it should never, ever be taken or intended personally. Our team members can disagree intensely, but the feeling should always be, “She makes me better,” not, “She makes me feel bad.”

A happy team is comfortable with themselves and each other. They enjoy friendly, productive, potentially eye-opening exchanges. And people leave meetings feeling enlightened and challenged, not disrespected or defeated.

### **Sign 2: People are externally focused.**

I call team members who worry too much about themselves at work “[internally focused](https://medium.com/swlh/why-i-tell-my-team-members-to-never-ask-for-a-raise-and-what-i-say-ill-do-for-them-instead-4cef694cb8ac).” An internally focused person might be thinking about how and when to ask for a raise, dwelling on office politics, or wondering if someone else is getting credit for their work.

But internal focus isn’t necessarily the team’s fault.

A great manager knows it’s up to them to proactively reward their people for their achievements — so the team is freed up to focus on the customer instead of thinking about recognition and rewards from the company. A happy team member spends far less time worrying about themselves and far more time doing great work for the customer.

### **Sign 3: People are excited to come to work every day.**

Here’s my definition of being happy on the job.

First, you don’t get “the Sunday blues.” You know, that feeling of anxiety — or even dread — that sets in Sunday evening when you think about going to work the next morning. Happy employees don’t feel that way, because they enjoy Monday, Friday, and every day in between.

Second, you genuinely fall in love with your job, because your work energizes and inspires you.

Finally, work no longer even feels like work. You love your workplace, solving problems, and collaborating with your coworkers. You even look forward to returning to work if you’ve been away for a while!

For example, on New Year’s Day, I found myself feeling giddy about the thought of walking into my office at [NakedPoppy](https://nakedpoppy.com/) the following morning. I couldn’t wait to get back. And, as I later found out, my co-founder Kimberly felt the same way.
> I’ve seen throughout my 30-plus-year career that when you can assemble a team of people who love their jobs and are enthusiastic about coming to work every day, your team can be unstoppable.

These are just a few of the characteristics I look for in a healthy team. But these qualities don’t just develop organically. It takes intentional effort to bring together a team of motivated, productive people.

While there are many things you can do to boost happiness at your company, here are a few that come to mind:

* **Articulate a simple, inspiring vision, or “north star”
**People are wired to want their work to matter. Every team member should understand how what they do every day contributes to your larger mission. When it comes to your company’s north star, err on the side of over-communication. What feels repetitive to you is often a wonderfully consistent and motivating reminder for your team. Describe the impact your company has on the world, and your team will have purpose and direction.

* **Help your team focus — and use [the 80/20 rule](https://medium.com/swlh/3-steps-to-finding-the-all-important-20-percent-that-will-skyrocket-your-business-s-success-b7a861d76180). **Don’t overload people with more than they can handle. And when they feel overwhelmed, help them prioritize, or in other words, focus on the uber-important 20% of effort that gives you 80% of your results.

* **Be intentional about “depersonalizing” success and failure. **At NakedPoppy, we’ve instituted “blame-free retrospectives,” where we dissect how we can improve without anyone having to feel guilty or defensive. We also avoid using names as much possible. For example, if I say “Nancy’s idea”, and Nancy got the idea from Matt, Matt may expend energy to ensure he gets credit. The truth is, it doesn’t even matter, because we all build on each other’s ideas anyway. You win as a team, so focus on the team.

* **Nip issues in the bud. **When you notice an issue that may threaten your culture, address it quickly. No matter how great your team is or how well your company is doing, relationships among people can get messy, so the best and kindest strategy is to deal with them swiftly.

* **Be curious about your people. **Remember their kids’ names. Ask your junior salesperson how their post-surgery shoulder therapy is going. Establishing a personal connection can make all the difference in demonstrating that you care. It may seem like common sense, but it can be easy to overlook. Never be too busy to show you care.

* **Don’t tolerate people who hurt your culture — no matter how talented they are.** A single person can threaten a good culture, and even throw into doubt your commitment to it. So don’t let “bozos” (or bullies) continue. Make no exceptions, no matter how talented someone is.

* **Beam your own happiness. **Team members are hypersensitive to their manager’s demeanor. Even when something goes wrong, it’s important to make an effort to remain positive for the sake of team morale.

Now for a personal note. I do everything I can to orchestrate happy teams because I enjoy being surrounded by people who love their jobs. :)

So, I see a happy team as a triple win: It’s good for business and productivity, good for the team, and nice for you as well!

# Born To Be Unhappy. How We Can Overcome Our Own Biology. (Part 2 of 4)

## Wisdom from the ages

![](1*BLB3AX3Fq49bsQPXrbbOQw.jpeg)

In [Part 1 of this series**,](https://medium.com/@yinonweiss/born-to-be-unhappy-a-guide-to-living-a-better-life-part-1-of-4-73cb072a8152) **we reviewed the state of human happiness and why so many people are unhappy. These conditions have been long understood by great philosophers across many civilizations, so before jumping into Part 3 (Ten Tenets to Guide a Better Life), let’s first reflect on what the wisdom of the ages can provide us.

This post gets a bit academic but is recommended for those looking for greater context. I also want to give proper credit to the philosophies that have influenced me.

## The Philosophy of Buddhism

This is not a comprehensive analysis of Buddhism, which has enormous depth and many sects (from classical Buddhism to Zen Buddhism). I will address only core tenets and acknowledge that the entire practice of Buddhism is quite a bit more complicated. Nonetheless, let’s move forward.

Gautama Buddha is the founder of Buddhism and lived around 2500 years ago. As a sage, he observed misery and suffering in people from all walks of life and sought solutions to what appeared to be chronic human suffering.
> # Buddha’s noble truths say that people are unhappy everywhere and that suffering comes from our craving for more and from our fear of losing what we have.

He also said that there is a solution to mass human suffering and that it’s rooted in one’s internal state of mind.

Buddhism presents many general rules for following a positive path such as living a kind and compassionate life, but a core component of Buddhism is that the cure to unhappiness is to stop craving things that most humans naturally crave such as sensual pleasures, fame, and recognition. People must detach themselves from craving and attachment to possessions and status.
> # *Good men, at all times, surrender in truth all attachments. The holy spend not idle words on things of desire. — Buddha*

For example, one’s focus on getting promoted sows the seeds of unhappiness because once one gets the promotion he will just have to work harder for the next promotion. Similarly, there may be people who are living in fear of losing their job. In reality, neither keeping your job nor getting promoted can make you happy because as long as you remain in a state of desire you will be unhappy.
> # According to Buddhism, the path to happiness requires us to not crave more, to not fear losing what we have, and to be mindful and at peace with ourselves at all times.

Buddhism also directs us to avoid unpleasant but natural emotions like fear, anger, and jealousy. This all sounds great, but personally I find it rather impractical to implement. It’s difficult to undo our fundamental human nature. More importantly, I don’t want to deny my emotions and desires, I just want to control them instead of having them control me.

### Buddhism is a tough sell even if it is selling happiness

A study of [happiness among different religions](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10943-017-0481-2.pdf) seems to validate some of the challenges of Buddhism (spoiler: Protestants were the happiest). If Buddhists were really that much happier, I imagine we would see Buddhism more strongly sweeping the west rather than remaining relatively isolated in progressive yoga studios and hippie pop culture.

When you think of an idealized Buddhist monk you may think of somebody detached from the rest of the world. He is at a monastery on top of an isolated fog covered mountain. He is depriving himself of worldly temptations in order to avoid craving and achieving inner peace. He reaches nirvana by achieving nothingness and emptiness. That’s impressive — but not what I want to do.

![Buddhist meditating in a secluded mountain — an arch-type of a successful Buddhist](1*VnaEXSwE_Xun0SkyCtjUhg.jpeg)*Buddhist meditating in a secluded mountain — an arch-type of a successful Buddhist*

I am therefore attracted to parts of Buddhism but not others. On a practical level, we are fathers, mothers, managers, workers, and just regular every day people. We have businesses to run and schools to pay for. I’m not looking to separate myself from the world.

I also don’t want to lose the sense of having a powerful passion and ambition in my life, but I do need a healthy way to manage my emotions.

Furthermore, I also believe in our ambitious progress as a species. I believe that human life dominating the galaxy and beyond some day is generally a good thing. I applaud the ambition that propels our species rather than seek to individually deny it. So there are many components of Buddhism that I take, and some that I leave.

**To summarize my take on Buddhism:**

1. **Buddhism identifies that our suffering comes from craving and desire**

1. **Buddhism seeks to isolate ourselves from such desires and create inner peace**

1. **I don’t want to wipe away my passions and desires, I just want to control them rather than to have them control me**

## The Philosophy of Stoicism

Stoicism is a philosophy with some branding challenges. The last thing my wife would want from me is to be even more stoic in the modern sense of the word in which one doesn’t express feelings and suffers in silence. When she asks me how my day went, she never seems satisfied with “it was fine.”

The origin of Stoicism comes from the Greek word *stōïkos, meaning “of the porch” *which supposedly refers to an ancient porch where original Greek Stoics taught. The philosophy has little in common with its modern day popular use, so please disregard the branding and let’s focus on what Stoicism is as a philosophy.

![](1*KWn10SoLqq3YxI2QgL3FWQ.jpeg)

Both Buddhism and Stoicism acknowledge that the source of suffering originates from our craving, desires, and counter-productive emotions. While Buddhism encourages us to strip away those natural but unproductive behaviors, Stoicism attempts to equip us to handle them in every day life.

Stoicism teaches us how to manage our passions and desires so that we control them instead of them controlling us.

A revered Buddhist may put himself in an isolated mountain where life’s tempting urges cannot compromise his mind. Stoicism is different. It is for the single parent, for the business executive, for the farmer, for the programmer, for the every day person who is seeking to both lead a happy life and to work toward leaving a significant mark on the world.
> # The monk dresses in his robes. A priest puts on his collar. A banker wears an expensive suit and carries a briefcase. A Stoic has no uniform and resembles no stereotype. They are not identifiable by look or by sight or by sound. The only way to recognize them? By their character. — Ryan Holiday

Stoicism teaches us to live in the moment, to focus only on what we can control, and to treat others fairly and justly. If I were to summarize Stoicism in one sentence, I would describe it as follows:
> # We can’t control everything that happens to us but we can control how we interpret what happens to us and how we respond.

What appeals to me about Stoicism as opposed to Buddhism is that I don’t strip away my ambition. I just improve how I manage it.

I’m quite bullish on human progress and I want to contribute to the progress of life across the universe.
> # Stoicism equips me to pursue external achievement while at the same time not relying on this achievement to be the source of my happiness.

**To summarize my take on Stoicism:**

1. **Stoicism is an ancient philosophy meant to improve the every day lives of every day people**

1. **Stoicism equips us with a perspective that enables us to control our ambition, desires, and emotions, rather than them controlling us**

1. **At the heart of Stoicism is the idea that happiness comes from our own reasoned choices and not by outcomes and external events we cannot control**

I will discuss the practical application of Stoicism in Part 3: A guide to living a better life. You can also learn more about Stoicism [here](https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/).
> # Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they happen, and your life will go well. — Epictetus

## Putting it all together

As animals, we are subject to slow forces of evolution and we’ve developed instincts, biases, and heuristics that help us thrive in the wild but which are completely out of place in the world we live in now. As discussed in [Part 1: Born to be unhappy](https://medium.com/@yinonweiss/born-to-be-unhappy-a-guide-to-living-a-better-life-part-1-of-4-73cb072a8152), our DNA has not caught up to the world we find ourselves in.

Many of our cognitive shortcuts lead us to the wrong conclusion and wrong decision. The emotions meant to protect us from being killed by a rival tribe or a mountain lion are now screwing with our psyche in a world of abundance.

Influenced by many authors and ancient philosophies, I have put together Ten Tenets to guide myself for a better life and help keep myself on track. I wrote them to bring clarity to my way of thinking and as part of my continuous journey of self-discovery and improvement. If it has any benefit to others than that is a graceful bonus.

# 7 Ways You Can Make More Money With Google AdWords

## 

Should you advertise your business using [Google AdWords](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/4-ways-google-just-made-mobile-app-advertising-more-awesome.html)? Is it effective?

Yes! And I’m going to tell you why.

More than anything else, AdWords enables you to target the people who are searching for and ready to purchase the exact products or services you’re selling right now. Often these people need little persuasion — they just need to know where to buy it.

That’s just one reason why AdWords is so freaking cool. It puts your company and message in front of people who are ready (or very nearly ready) to buy.

Google AdWords isn’t the only marketing channel or bit of technology that can help grow your business. You’ll also want to invest your time and money in other key technologies to fuel your growth — such as [remarketing](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/5-proven-ways-remarketing-will-make-your-business-successful-first-90-days.html), [Facebook ads](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-important-reasons-you-need-to-use-facebook-ads-right-now-first-90-days.html), [your website](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/7-insane-website-hacks-to-triple-sales-first-90-days.html), and [tools to understand your target market](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/3-free-tools-that-help-you-understand-your-customers-grow-sales-first-90-days.html), to name just a few.

But AdWords is your next big win. With a little effort and the right investment, you’ll start attracting more prospects and customers, making more sales, and growing your business and revenues.

For [more than 15 years](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/28/adwords-turns-15), businesses of all types and sizes have realized the value of Google’s advertising system.

Google is constantly adding new features and functions in an effort to improve their product. AdWords is so deep that you can literally do thousands of things.

Overwhelmed about where you should focus? Don’t be. I’m going to tell you where you can get the biggest bang for your business.

Here are seven of the most powerful AdWords features from the last year or so.

## 1. Call-Only Campaigns

[Call-Only](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/google-call-only-campaigns) ads are very much like the traditional pay-per-click (PPC) ads you see on Google’s search results pages. The key difference is that these ad encourage people to call your business, rather than visit your website.

What’s so amazingly powerful about Call-Only Campaign ads is that they are immediate. Google makes it super easy for potential customers to reach a business at the exact moment they want to do something, and also makes it easy for that business to capture the lead.

It’s incredibly smart to allow hot prospects to simply call you, rather than sending them to a landing page. Call-Only Campaigns allow you to capture 100 percent of leads, rather than the 3 percent conversion rate, on average, you’d get from sending people to a landing page.

## 2. RLSA

Another incredibly valuable Google AdWords feature — especially for small businesses with a smaller advertising budget — is Remarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSAs).

Basically, RLSAs let you target people who are already familiar with your brand (people who have visited your site and received a cookie) and searching Google using keywords you’re bidding on. Talk about people who are ready to buy!

Your ads will cost less and result in more conversions. Win-win!

## 3. Customer Match

[Customer Match](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/11/02/adwords-customer-match-setup) is a featured I’ve called “THE most exciting AdWords update in the history of the platform.” No hype. This is another way Google helps you reach people who already know your company — talk about low-hanging fruit!

Customer Match is an extremely efficient way to reach people on Search, Gmail, or YouTube. They will experience different ads based on their stage of their consumer journey (e.g., a prospect vs. an existing customer vs. a frequent buyer).

Simply upload a list of your prospects’ email addresses, and then Google matches that list with customers who use Google products. I did an experiment and determined Customer Match had an excellent match rate of 50.4 percent.

## 4. Gmail ads

[Gmail ads](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/01/gmail-ads) appear within the Promotions tab of Gmail, and target users based on their personal account activity.

One of the biggest keys to Gmail ads success is to write subject lines that will attract huge numbers of clicks — the more clicks you get, the less you’ll pay.

Check out the performance data from your existing email marketing campaigns. Look for the ones with the highest open rates — your unicorns! — and use those for your Gmail Ads campaigns.

Keyword targeting is also incredibly powerful. Consider targeting the trademarks of your competitors to potentially steal some sales. If people are thinking about buying something from your competitor, that means they’re also in the market for what you sell — they just might not know it yet!

## 5. YouTube ads

More than 6 billion hours of video are watched every month on YouTube. That makes YouTube a massive opportunity to reach your target audience. How?

Using YouTube’s TrueView ads, you can reach your target audience as they’re watching videos.

With TrueView videos you only pay when people view 30 seconds of your video ad (or if they otherwise engage, such as clicking on an overlay, banner, or card). If someone clicks on the “skip ad” button before your video ad finishes, you don’t pay.

## 6. Custom affinity audiences

AdWords’ custom affinity audiences is a Display Network feature that gives you the ability to target an predetermined group of people who are likely to be interested in your specific product or niche.

There are more than 80 options — from technophiles, to pet lovers, to sports fans, and so much more.

You can take this a step further with custom affinity segments, which lets you create your own subsets of each affinity audience. Google shared an [example from Electronic Arts](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/products/custom-affiniity-audiences.html), which created 32 custom audiences to reach fans of specific NFL teams.

## 7. New AdWords app for iOS

In January, Google released the [AdWords App for iOS](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/01/29/adwords-app-ios), nearly an entire year after the app became available for Android users.

This helpful, complementary tool allows you to quickly manage your AdWords campaigns while you’re on the move ­- you can change your keyword bids, and enable or disable campaigns, ads, and ad groups.

Essentially, AdWords for iOS has two helpful functions: it provides a way to handle the small stuff quickly, and acts as alert system to let you know which areas of your account need your attention when you can get on your PC or laptop.

## Conclusion

To truly be successful, your company must be present in the places where people are looking for things (Google search) and spend so much time (YouTube, Gmail). If your company isn’t there, chances are your competitors are.

Without a doubt, Google AdWords is extremely effective. AdWords can deliver more traffic from consumers who are more likely to convert or are ready to buy at this very moment.

Many businesses and brands have grown through AdWords over the past 15 years, and this will only continue this year. Start using these seven powerful features and you’ll be well on your way to becoming the next AdWords success story!

# “I don’t want to die.” | 7 Life Lessons From the Abyss

## “I don’t want to die.” | 7 Life Lessons From the Abyss

*“Hello!? Are you okay?!”* she asked, as I lay in a puddle of my own sweat.

At least I thought it was my sweat.

Bewildered I asked, *“What happened?!”*

*“I don’t know! Do you want me to call an ambulance?”*

*“Sure,” *I said resignedly.

*“Can you move?”*

I lifted my arms an inch before they slammed back down on the table,* “Yes, but I have no energy.”* The thought of what this could all mean started to frighten me, *“I don’t want to die.”*

She didn’t hear me because of the commotion in the cafe and because there was a bit of a language barrier since I live here in Vietnam.

![](1*weFJxlm5PN0VyKlNZZI-PA.png)

The medics emerged with a stretcher. They checked my blood pressure, glucose, heart rate — all seemed normal, which worried me even more.

I then got lifted out of there like Maximus at the end of Gladiator.

![](1*EG8il6k0VOKvMeZJBUtnPw.png)

## Fast Forward

I’m sitting across from the neurologist. At this point I had spent a few days in bed with a numb tongue and an aching back pondering the worst case scenarios… epilepsy, cancer, heart disease, Parkinson’s? I didn’t understand how someone so young and healthy can go through such an ordeal unless there was a deep underlying medical issue.

The neurologist asked me to recall the events that led to the seizure…

![](1*yLCNyqrqvdkNnUPsYc1szw.png)
> “It was a typical day. I had just finished my coffee and cocaine. Kidding, coffee and cake. As I was getting ready to leave I felt my heart flutter. This has been happening on and off for the past several months. I decided to do a quick google search. The prognosis varied from nothing to imminent death. I’m an optimist so I told myself it’s probably nothing, but then I started to feel dizzy then nauseous. I told myself, “Don’t throw up.”, “Don’t throw up”. I leaned back in my seat to take a deep breath. I saw flashes of lights and images and then every thing went black. I awoke in a puddle of sweat.”

He recommended an E.E.G. *(tests epilepsy)*.

![](1*9WGPSlyNQQEB5S-DAgxeqQ.png)

I took the test and sat back down with the doctor. He said the results came back… normal. THANK GOD.

He asked me if I’ve ever lost consciousness before?

3 times.

Once when I was robbed and knocked unconscious with a pipe *{story for another time, kids}*.

And twice before that while giving blood.

He said that it was likely syncope, which is a fancy term for fainting.

He explained to me that if one is out for too long the lack of oxygen to the brain will cause a seizure, which was the difference between this time and the other times I fainted.

I wanted to kiss the doctor because it was the first time in days where I didn’t think I was dying.

I walked out of that hospital with a post-sex afterglow.

With any major life event, I think it could be helpful to reflect upon the lessons learned so that the **event would not have passed in vain**. These were costly lessons for me *(no health insurance)*, but I give them to you free of cost and without the associated back pain…

## Lessons

**Prepare to die.** One of my regrets while lying motionless on the stretcher was that I still had so much more I wanted to accomplish. At this point in my life I feel like I’m in debt. I’m in debt to my friends, family, and society. I want to pay back that debt with interest before I die. *“For whom much is given much is required.”* I also want to plan out and finance my own funeral so that it is one less thing my family has to worry about. And if finances permit, I’d like to be cryopreserved so that my last words can be something badass like, *“I’ll be back!”*

**Non-Conscious Being.** The loss of consciousness is an interesting concept to ponder. Isn’t it our *“consciousness” *that makes us human? So what does it mean to lose it? I’m not dead, but I’m also not conscious. Existence is funky. I ponder if losing consciousness is similar to death? Flashes of light and images. Everything goes black. Time no longer exists. I re-awake without knowing whether seconds or hours passed. In that brief interval “I” no longer existed. My experience was similar to a guy who was actually pronounced dead: *“Asked about what he felt the moment he died, the Reddit interviewee revealed that it was like as if someone had flipped the on/off switch… everything around him went to black.”* Obviously I wasn’t dead, but it doesn’t seem farfetched for my experience to be similar to it. The abyss wasn’t painful, but with that said, my first impulse upon reawakening was to say, *“I don’t want to die.”*

**Hey God, it’s me! **I am an agnostic who would like to think there’s a god, especially during low moments. I find the lower we go the higher we look for strength and support. As I went into the MRI machine I was asking god for my brain to be okay and I promised I’ll try harder to not to take his creations for-granted.

**Existence feels solid.** Sometimes I ponder why the heck more bad things don’t happen to me. Why don’t I have a serious illness? Get hit by a car and die? Why doesn’t a meteor crash down and kill us all? Why do I feel safe in such a volatile world? It’s because relative to my timescale these things are rare. The chances of us dying this second is unlikely, but the chances of us dying this century is likely, which relative to the universe’s timescale is still but a second. Look at the stars. We are merely a flicker of dust on a massive pinball machine.

**Thoughts are more powerful than you thought.** I read that some people are able to make themselves faint. I feel like now that I’ve experienced it so many times I can probably do so too {call me Hollywood} by tunneling my thoughts on a stressor, which makes me ponder if we have the power to lose consciousness then maybe we have the power to maximize it?

**Life is a game.** After returning from the abyss I feel reinforced in my belief that life is like a game where eventually we’ll be hit with GAME OVER. The difference is we don’t get an instruction manual despite what the major religions tell us. We must either come up with our own or attach to a preexisting one {or mixture of the two}. We can also change the game we are playing overtime if it becomes too boring or difficult. In any game though the more you can push through the difficult levels the greater the glory and satisfaction. It’s also in seeing life as a game that we shouldn’t take ourselves too seriously.

**Embrace the black. **Upon returning from the abyss I’ve had a greater appreciation for the beauty and richness of life. We are all so inundated with notifications, advertisements, emergencies that corrode the enjoyment of simple pleasures. Meditation seems the closest thing to nothing. Imagine meditating for a full day in a dark room. The next day you step outside you’ll have a greater appreciation for the light. When we start to feel like we’re losing appreciation for simple pleasures then consider going into a metaphorical or actual hole.

*Thanks for reading! I hope you may also find these lessons helpful during your darkest moments.*

# 7 Bad Slack Habits That Make Your Coworkers Hate You

## 7 Bad Slack Habits That Make Your Coworkers Hate You

### Don’t send the gif of David Tennant standing in the rain.

***By [Mel Burke](https://twitter.com/melburkewrites), staff writer***

Slack has only been around for a little over 5 years, but the communication app’s signature “shhhtick-thunk-thunk-thunk” has invaded our dreams.

It’s on our computers, tablets, phones, ensuring we are always around and available regardless of whether or not our laptop is even open. Between weekend updates, productivity and workflow management, and whatever other “pings” need to happen, chances are you’ve heard that strange arrow-hitting-a-bamboo-wall sound a few hundred times a day.

And while it’s not like a social media platform in that you’re publically broadcasting your thoughts to all [8 million daily active users](https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/slack-statistics/), you’re stilling speaking to the majority of your company regularly.

It just doesn’t feel like it.

The problem is, before Slack, we were conditioned to understand messaging services were for personal use. You already use Facebook Messenger, texting, iMessage, WhatsApp, and Snapchat regularly to [talk with your buddies](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/matthew-jones/discover-who-your-true-friends-are-5-things-you-should-pay-close-attention-to/). If your boss sent you a Snapchat about a work question, that would feel weird. Not weird enough to stop you from screenshotting it and asking what that was all about in the morning — but still definitely weird.

Which is why [Slack can blur the lines](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-navigate-office-etiquette-on-slack-1818966577) of what is and isn’t professional conduct.

It feels like any other messaging service on your phone or desktop, which may make it feel like it’s okay to carry that same conversational tone into what would [otherwise function as an office](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/staff/how-to-build-company-culture-trade-your-coffee-machine-for-these-15-unique-team-building-exercises/). And the service is so new, there’s very little written on how you should or shouldn’t comport yourself. I mean, you can send gifs and react with emojis — that’s an invitation to express yourself truly, right?

Wrong, my friend. *So wrong*.

So, because no one else is going to tell you and I love nothing more than stomping on someone else’s parade, here are all the things you’re doing on Slack to make your coworkers hate you.

## 1) You Gif EVERYTHING.

Look, gifs have become internet shorthand in almost every online space. They’re an incredibly powerful and complex way to express emotion without having to be face to face. So I’m not saying you *can’t* use them in Slack — just not for *everything*.

Did HR announce over Slack that your coworker is leaving? Don’t send the gif of David Tennant standing in the rain. Did your boss send you a note telling you your last post wasn’t up to par? Don’t send Alicia Silverstone in Clueless shrugging “My Bad” over her shoulder. “But Mel,” you whisper to the screen. “No one would do that, that’s rude.”

To which I say, rules exist because *someone* did it.

And while we’re here, let’s talk about how even in gif-appropriate situations your choices might still suck. If your coworker is celebrating their 2 year anniversary with the company, don’t send the first gif that pops up for the word “celebrate.” You may end up with *that* Jason Segal wiggle scene from Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

## 2) You use a winky face.

Dating apps ruined the winky face.

And you can pull that claim from my cold, metaphorically dead hands. Unless you’re trying to date your coworkers (which is HR’s headache, this isn’t that type of article) just don’t send it.

Do you feel like this guideline is smashing your creative expression into a thousand minuscule shards never to be recovered again by man nor beast? Then allow me to not-so-gently offer the male and female supervillain emojis that have been so painstakingly crafted for you by the team at Apple.

## 3) Everyone’s your best friend whether they like it or not.

Diving further into the overly-friendly theme, you can’t just run around Slacking everyone like they’re your most intimate bosom buddy. I don’t care if they’re your work wife. No one you know in a professional capacity needs to know how wasted you were on Friday or how bad Sunday’s date was.

And that goes for jargon or pet names as well. No one at work is your “bro/dude/babe/chiquita/boi.”

## 4) That joke wasn’t funny.

You know that killer joke about the [insert specific group here] that screwed in a lightbulb?

Don’t tell it.

## 5) You send 10 messages for something that could be condensed into one.

We all have that one friend

who sends texts

like this.

And it blows up your phone because

they can’t be bothered to chill on the enter arrow

for like

a

minute.

Same issue applies in Slack — but times 10. Sending a billion messages to communicate one thing makes you look like you don’t know what you’re talking about. So if you send your message too early or need to add something or just hate it altogether because anxiety is a helluva beast, then smack that edit button and adjust it. Voila, multi-enter syndrome conquered.

## 6) You @here or @channel for questions that could be directed at one person.

You might not know that the @here or @channel function in Slack sends a notification directly to everyone in public channels — either to everyone active or simply everyone joined, respectively.

So unless your question could actually be answered by literally anyone in the channel, don’t ask it there — or at least don’t use the tag that makes everyone’s computer get a notification.

## 7) Or worse — you don’t check before asking questions.

Far be it from me to tell anyone to never ask questions. I am the queen of questions. But one of the things I’m guilty of is not always checking for answers on my own before pinging anyway.

Yes. I absolutely ask questions that could have been answered with either a quick Google sesh, or a trip back through old training materials. And the problem here is *not *that I’m asking for help, questioning a set rule, or tapping into my deep-seated vulnerability issues in order to improve my world view (Hey look! I’m not entirely alone! People will help me if I ask!).

It’s that I’ve sent someone yet another Slack notification, that will require more of their time to answer, which they will do by sending me a link I could’ve easily found on my own. And that link will send *me* another Slack notification.

Basically, it all comes down to respecting your coworkers’ time. Don’t waste it, and they won’t hate you — at least not because of your Slack etiquette.

# WHAT WE BELIEVE IN

## WHAT WE BELIEVE IN

I am a capitalist.

If you are a liberated person, you are a capitalist. If your nation is liberated, it is a capitalist nation. If you are fighting for individual freedom, in any corner of this globe, you are by extension also fighting for capitalism, because there cannot be freedom without capitalism. Individual freedom has illuminated our human existence. There has never been a force for good in this world as powerful, or as important. Consider the painting that moved you to tears, the composition that catalyzed your philosophical awakening, the computer — lightning in a bottle! Behind every work of genius is a free mind, a single man or woman who laid their hands to the world and shaped it into something new. But today capitalism is at risk, and with it the progressive potential of the human race.

Since the Industrial Revolution proponents of capitalism have ceded intellectual ground to ideological cancers ranging from the confused to the nihilistic. The nature of capitalism has been challenged. The fruits of capitalism have been challenged. Today even the definition of the word — capitalism — is challenged. The failure of the capitalist to defend his position has been so complete as to corrode even the thinking of our own. Many who defend capitalism today now freely accept, and even drive forward, the utterly absurd, demonstrably false notion that the free nations of Europe are no longer capitalist. Many argue similarly ignorant positions concerning the injection of some additional “empathy” into capitalism, as if it were a way of life, and “new kinds of capitalism,” as if man’s right to freedom came in numerous varieties as apples at the grocer. The future of our free people has never been so precarious, but our contemporary tragedy is this: we are not staring at liberty’s collapse in popularity because slavery is a new and compelling idea. Every philosophical threat the free world faces can be ascribed to a failure on the part of capitalists to make their case for freedom — a failure to fight. I believe freedom is worth fighting for, and that we must.

Language is our first and most important front. The capitalist has truth in his favor. The arguments for freedom are strong, persuasive, and, when left to choose, the great majority choose liberty. To counter this basic human impulse — with well-meaning intentions or not, it is difficult to know — many now work to redefine the words we use to learn about the world and how it functions. The effect of such labor has made it almost impossible to truthfully navigate political philosophy at scale. Ceding terms, to any degree, must no longer be tolerated.

The definition of capitalism is, and has been from its inception some close version of, “an economic system in which trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit.” On top of this system, Americans, and many others, have created different kinds of governments. But capitalism is not itself a kind of government. Capitalism is neither concerned with class nor economic outcome. It is not an argument on behalf of the wealthy. It is not an argument for some manner in which we may or should compete, and it is not an argument for moral goodness of material acquisition. Capitalism is not an indictment of the poor, or the state, or God. Capitalism is agnostic on everything but this single point: what the individual produces, the individual owns. In this way, capitalism does not merely acknowledge a human right, but is itself the acknowledgment of the human right to own property. This right to property acknowledged *is* the system. Where property is owned, property can be traded. This is most commonly observed in the case of labor, the fruits of which can be, and often are, traded for money. The rights to our time, to the product of our labor, and to association — our freedom to trade with whomever we want, on whatever grounds we choose — we call liberty. One can argue against capitalism, and there are rational arguments against it, however so immoral. But one cannot deny the definition of capitalism, one cannot deny its explicit agency in human freedom, and one must never entertain the twisting of such definitions.

With the link between capitalism and freedom here re-established, let us consider freedom. Too often it has been assumed the nature of freedom obvious. For this, I hope, the American may be excused, as our founding fathers did instruct us in the folly from the start: “we hold these truths to be self-evident.” It unfortunately appears they were not. Despite the genius of our government at founding, the architects of America left us vulnerable, and not to despotic kings abroad. We are vulnerable to our own wandering minds, and to the few among us who would take advantage of this lapse in self-regard. It is absolutely essential we recover this philosophical ground: man’s right to freedom is inalienable because it is innate. Freedom is natural.

Freedom exists in a vacuum. There are no material or productive requirements for freedom, and while it is possible for elections to exist in a free state, elections do not create freedom. To a free people some form of government is advisable, as government has proven our most effective defense of liberty. But liberty absolutely precedes government. Freedom emerges immediately, from humanity’s first principle: the individual. A man alone in a forest is free. He can speak and move and work, and what he creates he controls. He may be lonely, but it cannot be denied the decisions he makes, for better outcome or for worse, are his own. Freedom may then thrive in a pair where both parties acknowledge such freedom exists, and here again with no property, maintenance, nor outside force required to sustain it. Freedom may exist in a small group, in a large group, on an island, on a continent. The free man’s life may be threatened, and in fact all of our lives are threatened — always — by nature. But his freedom is not applied. His freedom may be subverted, suppressed, or forgotten, but it is a part of him as his own mind. Freedom is in fact the philosophical incarnation of the mind — an abstract mirror of that thing called self with which we are most intimately acquainted. A state of freedom is, as breathing oxygen, the natural condition of the human being.

As freedom is natural, the burden of proof for arguments pertaining to its necessary restriction belongs to those who would restrict it, and there are indeed questions pertaining to the nature of freedom that are made in good faith: does total human freedom lead to chaos? If so, would such chaos make irrelevant the individual’s freedom? What possible good could be liberty, after all, were one a citizen of hell? From such questions have emerged a theory of protecting liberty grounded in a social contract principally concerning force. As the free man must also acknowledge the freedom of others in order for a free world to function, and as there have always, and will likely always be, some men who would violently subvert such freedom for any number of immoral reasons, the institution of a liberal government was established. The purpose of a liberal government is the monopolization of force, and the application of that force in the service of protecting individual liberty. The force our government is permitted to apply in the service of protecting individual liberty is determined by law, and in the United States of America this law is designed in the freest manner our founders could imagine: democratically, with a vital check. No law shall be passed that subverts the natural law — individual freedom. There are several examples of such delicate machinations in service of liberty, in my opinion none so elegant, so historically significant, as the U.S. Constitution.

But long before the first European settlers of the American continents had even dreamt so bold a thing as the historic journey across the Atlantic Ocean, the effects of freedom could be felt by humanity. Indeed, such liberty enabled exploration. As long as there have been governments there have been restrictions on freedom to varying degree, but in Europe the right to freedom was first named, and first protected. So it was in Europe that humanity came of age. From Europe, the seeds of America, and the western world began its rapid transformation from an agrarian race to a spacefaring civilization. Today, every nation in the western world is a capitalist nation. In each, rights to property and exchange of property are acknowledged, and personal property is protected. The liberal tradition of European government precipitated the greatest boon to creative output in history, and a centuries-long, exponentially-accelerating prosperity — measured empirically in GDP per capita, and in the literal, mathematical sense of the word “exponential.” From the Renaissance to the Reformation to the Enlightenment, free people designed the engine of human civilization, and we are moving towards something spectacular.

Spanning the cultural gamut from Christ’s prayer for heaven on Earth to the utopian lore of San Francisco transhumanists, and the technological quest for a world post-scarcity, the common goal of free people has been clear for thousands of years: we are here to perfect this world, and through this work ourselves. Push further: we are here to build a high-energy civilization, to master the mechanics of our reality and to prevent the expiration of our universe. Free people will complete our centuries-long march toward the eradication of hunger, disease, and poverty. We will eliminate the material preconditions of creativity, and we will build a world where that which you can build is limited only by the bounds of your imagination. There will be knowledge for every man who seeks it, and the ability to become whatever we want. The mind of the human being is a miracle, and from it our dreams have ever preceded our destiny. But the material realization of our dreams cannot be accomplished without our freedom to material, nor our freedom to shape material.

With freedom, and from the freest nations in history, every step of this world’s technological, scientific, and cultural advance has been taken. Such steps have been taken for many reasons, profit, idealism, and self-preservation among them. The contributions here of private industry are obvious, and woven into almost every aspect of the modern world: the computer I’m writing from, on top of the desk I’m sitting at, beside stacks of books edited and bound by New York City publishers, beneath Edison’s electric light, while clothed, bathed, and nourished by medicines and products invented first and then delivered all for profit. These contributions of private industry are impossible to deny but by the most ideologically corrupt. However, many honest people continue to lose themselves in an argument concerning government’s role in materially improving the world. The answer here is obvious. The ability of any government of course depends on its kind. There are many. Who could deny the profound importance of the American moon landing, or splitting the atom? These are accomplishments of free people in a free nation of property, association, and trade. And the context in which these noble projects, these absolutely historical achievements, were managed? America, a free nation, was fighting for its life — for freedom.

There are many false motivations ascribed to the champion of capitalism in bad faith, and it is important one not spend his life combatting dishonesty. There are too many good people with real questions with whom we must engage. So let us state plainly here our true motivation in defending so great a revelation as the goodness of property and rights, that we may point to it forever:

I am a capitalist because capitalism is essential to freedom. I am a free man, I intend to remain a free man, and for his freedom there must never be equivocation — the free man fights.

# Science Says We Have 12 Years To Save The World. Let’s Act

## 

A few weeks ago, the world’s leading climate scientists, in conjunction with the United Nations (UN), published a [pretty devastating report on global climate change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report). Their consensus is that humans have just 12 short years to make significant changes to our behavior before facing catastrophic consequences.

I recognize that there are many who believe that climate change is not man-made and is both normal and cyclical. There’s no question that the issue has been politicized in some countries like the United States. However, when 91 scientists from 40 countries conclude that a huge climate crisis could arise as early as 2040 if we don’t do something in the next 12 years, what does it matter who or what caused it?
> # What matters is that we have a dire reality to confront as humans, not as citizens of a particular country, region or political party. And we have about a decade to figure that out.

What I actually find even more alarming is that, just two weeks after this report was published, it seems that few are taking this news seriously. Some *extremely* intelligent people just told us we’re rapidly heading towards impending doom and the news cycle is already back to their regularly scheduled programming — and we’re all back to [practicing distraction](http://www.fridayfwd.com/practicing-distraction/) on our phones and social media feeds.
> # Why is that? Why are we so resistant to act?

Yes, the truth is frightening, but we are not powerless. Will sacrifices need to be made? Absolutely. But if those short-term sacrifices mean significant reduction of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people long-term, isn’t it worth it?

Why are we surprised when our short-term thinking, ambivalence and poor decision-making lead to troublesome long-term consequences?
> # Why can we agree on unlimited funds to clean up disasters, [but not funds to prevent them](http://www.fridayfwd.com/preventative-maintenance/)?

Across many aspects of our lives, we need to be thinking about connecting our short-term actions with long-term outcomes. As James Clear notes in his NYT Bestselling book, [*Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)*, when we consistently make small, “one percent” changes each day, they start to compound; seemingly small changes can put us on an [entirely different course.](https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains)

While I wish I had the one big answer to how we humans solve the audacious problem of climate change, I don’t. I do, however, have multiple small ones to suggest for how we can all contribute, reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and curtail our consumption of finite resources.
> **Start with the one percent.**

Change your light bulbs to LEDs. Walk the extra few steps to toss that bottle in the recycling bin instead of the trash. Hop on your bike for short distances. Make it easy for your employees to work remotely and reduce their time in CO2-producing vehicles.

Most importantly, let’s rally behind our best and brightest thinkers and problem-solvers. Does the world *really *need another distracting social media game or app? I’d argue not. What it needs right now is big solutions to big problems, such as [this innovative new solar-powered stadium in Amsterdam](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/netherlands-football-johan-cruijff-stadium-electric-car-batteries/). This new home of Dutch football club Ajax leverages used electric car batteries.
> # We’re all in this together. Let’s do our part to at least make small, incremental changes that can have a huge impact.

There really is no downside to action and the commercial opportunities of new solutions far exceed any risk. However, there are real dangers to be faced by continuing on the current path and sticking our heads in the sand.

12 years from now it will be 2030 and it will be here before we know it. I, for one, want to be excited about what the future holds for both myself and my kids over the next decade rather than fearing and planning for the environmental debts that are about to come due.

# Use This to Develop More Mental Resilience, Clarity, and Endurance Than You’ve Ever Had

## Use This to Develop More Mental Resilience, Clarity, and Endurance Than You’ve Ever Had
> “Mental resilience is arguably the most critical trait of a world-class performer. It should be nurtured continuously.” -Josh Waitzkin

Resilience is what allows you to continue fighting long after everyone else has quit. It’s what keeps you going in the face of stress, anxiety, uncertainty, and difficulty.

Sadly, the world sets you up to steal your mental resilience. Basically, the world wants you to become a vegetable — a high-paying, obedient vegetable who keeps paying for more comfort. You have an entire menu of food, TV, games, entertainment, and distraction at your fingertips; most people have lost their edge through the powerful invasion of instant comfort.

Most people can’t say they have much [mental clarity](http://“If you want to live an exceptional and extraordinary life, you have to give up many of the things that are part of a normal one.” -Srinivas Rao) in anything. All around you, people are in mediocre relationships they aren’t sure about. They’re working in jobs that, deep down, they know aren’t helping them reach their real goal. Frankly, they probably don’t even know what their real goals are.

Former editor of *SUCCESS Magazine* Darren Hardy once wrote:
> # “Most people drift through life without devoting much conscious energy to figuring out specifically what they want and what they need to do to get themselves there.”

Meeting someone who is crystal-clear on their goals is very rare. So is meeting the person who won’t give up on their goal, *no matter what*. The world is full of individuals who have settled for less, who have lost their resilience, clarity, and endurance. Maybe they never had it at all.

If you’re reading this, I already know you’re an ambitious, driven person (these are the people I write for). As prolific author Seth Godin once quipped, “*Only talented people fret about mediocrity*.”

In the following paragraphs, I’m going to teach you how to develop your mental resilience, clarity, and endurance so that you can one day enter into the top 1% of your field, whatever that may be. Because these principles are evergreen — they’ve been true for thousands of years, and will still be true long after I’ve passed away.

Following these principles are how the world’s most successful, most driven, and [most ambitious individuals](https://medium.com/the-mission/12-universal-traits-of-world-class-winners-anyone-can-instantly-use-to-dominate-their-field-78f0be472fc5) have consistently achieved extraordinary goals that 99% of their peers deemed impossible.
> “If you want to live an exceptional and extraordinary life, you have to give up many of the things that are part of a normal one.” -Srinivas Rao

## Ordinary People Focus on the Competition. Extraordinary People Focus on This.

You’ve heard it before: “*What is already working? What is our competition doing? How can we do it better?*”

Most people’s definition of success can be phrased like this:

**“Am I doing better than *that* person?”**

![[Tim Gouw](https://unsplash.com/@punttim?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*4yAoY8ostGshtr-N)*[Tim Gouw](https://unsplash.com/@punttim?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

The truth is, most people base their progress, growth, and victories (in their job, the gym, their family diners, and social media) on how much better than others they are.

But this always creates problems; your competition is always improving. The goal lines are always moving. What happens when they do better than you? That makes you a failure. It means you suck again. Back to working your ass off to regain the lead and get rid of the horrible feeling of being a loser.

While ordinary people are spending all their time trying to “beat the other guy,” extraordinary people are focusing on something entirely different: **being better than they were yesterday. **For these individuals, nothing else matters, and there’s no stress to beat anyone.

**When you are stressed out and anxious, you can’t achieve your peak performance. **As Bruce Lee once quoted, “*The stiffest tree is readiest for the ax.*” If you’re relaxed, you can be flexible and consistently enter flow states. When you are stressed, you are probably operating our of fear, which is a guarantee for below-average results.

Ernest Hemingway once wrote:
> # “*There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self.*”

Here’s a secret most people haven’t realized yet: **achieving your goal actually leaves you feeling empty and unsatisfied.** That’s right — success never feels as good as you’d hoped. There’s nothing to be gained by beating your fellow, except a fleeting sense of pride and vanity.

True nobility — the kind that’ll bring you *lasting* satisfaction— lies in being better than you were. Personal evolution, reaching higher levels of consciousness, mastery, and doing things you couldn’t do before…**that’s what you really want**. At the end of the day, who cares what your competition did? Aren’t you happier when you achieve personal goals instead of trying to beat others at theirs?

Here’s some great advice by one of my favorite authors, Ryan Holiday:
> # “Ignore what other people are doing. Ignore what’s going on around you. There is no competition. There is no objective benchmark to hit. There is simply the best you can do — that’s all that matters.”

I used to be really concerned with “beating the other guy.” I thought my self-worth and validation would come from being faster, smarter, and more popular than my peers.

So I focused entirely on that. I was obsessed with being the best basketball player on my high school team. I did the same thing for drum line, the volleyball team, AP classes, even musical theater. My core, driving thought was, “How can I pass the guy in front of me? How can I best the *best*?”

It wasn’t until years later, after intense therapy and counseling, that I saw how little self-worth I had. Years of trying to beat the competition just left me feeling scared, fearful, alone, and insecure. See, I was basing my self-worth on an ever-changing variable I had no hope of controlling: other people.

Now, I don’t worry about all that. I’m not frantically checking on other writers’ numbers and comments, seeing if my numbers match up (well, most of the time). Usually, I just write for myself and helping others. My priority is being better than I was yesterday, not beating some imaginary nemesis.

Prolific author and entrepreneur James Altucher put it simply:
> # “Every day, check these 4 boxes: Have I improved 1% on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health?”

Your competition doesn’t matter. All that matters is whether or not you improved — however slightly — today.

Even if it’s just 1 measly percent.

## This 20-Minute Writing Exercise Will Provide Immediate Clarity On Your Life Goals

The other day, fellow writer [Zak Slayback](https://twitter.com/zslayback) wrote an [illuminating article](https://medium.com/@zslayback/18-rules-for-ambitious-young-men-in-2018-b62dfed1094d) about clarity. It contained some of the most concise, best-worded questions about clarity I’ve ever come across.

Here are the questions:

1. *I feel most unhappy when I…*

*2. I dread …*

*3. I am good at but do not particularly enjoy…*

*4. I cannot imagine doing … every day for the rest of my life.*

*5. I don’t understand why anybody would…*

*6. … does not appeal to me.*

I recommend taking a short 20-minute break to write down your answers.

After 20 minutes of writing, I felt an incredible increase of clarity and focus on my direction. Specifically: what’s important, what I need to spend my time on, and what relationships/projects/tasks I need to cut out of my life.

To achieve the enormous success you so desperately want in life, you need two things:

1. Clarity

1. Energy

Without clarity, you’ll end up like many of my friends, exhausted from constantly searching for new jobs, relationships, and forms of satisfaction. Your energy will be spent running in circles, getting more and more lost.

When you increase clarity, you increase your energy. This is how people seem to have limitless energy towards their goals — their clarity invites enthusiasm, endurance, and passion.

When you have a vision, you will experience renewed vigor; strength that has been missing since your youth will return. Desire and ambition will reawaken from their long-dormant positions.
> “People who choose what they really want and avoid the temptations and get over the pains that drive them away from what they really want are much more likely to have successful lives.” -Ray Dalio

## In Conclusion

This short parable proves an important point.

It was the 2016 Summer Olympics. All eyes were on the Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos in the 200-meter butterfly final.

In 2012, Phelps was the unanimous favorite…until, against all odds, Le Close *beat* Phelps at his own signature race. There was an international frenzy. Shaken, Phelps retired. The entire world began to accept Chad Le Clos as the new champion.

But then Phelps came out of retirement, causing another media bonanza — would Phelps choke again? Would he come up short? What about Le Clos, his younger competitor who’d already beaten him? After a practice session, Le Clos arrogantly announced to the press, “*I just did a time [Phelps] hasn’t done in four years,*” he boasted.

Race day came. The world watched with hushed breath as Phelps and Le Clos swam neck-and-neck towards the finish.

![](1*QMBk_2jLA9H5YtMxAcYzMg.jpeg)

But instead of looking ahead to the finish, Le Clos famously watched Phelps the rest of the home stretch. Phelps never wavered, only looking towards the finish line.

Phelps won. After regaining his throne, the media ambushed him with questions about beating his nemesis. “*There are a lot of things I could say. But I won’t,*” Phelps only said. “*I’m going to let what I do in the pool do my talking.*”

You’re going to have a lot of pressure to “beat the competition.” To be buffer than that one guy at the gym, to be prettier than that one coworker, to be the smartest family member.

When that pressure comes, remember:

Competitors watch the winners. Winners just look forward.

# 5 Skills You Need To Become A Marketing Expert (From A Serial Marketing Entrepreneur) — Minutes —…

## 5 Skills You Need To Become A Marketing Expert (From A Serial Marketing Entrepreneur)

### If you can market your product better than the next person, you’re going to be [more successful.](https://www.influencive.com/8-ways-dog-made-successful/) Plain and simple.

***By [Brian D. Evans](https://twitter.com/BrianDEvans), founder of Influencive***

Many people make the same mistake when they start out in marketing — they think there isn’t much to it.

The average newbie says, “Since we’re in the beverage space, let’s send a bunch of our drinks to [influencers](https://www.influencive.com/5-tips-network-big-influencers-not/). That oughta cover it.”

Truthfully, you need a variety of skills and abilities to become a marketing expert. And today — when you likely have hundreds, if not thousands of competitors — great marketing is a fundamental part of any flourishing business.

If you can market your product better than the next person, you’re going to be [more successful.](https://www.influencive.com/8-ways-dog-made-successful/) Plain and simple.

With that in mind, here are five skills you absolutely need to move from novice to marketing expert:

## 1: Knowing how to sell and position benefits

A big aspect of marketing is [positioning a product](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/christopher-lochhead/if-you-need-to-know-1-thing-about-bringing-your-product-to-market-this-is-it/) or service to be sold and finding an audience for it.

In fact, selling is one of the fundamental building blocks of becoming a marketer. If you don’t know anything about selling, you’re going to have trouble grasping the intricacies of marketing.

That’s why when I’m hiring for a marketing position, I always look for candidates who’ve had to sell something. It doesn’t have to be the direct, “Sell me this pen,” type of sales, either. If they’ve spent time in a position where they had to convince customers not to cancel a service, for instance, that’s an advantage.

As a marketing expert, you must know how to explain the benefits of what you’re selling in an attractive way.

## 2: Understanding the nuances of communication

People hear “communication” and think, “Of course I know how to do that.”

In reality, not everyone is as great at it as they think. Not only does interpersonal communication have so many different layers, but in marketing, you also have to understand how *other people* communicate.

**It is extremely important for a marketer to really understand how other people communicate and interact with each other.**

[Great marketers](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/stephanie-danielsson/the-single-best-way-to-get-prospective-clients-to-call-you-back-from-a-marketer/) aren’t always social butterflies and can be very data-driven. They can dissect people’s communication and thought patterns very well. In fact, you’ll find that type of person in a lot of marketing positions.

Marketing experts aren’t necessarily the gregarious salesperson type, but they know how to interpret human behavior really well.

## 3: Writing different styles of copy

It’s incredibly useful to have a basic understanding of how to write copy as a marketer. Writing is just another form of communication, and you have to master it if you want your emails and ads to be successful.

### The basic formula is this: attention, interest, action.

You find a way to grab an audience’s attention right away. You then get them interested in what you’re marketing. Finally, you provide a call to action that prompts an immediate response. (This can range from buying a product right then and there to simply clicking on a link).

You also have to make your message feel relatable. The worst thing you can do as a marketer is to sound like a marketer. Instead, you want your audience to feel like you’re communicating with them, building rapport, and creating a connection.

The moment you sound like you’re selling something, people tune out.

## 4: Ideating and testing

Over the years, I’ve learned an incredibly crucial marketing lesson: just because I think an idea will work well, doesn’t mean that it will be a hit. Conversely, simply because I believe an idea will bomb, doesn’t mean that it will fail.

Marketing experts and the best copywriters in the world will tell you in a heartbeat they rely heavily on split testing to assess their ideas. If they want to market a car to a certain demographic, they don’t just create one ad. They make 15, or even more. All of them are different because, in the beginning, they’re not absolutely sure what messaging will work. They may have educated guesses, but nothing’s concrete without data.

As the results of the ads roll in, the data is narrowed down. Marketers look at what didn’t perform well, learn from it, and continue to adjust and iterate. So if you really want to succeed in marketing, you have to be able to [come up with ideas](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/nicolascole77/7-ways-to-come-up-with-creative-ideas/), and more importantly, you have to test them.

## 5: Having patience and being able to interpret data

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen people give up on a campaign or a niche market too early. Given a few more weeks and a handful of split tests, they would have been successful.

The problem is that a lot of people don’t realize how badly a small sample size can skew their results. They run a campaign for five days and then get depressed at the low level of engagement with the ad. But by running it for five days with a minimal budget, they were only able to reach a tiny percentage of their target audience. Discrepancies always arise in a small sample size.

For example, if I asked the next 10 people I meet what they think about my favorite movie, they all might agree that it’s great. That doesn’t mean *everyone in Los Angeles* thinks the same way, or that the ratio would hold up for a larger audience.

If you have confidence in your idea and you’re committed to testing it, then you have to be patient, as well. You need self-restraint to consider the data you receive and identify whether or not the sample size is misleading.

Being a marketing expert requires a greater depth of knowledge than many people imagine. But if you can master these five skills, you’ll impress others with your ability to truly understand and communicate with consumers.\

# 4 Psychology-Based Tips To Navigate Client Personalities, From Aggressive To Soft-Spoken

## 

Managing client personalities is a case-by-case business.

If you work with people long enough, you’ll probably run into the aggressive, angry type who loves to yell and get under your skin. You’ll also probably find yourself in a room with someone who’s incredibly passive and indecisive. And you’ll definitely meet people who fall somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.

The truth is, there’s no silver bullet for handling any of these client personalities because everyone’s different.

Sometimes the person yelling just needs to vent — and you have to figure out the right things to say to help calm them down. Other times, you may need to be firm and simply tell them, “I’m not going to tolerate this. Unless we can speak like adults, I’m leaving.”

Luckily, you can follow basic psychology principles to help you understand who you’re dealing with and how to manage different situations. If you know the general rules and apply them to your interactions with clients, you’ll save yourself a ton of headaches.

These are the four tips that have helped me through numerous tricky situations:

## **1. Be a chameleon.**

You probably already do this without even realizing it.

[The “chameleon effect”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10402679) is a well-documented behavior in which people unconsciously mimic the mannerisms, posture, or tone of the person they’re speaking to. We do it because when we mimic someone else, it actually makes our interactions smoother. The other person feels more comfortable with us without knowing exactly why.

You can also use this technique consciously. Since you never know what a person is going to be like when you first meet them, it’s important to understand how to adjust if he or she turns out to be more aggressive or passive than you were expecting.

Obviously, you can take this [too far](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/12/science/social-chameleon-may-pay-emotional-price.html). It’s not really about crossing your legs the moment you see them cross theirs. It’s about reading their personality and current mood — and then adjusting your own behavior to help the conversation flow.

## **2. Listen and wait.**

You’re may be wondering how you’re supposed to know what adjustments to make in the first place. The answer is simple: [active listening](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10904018.2013.813234) and observation.

Most people will say, “Yeah, I’m a good listener,” but there’s a very real difference between just hearing someone and actively [listening to them](https://medium.com/@SamRusani/advice-for-entrepreneurs-how-to-find-a-mentor-worth-listening-to-eabd35f3f509?source=---------2------------------). When you’re really keyed in on what they’re saying and *how* they’re saying it, you’ll know whether you need to change your own behavior in some way.

* Watch your client’s body language and facial expressions.

* Listen to their tonality. Are they stressed, calm, rushed?

* Take the clues they’re giving you and use them to navigate any potential hangups or opportunities in the conversation.

Management legend Peter Drucker summed it up nicely when he said, “The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn’t said.”

## **3. Make others feel comfortable.**

People need to feel relaxed around you. You don’t hang out with [someone you’re not comfortable with](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/01/affective-presence-how-you-make-other-people-feel/579643/), and you definitely don’t do business with that person, either.

Think of your interaction with a client like you would any other relationship. You can’t build a good rapport until you’re both at ease. If someone’s tense and wary, the conversation will reflect that.

An easy, quick way to help a client feel comfortable is simply by finding a connection — something you have in common. Ask them about themselves. Do they have a dog? What kind of music do they like? Yesterday was beautiful, did they get outside and do anything? Oh, they played 18? You golf, too. Talk about it a little.

Once you make that connection, slowly but surely you can build trust and help them feel comfortable around you.

## **4. Visualize situations ahead of time.**

Among athletes, visualizing an action [or goal](https://medium.com/@SamRusani/why-goal-setting-is-the-difference-between-success-and-failure-in-life-and-business-fe4bd5b5c57c?source=---------10------------------) ahead of time is [a well-known technique](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14998709) for improving performance.

While you can use visualization in multiple areas of your life, it can actually be just as helpful when it comes to managing client personalities.

Over the years I’ve been in plenty of situations where someone has said or done something, and I’ve had no idea how to react. Maybe they were overly aggressive, or I wasn’t ready for them to poke me the way they did. Whatever the case, afterward, I knew I didn’t handle it well.

So, I started using visualization. I’d sit down, imagine that situation happening again, and visualize myself handling it confidently. Now, when a tricky situation arises, it’s no problem because I’ve already been through it a thousand times in my head.

Navigating the nuances of client personalities doesn’t come with step-by-step directions. But if you visualize yourself listening, adjusting to the situation, and putting people at ease, I guarantee you’ll have an easier time handling all types of people when an interaction gets unsteady.

# If You Want to Build an Audience, Focus on Mastery Instead of Metrics

## 

A few days ago, I interviewed Danielle Laporte for Creative Live’s podcasting week. My host Drew asked me what advice I would give someone who is just starting out. My advice for anyone starting out, whether that be as a podcast host, a writer, or any other kind of creative was to commit to mastery over metrics. Far too often people prioritize metrics over mastery.

* They value the number of downloads on a podcast over the quality of a conversation

* They value traffic to a blog post over the quality of the writing

Anyone can game the system when it comes to metrics. They can spend a ton of money and drive traffic to a shitty blog post or lousy podcast. They can hire a company to buy thousands of copies of their book and make a best-seller list. But gaming the system is not a sustainable long-term strategy to build an audience for your work. If you commit to mastery, eventually the metrics will improve. But if you commit solely to metrics, it’s unlikely you’ll ever reach the point of mastery:

* Constantly checking the traffic to your website won’t cause it to go up. Writing something worth reading will.

* Obsessively looking at your podcast downloads won’t cause them to go up. Producing an amazing episode will.

Metrics have their place. But, when we focus obsessively on metrics, we put a significant amount of our energy into something we can’t control. **When we commit to mastery that same energy gets redirected to what we can control: our effort.**

## What You Control VS. What you Don’t
> # *“In the end you have greater control over your actions than you do your results. Your results are created by your actions.”**– Brian Moran, The 12 Week Year***

You can’t predict how many page views or how much traffic one article is going to get. But you can control whether or not you write 1000 words a day. You can control how many articles you choose to publish. By focusing on the things you control, you tap into the profound power of consistency, experience visible progress, and build momentum. **This more than anything is what it means to [create for an audience of one.](https://amzn.to/297YjPz)**

Write down a goal you have. Then write down all the things about the goal that you control and all the ones you don’t. Then take action on the things that you control.

## Attention Doesn’t Equate to Value

Because we’ve quantified nearly every aspect of our lives and made it nearly effortless to capture a person’s attention with selfies, tweets, and status updates, people overvalue metrics and undervalue mastery.

Most people who have become masters of their craft did so long before social media ever existed and before they could quantify their value in artificial metrics:

* Annie Leibowitz preceded Instagram.

* U2 preceded Spotify

* Stephen King preceded websites like Medium

Just because you’ve gained somebody’s attention for a small fraction of their day, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve created something of value.

## The Long Game

Very few people commit to mastery because it requires playing the long game. It takes years of deep work and deliberate practice.

***Why spend ten years becoming so good they can’t ignore you, when you can spend 20 seconds uploading a picture to Instagram or composing a tweet to be so average that they pay attention to you for a fraction of a second.***

The beauty of the long game is that there’s less competition because the overwhelming majority of people (millions) are playing the short game:

* There are far fewer people attempting to write books than there are people composing tweets.

* There are far fewer people attempting to make better art than people who are looking for more tactics

People who play the short game might be relevant for a moment in time. But people who play the long game are more likely to create something timeless.

## Commitment to Mastery Leads to Higher Quality Products and Perennial Sellers
> “It’s much better to first make a product a small number of users love than a product that a large number of users like. Even though the total amount of positive feeling is the same, it’s much easier to get more users than to go from like to love.” — [Sam Altman](https://twitter.com/sama)

When I started the Unmistakable Creative in 2009, I thought that I would interview famous people, they would tweet about my interviews with their millions of followers, and every interview would go viral. I realized how misinformed that was within two months. It became clear that our listeners were the ones who were going to cause our show to grow. Over the last ten years, our listeners have shared our show with friends, family members, and co-workers. The small group of people who loved our work helped us reach a much larger group of people.
> # ***The paradox of prioritizing mastery over metrics is that it makes what you’ve created much more scalable. If your product (book, podcast, app, etc.) sucks, no amount of “growth hacking” will cause it to go from lingering in obscurity to becoming a unicorn.***

When you commit to mastery, you increase the likelihood of producing something with emotional resonance. If it has emotional resonance, it will continue to spread without hacks and tactics. It will become what Ryan Holiday calls a Perennial Seller. But it could take years before it does.

When you focus on mastery, the metrics will eventually move in a positive direction. It’s an inevitable byproduct of being so good they can’t ignore you.

# Why Bookstores Still Matter

## Photo by Stanislav Kondratiev on Unsplash

I get books in the mail from Amazon every week. My roommate says that it seems like I get a new book every day. I usually keep a running list of the books I want to read. I also learn about books I might be interested in reading from the following sources:

* Authors who are guests on The Unmistakable Creative Podcast

* Book publicists who are trying to land media appearances for one of their authors

* Recommendations from friends

* References in books I’m currently reading

You’d think with all of this there would be absolutely no reason to set foot in a bookstore. But when I was ordering a new batch of books on Amazon the other night, I realized I’d spent every day this week searching the internet for new material to read:

* I looked through all of Ryan Holiday’s recommendations.

* I checked out the top selling books on Amazon

* I read some book reviews on Bill Gates’ blog

I’d read many of these books and didn’t find very many that I was curious about. Then I thought of some of my favorite books that I’ve read this year. I found out about them while wandering the aisles of a bookstore.

I learned about [Andrew Yang](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang)’s book [*The War on Normal People](https://www.amazon.com/War-Normal-People-Disappearing-Universal/dp/0316414247)* while I was at a Barnes and Noble. I ordered his book and interviewed him about his 2020 Presidential campaign. If I hadn’t been to a bookstore, I wouldn’t have known about him.

I stumbled on Will Storr’s book [*Selfie: How We Became so Self-Obsessed and What It’s doing To Us](https://www.amazon.com/Selfie-How-West-Became-Self-Obsessed/dp/1447283643)* in a bookstore. I think it’s the most important book that I’ve read in 2018. I’ll be interviewing him in a few weeks. If I hadn’t been in a bookstore, I likely would never have heard about him.

I learned about Ingrid Fetel Lee’s book [*Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness](https://www.amazon.com/Joyful-Surprising-Ordinary-Extraordinary-Happiness/dp/0316399264)* at an airport bookstore.

And so, I drove to my local bookstore, and I came back with a list of 10 new books that I wanted to read.

It’s not a coincidence that Amazon, who turned the book publishing industry upside down, has now started opening retail stores. As much we love getting packages in the mail, it’s hard to recreate the experience of wandering the aisles of a store. Websites are optimized for searching not browsing.

Following your curiosity is a lot harder when your just clicking images and “seeing” what’s inside a book.
> # The aisles of a bookstore are a choose your own adventure journey into the depths of your curiosity and imagination.

As [Ryan Holiday](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday) wrote, “Good things happen in bookstores.” They still matter.

# 11 Genius Productivity Hacks You Need to Know

## 

Most of the time, being more productive means striking a better [work-life balance](http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/5-things-that-will-keep-you-from-achieving-work-life-balance.html) and learning to mitigate the little stressors that eat away at efficiency and the psyche.

These hacks will help you maximize your time *and *happiness.

## 1. Know Thyself

What time are you at peak productivity? Now schedule your most crucialtasks during that time. If you’re a genius between the hours of 10 p.m. and midnight, then by golly, do whatever you have to do to block off that time and get ‘er done.

![](0*CI_GNhhSZd2DXCH4.jpg)

If you need a little [help discovering your peak productivity](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/08/24/not-just-when-the-caffeine-kicks-in/), check out this app that promises to help you find it.

And if you work from home, here are some [special hacks](http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-tips-to-increase-productivity-in-your-home-office.html) just for you.

## 2. Skip Facebook

![](1*S9aE9sYN-mFqmm5hRwZT-A.png)

It may be tempting to log in and just *peek* at what your news feed is up to, but that’s a dangerous move when you’re trying to get something done. Before you know it, you’re tangled in a web of cute animal videos and profilestalking, and it’s 30 minutes later before you realize you’ve entered the Facebook time warp.

[One study showed](http://www.salary.com/2014-wasting-time-at-work/slide/3) 23 percent of workers cited Facebook as the destination to “waste time.”

But what if it’s your job to manage social media profiles for a company? Try staying within scheduling apps like Hootsuite so you’re not tempted to log in — or check out the [Facebook at Work product ](http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/will-your-company-use-the-new-facebook-at-work-.html)that promises to keep work and personal separate on the network — and limit distractions from screaming goats.

## 3. Ditch the Smartphone

![](1*RY5zx8ghi7dSo2Kv6r-ZKQ.gif)

The [average smartphone user](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/techandgadgets/average-smartphone-user-checks-device-221-times-a-day-according-to-research-9780810.html) checks his or her device 221 times a day.Putting your cell phone out of sight during work hours helps get it off your mind — unless you’re so far gone that you experience [phantom cell-phone vibrations](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2504472/smartphones/cellphone-vibration-syndrome-and-other-signs-of-tech-addiction.html). In that case, start rethinking your relationship with technology.

## 4. Forget Multitasking and Just Focus

![](0*tRSR8yBvp6QxW-0u.jpg)

You might think you’re being more productive by sending those emails during a conference call, but think again. [Multitasking ](http://http//www.inc.com/larry-kim/why-multi-tasking-is-killing-your-brain.html)reduces efficiency and the quality of work (plus, research shows it literally lowers your IQ). So when you have to get something done, just focus on the task at hand for best results.

And keep in mind that[ studies show the human brain](https://podio.com/site/8-hour-workday) can only focus for 90 to 120 minutes at a time before it needs a break.

## 5. Reimagine Your Inbox

![](1*2KaFlixyEnFYvglL_1zlog.png)

Emails build a to-do list that other people create for you. So you need to manage that daily annoyance somehow.

Schedule certain times of the day that you check email, and stick with it. You can try tackling email first thing in the morning, after lunch, and at the end of day. And for God’s sake, turn off email notifications.

If you think this is going to be a problem for your teams or clients, let them know ahead of time how you communicate throughout the day.

You can also look into apps that let you get a handle on your inbox, like [Productive Inbox ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/productive-inbox/hklikiifbhodakpnmaopdhmnpjeleeac?hl=en), [SimplyFile](http://www.techhit.com/SimplyFile/), or[ Boomerang for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boomerang-for-gmail/mdanidgdpmkimeiiojknlnekblgmpdll?hl=en.).

## 6. Change Your Scenery

![](0*0iP3LnN5Q3wSRbyG.jpg)

If you’re feeling a little foggy midafternoon, try looking out the window into nature. No window? No problem — one study found simply looking at a computerized image of nature helped [increase focus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/05/26/viewing-nature-can-help-your-brain-work-better-study-finds).

Even better though is to take a short walk outside. Research shows that a 30-minute lunchtime walk can help people [cope with stress](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/stressed-at-work-try-a-lunchtime-walk/?_r=0) and boosts enthusiasm for the remainder of the afternoon.

## 7. Meditate

![](1*zsWRr4VjdA3NNR_M0Qym5A.jpeg)

[Just 15 minutes](http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/12-mindfulness-hacks-you-can-use-in-24-hours.html) of mindfulness meditation can lead to more rational business decisions — not to mention better teamwork, being more creative, and a whole slew of health benefits.

Not the yogi type? Try the [Headspace app](https://www.headspace.com/), which has brought meditation to the masses. So go ahead and get your ohm on.

## 8. Ask for Help and Delegate

![](0*WliUa7iyrtdtW9D6.jpg)

There is power in numbers. And frankly, there are things you’re just not good at and probably don’t want to do. When you’re feeling overwhelmed with tasks or underwhelmed by the tedious work on your plate, ask for help.

Guaranteed there is someone out there who can do the tasks you don’t want to 10 times better (try looking in [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/)), so find the person and delegate!

## 9. Create Innovation Time

[Google made famous](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-20-percent-time-policy-2015-4) the idea of giving team members a percentage of time to work outside their normal projects and on what they think would most benefit the company.

If you’re constantly “doing,” you have no time to innovate. Making the same widget day after day does not allow you to think about what new widgets you might make.

Try setting aside time to work on something that will move the needle.

## 10. Be Agile

![](1*gBmS9asYNuHMVQ0zgBp6Uw.png)

The agile approach to building products and software and managing projects is finding its way into other areas of business and even into people’s personal lives.

A popular method is [Scrum](http://www.scrumyourwedding.com/) (an agile framework), which breaks large tasks into smaller items that are worked on and completed typically within a one-week sprint.

## 11. Get Ergonomic

![](0*oohru8alYmuykpdt.png)

[Sitting is the new smoking](http://www.inc.com/bill-carmody/sitting-is-the-new-smoking.html), don’t you know. And some research suggests that even if you exercise but still sit for long periods of time, your health is at risk. Not to mention aches, pains, and fatigue can be a real productivity killer.

Luckily, there’s been [innovation in workstations](http://www.varidesk.com/) that offer affordable sit-standoptions, [chairs that move with you](http://www.ergodepot.com/category_s/168.htm) more naturally, [desks that recline](http://mashable.com/2015/10/28/altwork-station-laying-down/#hGeOvBCckOq3)and even allow you to take a nap. (By the way, [napping has also been linked with productivity](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/WaterCooler/story?id=124677).)

# Why I Started with a Lower Paying Job

## The hidden advantages of NOT maximizing for income early

![The paradox of chasing high pay early](1*IpTbFtLRU1qocxVGl6K9nw.png)*The paradox of chasing high pay early*

I think it’s a decent default rule to take the lowest pay you can for the first decade or so of your career.

If you ignore pay and focus on other things, I’m willing to bet you’ll be happier and earn more pay a decade in than someone who maximizes pay from day one.

I’ll walk you through my own example to explain some of the reasons I think this is true.

## **An early choice**

It wasn’t a dramatic sell-your-soul-for-riches moment, but at age 19 I had a juicy job offer. I had just gotten married, had no job (nor did my wife), zero cash, and a mortgage to pay. I was working odd electrical and landscape gigs and sending out resumes.

I had a job opportunity that my friends were jealous of. It had a $45k base salary, company car, plus commission. They said I’d likely make around $50k in my first year.

I said no.

I wasn’t really excited about the job, but I could’ve been fine with it. Beyond looking for something more connected to my interests and skills, I also knew this job had a fairly low ceiling. I’ve never been primarily motivated by money, but I knew some middle aged people who had essentially the same job and I knew their life seemed pretty mediocre to me, financially and otherwise.

Instead, I got a job I was thrilled about that paid $25k. I excelled, and it led to several next steps with slightly higher pay. Here’s my first eight years in the professional world.

## **My actual pay trajectory:**

Year 1: $25,000
Year 2: $28,000
Year 3: $35,000
Year 4: $35,000
Year 5: $40,000
Year 6: $40,000
Year 7: $45,000
Year 8: $75,000

Seven years in, I was still making less than that first offer I turned down. I never focused on pay. I don’t think I ever asked for a raise. That year seven job probably paid me too much too. I would’ve done it for $40k, but I wasn’t going to turn down the higher offer.

Let’s compare my pay trajectory to a very reasonable estimate of what I would’ve pulled in over the same eight years with the other job.

## **My forgone pay trajectory:**

Year 1: $50,000
Year 2: $55,000
Year 3: $60,000
Year 4: $60,000-$65,000
Year 5: $60,000-$65,000
Year 6: $60,000-$65,000
Year 7: $60,000-$70,000
Year 8: $60,000-$70,000

The job had a pretty consistent ceiling. The best performers made somewhere between $60–70k. It wasn’t a role or industry that really had a clear path to something else within either. A jump to something totally new can always be made — I’ve done it myself more than once — but one of the dangers with high pay early is that it makes those jumps harder and less likely.

So for seven years, I looked like a poor sucker compared to my company car driving alternate self. But by year eight, I not only surpassed the ceiling of the previous trajectory, but had massive amounts of opportunity and social capital at my disposal, not to mention greater fulfillment in my work.

Oh, and each year after year eight saw quick and significant jumps in income as my years of learning where to focus and optimizing for value began to pay off. The years of non-income optimization also set the stage for me to launch [a company](http://discoverpraxis.com) in year 10 (and [another](http://crash.co) in year 15!), something I’d never have been able to do without all the social capital I’d built.

## **Why does it work this way?**

I think there are several reasons I was better off taking the lowest pay my wife and I could handle for nearly every job for the first several years. If I have any regrets, it’s that I didn’t find a way to live on even less and worry even less about pay.

For me, lower pay early on meant several things:

**1. It was easier to be impressive**

A great way to get ahead in your career is to always strive to be the best employee anywhere you work. Not all employees are equal, and this is where low pay can be a big advantage.

A young $35k worker gets noticed for being just a little above average. A young $60k worker, on the other hand, had better be pretty damn good to command that salary early in their career.

You can stand out to your colleagues and the broader world pretty easily when you’re a low paid employee. Soon, you develop a reputation. “Hey, have you met that young dude from that one place? What a hustler. Maybe he’d be a good fit for this…” Again, this works both internally at a company and externally.

I had little problem establishing myself as impressive because being obviously worth more than a low salary is doable with a little hustle. A great reputation built over those first several low pay years can catapult you to a higher pay in ten years than yearly cost of living increases at a fatter starting point.

**2. It was easier to find what I loved and hated**

$50k isn’t quite golden handcuffs, but it’s kind of like copper handcuffs. Early, that’s a lot of money. Once you’ve tasted it, it’s very hard to go back. One problem my wife and I have is that we’ve always managed to live right up to our level of income. Always. Once you have high pay, going back is brutal.

This means that if you discover two years in you never want to audit tax documents again, it might be too late. Not just to change, but to even see it. You actually become worse at knowing yourself and being honest with yourself if you are paid a lot. You weave stories about how much you kinda sorta like it, or how you’ll leave in five years. Lies. I saw many people do it.

Self-discovery is too important to play servant to your early income goals.

**3. It was easier to find new opportunities**

Opportunities travel through the grapevine. You have to be sending a frequency that others tune into in order to find them. People have a rough idea how much you make. If you are a young hotshot with a big salary, I can almost guarantee someone somewhere has said, “Hey, she’d be a good fit…but doesn’t she make like $50k right now? This role starts at $35k. Doubt she’d do it. Who else?”

I’ve said it about people many times. Sometimes, the person in question was too senior for the role, but sometimes they were perfect for it but their pay was just too senior for the role. Some of them will be making about the same in five years, where the role I decided not to consider them for could have blossomed into much more than that.

I got some very cool opportunities for jobs and side gigs that I never would have gotten had I started at the $50k job. [Low opportunity cost was my secret weapon](https://isaacmorehouse.com/2016/03/29/the-secret-weapon-young-people-have-on-the-job-market/).

You don’t realize it, but a highly paid young person is like a red flag to people looking for hungry young talent. Salary maximizers often miss out on the best long-term opportunities.

**4. It was easier to act on new opportunities**

Even if you manage to gain self-knowledge, and you manage to find cool opportunities, if you’re earning bookoo bucks early, seizing them isn’t easy.

Again, the copper handcuffs begin to chafe. You are used to a certain standard of living afforded by your high pay. It can be hard to move to completely different areas and maintain it. I had little trouble early on saying no to bad fitting roles and yes to cool ones with low pay. I started at $25k and we learned to live on that (we had our first child while I was still making $28k for goodness sake!), so new opportunities weren’t big sacrifices.

## **Focus on what matters**

Go in to each job with a mission to be the best employee there. To create the most value, have the most fun, capture the company vision and help build on it, learn everything you can, help as many people as possible. Don’t turn down a job you like over a few thousand in salary. Don’t haggle over an offer to ratchet up the pay inch by inch. Ignore salary altogether if you can. Focus on building value for yourself and others.

I’m willing to bet the entire $50k I passed on in year one that you’ll be doing better a decade down the road than those who maximize pay above all.

# 7 Small Things You Can Do In 10 Minutes That Will Improve Your Health Substantially

## People seeking change in their lives tend to think that “change” is the result of some big decision.

*“I need to move cities!”*

*“I need to change careers!”*

*“I need to start a huge project!”*

And while all those things can be beneficial, it’s the small stuff that ends up bringing about the biggest change.

## 1. Learn To Cook A Healthy Morning Breakfast

When did cooking get the bad reputation of being “difficult?”

It’s no more “difficult” than anything else in life — it just takes a bit of learning.

For 10 minutes every morning, search on YouTube or Google something for breakfast you want to learn how to make — and then follow the instructions and make it. 10 minutes a day, 7 days a week, that’s a little over an hour of practice per week. Add that up over a month, 3 months, a year, and you’ll not only be a much better chef, but you’ll be setting a better foundation for yourself each morning: Learning something new, and eating some healthy.

## 2. Handstands, Push Ups, Crunches

Your body is the single best indicator of how you feel.

The more in tune you can be with your body, the better sense you will have of what your body needs (sleep? food? rest?). Since the majority of us spend so much time in front of our computers, hunched over, demolishing our posture, try adding in 10 minutes of body weight exercises (preferably every few hours).

Again, the Internet is your resource. If you have no idea how to do a crunch, push up or handstand, look it up. 10 minutes a day will improve your ability to get in touch with your body, make you stronger, and help you remember to maintain good posture.

## 3. Breathing Exercises

If angry outbursts during frustrating meetings is in your daily repertoire, this one is especially for you.

Breathing exercises are quite possibly one of the easiest things to learn — you just *breathe* — but their effects are tremendous. Focus solely on your breathing for 10 minutes. No worrying about the next project. No stressing about what is due and when. Just breathe for 10 minutes and you’ll be amazed at how much more cool, calm, and collected you’ll feel.

Nobody makes good decisions when they’re stressed out.

## 4. Creative Brainstorm

Creativity is a muscle that needs to be exercised, just like anything else.

If you want to keep your creative muscles fresh and learn how to be more creative on the spot, then you need to practice that. Every day, for 10 minutes, write down 10 new ideas that interest you. 10 ideas that would be fun to execute, or you think would be cool. They can be anything you want. But write them down.

Do this for a few days and your creative juices will be overflowing.

## 5. Don’t Eat Sugar

One of the most common snacks (especially in America) is sugar: whether that’s fruit, or “nutrition bars” masked as sweet tooth snacks.

Something you can learn *right now* that will significantly help your health is that sugar is one of the worst snacks you could possibly have — especially over long periods of not eating. When you eat sugar, you spike your insulin. When you spike your insulin, you are signaling to the body that you’ve just been fed.

The body, then, isn’t sure when it is going to be fed next, so it halts the body’s burning of stored fat because it wants to make sure it “makes it” to the next meal.

Aka: Your body decides, “Now I should store fat.” No bueno.

## 6. Journal Your Thoughts

Journaling can be so therapeutic, and if you are going through stressful times or just want to “think through” something a bit deeper, pull out your journal.

For 10 minutes, just write whatever comes to mind. Don’t think about making it perfect, or anyone reading it. A journal is a journal for a reason — it’s your place to be messy and get out all your thoughts.

Once you see them in front of you, you’ll have a much clearer sense of how to best move forward with whatever it is you’re contemplating.

## 7. Read or Listen To Music

10 minutes of input is often better than 10 minutes of output — especially when you are feeling drained.

A big pitfall people succumb to is thinking that when they are tired or worn out, they need to “do something.” That’s the opposite of what you need to do. What you need is to “do” nothing.

You need to soak up something new. 10 quiet minutes of reading or listening to music and you’ll find yourself starting to refill with ideas.

# Three life lessons from the making of this Hollywood blockbuster

The 27-year-old director had a major problem on his hands.

The star of his movie, Bruce, was [high maintenance](https://mentalfloss.com/article/31105/how-steven-spielbergs-malfunctioning-sharks-transformed-movie-business) — even by Hollywood standards. Bruce was a mechanical shark, lovingly named after the director’s lawyer. But the shark couldn’t do the one thing he was built to do: swim properly. On his first day on the set, he sank to the bottom of the water. Within a week, his electric motor malfunctioned. Even after a good day, Bruce “had to be drained, scrubbed, and repainted” to get ready for filming — requiring the type of pampering rarely expected by movie stars.

The director then did what all directors wish they could do to an over-demanding and under-performing actor: He fired the shark. “I had no choice but to figure out how to tell the story without the shark,” he explained. As he faced this major constraint, he asked himself, “What would Hitchcock do in a situation like this?” The answer gave him a stroke of inspiration that helped him convert a seemingly insurmountable obstacle into a blockbuster opportunity.

In [the opening scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrEvK-tv5OI) of the movie, Chrissy decides to go for a moonlight dip. As she’s swimming along, she’s suddenly pulled under water and yanked around, while gasping for breath and screaming for help. The focus is on Chrissy, and the villain is nowhere to be seen. The monster is left entirely to the imagination of the audience, which doesn’t get a good look at the shark until the third act. This omission ultimately produced a constant state of anxiety in the audience, boosted by the ominous theme music (*da-dum . . . da-dum . . . da-dum-da-dum-da-dum*).

The movie, as you probably guessed, was *Jaws*, and its director was a young Steven Spielberg. *Jaws *became the first movie ever to top $100 million at the box office.

I love this story in part because it marries three different principles that I’ve written about in the past.

First, constraints like the one that Spielberg faced are supposed to be detrimental to our work. How are you supposed to film a shark movie without the shark? But, as *Jaws* illustrates, [constraints can boost](https://ozanvarol.com/freedom-doesnt-increase-creativity/), rather than undermine, creativity. The opposite can also be true: If Spielberg had a well-functioning shark to work with, the ingredient that made the movie most memorable would be missing.

Second, when Spielberg was deciding what to do, he asked himself, “What would Hitchcock do in a situation like this?” Notice what he did *not *do. He didn’t call Hitchcock to ask if old Alfred [would be willing to mentor him](https://ozanvarol.com/why-you-should-stop-looking-for-a-mentor/). He didn’t say, “Al, I’ve got a broken shark. What do you think I should do?” Spielberg had studied the masters of his field so carefully that he knew exactly what Hitchcock would do without having to pick up the phone. Spielberg’s mentors were all around him — in the movies that lined the shelves of his film collection — and he knew how to open his eyes to channel their power.

Finally, in hiding the shark from view for much of the movie, Spielberg applied a principle that many of us neglect: What we don’t see is scarier than what we do see.

From a human perspective, not all facts are equal. We tend to incessantly focus on the facts in front of us and [neglect other facts](https://ozanvarol.com/the-one-question-that-will-make-you-a-better-problem-solver/) that may be hidden in a blind spot. But contrary to popular wisdom, what you don’t see or know can hurt you. In focusing on the facts in front of us, we don’t focus enough — or at all — on the missing facts, which can be far more important than what’s right in front of us. As the focal facts scream their 100-decibel sirens for attention, we neglect to ask, “What am I not seeing? What fact should be present, but is not?”

Next time, before you jump to a confident conclusion, check your blind spot.

You’ll see sharks lurking there.

# 6hrs Sleep vs 8hrs Sleep

## The differences that 2hrs made for my work life

![Photo by [Christopher Jolly](https://unsplash.com/@chris_jolly?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*vfqvoyxttYunzHQX)*Photo by [Christopher Jolly](https://unsplash.com/@chris_jolly?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

This is the perfect time to write this article.

After 4 hours of sleep last, and about to embark on a 4hr train journey up to London — you really do begin to feel the effects from lack of sleep.

**You may spot typos….**

### This topic has been on my mind for a while now.

The last 6–12 months has been a giant experiment for my sleeping patterns, and although everyone’s sleep very much differs, there’s lots of sleep-based lessons to extract. Improving my sleep routine has doubled my productivity and potential for work and life based activities.

## Relationships with Sleep

Being 24-years old, my relationship with sleep has never been ideal.

Combining a high-work ethic, start-up job roles and university lifestyle, I’d downplay sleep as another element of my day, regardless of the time committed. The first time I flagged sleep as a concern was in 2015.

2015 was an intense work year for me. I’d joined a start-up in a new city, left my family behind (a 5hr bus trip away) and focused my efforts on starting a new YouTube channel too.

Thanks to this massive change in my routine, sleep took a back seat.

My day ended like this. Getting home from work, I’d head straight to my Chromebook and start tapping away into the night. I’d stop based on whether I could physically continue (usually midnight or 1AM, sometimes 2AM), throwing in an occasional hour of basketball with my flat mate (once or twice a week) and my body and mind were in a vicious circle dying for rest.

### The worst addition was the early rise.

Despite work starting at 9AM, like most work places, I’d get into my local coffee shop in the city at 6:30AM, leaving me a total maximum window of sleep of 6 hours. This meant my wake-up time was 5:30AM most days, and heading to bed at midnight, this really put pressure on my body.

## 6 Hours of Sleep

When up in the city, you’d blend in with this sleep pattern.

The work atmosphere was riot. I remember discussing my crazy routine, with pride. When I should have been concerned. And others joining in, like it was some sort of trophy cabinet comparison.

Not good looking back on it.

Of course, there’s an argument here. The hours I dedicated surely helped me grow my now-evolving YouTube community or my freelance work… Surely?!

Yes, to some extent. I excelled still, despite the lack of sleep.

But with more hours in the day, that was one of the benefits of working outside of the workplace, however the amount of sleep was really taking it’s toll. I wasn’t looking healthy at all.

### So what happened to me with 6 hours of sleep:

### PROS

* More time to expand YouTube efforts

* Taught me about my sleeping limitations

### **CONS**

* Peaks and troughs of energy across the day

* My thought process was always long-winded and foggy

* Fitness sessions would never deliver the best results

* Listening in and around the office dropped off

* My skin quality would not always be good

Other such habits made this worse, normally associated with work. Skipping lunch breaks, too much exercise, bad sleep posture, sitting down most of the day and many more elements brought together was a recipe for disaster.

Cutting a long story short. The 6 hour sleep routine wasn’t for me, despite my forced attempt to make it work. The results on 8–9 hours changed my day.

## 8 Hours of Sleep

Skip forward a few years, and now I sleep between 8–9 hours.

Breaking down my own judgments about this, this is actually the optimum time for recovery for me. The majority of days, I’m now out of bed and within 5–10 minutes (of processing my deep sleep) I’m awake and at it.

The 8 hours now makes me feel refreshed and gives me the energy to think more smoothly. Combining all of this additional sleep with a relatively healthy morning routine and a tasty breakfast, things are 10/10.

### So what happened to me with 8 hours of sleep:

### PRO

* More focused and channeled work sessions

* My schedule/routine looks more sensible

* Healthy look for my skin, hair and eyes

* Faster response time (brain, decisions, reactions)

### CONS

* Less hours in the day

* Guilty feelings when others are working into the night

## You probably ask, what’s the reasoning behind this?!

### Getting married helped. Aha.

No seriously, during that time in the city, I wasn’t living with my, now, wife. So I’d come home and just occupy myself with work versus Xbox.

Since we moved into our flat, I’ve tried hard to break into a 9–5 pattern to make sure to separate work and life a little more. This focus on keeping a balance has paid off. I feel more switched on than I ever have and much more energetic.

## Do you ever sleep 6 hours?

Of course. In fact, Thursdays, I sleep 4–6 hours a night.

This is where we started the article. This late night work session, once a week, gives me the opportunity to catch-up on goal-planning and editing.

It does leave me knackered the next day, but sometimes too many sets of 8–9 hours sleep does leave me over-tired, so I like to throw in this stressor. Maybe I’m mad, but it helps right now.

### The moral of this story is:

* If you are pondering increasing the amount of sleep you are taking. Do it for 3-months (90-days) and tally your benefits using a 10-minute journal entry in the morning after waking. When I did this, **my hand-writing improved** and I noticed I was a lot more alert, not just then, but across the day. You will notice the affects and you can then weight this against your workload.

* Try and avoid listening to “busy” or “sleep-poor” stories of colleagues. This will try and normalise this bad habit. Trust me, hearing these tales really puts you off from sleep, **you want to “work harder” and “hustle”** but chances are you are damaging your health, with occasional exceptions. I now deliver the same results on more sleep, and even more sometimes, despite loosing those 2 hours a day.

* If you have trouble heading to bed, there’s countless solutions. Use “[Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)” a Japanese practice about steady learning and improvement and **change one thing at a time** and hack your sleep together. Over time, you’ll have the perfect sleep set-up and bedtime wind-down. One thing that Becca and I do now is have Google Home Mini play “forest sounds” to fall asleep too and set a 2hr sleep timer to stop playing into the morning.

Of course, if you sleep 6 hours and this is your optimum time. That’s great. Stick to it. But just make sure you are listening to your body when it comes to recovery. It’ll pay off over time, for sure.

# Positive Thinking? Pathetic! Strong People Make Meaning Out of Suffering

## Positive Thinking? Pathetic! Strong People Make Meaning Out of Suffering
> # *Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.*
> # *— Viktor Frankl*

When Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl wrote the above quote in *Man’s Search for Meaning, *I’m pretty sure he didn’t mean to imply that people who are experiencing bad circumstances should “think positive,” or “look on the bright side.”

Can you imagine suggesting to any prisoner in a concentration camp — having lost *everything*, starving, struggling to stay alive — that she should focus on:

- how the experience is, in fact, a growth opportunity?

- how what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger?

- how replacing negative thoughts with positive ones will generate positive results?

No.

It’s only when lives and cruelty aren’t *really*on the line that we begin to believe that we are entitled to be *happy*all the time like we do here in the western world.

## **Happiness is a Right? That’s B.S.**

Here, we believe that happiness is an inalienable right.

We believe that people who encounter painful life circumstances bring them on with negative *thoughts.*

We imply that *we *can use positive thinking to magically protect ourselves from painful events like those our lesser counterparts “attract” via their inferior negative thinking patterns.

Believing we’re *entitled *to feel happy distorts Frankl’s idea about choosing one’s attitude in hard times into a mockery of itself where we use attitude choice as a goal-driven push away from feelings and toward *results. *Every day I see people *inflicting *positive thinking on friends and family members (or ourselves) who are grieving or in pain.

Example: Years ago, an old friend of mine lost her father to a devastating illness. The next day, her neighbor showed up on her doorstep carrying a smiley-face balloon and clutching a boom box that was blasting “*Don’t worry. Be happy.”*Sheesh!

As a culture, we constantly evade the normal, natural grief that emerges from loss; the disappointment that slams into us when we’re hurt or disillusioned; the anger that arises from being treated unfairly. We push these feelings underground with a collective demand for positive thinking, a demand that paradoxically reveals our terror of the feelings, a belief that simple emotions are somehow dangerous.

The idea that all painful feelings are hurtful and corrosive and that happiness is the only healthy emotional state stems from a simplistic view of emotions.

Come on, folks! We tout our strength all over the place! We should be capable of more complex thinking than that.

## **Emotional States Are *Not *All The Same**

Sadness over loss is not at all the same as self-pity.

Outrage at having been wronged is not equivalent to contemptuous anger.

Disappointment at making a mistake is not the same as a shameful giving in to failure.

**Life is *full *of painful circumstances that simply *are. *There is no way to escape grief, disappointment, or other forms of suffering in a human life.**
> # Note that Frankl also said: *Not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete.*

And modern emotion science shows that it’s when we feel ashamed of our emotions, or abandoned in the midst of intense emotional states that we don’t know how to handle, that our healthy emotions morph into the corrosive bad kind of emotion. When we are instead supported to *feel *the emotions that arise in response to life events, and to *express *those emotions in healthy ways, the emotions themselves (even painful ones) actually generate healing, restoration, and adaptive actions.

(Note that expressing emotion does not equal mindlessly *acting out *any emotion that comes our way. I’m not advocating for spoiled toddler behavior!)

When we find a way to express our true emotions, we discover that:

- Results are NOT the same as meaning. So forcing positive thinking on people in order for them to get results can lead to lots of meaningless productivity.

- Happiness is NOT the same as the meaningful joy that comes from feeling the full range of emotional experience. Happiness is elusive and momentary. It was never meant to be a constant state.

## **A Meaningful Way to Choose an Attitude**

What Frankl was talking about when he discussed choosing one’s attitude was not positive thinking. What he *was *talking about was choosing an inner stance toward suffering that imbues whatever we’re going through with meaning.

The attitude we *can *choose that gives us true freedom is an attitude of humility. We certainly should not become passive in the face of our own or others’ suffering. But we do need to admit when life is larger than we are, and to turn *toward *the suffering that emerges to seek what it is asking of us.

I’m NOT saying we should be grateful to our suffering for teaching us all kinds of wonderful things. That would be premature, perilous positive thinking.

I’m saying that we can *listen to *our suffering and find out if it’s wanting us to get help, to help others, to take a break, to fight for what’s right, to break apart and knit ourselves back together, to try to heal a relationship, to let go of a relationship.

The seeds of healing and growth are embedded in suffering itself. But we have to adopt an inner attitude of compassion that accepts that suffering is *terrible, *even as it is necessary; that understands that suffering is more likely to lead to growth and healing when supportive communities *help *sufferers.

Life is hard. There are no guarantees. We should choose an attitude of kindness toward one another. Especially during times of suffering.
> # *The way in which a [person] accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, … gives him ample opportunity — even under the most difficult circumstances — to add a deeper meaning to his life. He may remain brave, dignified, and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a [person] either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not. … Such [people] are not only in concentration camps. Everywhere [people] are confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through [their] own suffering*

# 3 Insights the New Billie Ad Taught Me About Marketing

## Billie’s new ad “Project Body Hair”

We see legs. And hair. Lots of hair.

Armpits, bellies and feet. All close-ups. All full of hair.

That’s the way it is. That’s the way bodies look like. That’s how female bodies look like.

Yet, not in ads.

Ads used to show women’s skin without any hair. Smooth like the sea on a windless Sunday afternoon. Hair used to be a male attribute. A sign of growing up, sophistication and power.

*Until now.*

Billie, a female-first shave and body brand, breaks this rule. Its new commercial celebrates female body hair in all its beauty and diversity. It’s a call for gender equality, emancipation and freedom.

The ad has been a huge success [on social media](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/billie-womens-razors-hair-ad-shaving). It’s a great artwork and a marketing masterpiece. It teaches us three insights that every marketer can deploy to create work that matters.

## **1. Political Activism**

![© Billie](1*Bb-eevFow_f5wchn3VM1dw.jpeg)*© Billie*

[Successful 21st century brands don’t promise material wealth but higher order values.](https://artplusmarketing.com/the-new-wave-of-status-symbols-98c1c03d98ad) Consumers engage in sustainable citizenship. They demand businesses to take an ideological stance on the world instead of only selling functional goods.

Billie doesn’t accept that women pay 10–15% more for razors than men. It fights what they call the “pink tax”. It builds razors for womankind at a fair price and fights male hegemony.

The New York-based body brand also challenges stereotypical beauty and gender clichés. It paves the way for women’s freedom to choose. To choose who they are, what they want to do and how they want to look like.

By doing so, Billie adheres gender equality, feminism and female self-realisation. It establishes a new female identity and its ads become a socio-cultural call for action. The brand enacts like a political activist and fights for ethical values. For its customers, Billie functions as an identity maker. They use the brand to show the world their beliefs, attitudes and ideologies.

## 2. Neotribalism and Communities

![© Billie](1*13EgJWeBg2i4fVqWXRGaRw.jpeg)*© Billie*

NikePlus provides athletes a platform to connect. Harley Davidson doesn’t sell motorbikes but access to a network of freedom lovers. A circle of hardcore fans builds MINI’s brand identity in unofficial and exclusive membership meetings.

Nowadays, consumers buy products because of their social link to like-minded peers. The universal human needs of belonging to a tribe with shared values drives humans. And smart marketers are aware of this phenomenon.

Some of them seem to work for Billie.

Besides its commercials, Billie also has also launched an online platform where customers can connect to each other: [#projectbodyhair. ](https://mybillie.com/pages/projectbodyhair)This social movement encourages women to make the internet a little fuzzier. It invites every women to submit her own body hair photo and be proud of the way they are.

## **3. Direct-to-Consumer Brand**

![© Billie](1*5-Gx6hXgS3eVc4OlLQ9a2A.jpeg)*© Billie*

The Dollar Shave Club has blunt Gillette’s success. Casper has disrupted the mattress market. And Warby Parker has revolutinzed how we buy our sunglasses.

Humans love the David vs. Goliath story. The small ones beat the big ones. The underdogs tear down the business places once dominated by the Unilevers and P&Gs of our world.

These so-called direct-to-consumer brands (DTCs) are the new normal. They avoid traditional retailers and sell their products through their own online store. DTCs foster a one-to-one relationship with their customers. They rely on social media marketing and get rid of intermediares like TV channels or newspapers.

So, is Billie. The rising star promotes its service on Instagram, Facebook and Youtube only. It offers freeshipping. Their fans can get an individual product besides the overpriced mainstream offerings.

All in all, Billie practices an ideologically driven branding and marketing philosophy. Its new ad enacts as a form of political activism with the purpose of establishing a new female identity. Billie provides its target group a platform to connect and fight for shared values. As a micro brand, Billie markets its products directly to its fans. Without any expensive intermediaries but with authenticity and transparency.

# Why Small Steps Lead To Big Results

## Photo by Isaac Smith on Unsplash

## Don’t Quit But Readjust Your Plans
> # “Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.” — Jim Rohn

Daily action, irrespective of its size **compounds into greater momentum**. We must move forward towards our goals irrespective of what is encountered along the way. The journey to reach our goals is seldom easy, in fact it was never meant to be easy. The purpose of goals is the **personal growth** experienced along the way. I’m not suggesting the final goal is of lesser importance, yet were it not for the growth that takes place, the goal is meaningless. It is the joy of the experience and who we become while pursuing the goal that makes it worthwhile. Have you achieved a goal in the past and noticed the improvements in your confidence and self-esteem?

Quitting when the going gets tough is taking the easy way out, readjusting our plans however should be our primary focus. Abandoning our goals is akin to flying from one destination to another, when our plane is unexpectedly stranded at a stopover. As a result, we return home instead of finding an alternative route to our destination. This is what many people do in terms of their goals. They give up when the going gets tough because they lack the confidence to find a solution, or are frustrated overcoming their challenges. However, that is the purpose of goals: to find new ways to reach them, gain new skills and discover more about ourselves.

## Find Ways To Motivate Yourself
> # “We are the creative force of our life, and through our own decisions rather than our conditions, if we carefully learn to do certain things, we can accomplish those goals.” — Stephen Covey

To achieve our goals, we must establish firm habits as a framework to reach them. Without good habits we are being controlled by external conditions and our internal world. Goals require constant motion and making informed decisions explains author Larry Weidel: “If you want to win, you have to keep moving forward. To keep moving forward, you have to keep making decisions.” I’ve coached many hundreds of people who lose inspiration while pursuing their goals. Successful people are like you and me and are prone to feel unmotivated from time to time. The difference however, is **they have a strong framework of habits to fall back on**. **They don’t contemplate giving up or changing their goal, but will adjust their route to get there.**

Consider the example of an author who wants to write an 80,000 word novel and encounters periods of not being motivated. They know if they miss a day of writing, they will fall behind their deadline and soon their publisher will be on their back to complete the novel. Whilst projects and deadlines are good motivators, they can sometimes work against us depending on our motivational type (intrinsic vs extrinsic). So, if we respond favourably to deadlines, as long as we have sound habits in place, we will likely stick to our goals. I value the advice from authors Gary Keller and Jay Papasan who write in *The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results: *“The trick to success is to choose the right habit and bring just enough discipline to establish it.”

We must find ways to motivate ourselves, knowing conditions needn’t be optimal to pursue our goals. That is, we may wake up feeling tired or with a cold or flu and still pursue our goals, anyway. That’s why sound habits are important, especially when we are less inclined to pursue them. For example, when writing one of my earlier books I made a plan to complete one thousand words per day, in order to finish the manuscript in less than ninety days. However, there were days when life got in the way and I missed writing due to other pressing matters. Yet, through good habits I made up for it in the ensuing days by writing two thousand words or more. A strange thing happened as a result: the momentum of my habits pulled me along and within sixty days I completed over ninety five percent of the manuscript. I was ahead because my habits forced me to focus on the task instead of being dictated by external factors. At the saying goes: “Easy to do, easy not to do.”

![Photo by [Isaac Smith](https://unsplash.com/@isaacmsmith?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*GNC0xfdRnWnkUtKp)*Photo by [Isaac Smith](https://unsplash.com/@isaacmsmith?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

## Create Sound Habits And Stick To Them
> # “What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.” — Zig Ziglar

Some years ago, I was coaching clients with their health goals and realised many were frustrated setting goals with a certain end date. The goal seemed difficult to reach because there was a gap separating their desires from where they stood. Most times, the client had not formed habits in this area and it was my task to help them create the right habits to reach their goals. They were surprised when I set a plan that involved walking around the block twice in the first week and increasing it over the coming weeks. I imagine they were looking for a magic nutritional formula, specific exercises and supplements to achieve their goals, yet it was much simpler than that. I wanted to create sound habits they could stick to until it became second nature. It required focusing on building a solid foundation in the initial stages. Think about the habits you have in place? Are they serving you? How might you change or adjust them for a better outcome?

When they had established their new habit, the momentum was like a wheel rolling downhill; it gathered enough energy to keep it moving. I liken it to consulting with an architect when planning on building a new home. In the initial discussion, they are unlikely to discuss the fittings for the kitchen or bathroom since that comes later on. The initial discussion involves agreeing on the designs and framework first, then the rest will follow. That is the key principle of this article: **smaller steps lead to greater momentum if we keep moving forward towards our goals.** With this in mind, consider what small steps you can take to work towards your goals. What is the smallest adjustment you can make in your habits for greater impact? If we stop or quit, we must find the motivation to start again and create new habits from scratch. Quitting is seldom the answer, however adapting our plan should be the aim if we wish to reach our goals.

# I Love Doing Nothing—and I’m Not Lazy For It. Here’s Why&#58;

## 

Recently, I’ve been making time to do nothing.

In fact, I’d say I’ve *prioritized* doing nothing. I wake up every morning, grab my coffee, pen, and extra-large post-it, and write-out my to-do list — leaving at least half-an-hour of time blocked out for “nothing.”
> Well, I write in all caps — so really, “NOTHING.”

And when that time comes, I stop whatever I’m doing, and do nothing.

## **I’m not lazy for it.**

In fact, I’d go as far as to say I’m *more* productive on the days I specifically block out time for nothing, than on days I don’t.

Let me explain.

Not too long ago, I fell into a funk in regards to writing. It felt like I had exhausted every part of my brain — that there were no topics left to cover, no words left to use. It wasn’t so much writer’s block as it persisted beyond writing and into every other creative endeavor I was involved in.

I felt completely maxed-out.

But, like most of us, I have plenty of goals I want to accomplish — one of them being recognized as a world-class writer. And I know without writing on a daily basis, I’m not going to reach that goal.

So, I pushed-on through my slump.

I did what I could to come up with insightful pieces, offering the reader some sort of value or actionable advice, but the fact I was in a funk was evident in my writing. Everything felt forced. Some of the articles I pushed out were a reach, to say the least, and some were just out-right embarrassing (according to my standards).

It was frustrating beyond belief. All of my previous methods of thinking up new pieces began to fail me. I tried every brain-stimulating hack I had ever heard of — extra coffee, reading, yoga, running around the block — none of it worked. Articles that would normally take me an hour to write took triple the time, with half the quality.

One night, I hit my end. I was sitting at my desk, trying to figure out what to write about, thinking myself into a massive headache. I tried and tried to get my juices flowing and again, none of it worked.

Since ‘nothing’ was working so well against me, I thought to myself: *Maybe if I use **that** as a stimulant, it’ll work to my advantage.*

### **I decided to do nothing.**

I literally laid on the floor of my bedroom and did nothing.

I wasn’t on my phone, wasn’t listening to music or a podcast or reading or watching *The Office*. I was just laying there, letting ‘nothing’ consume me. I figured I’d stay there awhile, just to see what would happen.

And after a few minutes of doing nothing, ideas for articles started popping into my head. The thing is: I wasn’t trying to think of new content. I wasn’t *trying* to think of anything — but by just ‘being’ for a bit, thoughts started to flow.

At first, my thoughts were random and unrelated to one another. I thought about work and what I had for breakfast and archeology and Harry Potter and Lil Wayne and eating less meat and a whole bunch of other things — things that subconsciously float around in my mind on a daily basis that I typically pay no attention to.

What I noticed, however, was that in doing nothing, I was finally able to analyze my thoughts in-full, considering everything that came to mind in greater context. There was a dialogue going on in my head — I actually *talked* to myself. And whatever ‘useless’ thoughts came to mind — thoughts I’d typically ignore — suddenly became *useful*, in the sense that I found ways to incorporate them into an article.

By doing nothing, I gave my brain room to breathe and let free-flowing thoughts spark conversation with my inner-conscious.

## **Prioritizing nothing is prioritizing high-level thinking.**

It sounds counter-intuitive, I know, but trust me: your brain needs time to decompress in order to function properly.

Try incorporating time for nothing into your day. It doesn’t really matter how long — 30 minutes works for me — but it’s going to be different for everybody.

And remember: don’t expect anything out of it — that defeats the whole purpose. If you go into your ‘nothing’ session expecting to come out some enlightened, all-knowing being, it’s not going to work.

Simply get comfortable, and let your mind go.

# How Facebook Groups Can Help Marketers Thrive

## 

New changes to [Facebook’s News Feed](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/rip-facebook-news-feed-for-publishers.html) have made organic reach practically impossible. It’s a clear signal that many marketers need to change their approach once again. While paying for [Facebook ads](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-important-reasons-you-need-to-use-facebook-ads-right-now-first-90-days.html) is always an option (one that you should be using, I must add), it may be too expensive for companies struggling with a small budget. Luckily, there is a lower-cost, engagement-driving alternative: Facebook Groups.

Now, Facebook Groups are nothing new. But many marketers have yet to take full advantage of what this unicorn feature has to offer. It serves as an engagement loophole, making it incredibly valuable after the recent [Facebook News Feed Armageddon](https://mobilemonkey.com/blog/2018/01/facebook-news-feed-tips). If you haven’t plunged into the world of Facebook Groups, here are five things you need to know.

## 1. A Focus on Collaboration

While a traditional Facebook page is predominately considered a one-way broadcasting platform where the primary goal is to send out information, Facebook Groups are more focused on open and equal discussion. The experience is meant to be collaborative, with participants having the ability to take part in the conversation.

I know what you’re thinking: “How are Facebook Groups valuable if they focus on collaboration?”

Initially, this may seem like a drawback from a marketing perspective, as Facebook groups are not ad-centric. However, it actually gives you a chance to engage with users in a meaningful and authentic way.

Group members have a definite interest in the topic covered by the members. This allows you to gather a range of information and talk directly with a targeted audience. That’s what makes Facebook Groups a unicorn for discovery and connection, particularly as [engagement levels fall](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/this-is-why-facebook-engagement-is-falling-for-bra.html) for brands and publishers.

## 2. You Can Create a New Group

If you need specific feedback or would like to have discussions in a particular niche, then you can create a group designed to do just that.

What sort of reasons would there be to start a group? Nearly anything.

A [product or service launch](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/the-ultimate-product-launch-checklist-infographic.html) is one excellent example, letting you drum up interest and learn the thoughts of potential customers. You could also create one to push an upcoming event, coordinating conversations with attendees.

Looking for feedback on an existing offering? Create a group and get the information you need. The possibilities are essentially endless.

### **Facebook Group Settings**

When you create a group, you have the ability to set it to “public,” where anyone can see the posts; “closed,” where anyone can find the group but only members can view the posts; or “secret,” where members have to add a person directly for them to gain access. You can also control whether anyone can post to the group or if those rights should only be given to group admins.

Ultimately, which options are best depends on your goals, so consider what you want to accomplish before making a choice.

If you are looking to [drive engagement](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/what-most-shared-content-on-facebook-can-teach-you-about-engagement.html) in general, then a public group where everyone can participate is your best bet. For providing support to customers after the sale, a closed group where anyone can post could be a better choice. This approach provides members with some serious value without you having to risk a forceful takeover of the group’s purpose.

## 3. Or Join an Existing One

In some cases, a Facebook Group will already exist within your target market, such as a current events forum for your industry. In those cases, you can request to join it if you want to be part of the conversation.

Why would you want to join an existing group? For the built-in audience!

An established group already has members, so you’re tapping into a pre-existing resource. That means you get to reach out to potential customers without having to source them yourself. Now, doesn’t that sound like a unicorn of an opportunity?

## 4. Contributing to the Conversation

When you join or create a group, you may be tempted to get your sales pitch out there. After all, that’s what this is for, right?

Wrong! Just like you need to create [quality content](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/what-quality-content-really-looks-like-today.html) for your Facebook page, you shouldn’t blanket the group with blatant advertising.

Instead, engage with others, take part in discussions, answer questions, and establish your account as an authority. This creates a buzz surrounding your brand, drawing in Facebook users and separating yourself from the donkeys of the group.

## 5. Bypassing News Feed Armageddon

One distinct benefit of using Facebook Groups is that new posts appear in more areas than just the News Feed. Yes, the News Feed appearance is still there, but it’s easy for new information to get lost there.

Where else do they appear? In the user’s notifications.

That’s right, they get a separate notification when new information is added. No more getting buried in the News Feed!

Just be forewarned that a high level of activity (resulting in a plethora of notifications) may lead some users to disable the notification. And, since the posts can get lost in the News Feed, they may forget the group exists.

This means you want to be strategic about groups, especially the ones you start, to [keep engagement high](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/what-most-shared-content-on-facebook-can-teach-you-about-engagement.html). If you aren’t prepared to make sure the group provides value to others, then this isn’t the right option for you.

## Are Facebook Groups the Answer?

While getting involved in existing groups or creating new ones might not be one-stop shopping for all of your marketing needs, Facebook Groups can be incredibly powerful unicorns brimming with opportunity.

In the end, they are an excellent way to combat some of the losses everyone is going to experience after [Facebook’s News Feed changes](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/goodbye-facebook-news-feed-10-things-publishers-need-to-know-about-news-feed-armageddon.html). Adding them to your repertoire gives you a new way to engage with users in meaningful ways. In exchange, you’ll gain access to valuable feedback and be able to promote your company as an authority.

Since the feature is free to use (and isn’t a free feature a unicorn in its own right?), there really isn’t any risk to giving it a try. So, why wouldn’t you take advantage of Facebook Groups to help forward your marketing efforts?

It doesn’t take a lot of time to get started, so explore what’s out there or create your own. Any option that can increase engagement is worth exploring, including Facebook Groups.

# 5 Harsh Yet Liberating Truths You Must Accept To Revolutionize Your Life

## 5 Harsh Yet Liberating Truths You Must Accept To Revolutionize Your Life

Ambitious people are a dime a dozen. Most people doubt themselves. All of us — in some shape or form — are stuck in la la land.

One of the most difficult yet useful skills is the ability to balance your aspirations with reality. A pessimist and an idealist both miss the point.

The point is to have optimism about your future but look at the state of society, your environment, and your circumstances without rose-colored glasses.

Many of these truths sit right under your nose. Intuitively you know they’re true, but facing them head-on means discomfort.

Success or failure in life comes from which type of discomfort you choose.

You can choose the discomfort of facing reality, making decisions to change, and having the difficult dialogue needed to do both.

You can also choose the discomfort of rationalizing your situation, lying to yourself, and making excuses.

The choice is yours. In my experience, and from what I’ve observed, taking the discomfort upfront can feel horrible in the short run but rewarding in the long run. Pushing it away with the avoidance of truth alleviates discomfort in the short term, but it always comes back and persists until you do something about it.

Take a look at the truths I’m about to share with you. Technically, they are my opinions. You’re free to disagree with them. Before you do, though, try to take a look at yourself and your situation honestly to determine whether you really disagree with me, or you’re just hiding.

## The World Will Never Quit Poking You
> Most [people] make the error of thinking that one day it will be done. They think, “If I can work enough, then one day I could rest.”Or, “I’m only doing this now so that one day I can do what I really want with my life.” The […] error is to think that eventually, things will be different in some fundamental way. They won’t. It never ends. As long as life continues, the creative challenge is to tussle, play, and make love with the present moment while giving your unique gift.

Have you ever felt like your circumstances were trying to break you?

Just when you’ve improved your finances, your car breaks down. You wake up on the wrong side of the bed, come to work to a nagging boss and go home to an indifferent spouse.

Every time you take a step forward, you take three back. Inevitably, just as you’re on the rise, something or someone tries to knock you down.

If only life would give you a little bit of a break, you tell yourself, you’d have enough energy to make an effort to become successful.

Deep down, you believe success provides an escape from life’s problems. You figure if you had enough income, freedom, and positive experiences in your life…the bullshit would stop.

It doesn’t and it never will.

In fact, when you push to do something outside of the box — start a business,write a book, become an artist, carve your own route — not only will things get worse before they get better, you’ll still have to work to maintain what you’ve achieved.

People of all walks of life have problems. Billionaires have problems, Hollywood actors, the Dalai Lama all have problems. Around every corner, just when you think you’ve won, life will find a way to see what you’re made of.

But there’s beauty in the struggle of life when you look at the right way. When life tests you, you get the chance to prove you’re resilient. One of the deepest levels of satisfaction comes from knowing how strong you are. Few memories are better than those of overcoming struggles, persisting, and absorbing pressure and turning it into fuel instead of letting it break you.

Realizing the world will constantly test you removes the element of surprise.When you find yourself in a bad spot, it feels doubly worse because you didn’t see it coming.

Know that life is preparing its next right hook, but as Jim Rohn said, “Don’t wish it was easier. Wish you were Better. Don’t wish for fewer problems. Wish for more skills.”

Our first reaction to pain and hardship — mine included — is to dwell on how much it sucks. A few of us, however, realize there’s an opportunity to be had.

It’s easy to say and difficult to do, but if you can learn how to transform pain into purpose you’ll feel a type of happiness that is ten times better than the feeling of having a life devoid of difficulties.

Maybe our purpose on this planet isn’t to feel good. Maybe we’ve been placed here to see what we’re made of.

Almost every time life tests you, you won’t want to find the opportunity in it. I never look positively at a challenge or hardship instantly, but after I’m done sulking, I look to take a step in a positive direction.

Try it. Over time, it works wonders.

## Things Will Never be the Way They “Should” Be
> “We unconsciously imprison ourselves to avoid our most primal fears. We choose Should because choosing Must is terrifying, incomprehensible.”- Elle Luna

Should — what a simultaneously dangerous and useless word.

People often use should in one of two ways — to give themselves an excuse for not doing something or for complaining about an unchangeable circumstance.

A perfect world doesn’t exist — the one without inequality, injustice, unfairness, superficial people, hate, greed, envy, lust, the list goes on.

Are you using the world should to avoid living in reality?

Maybe you think you should be making more money. But you’re not, and believing you should make more isn’t going to change that. Finding a new job could change that. Improving your performance and negotiating a raise could change that.

Complaining definitely won’t.

Maybe you think you shouldn’t have to work twice as hard to achieve the same level of success as someone else. But what if you do have to work twice as hard? Are you going to wait for the scales of justice to even out? They won’t.

Again, you can complain if you want, but complaining isn’t a strategy. It doesn’t do anything.

The same energy you use to rail against the way life should or shouldn’t be could be used to improve your situation.

Should also become dangerous when you talk about the things you aspire to do. “I should start working out,” you tell yourself. “I should start working harder and being motivated.” The minute you use the word in your head or out loud, you’ve already lost. It gives you an out. You almost get a perverse satisfaction from thinking about doing something. It gives you the credit you don’t deserve yet.

Instead of talking about what you should do and the way the world should be, you’re better off doing.

Doers make change happen for themselves and for others. Doers don’t have time to think about what they should or shouldn’t do. They know what to do. If they don’t, they gather enough information to have an idea of what to do and act on it.

Ask yourself where the word should is causing harm in your life. Now, what are you going to do about it?

## No One is Coming to Save You
> “Sure, raise the minimum wage if you plan to stay there your entire life.” — Jim Rohn

When was the last time the government came to your rescue?

The answer is likely never. Yet we treat it like a savior or a demon when it’s neither. It’s a machine. An uncaring machine that’s completely self-interested. Regardless, we make our way to the voting booths to ensure our guy or girl wins.

Look at your own life. Has it changed dramatically between presidencies — not in terms of news coverage or your feelings about the president — but your actual life from day to day?

Are you waiting for an employer to save you with a raise or magically improving your work environment? If so, you might be waiting for a long time.

It’s easy to blame the government, your employer, or someone other than yourself for your woes. It’s easier to say wages should be higher than to try to become more valuable.

I’m not saying the institutions of society are fair. They’re definitely not. With the fleeting life you live, however, you don’t have time to wait for institutions to save you.

Odds are, you’ll have to lift yourself out of your circumstances. Will it be easy? Hell no. But you really don’t have a choice — not if you want to change your life.

## Everything is Your Fault
> “If you could kick the person in the pants responsible for most of your trouble, you wouldn’t sit for a month.”- Theodore Roosevelt
I know what you’re thinking.

You were born poor, your parents didn’t treat you well, you have a disability, you have a funny accent, you live in the wrong city, you’re sick, your boss hates you, you have no money, you’re a disabled veteran, you’re black, you’re a woman, you’re gay, you’re trans.

You’re special. And because your circumstances are so unique, you couldn’t possibly be to blame for your failures.

Deep down we know we’re the common denominator of all our problems, but it’s hard to face. Why?

Becuase it means we’re the ones who have to change our situations. And if we don’t change our situations, we can only blame ourselves. Nobody wants to think they’re the only real barrier to their own success, happiness, and well-being. It’s easier to blame someone or something else.

And no, I don’t think you’re lazy, mediocre, or “don’t want it bad enough.” It’sgenuinely difficult to take full ownership of your life. It can be uncomfortable or downright painful. The natural reaction is blaming someone other than yourself because your brain wants to protect you from harm and danger. But you can overcome these excuses.

You’re in control of your life.

Are you in control of what happens to you? No, but you’re in control of how you react to what happens to you.

You choose how to react to situations, maybe not fully and consciously, but choose nonetheless.

If you don’t take responsibility for your life, who will? I know how hard it is. Denial feels bad, but it hurts a little less than accepting the truth of your role in your own life.

If you go through the painful period of acceptance and get up from the floor, I promise greater things are ahead.

## You’ll Never Find the Perfect Time Start
> “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” — Proverb

I remember the first time I told my wife I wanted to start writing.

“I think it would be really fun to have a blog and start writing,” I said.

“Well…why don’t you start writing then?” She replied.

I knew I wanted to be a writer when I was 17 years old. I didn’t start until I was 25. Maybe I was too immature to write anything of value until I’d lived a little, but I still wonder how much further along I could be now if I started earlier.

Did I make a declaration to become a writer, buy a typewriter, and lock myself in a room to write for hours? No.

I started with one blog post…and I’ve been writing nearly every day for years since. There’s power in starting. You don’t have to make a big deal out of starting a new project, just do it.

Seriously, what are you waiting for?

Are you waiting for the kids to grow older or move out so you can write that book?

Leo Tolstoy had 13 kids when he wrote War and Peace.

Are you waiting to have enough money to start your business?

If you have a good idea, there are various ways to start businesses at low cost or find seed money. Oh, it’s hard to find seed money? Well, starting a business is hard. Deal with it.

All salesmen know the phrase “now isn’t the right time,” is a lie. There’s always a hidden objection behind the polite ones given such as lack of time, money, or ideal circumstances. The objection could be that the buyer doesn’t trust the seller, they don’t believe the product will deliver on its benefits, or they do believe in the product but not in themselves to get the most from it.

The way you self-talk is much like the relationship between a salesperson and a customer. You give yourself the polite out, but the truth is there’s a deeper objection.

What is it? You may not have even consciously thought of it yet. You really might believe in your own polite excuses. Until you dig deep to find the hidden reasons behind your behavior, you’ll never change. I talk about this process at length in my book.

We all have deeply embedded beliefs about ourselves and about the world we live in — business is “risky,” intelligence and talent are fixed traits, finding a secure job will make us happy, others are luckier than you are, rich people steal, you’re left or right brained and can’t cross over, being healthy means depriving yourself, you must own a home and have kids, men are evil, women are evil, the list goes on and on and on.

Many of these beliefs keep you from starting. You’re not a “numbers person” you tell yourself. Richard Branson has dyslexia and teachers labeled him learning disabled as a child — he’s a billionaire.

You think you can’t succeed because you’re ill or have a disability. Jon Morrow — a man who cannot move anything below his neck — owns a multi-million dollar blog with a viewership of millions per month.

I can find a counterexample to every excuse you have for not starting “x.” Rather than argue with me about it, why not just start?

## Learn How to See

There’s a lot of noise in the world. A lot of b.s. You can find success by seeing through it all.

You can wait for the world to change into the ideal state you want it to be, or you can learn to navigate it.

The people we call successful, they can see — through the limits, society tries to place on people, through the cliches that aren’t true, through the joy-sucking prisons called institutions.

Can you see now?

I hope you decide to use the lens of truth to shape your decisions moving forward. It won’t feel good right away, but it will feel amazing when you look back at all you’ve done.

# 5 Simple Hacks to Sharpen Your Emotional Intelligence

## 

We spend an awful [lot of time in school](https://www.inc.com/melissa-shin/the-top-10-business-schools.html) throughout our lifetimes, diligently studying and cramming and writing exams, all in [the quest to be more intelligent](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/6-kinds-of-intelligence-iq-tests-don-t-measure.html) human beings.

How much time do you spend on your [emotional intelligence](https://www.inc.com/tom-gimbel/why-you-need-emotional-intelligence-to-run-a-business.html)?

If you’re like the average human being, the answer is probably: “Um, not much.”

That’s too bad, because according to researchers from Rutgers, there are [19 ways emotional intelligence contributes](http://www.eiconsortium.org/reports/business_case_for_ei.html) to the bottom line in any work organization. Emotional intelligence guides our ability to deal with others: to understand their emotions, as well as our own.

This is incredibly important in industries such as marketing, where a customer’s emotional reaction to an ad or display [could mean the difference](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/12-crazy-secrets-about-the-human-brain-to-make-you-a-better-marketer.html) between him or her making a purchase or walking away. But emotional intelligence affects all aspects of our professional lives, from our ability to sell, to our networking prowess, to the way we climb the career ladder (or don’t).

As leadership expert Gordon Tredgold wrote recently for [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gordon-tredgold/how-to-improve-your-emotional-intelligence_b_9119398.html), “We get promoted because of our IQ and we get fired because of our lack of EQ.”

Check out these five super simple hacks that will help you sharpen your emotional intelligence and enjoy all of the benefits that affords:

## 1. Stay cool.

[Italian researchers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256312275_Psychological_stress_and_body_temperature_changes_in_humans_Physiology_and_Behavior_52393-395) found that changes in body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure are great indicators of stress, which can affect how we deal with problematic situations. Before you lose your cool, take a walk outside to get some fresh air, or have a washroom break and splash cold water on your face. Don’t succumb that easily to the stressors.

## 2. Walk a mile in the other person’s shoes.

People can be a huge source of stress. Think about it: What drives your negative emotional reactions? Too often, it’s the opinions, judgments, requests, and demands of others. When a co-worker, superior, investor, or even competitor gets under your skin, try to look at the situation from that person’s perspective. Examine it from all angles. Is it possible you’re reading into the situation, or that his or her intent might be different from your understanding of it? Take a step back and think on the person’s possible motivations before reacting.

## 3. Have a plan B. And a plan C.

[*Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/emotional-intelligence) *defines emotional intelligence as “the ability to identify and manage your own emotions and the emotions of others.” How well can you manage your emotions if you’re never prepared for what’s next? Being reactionary is a sure-fire recipe for emotional reactions. Instead, start [projecting potential outcomes](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/top-10-business-plan-templates-you-can-download-free.html) each time you make a decision, even if some seem like a stretch. Imagine how you’ll react to each one, so you’re not completely caught off guard. You’ll eventually find that even if the outcome isn’t one you predicted, you’re better able to handle each one and think on the fly!

## 4. Be definitive.

Challenging your bad habits is key for developing your emotional intelligence. Do you tend to use [passive language](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/passive-voice/) to hedge your bets and protect yourself? (The form was completed by … New policies were introduced … etc.) Passive language is inherently weak, whether in writing or verbal; in fact, passive voice literally means telling the story of what’s happened to you. Do things happen to you, or are you a force who makes things happen? To showcase emotional intelligence, focus on highlighting the actions already taken. I completed the form. Our company introduced new policies. Take ownership and show customers, stakeholders, and the world your emotional intelligence.

## 5. Practice your emotional intelligence on others.

One critical aspect of emotional intelligence, as defined by *Psychology Today*, is your ability to [influence the emotions of others](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-to-get-people-to-like-you-heck-even-love-you.html). When a colleague comes to you in a stressed out, panicked state, are you calming, or is he or she more aggravated when you’re through? Whether in close, personal relationships, professional relationships, or interactions with strangers, how you deal with and influence others says a great deal about your emotional intelligence. Strive to leave each person you interact with in a better state.

Emotional intelligence is an incredibly[ important skill](https://mobilemonkey.com/articles/the-different-skills-of-a-modern-unicorn-marketer) across all aspects of your personal and professional life. How do you measure yours? Share your thoughts on emotional intelligence in the comments.

# I’ve Hired Hundreds Of People Throughout My Career.

## 

In today’s highly competitive labor market, most hiring managers understand that identifying, vetting, and hiring top talent is a key priority — one a CEO must be invested in. Gone are the days when you can hang the “Help Wanted” sign on the front page of your website and expect dozens of quality resumes to show up in your inbox.

Certainly, in my role as President of my company [BookBaby](http://www.bookbaby.com), I take the recruitment and interview process very seriously — not just because it’s important, but also because it’s difficult.

The truth is, anyone who takes the time and trouble to send you a resume and apply for your open position can probably do the tasks outlined in the job description. But that’s only half the battle.

## What to Look for in a Candidate

A successful hire is one who can complete tasks while also succeeding within the context and culture of the organization that employs them.

For my company, that means being nimble, forward thinking, and having an understanding of the publishing world. More specifically, beyond having good interview questions to ask, I look for three things in every candidate I interview.

### 1. The ability to work autonomously

All of my employees would agree on this one fact: I’m not a micromanager. I don’t want to spend my time looking over my employees’ shoulders all day long — I’ve got my own job to do!

Thus, I need employees to be self-starters who can not only inspire themselves, but also solve tough problems on their own.

### 2. The ability to communicate in various environments

Everyone expresses themselves in different ways. To succeed on my team, however, employees must be able to make themselves understood no matter their communication style.

This is true whether they’re communicating with their peers, managers, or especially customers. That means, of course, that new hires must also be able to adapt to different audiences — from those listening to their presentations in the office to those reading their words on Twitter.

### 3. The ability to make decisions

This might be the most important skill set that, truly, all managers look for. It doesn’t matter if you’re hiring a fresh-out-of-school marketer or a seasoned financial controller — candidates must be able to assess situations, determine the best means of achieving the optimal outcome, and make the call to move forward.

There’s a matter of trust here: as a company leader, you have to know that the people on your team will make the kind of choices and compart themselves in a way that is representative of your company, its ethos, and your ambitions.

Again, these priorities are not unique to me. These are things most founders, CEOs, and managers look for. They evidence, ultimately, abilities of reason and logic, levels of motivation, and self-awareness — the traits quality team members who’ll drive your company forward need to have.

## Good Questions to Ask in an Interview

So the question then becomes: how do you go about determining if candidates do possess these qualities?
> My strategy: ask the right questions.

### 1. Tell me about your happy place

The first question I ask candidates is this: tell me about your optimal work environment. An experience in which you know you’ll thrive. The culture in which you are most productive and happiest.[1]

I also want to know the characteristics exhibited by the best boss they’ve ever had — or wish that they’d had.

If their sort of optimal vision aligns with mine — with the sort of environment and culture I’ve worked hard to build in my company — I know we’re on the right track.

### 2. Putting the boss on notice

Second, my very best hires have all been people who’ve helped to up my game, so to speak.

So I always ask candidates for three or four expectations that they have of senior leaders in an organization. What hopes do they have for the people they work with and for?

If they can speak articulately on that, I know that it’s likely they’ll be able to help me improve in that area, which is a good thing for me and for the company.

### 3. Serving the customer

At BookBaby, we depend on our people to provide world-class customer service all day long.

It’s for this reason that I always ask candidates, then, to tell me a story about their most challenging customer and how they eventually made them happy — or didn’t.

You can learn a lot about the tolerance, patience, and one’s capacity for empathy and patience through stories like this. Plus, it’s important that candidates have experience to this end. Customer service is very much a skill.

### 4. That one decision

Finally, I do save one question for the end of every single interview. It’s a simple one — and I’ve received 100 different answers to it. Some amazing, some not so much.

Here it is:

*Tell me about the very best decision you’ve ever made.*

Was it a snap decision, or did you think it through? Were you happy with the outcome? Would you change it now?

This question reveals a lot about the applicant. Often it evidences their logic, and even gives you a glimpse of their creative capacity.

If the answer is forgettable and cliché, for example — “When I decided to ask my wife to get married” (ho hum) — that shows you either that the applicant hasn’t done many impressive things, or that they lack the creative chops to ideate something exciting.

## The Bottom Line

At the end of the day, of course more goes into whether or not you should make a decision as important as a new hire than just the interview — and four measly interview questions, at that!

But it remains that the interview — and particularly the interview with you, the leader of the company — is the most relevant and crucial opportunity a candidate gets to sell themselves. It’s inherently revealing, in this sense, and speaks to a candidate’s ability to perform under pressure.
> # Of course, you’ll only get useful questions out of an interview if you yourself put work into it on the back end.

It pays, in other words, to identify which questions, approaches, and strategies work best in helping you hire the right people for your company and its specific context.

# The GaryVee Content Strategy&#58; How to Grow and Distribute Your Brand’s Social Media Content

## 

Mastering content creation and distribution for your brand on social media is a difficult and long process. But, in an effort to provide you guys with as much value as possible, I’m going to help speed up that process and show you how I do it on a daily basis for my personal brand. Shared below is a powerpoint that my team and I created to help empower and potentially completely shift the way that you think about producing and distributing content online for your brand.

Look, I create a ton of content. I publish a new episode everyday on the [GaryVee Video Experience](https://www.facebook.com/garyvee/), which is distributed on [my YouTube channel](https://garyvee.com/YouTube), [Facebook Watch Page](https://garyvee.com/Facebook), and [IGTV](https://www.instagram.com/garyvee/). I then also have a daily podcast called the [GaryVee Audio Experience](https://garyvee.lnk.to/audioexperienceFA), which is distributed on [my iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-garyvee-audio-experience/id928159684?mt=2), [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/itunes928159684/the-garyvee-audio-experience), and [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-askgaryvee-show), amongst some other platforms. In addition to what I just mentioned, I continually post “micro content”, that is distributed to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/garyvee/), [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/add/garyvee), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garyvaynerchuk), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gary-Vaynerchuk), and many of my other social channels. “Micro content” is created from each episode and is used to drive awareness back to the original long-form content. Long story short, I am constantly creating and posting as much content as possible and in a way that is contextual to each platform.

Because I am producing so much content on a daily basis and in a way that has been proven to be very effective, I want to give you guys the full breakdown and analysis on what it is that I’m doing and how I am doing it. Like one of my favorite quotes, “[watch what I do, not what I say](https://youtu.be/25NjPTg-Ldw)”, this is a really good time for you to sit down, grab a cup of coffee, and carefully take note of what it is that I’m doing in this deck.

The ultimate goal of creating this presentation on my content model is to show you how my team took one of my keynotes, repurposed it into 30+ pieces of content, and then successfully distributed all of that content, resulting in over 35,000,000 total views.

I’m very proud of this deck and sincerely hope that it brings you, your team, or your company some serious value.


xoxo,

# Three Ways To Use The Power Of Persuasion In Marketing

## 

“Persuasion” is a term often used in marketing, and we’re all probably aware of it. What many businesses fail to realize is that persuasion isn’t just about getting people to buy your product. You may be able to get people to convert, but are they happy about the purchase? Were you able to change their sentiment towards your brand in a positive manner?

[Persuasion in marketing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/06/02/why-every-marketer-should-read-influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion/#4dd46c0a6d0c) involves the ability not just to influence people’s actions, but their attitude as well. Let me give you an example based on my experience a few years back. I called technical support because I was having some trouble with my laptop. After explaining the issue, I was told by the rep that what I was experiencing was a software problem, which wasn’t covered under my warranty. I was taken aback because I had bought the laptop only a few months prior to the call.

The rep explained to me that the warranty I had was for the hardware, which they manufactured. But to resolve any software problems, I would need to purchase an additional software warranty. Since I needed to get the problem resolved immediately, I grudgingly paid for the warranty.

Did the rep succeed in making a sale? Yes. But I felt like I was forced into it, and it affected my perception towards the brand. It felt as if I had no choice but to buy the warranty, and I was unhappy about it.

In persuasion, however, people end up making a purchase without feeling like they are being sold to. Persuasion involves influencing people’s attitude in such a way that they feel like they are making the decision on their own. They should be able to feel like they made an excellent decision with the purchase.

So I’ve decided to provide you with a few ideas on how you can effectively use persuasion in marketing. Check them out:

**1. Offer something to induce reciprocity.**

One of my favorite persuasion tactics is reciprocity. When we receive something from someone, whether it’s a gift or something as small as a compliment, we feel grateful. Our gratefulness makes us want to reciprocate and give them something in return. This is the power of reciprocity in action.

Even in marketing, we see it implemented all the time. A brand may offer a special discount on first purchases, which may compel many first-time visitors to make a purchase. Some may offer a discount to people who sign up, compelling many shoppers to register on the site instead of checking out as guests.

You can also see many SaaS companies applying the principle of reciprocity by offering free trials of their product. Companies like SEMrush, for instance, provide free demos for potential enterprise clients. Whatever it is that you are offering, it should be valuable enough to the customer. At the same time, it shouldn’t be too valuable that you end up facing a loss.

In return for your gift, you could get some customers to convert. Some may even recommend you to their friends and rave about you on[ social media](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/01/03/five-simple-and-effective-ways-to-humanize-your-brand-with-social-media/). So what you’re getting in return here is positive brand sentiment, which is vital for growth.

**2. Let scarcity do the talking for you.**

The scarcity principle is something you’ve probably seen in many e-commerce stores, when the number of items left in stock is on display. When shoppers see that a certain item they like is running low in stock, they feel compelled to make the purchase right away instead of saving it for later. In a way, it goes hand in hand with the urgency principle.

When a certain item is rare, we tend to have this perception that it is more valuable. On the other hand, we tend to lose interest in something that everyone else can have access to. In other words, exclusivity is what we crave as humans. This is what the scarcity principle is all about.

In marketing, you can offer your customers something exclusive that is unavailable to people who shop from other brands. Maybe your product is exceptional and there is no competition, like with Apple products. Maybe your restaurant serves a certain dish that tastes out of this world but is only available on Sundays.

You could also set up a VIP club, which is open to your best customers, just like Kiehl’s does. Club members could get early access to events, discounts and exclusive offers. Whatever the case is, people who buy from you should feel like they managed to achieve something that not many people could achieve. They should feel like they’re part of an exclusive group of people.

**3. Get authority figures to vouch for you.**

If someone like Neil Patel were to provide you with marketing advice, you would listen and follow that advice. Similarly, SEO tips from Rand Fishkin could make you want to change your entire SEO strategy. We trust advice coming from people we see as authority figures in their line of expertise. This is because we believe the decision based on advice from an authority figure is less likely to go wrong.

These authority figures have established their expertise a multitude of times, which acts as proof to us that their advice is trustworthy. Even influencer marketing is somehow based on the principle of authority. Influencers are people who have established their expertise in their niche, whether it’s in food, beauty, fashion, fitness or tech.

So you can start working with industry experts and influencers who can vouch for your products to win the trust of your target audience. With this increased level of trust, you also have an increased likelihood of driving sales.

These are some of the persuasion principles that would serve you well in your marketing efforts. Make an effort to give something that your customers would appreciate and would make them want to reciprocate.

# Your Time is Too Valuable For Game of Thrones

## Your Time is Too Valuable For Game of Thrones

### And I can break down exactly how.

***By [Michael Contento](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/author/michael-contento/), CEO of My Blue Umbrella***

When people consider the cost of watching [*Game of Thrones](https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones)*, they think about the money they’re spending to download or stream the series. They never consider the cost of the *time* they spend watching the show. If they did, they’d quit watching.

The reason? It could not possibly provide you with a [return sufficient](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/) to justify your investment.

The same is true of all our favorites: *Breaking Bad*. *Mad Men*. *The Sopranos*. Any of those long-running, intricately plotted TV shows.

## Let’s break it down.

Do you know how many hour-long episodes exist in the entire run of Game of Thrones? 73. The Sopranos had 86. Mad Men had 92!

Most of these episodes run almost an hour in length. To keep things simple, let’s assume that the people who have watched every episode of *Game of Thrones* have spent 73 hours watching the show.

That’s basically two work weeks.

So in addition to what you paid for the actual episodes, you also spend two weeks of work consuming them.

Let’s say you pull in $100,000 after taxes, and have two weeks of vacation. You make $2,000 a week.

Watching Game of Thrones costs you about $4,000.

On top of what you paid for the actual episodes you watched.

## How can that possibly be worth it?

Two objections are possible, here.

First, you didn’t binge your way through the whole 73-episode run. It’s not 73 hours* in a row*. Rather, you watched in a trickle, throughout the eight years that the show ran.

If that’s the case, however, then you probably spent *more* than two work weeks feeding your TV show habit. How many times did you go back and watch the last few episodes of the previous season to reacquaint yourself for the premiere of the upcoming one? How many recaps and explainers did you find on YouTube?

I have employees who were so excited about the final season that they went back and watched every episode-again. Taking into account the time spent rewinding the show to figure out what was said with some of those hard-to-understand accents, they probably spent a month watching the show.

Or, $8,000.

The other possible objection I want to head off is that, well, this is dead time. Not productive time. You’re watching this at night, after the kids are in bed. Watching the show relieves stress. Right?

But…is that really true? How many times did you finish an episode at 11 p.m., and continue on to the next one? And then you did it again? Which kept you up ’til 1 a.m. Which means you only got five hours of sleep. Which, over time, made you cranky, and groggy, and impeded upon your ability to perform at your job. If all that is true, the show actually added meaningfully to your stress level.

I hear other protests: *Game of Thrones* is valuable, some say, because it’s something to discuss with clients and coworkers. “Did you see what happened at the Red Wedding?” you might have said back in season three, perhaps to the executive you were trying to sell on a deal. And maybe even the shared experience of discussing the implications of that wholesale Stark slaughtering solidified a relationship, which in turn got you the deal.

Sure. OK. But I’d counter by saying that many other facets of life, which don’t require so much time, also can create shared experiences which might solidify business bonds. Following a sports team. Discussing your kids. Watching the latest blockbuster-go see a superhero or *Star Wars* movie on opening weekend. At least that only cost you two hours.

## The most successful people spend their time similar to the way they spend their money: thoughtfully.

If you are starting out in your career, and want to be successful, I would encourage you, too, to become cheap with your time. Don’t go spending your time on just anything. Have an *investment strategy* for your time. If you value your time in a rational way, you’ll see that investing in a TV show that has 73 episodes, and which requires you to see every one to stay current, isn’t smart.

Becoming successful at your career requires focus. And the ability to be more productive than other people. That means you’re going to miss some things because you have to stay in and work. Parties. Nights out. That may also mean you’ll miss being able to talk about the latest TV show, like *Game of Thrones*.

That’s OK. There’ll be plenty of time to relax on your couch, watching TV, when you have a few million bucks in your bank account.

# The Internet’s Gateway Drug — Passive Income (#Money)

## 

Ever since the birth of the internet and eCommerce, there’s been the rise of a new drug. It’s called passive income, otherwise known as making money online.

First off, there’s nothing wrong with money. The point of this article is that making passive income online has done two things:

1. Made people sacrifice the meaning of their life

1. Made people become addicted to the internet and making money online

Once you fall for this addiction, it can lead to other addictions.

Digital addictions such as endless online dating, porn, online computer games, online gambling and a routine of being away from real humans in the real world.

## The mirage of having to make passive income online.

*You don’t have an online course?
You didn’t sell an eBook?
You’re not monetizing your email list?
You didn’t place an affiliate link in your last blog post?
Holly shit! How do you sleep at night?*

That’s what people say to me all the time. It’s not that I don’t intend on making passive income, it’s more that it’s not the focus.
> **See numbers digitally appearing in your internet banking is bloody boring.**

The mirage is that we must make money online. It’s like some new culture that everyone feels they must jump on.

Following the masses never works. You’ll get lost in the noise.

The beautiful thing is everyone is playing the passive income game, so if you do the opposite, you’ll stand out and have the opportunity to inspire more people with your talent.

Payment walls are freaking annoying when as a consumer you’ve had little exposure to a company or individual.

## In the beginning, you’ll suck.

That’s why focusing on money at the start is a bad idea.

Why? Because if what you do at the start sucks, then charging people money for crap will turn everyone off you.

Selling people crap makes them pissed off and they’ll likely tell other people about their bad experience.

## Imagine becoming a digital slave.

That’s what many people have become.

I coined that term about 2.5 minutes ago after seeing a train full of people do nothing more than look at their phone. Many of you are becoming slaves to the internet by spending every waking moment trying to do the following:

* Increase web traffic

* Create engagement

* Make new content

* Check notifications

* Respond to instant messages (It could be Will Smith messaging you after all!)

Life is about more than being a slave to your device.

You can go a day without building anything or making a single dollar of passive income. After all, how did anyone live through the 80’s and party like a rockstar when there was no internet to take up all your free time?
> # “The older generations probably partied harder and had more fun because they didn’t the equivalent of modern slavery being the need to make passive income or build a following”

Let’s end digital slavery.

## Meaning feels so much better.

Not everything you do in your life has to make money.

Doing something you love that helps you feel like your life has a meaning is much more satisfying. It’s like a lifelong orgasm that never stops!

Chasing shallow goals like money doesn’t lead you anywhere. So many people forget the meaning part of what they do and then find themselves quitting only twelve months after starting their online endeavor.

The only reason I’m still blogging four years on is because I’m seeing the impact I’m able to have. Seeing people smash their goals, come out of the closet, overcome fears and deal with tragedies like a boss is the best feeling in the world.

**I would have given up years ago if blogging was all about the illusion of passive income, selfies, luxury cars and girls in bikinis.**

Fuck all that.

Please, please, please focus on meaning above everything else.

## Let me tell you a secret: The long game.
> # “If you sacrifice a bit of passive income in the short-term, you’ll make a killing in the long-term”

If money truly is your aim, then trying to monetize the way you currently are is actually having the opposite effect. When everything you do is free, you attract a lot more people. Naturally, charging people money to access your talents will limit your audience.

Once you find your sweet spot in life and doing one thing that makes you incredibly happy, the money finds a way in allowing you to increase your impact. Chasing money alone though will only leave you feeling empty.

Chasing money too early increases your chance of failure.

Slow down.

# One Habit I Broke That I’ll Never Break Again (I’d Recommend Doing The Same)

## Image Credit: Daniel Klowes — Patience

Habits are all over the Internet. Everyone is coming up with a new habit you should follow every minute you’re alive.

You’re forced to feel inadequate because you didn’t have a cold shower or eat sardines for dinner last night.

Most habits I believe are not essential…

## …Except this one habit.

The habit I’m talking about is this: patience.

Bet you didn’t expect that now did you? That’s because we all think we’re patient.

**We believe we’re patient and that our food should be delivered by UberRoo in a perfectly packaged box with the sauce evenly poured across the top. That’s not patience my friend.**

The habit of patience is having one nice takeaway meal a fortnight and savoring every last bite because it’s a treat rather than the norm.

Patience is not buying everything online and leaving a negative review because the supplier was 1.5 days late sending your goods.
> **Patience is not creating a startup and expecting to raise $2.8M dollars, having people beg you for a job and then selling it 1.6 years later for exactly $1b dollars so you can relax on the beach and preach to people about charity because you donated $600k to the new hospital wing down the road that you’ve never visited (other than at the opening so you could take an Instagram selfie).**

## Patience is not what you think it is.

That’s what all the nonsense of the rant above is trying to tell you. 
I’ll say it again: we think we practice the habit of patience, but we don’t.

Patience has changed over time in this new ‘Attention Economy’ where we have every man/woman with their dog trying to pitch us something.

The sales pitch is in our email, on our social media newsfeed, at work and while we’re trying to meet new people at an event.

## My battle with patience.

I was on the path to patience. I stopped trying to achieve my goals in a flash. I played the long game.

That was until Bitcoin took over and I began trading the currency. I thought I was a genius because of the price surge.

Patience showed up again when I had a career challenge and tried to change career paths too quickly — thus nearly killing everything I’d worked for.
Both these events happened around the same time.

![Photo Illustration by [Alicia Tatone](https://www.aliciatatone.com/illustration-1/)](1*qnpa_bpjC1CRrQrTfIzm5Q.jpeg)*Photo Illustration by [Alicia Tatone](https://www.aliciatatone.com/illustration-1/)*

My default habit of patience was replaced with the old anxious kid I used to be who’d forgotten that hard work and persistence was at the center of all success.

During this time, even my blogging suffered. I started asking myself the question *“Why am I not a viral sensation?”*

Up until this point I’d been blogging for many years without ever wanting any result and then all of a sudden that changed.
> I wanted to be right about Bitcoin; I wanted to show everyone I could change my career in 2.5 weeks because of the ‘Your network equals your net-worth catchphrase’; I wanted to demonstrate my blogging ability through a viral hit that would put me on the same level as Tim Ferriss.

All of this delusion blindsided me from the habit of patience. It’s so easy to get lost and be short-sighted (even for this Internet named Self-Help Blogger).

## Here’s what real patience looks like.

Being stuck in the middle of nowhere and having to saw your arm off — the story of Aaron Ralston.

Being locked up in prison for 27 years and then coming out and inspiring the world through your story and kindness towards your captors — the story of Nelson Mandela.

Battling cancer multiple times within a few years and still getting on stage to tell people that they can do anything, at the same time, battling throat cancer up — the story of Michael Crossland.

### The habit of patience is broken down into the following beliefs:

* Everything worth doing takes time

* There is no overnight success (not even for Mark Zuckerberg)

* The people that changed the world had to endure big challenges and hardships.

These are the real components of patience. These three beliefs are what you must never forget if you want to obtain, maintain or gain (geez they all rhyme!) patience which you can use to do something incredible.

By incredible, I mean entering a room and getting a standing ovation because you did something that served millions of people and wasn’t focused on your own ridiculous thoughts of how great you are or what you must own/have.

## Patience is the one habit you must focus on.

The cold showers, read a book a day and drink MCT Oil with Apple Cider vinegar are nice-to-have habits.

I promise readers life-changing advice and that is often served with a side of harsh truth.

### So, let me summarize the only habit you must not forget:

* Work hard (obviously) and take breaks/holidays

* Be patient with your goals (I mean like 10+ years patient)

* Focus on the habit of doing rather than the outcome

You can do the impossible, but it will never be done without the habit of patience. After all, if somethings impossible and could be achieved in a day, don’t you think it would have already been done?

Patiently think about that idea for a second and what I’ve just said.

# How To Get Rave Reviews&#58; Start By Asking

## How To Get Rave Reviews: Start By Asking

Raving fans. We all want them.

The recipe, of course, is to do great work and build a great reputation. But is that enough to get a great testimonial for your work? Not exactly.

Business owners forget that it can be hard for clients to write great testimonials. Doing great work is the pre-requisite. Coaching your clients to describe why it’s great to work with you is the essential next step. Sometimes it can be hard to articulate what worked so well, especially if the process is invisible or seamless. As a longtime copywriter and communications consultant, words come readily to me, but not necessarily to my clients (because that was my job).

In other circumstances, the nature of the work can make it challenging to for people to share easily. Think, for example, of a financial consultant that helps people get out of bad money situations or a divorce coach that helps people navigate the process of separation: not everyone wants to broadcast to the world their financial or relationship troubles.

**So how do you get great testimonials? Here’s the process I use.**

I guide clients through a process of four questions to help them frame and articulate a great testimonial. A great testimonial talks about the nature of the work, the type of change (a before and after), who you’re for, and why working together was so good.

Rather than email your clients with a blank page, which is terrifying to most people, use the framework below with four essential questions.

**Asking for the testimonial**

When you ask your clients for a testimonial, prime the pump. Remind them of what you worked on together and why you appreciated the time together. Tell them you’d like them to write a short testimonial and that you have a process that you appreciate using. Also, if your work is sensitive in nature, be sure to tell them that testimonials can be anonymized if they prefer.

Here’s a script you can steal:
> # *Hi there,*
> # *I’ve loved working with you and have been so appreciative of how well {project} and {results} have gone. One of the things that helps explain what I do to new potential clients is words from people like you. If you’re comfortable, I’d love to ask you for a testimonial about my work. If you’re a yes, I’ll send over 4 questions for you and you can always do an anonymous testimonial, if that’s easier to do.*
> # *Warmest,*
> # *Sarah*

**Remember to separate testimonials from feedback**

At some point in your work process, there should be an opportunity for feedback. This is separate from the testimonial. The purpose of a testimonial is to share the highlights of what you’ve done together and explain what it’s like to work with you to other potential clients. The purpose of feedback is private, constructive criticism to help you continue to grow and improve as a creator or consultant.

**Question 1: What did you appreciate most about working together?**

Begin by clarifying that you’re looking for positive feedback. I use this question to focus on what the best part of working together was. An alternative phrasing can be “What did you love most about working together?”

**Question 2: How would you explain our work or process to someone who is thinking of doing it?**

This is the piece that’s missing from most testimonials. What, exactly, do we do together? *“Working with Sarah was great!”* doesn’t do a lot for the prospective client who might, for example, be looking to join one of my mastermind programs. By asking clients to explain the process of working together and what the program is like, I can see how they think about the world and how they’d describe our work together.

This question is doubly useful because it also provides me with language to describe my work. Like anyone, I can get in a rut on my sales page. Having people describe what I do is eye-opening and reveals what they think about the process. As a result, you get a chance to see how they think about the work you did together.

Some people will answer this question with a nuts-and-bolts description of the tactics, tools, or structure of the program. “You get ten hours of copywriting, and Sarah works fast,” or “The mastermind is a structure of group calls, 1:1 coaching, and a shared community space for conversation, that people chat in each week.” People want to know exactly what they’re getting, and this is also useful language to have on hand.

**Question 3: What was your biggest “aha” moment during the process? How did you feel that you transformed or changed as a result?**

Every business owner is in the business of making change. We seek to transform our clients and customers through useful products, services, and tools that help them live or work differently. This third question gets at the heart of change. What change happened for them, and what did it look like? Why was it so powerful?

Marie Forleo, for example, sells a program called The Copy Cure, a copywriting class designed to help people write more persuasively. She lists three testimonials on the home page of the site, and two of them demonstrate an answer to the question, “How will I change if I take this program?” Here’s one example:
> # *“I was never happy with what I wrote. My hyper-critical self judgement paralyzed me. The Copy Cure brought me back down to earth and showed me that who I am and how I write is just fine. To be myself IS the way to write.”*

This testimonial shows a “before” (the hypercritical) transformed to an “after” emotional experience (relief).

**Question 4: Who is this work perfect for? Would you describe that person?**

This is a chance to see how your current clients would describe your target audience, and to see with fresh eyes the audience that you’re trying to reach.

People want to know if they’re the right fit for your program or work. Nothing drives me more nuts that asking someone, “who is this for?” and having them say “Oh, anyone can take it!” That is essentially a non-answer. Instead, the more specific you can be, the better.

For example:
> # *“We’re for entrepreneurial moms who are going through pregnancy and the transformation to parenting.” — A website about parenting and entrepreneurship.*
> # *“Coaching is a great fit for anyone who feels like they are at an important juncture/pivot point in their life, who needs support and inspiration, who is looking for clarity.” — Someone looking for a career coach.*

**Closing**

At the end, I offer an open question: “Is there anything else you want to tell me?” and then I double-check that it’s okay to use their name and website in the testimonial (with an option to remain anonymous).

Use these four questions to get better testimonials about your work.

# Nobody Has it Perfect

## 

Thanks to social media we’ve created a culture of voyeurism that gives us curated, edited, and filtered glimpses into the lives of virtually every other human being. We see reality through the lens of status updates, Instagram pictures, blog posts, podcasts, TED talks and personal brands, resulting in the illusion of perfection.

But the illusion of perfection precedes the age of social media. Social media merely amplifies the illusion, causing us to see reality through one dimension, blinding us to other parts of every person’s story.

One of my oldest friends appears to have what you might call a very charmed life. She fell in love with the guy she married our senior year in college. They have three beautiful kids, good jobs, and a house in a nice neighborhood. It would be easy to conclude that she has it pretty damn good until you learn that 3 months after we graduated from college her mother was killed in a car accident. Fresh of out college, she had to assume the role of caretaker for her family, and grow up much faster than the average 20-year-old.

Another one of my close friends joined a company that made him quite well off a few years after he graduated from one of the top universities in the world. He made enough money to buy a nice apartment in New York City. He probably doesn’t have to worry about money for quite some time. He met his wife, and they had three kids. It would be easy to envy what he has until you learn that his father has been slowly deteriorating this entire time. I can’t imagine how painful that would be considering that my dad is in great health.

When I interviewed [Alex Banayan](https://twitter.com/AlexBanayan) about his new book *The Third Door*, we discussed what it was like being at the heights of his career, while at the same time coping with the loss of a parent. He said, “People think I’m dealing with the grief of losing my dad during my book launch when it’s the other way around. I’m dealing with my book launch in the midst of grieving over the loss of my dad.” If you haven’t read the book or didn’t know the full story you might be envious that he’s on the Forbes 30 under 30 list and that his book has become a bestseller.

## The Illusion of Immunity to Adversity

We read stories like the above; we empathize while harboring the illusion that we’ve somehow been fortunate enough to be granted immunity to adversity. That’s not going happen to us. And we take it for granted that we have today, we have tomorrow and the day after. Sometime last week a friend sent me a text letting me know that a mutual friend had lost his life, while on a trip to Cabo. In a million years, I never thought the friend I was playing video games with a few weekends ago was somebody I’d never see again.

## We See Reality Through Windows

If you went to someone’s house and drew conclusions about who they were, what they were like as a person, and what their lives were like merely by looking through a window, your perceptions would be wildly inaccurate. But that’s precisely what we do in our digital lives. We see other humans through windows. We draw our conclusions and make assumptions based on nothing but a window.

It’s been said that the eyes are the windows to a person’s soul, but when we see people through nothing other than a window, we have to ask ourselves if we’re making our humanity soulless.

My Instagram feed and my status updates are filled with quotes from books, pictures from beaches, and other windows which make up the highlight reel of my life. The Unmistakable Creative, my books, and my speeches are the windows through which the world sees my life.

But if you looked through another window, you’d see another story. It’s a window most people won’t peer into because it’s uncomfortable, it will shatter the illusion someone has constructed based on the image I’ve portrayed the world, a life filled with poetic words in the books I love and perfect waves in a place that has become my second home. If you looked through the other window, this is what you’d see…..

I wouldn’t wish depression on anyone. It’s a dark abyss, in which you can’t find light, and consumes you in such a way that you feel like you’re never going to come up for air. You can’t understand why the same things that other people handle with ease upset you so much.

In so many ways depression is one of the harshest forms of self-criticism we’re capable of as humans. It amplifies self-doubt and causes people to believe things they feel most insecure about are real. In a twisted way, it’s a bit like social media in that it colors a person’s perception of reality. But it’s not coloring another person’s perception of reality, and it’s coloring your version of your reality, which is a hell of sorts.

It comes and goes. Some days you can point to a cause or circumstance. Other days, there’s no rhyme or reason to it. Through this window, you might also see friendships that are fractured beyond repair and burn bridges that will never be rebuilt, all of which was a direct byproduct of my work.

## FAME, STATUS, AND TRUST

The tools we’ve created have facilitated and made possible a desire for fame that often exceeds the desire for a life that is instead paved with what essayist and New York Times columnist David Brooks calls the Road to Character. In his book, Brooks said the following:
> Among the privileged, especially the privileged young, you see people who have been raised to be approval -seeking machines. They may be active, busy, and sleepless but inside they often feel passive and not in control. Their lives are directed by other people’s expectations, external criteria, and definitions of success that don’t actually fit them.

In the last several weeks, we’ve seen two celebrity suicides which if interpreted by a society appropriately will shatter the illusions of a life of fame and fortune.

Reflecting on the life Anthony Bourdain, CNN anchor Kate Bolduan broke down in tears when she recounted her last conversation with him in which she said, “If only I could be born as Anthony Bourdain in my next life.”


Our window into his world was his incredible books and amazing journeys. But if we saw his world through the window of what he was dealing with, it’s possible that all we would have seen is darkness.

During their conversation, Tom Brady told Oprah that a kid at school said to one of his sons, “I’m only friends with you because your dad is Tom Brady.” A kid has trouble forming genuine friendships because of his dad’s status. While it’s tempting to write that off as a problem of privilege, when we’re that young we crave connection. When Oprah asked him about how you keep your ego in check when your Tom Brady married to Giselle, he said: “we don’t see ourselves the way the world sees us.”

Towards the end of their conversation, Tom Brady told Oprah that his fame has caused him to trust people less. One of the challenges, when you reach any level of success, is figuring out who you can and can’t trust. It becomes too difficult to discern between who is drawn to your perceived status, and who is attracted to you.

Initially, when women I was dating wanted to read my books, I was flattered. After all, my work was a deeply personal expression of who I am. By the time I started working with [Nick Notas](https://medium.com/@nick_45002), I had realized that people reading my books or listening to my podcasts before they got to know we me would cause them to see me through a filter. I had to tell a girl I was dating at the beginning of the year that I couldn’t stop her from reading my books if she chose to, but my preference was that she didn’t until we go to know each other.

These days I’m skeptical of people of any romantic interest that results from my work. Inevitably, I will disappoint them. They think they’re going on a date with the host of the Unmistakable Creative podcast instead of going on a date with me. There is a difference. As Nick Notas once said to me “for better or worse, it’s always going to be worse, just because it’s different.” When you have a public presence of any sort, you’re potentially connected to thousands of people, but the circle of trust paradoxically becomes much smaller. In comparison to Tom Brady, I’m nobody. To the barista at Starbucks, I’m just some brown guy living in a town filled with rich white people.

And believe me, no matter how authentic you think somebody is, who they are behind the writing, behind the microphone, and behind the football helmet is the person their closest friends and family see.

To the people who are closest to us, our perceived status means nothing. We’re still the siblings they fought with, the kids who took our parents’ car on a high-speed car chase through Tijuana and kicked a hole in the wall of their brand new house when they went out of town for the weekend. This is not a bad thing because it keeps our egos in check. It allows us to stay connected to our roots and remember where we came from.

To my sister, I’m still the big brother who was sent on a failed mission to the grocery store to buy cilantro. After about 30 minutes, being the genius she is, she voiced her thoughts to my parents. “I bet he’s at the store staring at the tops of carrots, thinking about ripping the leaves off, because he can’t find the cilantro.” So they sent her, a 4th grader to check on me. Much to her delight, there I was staring like an idiot at the top of carrots.

It’s the people who we can be our imperfect, fatally flawed selves around that we trust the most. Perhaps the most telling thing Tom Brady said about himself and Giselle is, “We don’t see ourselves the way the world sees us.” It’s one of the great ironies of being as famous as Tom Brady that you could have millions of fans, but nowhere as near as many people that you trust.
> # We see fame through windows, whether that be reading someone’s writing, watching them on TV, or hearing them on a podcast.

As [Ryan Holiday](https://medium.com/@ryanholiday_44799) wrote, in a recent post.
> “ Most people with a public persona tell you that the downsides outweigh the upsides. They have a target on their back from critics. They have less creative freedom. They feel *irresponsible *when they turn down opportunities because they know other people would kill for the chance. It’s not all bad of course, but there are real problems that go along with fame and fortune.

And many of the people we consider famous today are not. Ask your grocery clerk who Seth Godin or Tim Ferriss is, and you’ll likely get a blank stare. As [Chris Brogan](https://twitter.com/chrisbrogan) jokingly once said to me, “being famous on the internet is like being famous in Cleveland. Nobody gives a shit.”

When we are experiencing the overwhelming majority of our reality through nothing but windows, regardless of whether it’s the news or how we communicate with friends, it begs the question of whether we are in fact already living in a self-created simulation, seeing our world through nothing but windows, blinded, utterly unaware of the fact that no matter how it looks, nobody has it perfect.

# 5 Painful Lessons I’ve Learned to Be a Happy, Successful Writer

## Don’t Lose Sight of Your Dreams Because of Someone Else’s “Advice”

![Photo by Aaron Burden on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/writing?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*JcjykCKYpK7My4B-QwYs7w.jpeg)*Photo by Aaron Burden on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/writing?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

I haven’t written anything new on Medium for the better part of 2018. What I have published is mostly repurposed content, edited and tightened up with a different headline, image, and tagline.

When you see yourself as a content creator online, not providing new content for the better part of a year is problematic.

Sure, I’ve been refurbishing and republishing old posts, but those have been few-and-far between.

I know, I know, there’s a certain irony in telling you to avoid reading advice by giving you more advice to follow. But this is more of a cautionary tale I want to tell you to help you, if not to avoid, but at least to be more aware of your feelings and your mission to help keep your writing going in the right direction and staying on the correct course.

This has been because of a couple of reasons that I want to touch on with this post below. I hope you’ll find this post helpful as these lessons have been difficult and painful for me to learn, yet after uncovering them, I feel freer and more cemented in my purpose than ever before.

## 1) If You Follow What Everyone Tells You to Do, You Miss Out On What You Actually Want to Do

You hear it often, right? To succeed as a writer, you not only need an audience or a voice or a message worth hearing or an email list, but a worthy platform to share your ideas on.

Like many of you, I strove to accomplish all of the above things. However, I came to a couple realizations this past year: one of the biggest was when I realized I never started writing online to get better at blogging about writing.

I didn’t want to build an audience for the sake of building an audience, and I never really wanted to make money with my words, either — that was just a means to an end. I started writing and sharing my work online to get better at sharing my thoughts and conveying my ideas with others. I started writing online to start a conversation around my work.

Perhaps the biggest reason I started writing online was because I wanted to write books and works of art that would change the world, starting with my readers and spreading to others in a positive, beneficial, and inspirational way. By leaning towards creating courses and coaching and striving to make money off my writing, though, I feel in a sense I’ve lost my way. After realizing this, I fell into a kind of quiet depression in regards to my writing, and stopped writing every day until I found myself not creating any new pieces at all.

My purpose with writing was never to build an audience or make money with my work. My mission was to inspire people to follow their dreams and make the changes in their lives they needed to get unstuck and truly make a difference.

In the end, making money and blogging and building an audience wasn’t the main focus, it was just a way to hone towards my ultimate goal. And I lost my way so badly because I listened to others telling me what to do and how to do it constantly when reading and following the people and writers I admired online.

## 2) Your Journey Isn’t a Static Line — It’s Filled With Ups and Downs that We Don’t Talk Much About

When I started blogging and finally working up the courage to sharing my work online, I thought I was on the right track. And when I built up an email list of over 1000 people and a Medium base of 9,000 followers, I was convinced I’d finally *made it*.

I mistakenly thought my journey as a writer was to first became an internet sensation with thousands of adoring fans, so that I could then follow my dreams of working on my fiction novel and being a working artist and a thriving writer. I mixed up the two so much that I convinced myself what I wanted wasn’t actually what I wanted at all.

The worst part in all of this was when I finally realized earlier this year that I’ve been really unhappy for years chasing a dream I thought I wanted more than anything. It was better than sitting on my hands and doing nothing, sure, but it wasn’t what I wanted to be doing with my life. And that, I believe, was deeply rooted in my belief that when things got good, they would stay good.

I haven’t found that the case myself. I don’t wake up inspired most days. I don’t feel unstoppable most of the time. The little comfort and confidence I’ve found with honing my voice, improving my style, and sharing my work has come from becoming more of myself and shedding the belief that the popularized ideas of others are what’s best for me and that things should be great all the time.

Like I read once on here, if you don’t love the writing game and every aspect of sharing your work online, then you’re not a true writer anyways.

What gibberish advice, right?

That’s like you need to be working on your dream all the time in order to be successful. No, you actually need to take breaks.

Although many writers insist that their way is the right way, or that the journey is all ups after it’s downs, things don’t work that way.

It’s one thing to build your audience up on a site like Medium, but it’s another to admit to yourself that following your dream of being a writer is hard work, and most of the work it takes to get started and restarted everyday is the hardest part of the whole thing.

## 3) Most Advice is Bogus And We Rarely Need More: What We Need is Experience Which Can’t Be Taught

When you first start out on any journey, you begin to relish the idea of gathering as much advice as you possibly can to be the best you possibly can be.

You consume so many books and podcasts and blog posts and courses that you run the risk of information overload, but yet you constantly find yourself wanting to learn more and more.

That is, until one day, you start to read the same things over and over. Things like to be a great writer you need to start writing crap; things like you need to do an idea dump or journal or do ‘morning pages’ to free yourself up to do better work; things like you must buy courses to be successful or worse, that you must sell courses on information products in order to be a successful writer online.

The worst one I continue to come across is that you must be a writer-entrepreneur hybrid to be an astounding success, which is simply not true.

It’s one thing to test your ideas and gain an audience by blogging on sites like Medium, and it’s another to pursue your own dream. It’s one thing to write what you want to write and say the things you want to say, and it’s another to urge yourself to monetize your passion and build a successful business as a writer in order to live life in your own vein.

One thing I’ve come to realize is that that dream is not for me. It’s not what I want to do with my life and it’s not what I want to accomplish with the little time I do have everyday to write. I don’t want to be a entrepreneur or a writer-entrepreneur hybrid or even a freelancer. I want to be a writer, and I want to do it on my own terms as best as I can. That’s it.

## 4) We Need to Stop Vilifying the Day Job (Maybe Writing Professionally Isn’t Actually the Goal for Many of Us)

Yes, I want to be a writer. Yes, the best way for me to fulfill that dream is to keep a job I enjoy give me the mental and financial security I need so I can slowly work towards making my dream of releasing my first book a reality.

The truth is, I’m not passionate about blogging as an ultimate goal. I’m simply passionate about sharing my ideas and building a community around my words, and I believe writing a book is the best way for me to inspire others and convey that to the world.

I want to write books in the vein of Steven Pressfield. I want to create the next *War of Art*. I want to write sweeping works of fiction like James S.A. Corey’s *The Expanse *and Brandon Sanderson’s *Stormlight Archive *and Stephen King’s *Dark Tower* series. I want to write a work that is fit for readers and takes them away into my own private world, just for them. I want to entertain, inspire, and delight my readers.

Yes, in a sense, I want to be a jack-of-all-trades writer. I don’t just want to blog and write work designed to help writers. I don’t want to just create courses to sell to my readers. I want to entertain them too. Fiction is my first love, but I’ve grown to love blogging and non-fiction too. I think both have a place in this world, and I want to help facilitate my readers in both of those ways as best as I can.

Of course, knowing that I want to focus on writing books, I have to tighten my focus and scope a little bit. I can’t create as much as I once hoped to. I need to tighten the reins on editing and completing my work, much in the strategy that Jon Acuff espouses in his book *Finish*. I want to be a finisher. I also want to release complete works that I’m proud of and put in the work to do so.

Most of all, I don’t want to rush the process. I don’t want to churn out a formula just so I can charge someone else to learn it too. I want to finish what I’ve started and if I then feel comfortable to do so, to charge for those finished works and spread my work, my knowledge, and my imagination as far and as much as I can.

## 5) When You’re Lost, Take a Break to Rediscover Your Roots

Not blogging for so long has made me feel rusty, but it’s also giving me a clarity I don’t think I would’ve obtained otherwise. And I’m grateful and happy for all of the pain it’s giving me, because it’s led to a greater understanding and appreciation for the world I love in and to a deepening and stronger connection to those I love the most.

**I don’t really crave to be a writer-entrepreneur. I am not Jeff Goins.** However, I do want to make an impact, and I think I can still do that while holding down a day job and writing as much as I can in the margins between.

In the end, redefining your route will help you much more than drifting aimlessly forward will. Because it will stop you from working too hard on a goal you don’t want to achieve, to do work you don’t want to do in order to live a life you don’t want to live.

## What Type of Writer Do You Want to Be?

In the end, accomplishing your greatest writing dreams will allow you to live a life true to yourself instead of the one others espouse for you. And the best way to do that can be reviewing your journey so far, and then committing to pivot and redefine your work where ever you need to, so you can live a life true to your wishes and help become the best ‘you’ you can be.

In the end, success is whatever you define it to be. Only you can set the rules to lay the groundwork for your success, and only you can do the work that’s necessary to become the writer you dream you to be.

# How To Create The Reality You Want

***“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” ~Carl Jung***

A lot of talk about potentially living in a “*Simulation”* these days.

Is there any truth in this?

Absolutely.

But the common misconception is that *“Simulation”* means some type of tech or computer futuristic matrix.

Successful businessman, engineer, and entrepreneur Elon Musk at Code Conference 2016 [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KK_kzrJPS8&feature=youtu.be):
> Given that we’re clearly on a trajectory to have games that are indistinguishable from reality and those games could be played on any set top box or any PC, and there would probably be billions of computer or set top boxes, it would seem to follow that the odds we are in base reality are one in billions.

Obviously Musk was talking in the context of computers and gaming as if we are in some type of a computer matrix where games will one day blend with reality.

While I’m not a gamer, astrophysicist, doctor, or cognitive scientist it seems to me that that’s one of many options of what this “simulation” could be or mean. Obviously many religions have referenced this simulation ideology as well.

When I think “Computer simulation” as Elon Musk references I always think of that [*Rick and Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty)* episode where the character of Roy straps a helmet on and we see him live his life based on what he “sees” in his mind’s eye in a video game simulation.


Funny (and maybe a little scary), right?

The fact of the matter is experts are now saying that we are all actively hallucinating. Everything we know about reality is merely just our own perception of it. The reality that I’m seeing is different than the reality you’re seeing. What scientists are slowly learning is that everyone has their own version of “reality”. We are all seeing what he want to see.

This is explained in detail in this Ted Talk:


***“Our brain simulates reality. So, our everyday experiences are a form of dreaming, which is to say, they are mental models, simulations, not the things they appear to be.”***

***~Stephen LaBerge***

But if we’re not in a video game or computer simulation of some type, can we edit our reality? Is it moldable? Can we shape our “hallucination” into what we want it to be? Ah, the age old question.

More and more everyday we are learning that we actually can.

How is this done?

It’s all about getting in touch with your subconscious.

What is the subconscious?

## Sub·con·scious

*Of or concerning the part of the mind of which one is not fully aware but which influences one’s actions and feelings.*

Source: Google Dictionary

So one can conclude that by dictionary definition, the subconscious is what is really running the show. I love the iceberg metaphor and the Monkey / Elephant metaphor of the subconscious.

![Quora](1*UqIWBUQAsKQI4dkHmvdqZA.jpeg)*Quora*

![[https://dibau.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/monkey-riding-an-elephant/](https://dibau.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/monkey-riding-an-elephant/)](1*5hR9Y5r5dUs3ckD6HcdB1w.png)*[https://dibau.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/monkey-riding-an-elephant/](https://dibau.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/monkey-riding-an-elephant/)*

**Iceberg:**

*The conscious mind would be above water.*

*The subconscious mind would be below water.*

**Monkey / Elephant:**

*The conscious mind would be the monkey.*

*The subconscious mind would be the elephant.*

I was obviously very intrigued by this. So I did a little research and discovered you really can *change* you reality by getting in touch with your subconscious. Everything that is happening in your life right now is a direct manifestation of the way you’ve programmed your subconscious up to this very point in time.

Where you are in your life is a result of where you’ve told you subconscious to put you.

The real magic of this is that it’s much easier to edit this “programming” than people realize. If you’ve told your subconscious that you are in a place of desperate need and that you are limited, that is the reality that will manifest in front of you even if you consciously don’t want it to. Reality is like a mirror. It reflects back to us what we are telling the subconscious.

The important thing to know about this, is you have to program your subconscious ***in it’s terms.***

Blogger Brandon writes in his Co-Creation Coaching blog [*1 Secret Of Subconscious Mind That Leads To Instant Manifestation](https://www.cocreationcoaching.org/blog/2016/12/09/1-secret-subconscious-mind-leads-instant-manifestation/)*:
> The only reason your subconscious mind does not bring you what you want is because you have not told it, **in it’s terms**, what you want.
> When you tell your subconscious mind what you want, it works tirelessly, behind the scenes, to make it happen.


Experts on consciousness describe subconscious activity as like planting a seed. You are programming something into your subconscious. It takes time to grow. If you keep going back to check on it and digging to see if the seed has grown it’s unlikely it will manifest. Your subconscious needs time, patience, and consistency. You also have to continue to give the “seed” the metaphorical water, sunlight, and keep elements of nature away from it that might stunt it’s growth.

John Kehoe on his Mind Power blog post [*“Your Subconscious Mind Is Your Partner In Success. Get It Working For You.”](https://www.learnmindpower.com/using-mind-power/the-subconscious-synchronicity/)* writes:
> Think of your subconscious mind as incredibly fertile soil that will grow any seed you plant in it. Your habitual thoughts and beliefs are seeds that are being constantly sown. Just as corn kernels produce corn and wheat seeds produce wheat, the contents of your thoughts will have an effect in your life. You will reap what you sow; this is a law.

I was a little blown away by all of this but I kept increasing my understanding of it and came to learn how much control we really do have. At the end of the day it comes down to connecting to your true self. Believe it or not, many of us are not. This come through self awareness, telling the subconscious what you want, and most importantly acting on what you tell it. Sounds easy right?

If things have not been going your way, there are 3 things you can do to begin reprogramming your subconscious and in turn, changing your reality:

1. Give yourself ***Positive Affirmations ***but then take steps daily to act on these positive affirmations.*** Just thinking is not enough. ***Affirmations are statements you tell yourself out loud. Say these daily to yourself and notice how you’re feeling when you say them. Emotions associated with attaining your goals are very important. Write down what it is you want. Keep them positive and short. Examples of affirmations would be “*I will get that job.”*, *“I will win this race.”*, and *“I will find my partner.”* Get a clear vision of your goals and feel the emotions associated with them, speak them daily, be consistent, and act on them.

1. Come from a mindset of choosing what you want. When you ***choose*** what you want you can ***decide***. This leads to ***manifestation***. When coming from a place of want, need, and negative thinking, this tells the subconscious that you are limited and don’t feel worthy. Your reality manifests in kind. Your reality is mirroring your subconscious.

1. Meditate.*** ***The more you meditate, the the more one raises their awareness of their own thoughts and their relationship with the world around them. They come to realize that their thoughts don’t define who they are. This in turn connects one with their higher self and their reality starts to change.

Brandon from Co-Creation Blog goes on to [write](https://www.cocreationcoaching.org/blog/2016/12/09/1-secret-subconscious-mind-leads-instant-manifestation/):
> Remember that your subconscious mind, besides being a goal machine, is also an automator. In fact, it is *great* at automating.
> When you’ve gotten in the habit of focusing on lack, for example, your subconscious automates that behavior, because again, it doesn’t care where the lens is focused.
> The subconscious mind will, for a time, try to follow the old. It is your job to hold your vision of the new program you want it to install. Eventually, it will get the message, and start automating the new program instead.

Manifesting the reality you want is ultimately about connecting with your heart by meditating (and in turn having a growing awareness of your own thoughts), having positive affirmations and goals and saying them daily, and then taking action. When mind, body, and soul are in sync your subconscious manifests the reality you want. This is not as complicated as many people make it. If you do this consistently, your subconscious programming will rewire itself and in turn the reality around you will change.

See you soon.

# How Tired Is Too Tired?

## Sleep Deprivation Is Ruining Your Mind And Body

![](1*QnVyTLh_ahXrd3t_Er-WtQ.jpeg)
> # “Tired minds don’t plan well. Sleep first, plan later.” — Walter Reisch

### **Food For Thought**

## **Sleep Deprivation Is Ruining Your Mind And Body**

Every one of us has experience trudging through the foggy haze that is sleep deprivation.

Between excessive screen time into the wee hours of the night, expectations to be accessible 24/7 by work, family, and friends, and a growing narrative that “sleep is for the weak,” we are progressively becoming a sleep-deprived society.

It’s unsurprising then that the CDC has declared insufficient sleep a ‘public health problem.’ According to Dr. Matthew Walker, author of *Why We Sleep*:
> “The physical and mental impairments caused by one night of bad sleep dwarf those caused by an equivalent absence of food or exercise. It is difficult to imagine any other state — natural or medically induced — that affords a more powerful redressing of physical or mental health at every level of analysis.”

When you think about the effects of sleep in your own life, it’s easy to see this as the truth. But even with science, psychology, and personal experience pointing us all to the same conclusion, we still don’t take sleep deprivation seriously.

The mantra continues:

*Sleep is for the weak.*

So how do you really know if you are sleep deprived (and that this grogginess isn’t just part of your personality)? Outside of an actual clinical study, Walker suggests you ask yourself these two questions:

1) After waking up in the morning, could you fall back asleep around 10 or 11 am?
2) Can you function optimally without caffeine before noon?

If you answer ‘yes’ to the first question or ‘no’ to the second, then you are likely not getting sufficient or quality sleep.

There are two factors that control your sleep pattern: your circadian rhythm and a chemical called adenosine. Both are independent of one another and influence when you feel tired.

Your circadian rhythm is your body’s natural tendency to feel awake or tired at certain parts of the day. Everybody’s rhythm is different and the length of the rhythm varies for everyone — usually about a day, give or take a few hours.

Adenosine is a chemical that starts to build up in your body the moment you wake up and doesn’t dissipate until the moment you go to sleep. As it builds up, it creates a ‘sleep pressure’ that gradually makes you feel more tired. If you don’t sleep long enough, not all of the adenosine goes away, creating an outstanding balance the next morning. After several nights of bad sleep, this outstanding balance starts to add up.

(More on the science of sleep [here](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/resources/highschool/chemmatters/past-issues/archive-2014-2015/the-science-of-sleep.html).)

Why is sleep deprivation so bad? Outside of the health effects we shared yesterday, it’s killing your creativity, productivity, and ability to perform tasks efficiently.

According to [Optisom](https://www.optisom.com/productivity), there is a $60 billion estimated loss by US companies due to lower productivity caused by poor sleep. Employees experiencing insomnia are also 10x more likely to feel anxious or depressed — not optimum mindsets for innovative productivity.

But it’s not just the workplace or your health that suffers — your safety is also at risk considering that driving while drowsy [is the equivalent](https://sleepjunkies.com/drunk-vs-drowsy-driving/) to driving while drunk.

From our youth onward, school, work, and personal obligations have conditioned us to ignore our body’s natural sleep patterns. As we get older and have more control over our sleep schedule, it’s hard to shake what we’ve been conditioned to believe about sleep — that it’s a luxury many of us can’t afford.

If we have any hope to create happier home, work, and social lives, then we must flip the narrative and realize that good sleep is a habit *we can’t afford not to make*.

# Just take the pain…

## 

***“That really hurts!”*** I cried as the masseur drove his elbow deep into my back*.* ***“Take the pain!”*** he replied in a heavy Swedish accent. *“There is good pain and there is bad pain… you have to have the good pain to not have the bad pain.”*

This is true in business. **Good pain is pain that leads to relief. Bad pain is just that. Most of the time you have to push through the one to eliminate the other.** Case in point…
> It was obvious that the SVP of product was wrong for the position. His peers knew it, his direct reports knew it, but for some reason the CEO couldn’t bring himself to let him go… and so he didn’t. This went on for some time. Finally, the pain became too great and he was terminated. A few months after the deed was done, the CEO questioned the head of HR, “Why didn’t we do that much sooner?”

## Avoiding pain only prolongs it.

This situation occurs far too often. Why? Like water, we take the path of least resistance. Let’s face it, letting someone go is hard (and it should be). It’s especially difficult in a smaller company where every employee is like a family member (sometimes they are a family member or friend or neighbor or even partner). There is no HR department to “handle” things.

Difficult or not, **when a person isn’t right for the job, you are doing a disservice to both the company AND the individual if you let him or her stay in that role.** It doesn’t matter who they are or how they got there. If an employee demonstrates problem(s) in one or more core areas (e.g., competence, work ethic, integrity), they must either be moved to a position where they CAN be successful, or terminated. How many problem(s) depend on the nature of each (e.g., you might have a 3-strike policy for competence but a zero-tolerance policy for integrity).

The good news is that competence, work ethic, and integrity are relatively straightforward. Employees either have the skills to do the job or they do not. They either work hard to get the job done or they do not. They either act with complete integrity or they do not. No one controls these things for them. It’s not like movement of the stars.

![](1*VXq_nSnlbSLFRNzo4yHYcg.jpeg)

## Don’t let fear paralyze you to inaction.

**Here are a few common fallacies that keep someone in the wrong role**:

1. the individual is irreplaceable,

1. the individual can change,

1. the individual can grow into the position, and

1. removing the individual might create a legal risk or liability.

**If you’ve ever said this to yourself (or even out loud), here are a few things to consider**:

1. NO ONE is irreplaceable,

1. an EXCEPTION is not the rule,

1. be careful not to PROMOTE someone to the level of their incompetence, and

1. problem(s) with competence, work ethic, and/or integrity are VALID REASONS to let someone go.
> “All of these behaviors can and should result in employment termination for the employee. Anything else is disrespectful of your other employees and will breed cynicism and ill will.” — *Susan Heathfield, [Top 5 Reasons to Fire an Employee](https://www.thebalance.com/top-reasons-to-fire-an-employee-1917577)*

## How can you prevent this?

Clear conversations from the onset are key. When metrics are clear (e.g., at our company, this means a, b, c, d), they’re easy to measure. When there’s a disconnect (a gap between how the employee perceives their performance and how you perceive the same), that’s when change must take place. But, don’t wait. Establish final performance metrics and the timeline. Be gentle but firm like the goalpost in the end-zone. It’s not moving anywhere but it has two feet of foam padding around it. At the end of the day, some employees will change, some will quit and some will need to be let go (but this last group becomes very small).

## Today’s takeaways:

1. **Just take the pain!** Is it not better for the individual to find a position that works for both the employer and the employee? Why would you rob him or her of that?

1. **Look for other areas and do the same. **You’ll find that this principle applies to much more than human capital. It’s OK to be prudent but often, time is not your friend (i.e., options tend to expire).

## As a side note…

A senior executive in a global staffing company once told me, *“I’ve never known of a situation where the employee was fired too soon.”* And then there’s what my Dad would say, ***“you’ll feel better when it quits hurting.”***

# The Story Of Your Life Is A Narrative That Should Be Written Properly And Edited Often

## “Macro of typewriter ribbon and paper reading "Hello February 2016"” by Dung Anh on Unsplash

## **Vow To Live Passionately**
> # *“Often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us.” — Helen Keller*

I have a question for you.

This is important because I believe how you answer this question could change the balance of your life: When the time comes to leave this place, will you be able to look back on your past with fondness, gratitude, and satisfaction instead of regret and guilt? I invite you to take a deep breath and simply sit with this question for a moment…*marinade* in the essence of its profound implications; allow yourself to *truly feel* the reality of your last day on the planet for there lies the most precious gift.

I know from experience because this is a practice I indulge from time to time. I recall over two decades ago losing my father to complications resulting from type II diabetes. I remember the day of his burial and his coffin being lowered into the ground as though it was only yesterday.

There was a final ending to his time here that not only touched my family, but echoed throughout my life in the months and years ahead. It was though the universe grabbed me by the shoulders and said: “Wake up, son, your time is limited. Don’t waste another moment because *you too* shall return to dust one day.”

Since then, I made a vow to live passionately, to be of service to others, to enrich my life and explore my potential so as to guide others to awaken theirs. The journey has been difficult, stressful and yet daring; I’ve discovered more about myself in the subsequent years than I did leading up to my father’s passing. It was as though I was jolted with a reminder that this beautiful journey called life must inevitably end, sometimes when we least expect it.

Now, my second question for you: Can *you *relate?

## **Don’t Consider Your Challenges As Permanent**
> # *“Your life is your story. Write well. Edit often.” — Susan Statham*

There’s a delightful parable told by the late Jesuit priest and psychotherapist Anthony de Mello that captures the significance of embracing life completely:

Before the visitor embarked upon discipleship, he wanted assurance from the Master:

“Can you teach me the goal of human life?”

“I cannot.”

“Or at least its meaning?”

“I cannot.”

“Can you indicate to me the nature of death and of life beyond the grave?”

“I cannot.”

The visitor walked away in scorn.

The disciples were dismayed that their Master had been shown up in a poor light.

Said the Master soothingly: “Of what use is it to comprehend life’s nature and life’s meaning if you have never tasted it? I’d rather you ate your pudding than speculated on it.”

Anthony de Mello’s fable reminds us, it is of little use to intellectualize life at the level of your thoughts. The question is: “Are you eating your dessert” — are you partaking in the sweetness of your life?” Life is to be lived *fully*, meaning you will experience pain and suffering, however as the adage goes: “This too shall pass.”

In such moments, the experience may be too much to bear. But as the former English Prime Minister Winston Churchill once declared: “If you are going through hell, keep going.” He knew too well that when you’re in the grips of despair, to retreat is to deny yourself the capacity to overcome your pain and suffering.

Sorrow and misery are not the narrative of your life story, but one chapter of it. There will be many chapters to come and you mustn’t consider your challenges as permanent.

Whilst you may have regrets, remember they are paragraphs contained within the story still being written. I urge you to be open to what tomorrow will bring, knowing the sum of your life is yet to unfold. What you are experiencing is not the end of the world because there is so much more to your life’s narrative to unfold in the years ahead.

## **What Is Your Soul’s Narrative?**
> # *“About the only value the story of my life may have is to show that one can, even without any particular gifts, overcome obstacles that seem insurmountable if one is willing to face the fact that they must be overcome.” — Eleanor Roosevelt*

The outcome of your choices are often right under your nose. Many people miss the signs because they are too busy moving from one thing to another to notice them. They are seldom present and engaged with the now to notice what is taking place beneath the surface of their lives. This is because they are concerned how their lives look to others, they don’t notice their interior life is slowly crumbling.

In many ways, they have forgotten how to come home to themselves. There will come a point when those you love will stand at the edge of your interment, looking down upon you as you are lowered into the ground. They will contemplate the same thoughts as I did that day at my father’s burial.

“Is this it?”

“Surely there’s more to life than this?”

For the most precious gift that you can give to yourself is to treat each day as though it were you last. Hold nothing back. Live fully and completely, knowing when the time comes, you will have been completely used up like a sponge wringed of water. May your life’s narrative be a compelling story lived truthfully.

# Bureaucracy Sucks. 2 Things Your Company Needs to Fight It.

## Leadership Lessons from Reed Hastings and Netflix.

![Photo by [Štefan Štefančík](https://unsplash.com/photos/UCZF1sXcejo?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/collections/2304079/freedom-and-responsibility?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](0*ie_z4H1eDYVXbyqK.jpg)*Photo by [Štefan Štefančík](https://unsplash.com/photos/UCZF1sXcejo?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/collections/2304079/freedom-and-responsibility?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

*“Founders are important not because they are the only ones whose work has value,” *wrote Peter Thiel in [*Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)*, “*but rather because a great founder can bring out the best work from everybody at his company.”*

Every company — at one point — started with a founder. And most startups live or die by the founder’s ability to see a market opportunity, compile the right team, and develop a breakthrough technology.

This is what draws people to startups. It’s what makes work exciting. Moving fast. Making changes. Influencing markets. Mainly, seeing how a small group of people can make a real difference in the world.

Just as every company begins with a founder, every company was at one point a startup. Yet few companies are able to maintain the excitement and the agility that comes with the startup mentality. Speed is replaced with caution. Autonomy is replaced with rules. And slowly today’s startup becomes tomorrow’s bureaucracy.

In a world that sensationalizes the short-term, we need to actively plan for long-term growth. As Reid Hoffman discussed in [one *Masters of Scale* podcast](https://mastersofscale.com/john-elkann-how-to-build-your-company-to-last/),
> # “Very few companies have managed both ‘scale tremendously’ and ‘age gracefully.’”

### Bureaucracies are Grown, Not Born
> # “Don’t quote me regulations! I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the color of the book that regulation’s in. [hardens his tone] We kept it gray!” — *Bureaucrat No. 1, [*How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0584442/), Futurama

Bureaucracies rarely start as bureaucracies. If they did, they likely wouldn’t have survived long — with government facilities being the obvious exception.

Startups begin with a core group of people, all looking to change the world in the same way. Everyone knows the mission. Everyone shares the same long-term vision. And everyone has the competence — or is actively working to gain it — that they need to be successful.

But as startups grow, they hire more people. People who don’t have the full technical competence. And people who don’t understand the long-term mission.

As companies grow, they have more to lose. They have more responsibility. So speed needs to be tempered with responsible decision-making. Once Facebook matured as a company — and Zuckerberg matured as a CEO — the trademark motto, *“Move fast and break things,”* became the slightly less catchy, *“Move fast with stable infrastructure.”*

In many ways it’s a necessary adjustment. We need stable infrastructure to protect our companies. We need to backstop training with processes and supervision. No one likes the idea of untrained, unconnected workers deciding the company’s future.

But with each additional layer of management, employees have less authority. And with each new generation of hires, people become distanced from the central mission.

Until we’ve turned our company into the establishment it was designed to disrupt.

### Bureaucracies Thrive on a Lack of Responsibility
> # “Bureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top of the heap look inept. Who enjoys appearing inept?”* — Frank Herbert, [*Heretics of Dune](https://www.amazon.com/Heretics-Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0425076695/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

I don’t need to sell you on the evils of bureaucracy. They slow down decisions, remove authority from the people doing the work, and crush motivation. They frustrate innovation, breed inertia, and generally create companies where the biggest goal of most employees is to simply make it through the day.

But above everything, they breed a lack of accountability — and as a result, a form of tyranny. As the celebrated German-American political theorist Hannah Arendt wrote in her timeless meditation, [*On Violence](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/10/14/hannah-arendt-on-bureaucracy-and-violence/)*,
> # “In a fully developed bureaucracy there is nobody left with whom one could argue, to whom one could present grievances, on whom the pressures of power could be exerted. Bureaucracy is the form of government in which everybody is deprived of political freedom, of the power to act; for the rule by Nobody is not no-rule, and where all are equally powerless we have a tyranny without a tyrant.”

Arendt rightly argues that if we consider tyrannical governments as those who aren’t accountable for their actions, then a bureaucracy would be the most tyrannical of all. Everyone operates in a mindless mode, slave to orders and procedures.

A company where no one’s truly responsible. And no one can really be held accountable for their actions.

The alternative is to embrace responsibility. To encourage individual accountability. And celebrate each employee’s freedom to make responsible decisions.

And one company has demonstrated this ability beyond almost any other.

### Would You Watch a Show from Kibble?
> # “Being an entrepreneur is about patience and persistence, not the quick buck, and everything great is hard and takes a long time.” *— Reed Hastings*

In a [recent issue of The Mission’s podcast *The Story](https://medium.com/the-mission/david-and-goliath-fda6651328c4)*, [Chad Grills](https://twitter.com/ChadGrills) recounts how Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph overcame the odds and revolutionized the entertainment industry. They leveraged their flexibility and vision to come back from repeated rejection and struggles to take over the movie rental industry. And thankfully changed the company name to Netflix, from their original choice: Kibble.

Even more impressive, after Netflix had developed a loyal customer base and proved its DVD mail subscription service, it pivoted not once but twice. As [Chad Grills](https://twitter.com/ChadGrills) put it,
> # “Reed never lost his long-term vision. He knew that Internet speeds would eventually improve and that streaming would eventually become the preferred viewer experience.”

Netflix changed from a DVD mailing company to a streaming company. Then, after dominating the streaming market, moved into the business of original content creation.

Now, six years after it started developing original content, Netflix rivals Disney in the funds it invests in original content creation. Netflix, under Reed Hastings’s leadership — continues to embody the identity of its founder — and thrives on breaking into new areas and avoiding the bureaucratic trap.

A feat they’ve managed by focusing on two key principles: freedom and responsibility.

### Freedom
> # “Our goal is to inspire people more than manage them. We trust our teams to do what they think is best for Netflix — giving them lots of freedom, power, and information in support of their decisions. In turn, this generates a sense of responsibility and self-discipline that drives us to do great work that benefits the company.”* — [Netflix Culture](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)*

Netflix leaders — including Reed Hastings — believe that people do their best work when they don’t need to constantly ask for approval. They consider that when people have the freedom to make decisions, they’ll put more effort into making those decisions responsibly.

Encapsulated in the culture deck that went viral several years ago, Netflix employees have the freedom to implement the company’s strategy into their own jobs and use them to deliver the best value they can. As a result, there’s no shortage of employee-developed innovations, including new content, diverse hiring, and social media campaigns. Employees also decide their own vacation time, maternity leave, and travel expenses rather than having the company impose rules.

Netflix leadership hires highly qualified people, provides them with clarity of the mission, and encourages them to make decisions that align to this mission. Every level of management is expected to set context and provide information so that decisions can be made by those that will be responsible to carry them out. In this way, people fully own their work. And they’re engaged to deliver the best quality that aligns with the company’s vision. [As Hastings recently told TED’s Chris Anderson](https://www.ted.com/talks/reed_hastings_how_netflix_changed_entertainment_and_where_it_s_headed),
> # “I pride myself on making as few decisions as possible in a quarter.”

Yet all of this freedom doesn’t come without expectations. Employees are expected to understand the culture deck and actively debate it with their peers. Everyone is expected to represent the company’s best interest in their own decisions, as well as those they see around them. In Reed Hastings words,
> # “To disagree silently is disloyal.”

In this way, Netflix fosters candid debate and gives people the benefit of multiple perspectives, as well as the opportunity to continue learning from their actions. As [one Netflix HR executive put it](https://hbr.org/2018/05/structure-thats-not-stifling),
> # “It’s not necessary for us to implement control mechanisms. We want to help people learn and give them oxygen to make mistakes.”

### Responsibility
> # “You might think that such freedom would lead to chaos. But we also don’t have a clothing policy, yet no one has come to work naked.”* — [Netflix Culture](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)*

When Reed Hastings developed his first company, he prioritized process as a means of quality. With each problem, they developed a procedural solution. In Reed’s words,
> # “We were trying to dummy proof the system. And eventually only dummies wanted to work there.”

When the market changed, as markets inevitably do, Pure Software was unable to change with it. By Hastings’s own admission, it was staffed with people who thrived in following procedures and were unable to adapt quickly to changes.

Reed brought this lesson to Netflix and vowed to avoid past mistakes. The company actively resists allowing process overreactions to unnecessarily limit employee freedom. Instead, they focus on individual responsibility.

Each employee is held accountable for their behaviors and the expectation that they’ll act in the best interest of the company. Management communication is frequent so that people understand how their performance measures up to expectations and are given the opportunity to improve and adjust.

In one of the best criteria I’ve ever seen, managers decide whom to retain within the team based on the “keeper test.” As Netflix describes it,
> # “If one of the members of our team were leaving for another firm, would the manager try hard to keep them from leaving?”

Employees are given the freedom to make decisions that best align with the company. And they’re held accountable for the results. What more could any quality employee want?

### Freedom and Responsibility
> # “Success is neither magical nor mysterious. Success is the natural consequence of consistently applying basic fundamentals.”* — Jim Rohn*

The Harvard Business Review asked members of the HBR community to gauge the extent of bureaucracy within their organizations using a [Bureaucracy Mass Index](https://hbr.org/2017/05/assessment-do-you-know-how-bureaucratic-your-organization-is) tool. After over 7000 responses, [the results don’t speak well for the state of most workplaces.](https://hbr.org/2017/08/what-we-learned-about-bureaucracy-from-7000-hbr-readers)

Nearly two-thirds of respondents identified scores that correspond to bureaucratic drag. With two-thirds also identifying that their organizations have become more bureaucratic — more centralized and rule-bound — over the past few years.

Sigmund Freud once said, *“Most people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves responsibility, and most people are frightened of responsibility.” *Yet in my experience, this isn’t true. People want freedom. They welcome the responsibility. And they need to have both of these virtues within their organization if we expect them to perform truly great work. As Albert Einstein put it,
> # “Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom.”

As our organizations grow, and move from dynamic startups into larger companies, they’re in constant danger of turning into the bureaucracies that history continues to make irrelevant. With each layer of management and each new generation of employees, it takes a conscious push to ensure we retain the adaptability that will support long-term success. We need to hold onto that founder mentality. And keep the focus on freedom and responsibility. Returning to the prophetic words of Peter Thiel’s *Zero to One*,
> # “It’s up to us. We cannot take for granted that the future will be better, and that means we need to work to create it today.”

*Thanks, as always, for reading! Any additional best practices to stave off the choke of bureaucracy? Feel free to share, I’d love to hear from you. And if you found this helpful, I’d appreciate if you could clap it up* 👏*and help me share with more people. Cheers!*

# Before You Start Up, Start This

## Before You Start Up, Start This

### It’s Fine, You Can Thank Me Later

I’m one of the most impatient people in the world.

When I graduated college, I wanted to start freelancing full-time instead of waiting for financial stability. So, I did.

When I was fed up with the same bullshit format that all networking events used, I wanted to try and fix it. So, I did.

When I came across an idea for a mobile app, I wanted to pursue it, even without a lick of coding experience. So, I did.

While (productively) fumbling through the past decade, I have made a living illustrating posters, building brands, laying out websites, designing apps, writing articles, throwing summer camps, starting companies, and pretty much everything else in-between. I’ve even been paid to make weird sounds with my mouth while standing next to five other guys who sing. True story.

I tend to dive head first into new projects without fully planning things out — it’s just the way I am. As you can probably guess, this impatience has played a part while working on a few startups in the past.

Now that entrepreneurship has become trendy, everyone and their mother is launching a startup.

If you ask me, this is great!

Sure, over 90% of them will inevitably fail, but thanks to the other 10%(ish), we will continue to see innovative solutions to worldwide problems.

At least, in an ideal world.

Since we don’t live in an ideal world, we’re stuck with half-baked ideas and ill-conceived companies that continue to disappoint.

If you ask me, I think it all comes back to one “simple” truth:

### Startups are still being created in vacuums and bubbles.

Many of today’s entrepreneurs still adopt a “leap before you look” mentality which leads to a solution to a non-problem.

In the overcomplicated jargon of the tech industry, people aren’t ***validating*** their ideas before they launch companies.

It’s the same issue with aspiring authors who choose not to vet the interest of their prospective book before writing it.

So, what exactly is the solution to this pandemic?

I won’t even begin to pretend that I have the silver bullet.

Instead, I would like to humbly propose a suggestion:

### Instead of starting a startup, try starting a community.

You know, a community with real people.

When getting started, it can be way too tempting to scratch your own itch and create a solution to your problem as quickly as possible.

Sure, there’s a chance that others might have the same problem, but why take that gamble?

Thanks to a little something called the Internet, the first step in scratching your own itch can be growing a community around said itch.

In doing so, you’ll quickly learn whether or not people actually share in your pain or if your just delusional.

While attempting to grow this community, a few things will happen:

* You’ll start practicing important skills that will directly translate when you start growing a company.

* You’ll actually prove whether or not people want what you have to offer.

* If so, you’ll have a direct line of communication to a very engaged group of early adopters.

* Which, if you do your job right and create a great solution, will also give you word of mouth marketing.

These are just a few of the benefits that come with starting and growing your own community.

### If you stop and listen closely enough, they might even tell you which startup to start next.

# Solving the Global Housing Crisis

## **Where do you put 3 million people every week?**

The man looked over the valley he declared that this was the right place to build their city.

It was the middle of the desert. The nearest city was more than a thousand miles away. The only indication that there might be some life in the area was the giant lake on the horizon, but it was too salty to support anything other than a few shrimp.

The man looked around at his people and the barren landscape. Fear ran through his head. He knew that 70,000 migrants would soon be arriving and that they would all needed a place to live. To the small group of weary travelers, this would be the founding of a new home.

In this case, one man, built and grew an incredibly successful city. The city with the salty lake is, of course, Salt Lake City, and today it is thriving, with a metro area of more than 1.2 million residents.

As tough as Brigham Young’s challenge was, it is nothing compared to what we face today. We are in the middle of a crisis that needs to be solved. Brigham had to build a city, housing, and government for 70,000 people. In order to meet the demands of the global housing crisis, we need to produce more than 70,000 houses… every single day.

# Four Pitfalls To Avoid When Scaling Your Business From Freelance To Agency

## 

It’s been a couple of years since I went from freelance to running my own agency. I was making decent money and had a handful of loyal clients, but that wasn’t enough for me. I realized that I needed to [scale my business](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abdullahimuhammed/2017/03/22/7-signs-you-should-go-from-a-solo-freelancer-to-an-agency/#437efa105719).

Throughout the journey, I had to overcome a lot of challenges, and I made a few mistakes as well. So I’ve decided to make a list of some of the common pitfalls you should avoid when trying to scale your business from freelance to agency. Hopefully, this will make your journey easier, and you’ll be better prepared to overcome any challenges along the way.

### **1. Investing In The Wrong People**

When you’re in the process of scaling your business from freelance to agency, one of the most important aspects you need to take care of is [your workforce](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jefffromm/2018/07/03/gen-z-in-the-work-force-how-to-recruit-and-retain-youth-generations/). You may already be collaborating with a few freelancers, but your agency will need to invest in full-time employees.

It’s understandable that you’re going to be in a hurry to accomplish this goal. But it would be best not to rush or you could end up investing in people who aren’t the right for your agency. Since your business is at a very early stage, it’s best to be cautious about who you invest in.

I started out by hiring a few freelancers. Then I observed the quality of work they delivered as well as their ability to keep up with business demands. It was only after a few months of consistency that I chose to hire them full time.

I found this tactic to be extremely helpful for me. Try it out for yourself. It works because you can hire people based on your budget, and your team members get a regular freelancing gig while still having some flexibility in their schedule. When you don’t have a lot of capital, you have to look for ways to get creative.

### **2. Investing In The Wrong Platform**

Once you’re scaling up to become a full-fledged agency, you will need to invest in the right platform on which to build your projects. What works for others may not necessarily work for you. So it may not be the best idea to simply spend your money on the most popular platform in the market.

The goal is to find a platform that comes with all the features you need to scale up over time, but without having a serious financial implication for your business. This is especially crucial since you may be on a tight budget.

### **3. Taking On More Than You Can Handle**

You may feel the need to aim for rapid growth so you take on as many clients as possible. One of the biggest mistakes you can make when you’re still in the process of scaling your business is taking on so much work that your team gets overwhelmed. Not only does this create unnecessary stress for your employees, but it also results in poor-quality work.

I suggest you only focus on a few loyal clients at first and deliver high-quality work consistently. You can then gradually scale up and take on more clients as your team gets better at handling the existing workload.

Once you already have a team that works full time, you can try recruiting some extra freelancers who are capable of delivering quality work. And then you can start taking on new clients.

Besides the workload, it’s also crucial that you closely examine the kind of work that potential clients need before you decide to take it. Will your team be able to deliver the quality of work expected? Do you have team members who are capable of taking on the job? Otherwise, you could end up working on a project that no one knows how to do.

For example, let’s say you have a content writing business and your clients come to you asking for a technical whitepaper. But none of your team members are experienced in technical writing.

In this case, it may be safest not to take on the job or you could risk under-delivering, which could harm your reputation. You may want to look for freelancers who can handle the job and occasionally reach out to them whenever you have proposals such as these.

### **4. Investing In Office Space Too Early**

I understand you’re excited about starting your very own agency, which also means you’re likely excited at the prospect of sitting in your very own office. But rushing to rent office space can distract you from focusing on the more important aspects of your business.

In a world where communication has become simplified by technology, I suggest you maintain a [remote team](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/06/26/four-ways-to-keep-your-remote-team-happy-and-motivated/) at the initial stages. This is, of course, only for the types of businesses that can function with a remote team. You can use tools like Slack for easy communication and coordination between team members from different parts of the city, state or even the world.

Working as a remote team can save a lot of time and money: Your team members don’t have to travel to a physical location to carry out their duties. And of course, you don’t have to pay a lease or monthly rental for office space, not to mention the various operating costs such as electricity, internet connection, etc.

As your team grows, you can start considering whether having a physical office would make organization and coordination simpler.

Now you know some of the biggest mistakes you should avoid when scaling your business from freelance to agency. The most important advice I have for you is to not rush into things. Since you’ll be working on a limited budget, it’s important that you play it safe.

# Workplaces of The Future

## Workplaces of The Future

### The Mission Newsletter, 10/26/18

> # “Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create.” — Roy T. Bennett

## **Where will we work in 100 years?**

Imagine you are 100 years in the future. You get into your automatic shower, put on your futuristic adaptive jumpsuit, and hop into your flying car to head to work.

You commute to the top of an impossibly tall skyscraper, where you work for only a few hours doing simple tasks while robots take care of all the dirty work. You fly home to your adoring family and robot dog.

This was more or less the vision of the future laid out in *The Jetsons*, the cartoon series that first aired in 1962. It was supposed to be a depiction of the world in 100 years, the year 2062. We are more than halfway there… and that prediction was a bit off.

Since *The Jetsons*, the nature of work has changed dramatically. Technology surrounds us. But our workspaces have lagged considerably.

There are a few flying cars and robot dogs, and perhaps the building in the clouds is the Salesforce Tower. But clearly, we need an updated vision of where the future of work will happen.

So we sat down with executives who are building some of the most cutting-edge offices in the world. We wanted to know where they are finding inspiration for these gleaming futuristic workspaces:
> # *“Honestly, Buffalo, Wyoming.”*
> # *“I think…Bozeman, Montana.”*

That’s when we knew we were in for some surprises…

# How To Network With Higher Status People

## 

When it comes to networking and building relationships, especially in a professional context, a lot of your success depends on being able to build connections to people of higher status than you in an industry, company, or community.

(It’s worth taking a second here to exclaim how much I hate using the term “higher status” since I deeply believe everyone’s worth comes from them being a human being, and status, power, money, etc don’t change that inherent worth.)

But there are situations where someone else has access to power, resources, or opportunity and you want to build a relationship with them to further your goals or your career. Ideally, relationships ought to be mutually beneficial and connecting to higher status people makes that more difficult because its unclear exactly what you bring to the relationship. And this is where the key to building mutually beneficial connections to people of unequal status depends on a fancy, academic sounding word you may only see on a standardized test:

Multiplexity

Multiplexity is an idea in network science that are different contexts for connections. Some people are only connected because of one reason. Those connections are called uniplex ties. Others are connected because of multiple reasons. Those connections are called multiplex ties.

Those people with multiple contexts for connection — with multiplex ties — tend to build a deeper relationship faster with someone, and they also give people reasons to stay connected.

But for our purposes — for finding a mutually beneficial relationship in a power imbalance scenario — multiplexity gives you more contexts in which you can find something beneficial to contribute.

If you really get to know that person you aspire to connect with, then you’ll probably learn something (or multiple things) to connect with them on where the power balance is a little bit more equal. And if it’s a little more equal, then it will be much easier to connect in that context. Even better, you may find a scenario where you’re actually the higher status person or at least have something valuable to contribute that the other doesn’t have.

For example (and because I realize this is kind of all complicated and throwing out big words like multiplexity doesn’t help), a number of years ago I was looking to build a relationship with a [friend of a friend](http://amzn.to/2up15sv)who was an absolute genius at book marketing. He’s a good guy and, like most people, would want to help me if he could, but like most geniuses at anything, time was limited. So relying on just being the beneficiary of his goodwill wasn’t going to work; he was already over-spending his goodwill.

I wanted to be friends authentically with him, but let’s be honest, building a relationship with him would also help me as I was preparing to launch several books.

However, I eventually learned that he was really developing an interest in the sport and the martial art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which I’ve been studying for more than a decade. There was a lot that I could teach him. So, we developed a relationship sort-of-in parallel. He would talk to me about concepts from book marketing. I would talk to him about concepts from Jiu-Jitsu. He would look at my marketing copy or content and give feedback. I would look at matches of him competing in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments, give him feedback. We had a mutually beneficial relationship not by being equals in the same space, but because we had this multiplex tie. We were able to create value for each other, but in two different domains.

That is why multiplexity is the key to building connections to higher status people. You can provide value to that person that can get reciprocated into value for you. You just have to do it in two different domains. But, it only works if you start looking at the totality of that person and find a different context in which to connect where things were a little bit equal or maybe even unequal but in your favor, and you can provide value to them that over time gets reciprocated.

Multiplexity is where you’re going to build a deeper relationship faster. But it’s also where you’re more likely to build a reciprocal relationship generating value for each other over time.

# Is Your Company Building an Inclusive Economy?

## B Corps Turn to Employees and Outside Partners for Collaboration and Support in the Inclusive Economy Challenge

If your company is ready to advance toward a more inclusive economy through collaboration and goal-setting — and a good deal of meaningful impact work — you’ll have to find the time and resources to support your journey.

And some companies — like Certified B Corporations participating in the [Inclusive Economy Challenge](http://go.pardot.com/e/39792/ps-inclusive-economy-challenge/8lmn78/1087050797) — recognize that inclusion is just the first step. Hundreds of participating companies are using their businesses to build an inclusive economy, one that is equitable and just for all, and they’re sharing their learnings.

Below are examples of B Corps investing time and resources to set goals, create a plan and follow through on those actions — by creating teams that represent all employees and working with partner organizations to realize their goals.

## Reinforce and Reinvigorate an Improvement-Based Culture

As a Certified B Corporation, [Ellevate Network](http://go.pardot.com/e/39792/2018-10-05/8lmn7j/1087050797) is committed to continually improving its metrics and impact in the world through its offerings to customers and employees.

That’s why last year Ellevate Network decided to join the [Inclusive Economy Challenge](http://go.pardot.com/e/39792/ps-inclusive-economy-challenge/8lmn78/1087050797) and seek measures on some key questions, including:

* Where does the company stand in terms of inclusivity?

* How well does the company train and ensure that employees have the tools needed for financial success in their lives?

* Does the company website serve visitors and respect its commitment to diversity?

To answer these questions, Ellevate Network set some ambitious goals, went to work on them — and soon realized some unanticipated effects on the company and employees.

## A Working Group With Authority

For [COOK](https://www.cookfood.net/), a United Kingdom-based company that prepares and sells frozen homestyle foods, shifting its workplace to be more equitable means exploring flexible scheduling for hourly employees and establishing an employee working group focused on diversity and inclusion.

The COOK diversity and inclusion working group, which has quarterly meetings open to all employees at its headquarters, is shaping company policies and providing feedback on proposed diversity training.

In addition to devoting employee time and focus to the internal diversity and inclusion group, COOK has joined other companies in the United Kingdom on a cross-industry working group to share best practices for [flexible working in retail](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/john-lewis-tesco-dixons-carphone-to-help-part-time-workers-career-progress-retail-a7737276.html), an industry that relies on part-time workers.

In some organizations, certain departments or teams may not be as connected to the overall mission or have the same opportunities for career advancement. COOK and other companies in the UK retail working group are working with a consultant to “unblock” career progression.

Through T3, trans women of color and gender nonconforming people of color in Sweet Livity’s trainer network had access to leadership development and wellness programming.

Sweet Livity continues its diversity, equity and inclusion growth this year through several projects. To spread the word about investment resources, Sweet Livity became one of the women-owned companies promoting the launch of [Crowdfund Main Street](https://crowdfundmainstreet.com/), which connects female entrepreneurs with unaccredited investors — aka everyday people — who want to invest in them.

It also moved forward on its goal of increasing the number of transgender and gender nonconforming people in its management roles and network of consultant affiliates. By celebrating diversity in its leadership, Sweet Livity takes another step toward equity.

In one of its biggest equity and inclusion projects this year, Sweet Livity started a conversion process to become a worker-owned cooperative and share its financial success with more employees. By distributing ownership throughout the workforce, Sweet Livity improves employees’ financial security and job satisfaction while creating a more inclusive workplace.

# Unconscious Bias&#58; the Key to Effective Communication in the Workplace Between Men and Women

## What gender communications patterns can teach us about ourselves

![](1*N-eIUoWa10krAiyHvlLQ7w.jpeg)

In executive coaching (both women and men) I’ve often observed that two parallel stories about women and men in the workplace often coexist. First, “women and men communicate differently” is a truth that few bother to deny. Second, “men and women are treated equally in the workplace.” To me, it’s difficult for these two perspectives to both be true and yet many people, especially leaders, seem to believe them without any cognitive dissonance, unaware of the ways unconscious bias works on us all.

## Do women and men communicate differently?

Research seems to bear out the truth of this statement and it’s pretty easy to verify this anecdotally. Sitting in a meeting with men and women communicating you’ll experience a common language and plenty of shared meaning. But if you look through a gender lens, you’ll see behavior and communications patterns that differ. Men will often be more willing to interrupt each other and women as well. Women will be [four times more likely](https://inpowercoaching.com/language-power-of-female-leadership/) to begin their comments with a self-deprecating phrase like “I may not be the expert on this, but….”

What’s most interesting to me about these dynamics is that if you could call a “time out” in the average meeting and collect the men on one side of the room and the women on the other, it wouldn’t take too long to get each group talking about the annoying communication patterns of dealing with the other group. When prompted, women will quickly start complaining about how often the men give voice to an idea a woman brought up only a few minutes earlier without giving credit to the woman. Men, similarly prompted, will easily roll their eyes at how long it can take a woman to get to the point, stop asking questions and make a decision. There are other patterns people will identify if you give them the chance, including [men don’t listen or women are too emotional.](https://inpowercoaching.com/upskilling/upskills-communications/gendered-communications-patterns/)

Even though research has found that people’s perception of communications patterns such as these consistently break down by gender lines, in my own experience there are other dynamics at play.

## How gender communications stereotypes reveal unconscious biases

I have worked with many women and women’s groups on personal and interpersonal strategies for communicating with confidence, and one of the most engaging conversations that consistently crops up is around the appropriate role of emotion in the workplace. Women are often shocked to learn that emotions, emotional awareness and emotional expression are extremely important [leadership skills](https://inpowercoaching.com/womens-emotional-intelligence-help-us-get-leadership-2/). The reason they are surprised is because they believe a story about emotions that is very limiting, which is that “emotions at work” looks like someone (usually a woman) breaking down and crying uncontrollably and in a way that incapacitates her to do her job. Many men believe this story too, and they live in fear of anyone (woman or man) becoming visibly upset in a business meeting. And yet, everyone has been acculturated to believing that anger — a potent emotion in any context — can be an appropriate emotion to express in a business setting.
> *“Learn to make the unconscious, conscious.” [*Click to Tweet](https://ctt.ac/7pwd0)

![](0*6u6tMYlJvtIlB5G7.jpg)

These perceptions reveal an important factor running beneath the stories most of us believe about gendered communications patterns in the workplace, and throughout life in general. In my experience the importance of differences between men and women (or any classification population) has less to do with the “truth” of them and more to do with what we believe about why we “do this to each other” and “what happens as a result.”

Those two time-out groups in the meeting above will quickly start psychoanalyzing the other gender if you give them the right prompts and they feel safe in their conversational bubbles. They’ll start trying to explain why women or men talk or act the way they do. They’ll repeat pop psychology and tell anecdotal stories about their family members and friends. Many will become defensive, and if you give it enough time, some victim-talk will start to emerge.

It is normal human behavior in like-minded groups, to seek confirmation for the way we experience “the other,” but for those who look at these beliefs and stories also reveal many [unconscious biases](https://inpowercoaching.com/buzzword-training-videos/unconscious-bias/) that have embedded themselves into our cultures. To the extent they remain unchallenged in the group, they also reveal how these biases have embedded themselves into our individual psyches as well.

## Bottom line: unconscious biases become reality unless we consciously change them

The tricky thing about unconscious biases is that until they become conscious, we cannot challenge our own, and our groups’, assumptions about what is true. We cannot begin an inquiry into what is true because it is a species-wide habit, reliable and predictable across circumstances and populations, and what is true because we have common perceptions that simply reinforce each other until it is, in fact, our reality. We cannot begin to experiment with our own behaviors and beliefs by challenging our assumptions to discover new ways of communicating and working together.

There is no one solution to this challenge, however, everyone’s journey to finding more effective communications styles personally and between genders, is the same:* start looking for the assumptions (i.e., biases) that influence your thinking and communications, and which you’re not conscious of. *That’s it. Learn to make the unconscious, conscious. Just be curious and ask yourself the questions to reveal your underlying assumptions. Challenge them more often and be open to changing the way you see things about yourself and others.

With respect to gendered communications, I have a [short lesson](https://inpowercoaching.com/upskilling/upskills-communications/gendered-communications-patterns/) to help you. Use this to get smarter about looking at all kinds of [unconscious biases](https://inpowercoaching.com/buzzword-training-videos/unconscious-bias/) you have that drive your behaviors and relationships. They’re not all bad, but you’ll be a more effective leader and communicator if you’re more aware of them.

# Why You Must Celebrate Yourself First Before The World Will Applaud You

## “A young woman blowing at small flower petals in her hands” by Ethan Robertson on Unsplash

## **Decide What Constitutes Success**
> # *“I celebrate myself, and sing myself, and what I assume you shall assume, for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.” — Walt Whitman*

It was Jiddu Krishnamurti, regarded as one of the greatest thinkers and religious teachers of all time who once wrote: “The more you know yourself the more clarity there is. Self-knowledge has no end — you don’t come to an achievement, you don’t come to a conclusion. It is an endless river.”

Do you think he was right when he says: self-knowledge leads to clarity? What about you? What do you know about yourself now with greater clarity? It’s reassuring to celebrate ourselves since our reality is the embodiment of our thoughts. If we believe in our worthiness to achieve success, we will attract it because what is thought and repeated, will undeniably come to life.

Does that notion work for you? Can you see how what happens within you must also happen in your reality? I want you to really understand this idea because it bears repeating since everything that happens *out there* has been created *within you* first.

I’m not talking about your desires being handed to you on a silver platter since that would be unreasonable. I’m talking about what you hold in mind and repeat with conviction and emotion must show up in your life, assuming you do the work and are committed to the process.

Success can encompass many things, whether it be: health, wealth, relationships or the simplest things. You get to decide what constitutes success, so it’s best to find your own definition and abide by it. Don’t be swayed by other people’s opinions because that will give you the impression you are unsuccessful. Does that make you feel better knowing you needn’t compete against others? I sure hope so.

I’m drawn to the British psychologist and author Robert Holden who explains in *Authentic Success* how we must redefine success to encompass the journey to get there. It’s not enough to focus on the prize because many people who achieve success find they are more unfulfilled than before: “It is my experience that many people relate to success as something to celebrate at the end of their days, when they finally “get there.” All their energy is invested in a ticket that will get them to a land called “there.” But life isn’t just about “getting there”; it is also about “being here” and enjoying your journey.”

Are you comfortable with this idea? I know I’m emphasising the point, but I want you to get an impression of what it means to **create success on your terms**, not others. What we believe about ourselves is the foundation for how the world responds to us.

Thoughts are a powerful phenomenon and many of us are unconscious to them because we’re habituated to ignore them. Mainly because they pass through our stream of consciousness at a rate of 70,000–80,000 thoughts per day. It is no surprise we ignore them, there are just too many thoughts to know which ones are relevant.

To celebrate ourselves, we ought to make peace with parts of ourselves we are at war with. Peace means to reconcile negative or unconscious thoughts with the wholeness of who we really are. So if you consider yourself to be an anxious person, you disregard the possibility of being a peaceful person; you rule it out so to speak.

## **The Wholeness Of Who You Really Are**
> # *“Go where you are celebrated — not tolerated. If they can’t see the real value of you, it’s time for a new start.” — Unknown*

I’m sure you’ve heard the story about the baby elephant tethered by a rope to a stake? It turns out that as the elephant matures to fall size, it remains chained to the stake unable to break free. Even though it is capable of escaping, it is held captive because of its conditioning from an early age. Whilst a fictional story, it correlates with our own story of how setbacks or failures limit our potential.

For example, I know a relative who is considered an anxious person and has trouble flying on planes. She believes her character is fixed and refuses to change. Yet, when asked if she’s tried meditation or other forms of relaxation therapy, she dismisses them because she’s convinced her personality is static.

Our behaviour is anything but determined. The science of epigenetics tells us that our brains are constantly evolving depending on the stimuli it receives. Do you know people like this? No matter what you say, they won’t change or to be more precise, refuse to change. It can be difficult to convince them otherwise.

Embracing ourselves foremost is central to awakening our greatest potential. To celebrate our own selves means to accept both our negative and positive characteristics. Wholeness is a story about welcoming every part of you while realising **you are none of those things in isolation but in their entirety**. **When combined, they make up the wholeness of who you really are.**

If we want the world to celebrate us, we must accept ourselves unconditionally in order to find clarity. You can become a greater version of yourself because if the thought is active within you, its potential to merge into the wholeness of your character will come to life.

Celebration of oneself is a journey that comes from within and radiates outward. It is an endless river as Jiddu Krishnamurti points out. So, what will you choose? Will you be a shining light others are drawn to or will you withhold your greatness because of the fear of being *found out*? I trust you choose in alignment with your core self.

# Instagram’s Co-Founders Just Left The Company. Here’s Why That’s A Good Thing

## 

The old Instagram is dead.

The titan’s founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, left the company in September of this year. The platform will now be run by longtime Facebook vet Adam Mosseri.

Normally, the departure of your founding executives would seem reason to pull a company fire alarm. Evidence of trouble. But the departure, in this case, is actually a good thing — for both sides.

Here’s why.

## **1. Instagram’s founders can now go back to doing what they’re best at.**

It takes a special set of minds to create something as game-changing as Instagram.
> # But, as any successful founder knows, starting and running a company are two very different things.

In the beginning, founders are almost purely creatives, problem-solvers running on inspiration — their work changes minute by minute, day by day.

The head of a machine as large as modern-day Instagram, on the other hand, has different priorities. They’re going to focus on things like:

* Profitability

* Data

* Long-term value.

Furthermore, Instagram now exists under the umbrella of Facebook, which means heightened expectations. Facebook wants Instagram to serve as part of its [big data program](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/03/16/the-amazing-ways-instagram-uses-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/#26839be45ca6), while moving in on the market share carved out by Snapchat. That’s likely not what Instagram’s founders imagined when they first started the business.
> **What Instagram needs, now, is a leader who can commit to those new goals and expectations without friction or pause.**

The new Head of Instagram can do just that. Systrom and Krieger, meanwhile, can bring their prestige and marketability to whichever venture they take part in next.

That marketability will prove insanely valuable. One of the chief goals of a startup is gaining exposure — reaching as many people as quickly as possible. With their experience and reputations, Systrom and Krieger will be kingmakers.

## **2. Instagram gets to keep growing.**

It’s easy to demonize buyouts. After all, mergers can actively [harm competition](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/opinion/sunday/how-mergers-damage-the-economy.html). And there’s a long history of [buyouts turning sour for companies.](https://www.idealsvdr.com/blog/bad-private-equity-deals/)
> But since the buyout in 2012, Instagram has exploded.

Before, Instagram was a growing app of 30 million users. It was a popular startup that captured the ideas and hearts of creatives and influencers across the world. But it needed Facebook’s prestige to become the massive success it is today. Instagram is now one of the most well-known social networks in the world, with [more than a billion active members.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/)

It comes down to basics: Facebook has an infrastructure the original Instagram team could only dream of. By integrating the photo-sharing platform within a network of billions of existing users, Facebook created a new audience for the site. The user base blew up, as did Instagram’s [cultural impact](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/influence-of-instagram/).

With the departure of its founders, and a Facebook exec placed at the company’s head, Instagram will become more integrated within Mark Zuckerberg’s system. Which means it’s further integrated into a network of 2.2 billion users.

That’s a lot of follows and likes.

## **3. Facebook benefits, too.**

For Facebook, the change in Instagram’s leadership will prove an intelligent decision.

For one thing, promoting from within will allow them to double down, as it were, on their mission to integrate Instagram more completely into Facebook. This creates a stronger revenue model in that it benefits Facebook’s [advertisers](https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/06/21/instagram-monetization-igtv-years-end/) *and [*consumers](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/01/its-going-to-be-an-instagram-christmas.html).

The impact to advertising will be particularly impressive. Instagram will soon flip the script in this field with tools like integrated shopping, wherein users will be able to buy Christmas gifts from straight from their favorite accounts. If you love the sweater Selena Gomez’s dog is wearing in a Story, you can purchase it from the actual page.
> # And that’s only the beginning.

With plans to compete directly with [Youtube](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram/instagram-expands-into-long-videos-will-compete-with-youtube-idUSKBN1JG2X6), for example — not to mention a commitment to further refine smash-hit features like Stories — Instagram will continue to play an important part of Facebook’s future.

While buyouts and the departure of the company’s founders sounds rocky, in the end, both of these moves can only help Instagram. The departure of Systrom and Krieger will prove a boon to the startup world. And Mosseri, as the new head of the company, will help make the *new Instagram* an even stronger app for advertisers, users, and its parent company alike.

# Key Takeaways from DreamForce 2018

## Dreamforce 2018

The Salesforce yearly extravaganza just wrapped up, leaving all those in attendance with plenty of new CRM insights and clues about the direction Salesforce is heading towards. Salesforce unveiled a lot of new updates and features aimed at improving the Salesforce customer experience. A lot of the talking points from this year’s addition were overshadowed by the headlining news of [**Salesforce and Apple partnership](https://www.rolustech.com/blog/salesforce-apple-join-forces-heres-means)**. But don’t worry, we’ve compiled everything you need to know for those of you who weren’t in San Francisco over the last week. Let’s dig in!

## Salesforce + Apple

Let’s get this one out of the way first. Unless you’re stuck in a cave, by now you probably know that Salesforce and Apple are partnering up. There’s a whole list of opportunities this could present but most of it is still under wraps for now. What we do now is that Siri and Einstein will be combined in a way to bring out the most out of both of them. Marc Benioff also highlighted how the integration of the [**Salesforce Cloud](https://www.rolustech.com/salesforce-cloud)** platforms with each other is the target to achieve. You can check out the link above for a comprehensive breakout of the partnership.

## The Integration Cloud

Salesforce finally unveiled its Integration Cloud at Dreamforce. The Integration Cloud finds its roots in the acquisition of MuleSoft by Salesforce. The Integration Cloud is the just the beginning of things according to Marc Benioff. Salesforce intends to build upon the Integration Cloud with its Customer 360 initiative. The Customer 360 is an attempt by Salesforce to offer its user a detailed and in-depth look at customers. Customer 360 will integrate all Salesforce Cloud platforms to deliver immense cross channel experiences, this will then be taken up by MuleSoft to connect data to various other platforms in an enterprise. The Integration Cloud is expected to play a pivotal role for organizations looking to upgrade from legacy systems.

## Einstein Gets a Voice!

Siri wasn’t the last of [**Salesforce Einstein](https://www.rolustech.com/blog/salesforce-einstein-intelligent-future)** updates at Dreamforce ’18. Since its introduction two years ago, Einstein has been one of the platforms with the maximum updates. This year, it gets natural language capabilities. This functionality allows users to direct their CRMs with their voice and initiate tasks i.e. notes dictation and chatbot creation etc. Voice control commands is a breakthrough in CRM features that will allow users to increase productivity by delegating most of their tasks.

## Dreampitch!

Dreampitch was back again this year giving startups a chance to get their hands on a grant of $250,000. Numerous startups locked horns in front of a panel of judges and will.i.am with each getting 5 minutes to convince the panel why they were the most deserving. Dreampitch has managed to make a place for itself as one of Dreamforce highlights, and it’s safe to say it lived up to that yet again!

## Salesforce + Lamborghini

Salesforce followed up the Apple announcement with a collaboration with Lamborghini. This partnership will provide Lamborghini owners with an amazing digital experience through Salesforce. Earlier this year, Lamborghini unveiled its exclusive mobile app for all its customers to interact with their Lamborghini cars. The app was built on Salesforce Lightning and integrated with the Salesforce Community Cloud. At Dreamforce, Salesforce announced that the Marketing Cloud will serve as the follow-up integration, aimed towards providing a more unified customer experience for all Lamborghini owners.

## Metallica!

Alright, so this isn’t technically a takeaway from Dreamforce but come on! We had to talk about Metallica! For years Dreamforce has managed to bring the best of the best for their entertainment events, and this year was no different. Metallica rocked the city of San Francisco leaving all those in attendance raving to the tunes that have made rock so popular. The proceeds from the concert were donated to charity, as it the custom since the start.

## Our Two Bits!

This was another outing for Salesforce that put them on the top for all things CRM. With numerous new partnerships and acquisitions, Salesforce looks to be right on track towards more expansion. The commitment and detail with respect to its products continue to set the benchmark, and judging by what we saw at Dreamforce 2018, the future is lightning bright!

# Surrender | A Better Way to Build a Startup

## 5 Lessons to create with more fulfillment and less stress

![Photo by [aquachara](https://unsplash.com/photos/Du09rfwlDP8?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*pEhHcQyuKAcVMLok4sWjDQ.jpeg)*Photo by [aquachara](https://unsplash.com/photos/Du09rfwlDP8?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*
> If you let go a little, you will have a little happiness. If you let go a lot, you will have a lot of happiness. If you let go completely, you will be free. — Ajahn Chah

**Building a startup is a grind. Or so they say. But, what if there was a different way?**

Most entrepreneurs are Type A’s. This means we are constantly pushing ourselves to our next big goal, next milestone. While you very well may achieve business success as I did, you’ll likely be left thinking “what’s next”. This constant push towards new goals will eventually leave most exhausted and unfulfilled. So what is the other way?

Michael Singer’s [*The Surrender Experiment](https://www.amazon.com/Surrender-Experiment-Journey-Lifes-Perfection-ebook/dp/B00NDTUDOS/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1532448978&sr=8-1)* is the most transformational book I’ve read. It effortlessly explores Singer’s simple model he used for building a hugely successful company while maintaining full alignment with the other areas of his life. The model is built upon his own personal experience.

He just may have hit on THE FORMULA for enjoying life while building a big company. I believe it to be the key to living a joyful and fulfilling life.

Singer’s book is his personal account of building what would become a huge public company from the rural woods of Gainesville, Florida. The crazy part is Singer moved to the woods after college with the intention of meditating in solitude for the rest of his life.

**Instead, he ended up accepting what he calls The Surrender Experiment: When opportunities were placed in front of him, he would surrender to them.**

What began as one man’s desire to depart far, far away from the likes of commerce and into the realms of spirit revealed itself as a mind-blowing union between both, all grounded in the foundation of surrender.

To paint a picture of just how far the Surrender Experiment enabled Singer to go, consider the following: Through conducting the experiment, he ended up building a large tech company in the woods of Gainesville. He also amassed a huge amount of property there, where he continues to live. He built [The Temple of the Universe](https://www.tou.org/) there and holds lectures and meditations open to the public. (I won’t go into more detail on how Singer did it all, as it won’t do his story justice. I highly recommend reading his [book](https://www.amazon.com/Surrender-Experiment-Journey-Lifes-Perfection/dp/080414110X).)

For leaders, I know the word “surrender” can often make you cringe. I know that as a Type-A, it did for me. But surrender in a spiritual context means accepting and not fighting the flow of life.

**When we talk about surrender, what we are really speaking of is trust in a power bigger than yourself or any other human.**

If we have trust in our lives, we don’t feel the need to try to control every outcome. We trust that we are in the right place, on the right path and that what will happen is meant to happen.

A few notes about trust: **You can’t fake trust. You can’t say you have it and then boom, you do. There’s a technique to it: **When you spend a life living at a vibration lower than your authentic truth, you don’t get any tangible rewards or positive payout for the risks you’re taking. You’ll find the universe sending you increasingly strong signals to readjust. This can be like getting four flat tires in one month, certain patterns of negativity or repeat injuries.

BUT when you spend a life living at your highest vibration, committed to truth and world service, you will find that tangible rewards come flying your way as a result of your trust. You will be more aware and equipped to recognize them in their unique packaging!

**Surrender *doesn’t* mean that we just lay back and let things happen to us.**

**Surrender is all about action.**

Rather than being in our heads and over analyzing every move, we strike when opportunity presents itself. We “know” when to strike not through our analytical minds. We know through our intuitive connection to the universal flow of energy readable through personalized signs and synchronicities.

I recently took on my own Surrender Experiment in building my latest company,[ 1heart](http://1heart.com). 1heart is a collective of companies focused on human and business acceleration. We focus on** building conscious businesses through inspiring, educating and supporting heart-led entrepreneurs. **Nothing about what we are doing is boiler plate. Using traditional planning and projection models is quite difficult.

By intention as well as by default, my co-founder Barry and I found ourselves living our own Surrender Experiment. Without an obvious path for funding and without a linear line to success, we were left to pursue this less travelled route. Both fans of the book and believers in the power of surrender, we accepted the challenge. Six months later, we are still surrendering daily and learning a ton as we go.

**As the people continue to become more conscious, more of us will become open to living in surrender.**

Traditional career and life paths are beginning to disappear for younger generations. People are less able to plan, and by default, must live more in the present. They must learn to be more flexible to change and more open to opportunity. **The Surrender Experiment path offers the ability to create greater alignment between our lives, our work and our self-actualization.**

This path is not easy, but neither are the alternatives. But, this path will teach you to live more in the present moment and be more alive. As people choose this path in increasing numbers, the stories of the daily successes and failures will help others on this journey.

**Here are the most valuable lessons I’ve uncovered for running a successful Surrender Experiment Business (SEB):**

### 1 | You Must Give Up Many Type-A Behaviors

I wrote a previous article titled,[ Why Being a Type-A is a Surefire Way to Lose at Life](https://medium.com/the-mission/type-a-to-type-be-dcc65ff9264f). As someone who considers myself a “recovering Type-A”, I believe this to be true. We are taught that we must set clear goals and lay out detailed plans for our lives and our businesses. As if the “success” that results is a linear progression. You execute according to your plan and achieve your goals. But, you rarely celebrate hitting your goals. Instead, you move quickly on to the next.

While this formula has built successful businesses in the past, building a successful life is another matter. Jumping from goal to goal, always wanting more is a recipe for being discontent. **Plus, the linear paths we set, often early in our lives, are often not the paths our souls desire. **We miss so much living along the way as we remain hyper focused on our next linear goal.

Focus is still important in business. **But, rather than finite goals, think about setting clear intentions. **For instance, an intention we set with one of our companies,[ Guided](http://getguided.co), was to democratize coaching. Our initial product was software-as-a-service (SaaS) that streamlined a coaches workflow. This allowed coaches to coach more people efficiently. But, corporate clients continued to come to us looking for us to bring coaching into their enterprise. We determined we could better democratize coaching by enabling companies to offer “Coaching-as-a-benefit” to all their employees.

Despite a round of funding already lined up, we decided to pass on that funding and pursue this new strategy. We generated revenue immediately in our first month and are close to profitability after just a few more. A pivot or major change in business strategy like this is not uncommon in startups. **What is more uncommon is our detachment from a particular outcome (e.g. closing funding) and deeper focus on our intention. **This allowed us to be open to what the Universe brought to our doorstep and smoothly follow its suggestions.

### 2 | You Must Align with Your Business

Building a SEB requires that you believe. You must believe in yourself, your team and your collective intentions. The deeper these beliefs, the more successful you will be. If your business is not aligned with your who you are at your core, you will find it very difficult to surrender.

In my previous startups, I built two large tech companies in the social marketing space. We worked with large Fortune 1,000 brands. Initially, I aligned with the business as we built a great team of amazing people and built an award winning culture. We were building cool technology on the forefront of marketing. But, I always knew it was not my purpose.

**As my personal and spiritual development advanced, the misalignment grew. **It became harder and harder to come to terms with helping large companies sell unhealthy and unneeded products. I started to desire greater meaning in my work. When my investors asked me to raise another $20MM for the business, my heart sunk. Despite our “success,” I couldn’t do it.

**If the business you are creating is not in alignment, you will not be able to surrender to opportunities that come your way. **These opportunities are pulling you away from your central purpose and not enabling you to live your purpose most fully. The Surrender Experiment will guide you to your highest self, not to selling out on your true self.

### 3 | Your Partners Must be Aligned with You

This likely seems obvious. But, it is perhaps the most prominent challenge you will face in building a SEB. People can be motivated to work with you for all types of reasons. Often in business these reasons revolve around money. Making money is an important intention. Money is the energy that will enable you to build your business and provide for your family.

**A focus on money above other important values will lead you down the wrong path.** In building 1heart, we’ve turned down business opportunities, investment and partners often due to lack of alignment. Recently, we turned down half a million dollars when the investor wanted to tie the investment valuation to hitting financial targets this year.

Nothing could be less SEB than that! This would leave us hyper-focused on a solitary short term goal rather than open to opportunity. A month later, we identified an ever more lucrative opportunity that has already increased the value of our business.

### 4| You Must Trust the Universe

Building a SEB likely requires some sort of spiritual path. This path may not even be something you immediately identify with as spiritual. **What is critical is that you have established a deep trust in the Universe, or something larger than yourself.** This can be a work in progress but needs to be an underlying belief you truly hold.

Many view the word surrender as giving up.

**In spiritual terms, surrender is full trust in a force you cannot experience with your five senses.**

**It is the ability to proceed even though you don’t see the full path or your mind hasn’t worked its way through all the answers.** Ultimately, this is necessary for nearly all entrepreneurs. Without the ability to move forward with uncertainty, we would be continually paralyzed in any startup. Another adequate synonym might be “courage,” and yet surrender is even *more* than courage — It includes an additional level of consciousness that the risk you are taking is grounded in higher truth and soul purpose.

Building a SEB puts trust front and center. **You must believe that the Universe will provide what you need at each stage to continue on with your mission.** You must accept that your mental mind does not always know exactly *what* you need, but that the Higher Power *does* know you better than you know yourself. So, this does not mean you will receive the $1MM you are looking for by the time you believe you need it. Rather, this means that you may discover that you didn’t need that $1MM after all. And, there is a different, and often better path you can pursue.

### 5 | The Universe Will Continually Test You

The Universe isn’t just going to hand you your dreams on a silver platter. You will be tested to see how badly you want them. **The bigger they are, and the closer you get, the more you will be tested.**

Perhaps you are feeling discouraged by this point. Just know that these tests are a good thing. **With each test, you have the opportunity to gain more clarity on your chosen path. **Often these tests serve as readjustments, even small tweaks that open up much larger possibilities.

Or, they may show you that you’ve started down a path that is out of alignment to your purpose. You now have the opportunity to re-align and continue creating from this new place. **Once you begin to understand that this force is working on your behalf, you will learn to welcome it. When you do, you’ll witness magic all around.**

*“Realize a lack of control is what brought you to where you are now in the first place. Don’t hinder your present experience fighting the universe and it’s chaos. You are the universe living itself, so allow it to live you.” — Conner J.*

We are not nearly over the finish line with 1heart, if such a thing even exists. We face daily challenges and many of them are significant. We have seen enough to know that building a SEB is the most rewarding thing we can imagine doing right now. **The personal growth, community and daily impact we are making exceeds all the challenges.**

The implications of more and more businesses learning to operate this way are immense. Rather than following existing formulas that lead to the same business models, we can break free of that. True innovation will come from those entrepreneurs who are most directly connected to Source. To those aligned to their true purpose and in service to something greater than themselves.

**I see a world where conscious, heart-led entrepreneurs use business as a force of good.[ **1heart is focused on accelerating this evolution](https://youtu.be/1Lxw-4Xznwg). We launched [1heart Journeys](http://1heartjourneys.com) to help entrepreneurs along this path through transformational travel experiences around the world. We even offer scholarships to Journeys for entrepreneurs who are on a path to helping humanity through their business.

Our society is undergoing major shifts and the world is becoming much more conscious.

**The implications of more entrepreneurs building businesses aligned with their hearts is massive.** **To do so, we must first get out of our heads and learn to follow the Universal knowledge that only our heart knows.**

# How to Make Complex Things Simple with Shannon Duffy

## 

When Shannon Duffy was just a girl, her friends wanted to play doctor.

She wanted to play advertising agency.

Since then, Shannon knew that she was destined for a career in marketing.

Flash forward to today and she has been a professional marketer for more than 20 years, and has risen to become the Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at Salesforce.

On a recent episode of [Marketing Trends](http://bit.ly/2DF9f55), we had a chance to talk all things marketing with Shannon.

She shared her thoughts on current marketing trends, what it takes to be successful, how to deal with failure, and how to build a great marketing team.

You can find the full episode on [Apple](https://apple.co/2TMSwBK), [Google Play](http://bit.ly/2E4o9lG), or [Spotify](https://spoti.fi/2E3QvfG). Also, don’t forget to subscribe to the Marketing Trends newsletter by visiting [MarketingTrends.com](http://bit.ly/2DF9f55).

## **Her Biggest Inspiration as a Marketer**

How did Shannon know that she wanted to be a marketer from such a young age? Shannon said that she was drawn to marketing because it combined two of her greatest passions: solving problems and connecting to people.

When Shannon hit her teenage years, she got even more inspiration to pursue a career in marketing. It came from an unexpected place.

“In high school, I loved the show *Melrose Place*, and they had an ad agency. They would show the meetings with their clients and the clients would tell them their problem. Even though there was other crazy stuff on the show, the cast would come back and try to solve the client’s problem creatively with messaging, words, and emotions.”

Of course, this was just the beginning of her marketing journey. Now Shannon takes inspiration from her colleagues, peers, and mentors. But she still tries to maintain that heart of emotional connection that she learned from *Melrose Place*.

## **Marketing Then vs. Now**

Over the course of her 20+ year career in marketing, Shannon has seen a lot of change.

In the past, companies developed advertising budgets designed to simply get as much exposure as possible.

Shannon attributes a lot of [Salesforce](https://medium.com/@salesforce)’s success to the fact that their marketing goes above and beyond in showing customers how a product will lead to their success.

“What marketing boils down to is that focusing on your customer’s success leads to your success. You need to take your customers on the journey with the how, and that impacts your content and marketing campaigns.”

Shannon believes that marketing is more than simply showing a product and its features. Instead, it is about finding the emotional core of a product.

“Marketing is how you connect to the emotion of what a product is. And whether it’s a Kodak picture caddie or it’s platform or enterprise software, we’re all looking for that way to make people remember what we’re trying to do.”

## **A Platform For All**

An emotional journey might seem out of place in the world of highly technical B2B sales. And yet Shannon always finds that there is an emotional component to the user experience. She’s doing that right now with the Lightning Platform at Salesforce.

“We view our mission as changing what it means to develop apps and what it means to be a developer. That’s an emotional connection. We want to show anyone regardless of background and education that they can harness technology and build applications.”

Shannon’s approach gets her team excited to come to work every day because they believe in the difference they are making.

## How to Fail Well

With all that said, even experienced marketers like Shannon slip up sometimes. What separates great marketers from the rest of the crowd is their ability to learn from their mistakes. Shannon shared her biggest professional failure with us.

“Someone on my team said ‘We need to do a viral campaign. We need to create an online game where people go into an office and kill each other with staplers.’ We created it, but it took months and way too much money. And we finally saw it, and I showed it to our CEO. And he looked at me, and just said ‘What is this? We’re perpetuating violence, people are throwing staplers… Shannon, what is this?’ ”

Shannon knew immediately that she had made the wrong decision to give the initiative a green light. Her gut had told her from the beginning that this was a bad idea.

“For me, it was a learning experience, because one, I should have trusted my gut. And two, as a marketer you have to be conscious of the world around you. So I will say the one good thing about that is he stopped me, but his questioning of me made me know enough to not fight it. He was right.”

Marketing involves taking risks. And when you take risks, things will inevitably fail from time to time. Shannon believes that marketers should get more comfortable with those failures.

“Marketers, in particular, have a hard time with failure. Because our whole job is to tell the positive story about something. I don’t tell that story about my stapler killing video game very often, because it’s not something we’re comfortable doing, but we would be so much better if we were able to embrace those mistakes as an industry.”

## Keeping Complex Things Simple

As a tech marketer, Shannon has the daunting task of taking complex products and making them easy for the average person to understand. Shannon has developed a relatively simple exercise to help her do this.

“We have meetings with my team where we pitch new messaging or talk about a new concept, and I’ll say, ‘Stop. If I had no context and I was looking at your slide or reading your blog post or looking at this web page, would I understand?’ ”

Doing this exercise regularly helps Shannon avoid using technical language that won’t mean anything to the reader. This leads to more success in terms of consumer engagement.

## Shannon’s Strategy for Building a Marketing Team

Shannon emphasized that being a marketing leader is about more than just doing great work yourself. You have to build a great team around you. Shannon shared some of her secrets to building successful teams.

“When I’m hiring, background is less important to me than looking for people who are collaborative, who are positive, and who are self-starting.”

These inherent traits are much more important to Shannon than specific marketing credentials or technical skills.

“It’s actually better to have more diverse perspectives, people who have lived in different countries, worked in different industries, or maybe don’t even have a traditional marketing background. If they all share that collaborative, positive, self-starting mentality, that’s the best possible thing to do.”

Once you have this team, it is important to enable them to be their authentic selves.
> # “I’ve never seen someone be their authentic self and not be successful.”

# Why You Should Ask A Friend For Advice

## A Call To Be More Vulnerable

![](1*UCorJGZNnQM6IgUo9nqfNA.jpeg)

*Welcome to the **July 8, 2019** edition of Mission Daily Newsletter!*

*If you like this, be sure to explore these topics deeper with Steph and Chad on the “Best of 2018” [Mission Daily Podcast](https://mission.org/missiondaily/)!*

## **Why You Should Ask A Friend For Advice Today**

Dear Reader,

Today I’m going to tell you one out of ~66 stories or so that I’m scared to share publicly.

At Mission HQ, we’re big fans of accelerated learning.

But what is accelerated learning?

Learning about a topic that is vital to you in the best, most effective way possible. 🤓

Unfortunately, our modern society and education system are set up to train individuals on how not to learn. Specifically, what we call “education” is mostly about isolating yourself from the harshest truths of the world. It’s about developing the habit of ceding values like “courage” to other entities and institutions. It trains us to look outward and cast blame, instead of looking inward to accelerate our own learning.

Accelerated learning feels horrible when you first truly believe that it’s possible.

It’s unsettling when you believe you can gain mastery over a subject. After all, what if it’s hubristic to decide we can and should learn everything we can?!

But what if it’s not? 🤔

![](0*G06MYjinvMq-ZqZg)

So often, we get consumed with the idea that in order to find peace and purpose (while also enjoying the pursuit, danger, and play that comes with the journey), we have to give up things we value.

But what if there is a way to accelerate your learning around topics vital to your future without making “traditional” tradeoffs?

Let me tell you a story.

Before I got to Silicon Valley, I had a cartoon in my head about what life and business were all about. I was doing well by outsider standards, but personally, I felt like I was drowning. At one point, I reached out and texted a friend. I asked for advice. I was struggling with something, and it was bothering me. All I needed was his advice on one specific question. He had a vantage point that I didn’t have, and he had enough context to provide a well-reasoned critique.

Maybe you’ve heard the Elon Musk quote that goes something like:

*A well-reasoned critique is worth its weight in GOLD.*

My friend’s response was quick, and in just two minutes I had the answer I needed. What I was personally struggling with isn’t important — just know that if you’re struggling right now, you have at least one person who can provide a well-reasoned critique or vantage point on a subject that you didn’t have.

Also… If you’re really interested in what I was struggling with, you can tune in to today’s episode of Mission Daily ([subscribe](http://bit.ly/2jWLdGQ) to get notified when it’s live!) to hear me open up a bit more. Sidenote: this was really hard to do, but by being open and honest about faults that need to be corrected and that are hurting others, we accelerate our learning.

In the moment before I texted my friend for advice, I was blind. After I had his advice, I could see the problem. It was something I could fix. I had been struggling with it, trying to beat it conventionally, when all I had to do to figure out how to make it better was send a short text.

![](0*kGkAj0sWE3jHHQcc)

That moment shifted my perspective about what is possible.

You don’t know how quickly you’ll be able to accelerate your learning if you don’t ask for advice.

Asking for advice from friends is hard.

But it’s worth it.

If there is anything you’re struggling with right now, that you’re embarrassed to talk about publicly or admit to a friend…

Just ask for advice.

If you need to, ask them for help.

It may make you vulnerable, but without vulnerability, how do you *really* know who is around you?

And more importantly, how do they *really *know you?

If you don’t open up and share things, or ask for advice in a way that makes it clear you’re in trouble and need outside help… you can’t accelerate your learning.

*You can’t accelerate your learning until you ask for advice *([Tweet this](https://ctt.ac/8e0cV)).

### Here’s our daily challenge —

📱😳 Text the person in your life today that you’re closest to. If you dare, ask them for help or advice that is way outside your comfort zone.

Accelerate your learning. In next week’s newsletter, we’re going to be talking about capital allocation and how to learn one central skill that can help you accelerate your learning in any area you choose. Stay tuned! 🤗

# We need more inspiring Storytellers to make the world a better place. Here’s why.

## On self-awareness, empathy, and healing.

![Photo by Harli Marten on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/M9jrKDXOQoU)](1*xOJw5uaZ9SAh9Js-nwQzHg.jpeg)*Photo by Harli Marten on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/M9jrKDXOQoU)*

*‘Storyteller’ *recently began to* *appear on social media in people’s profiles, sometimes even as a job title.

*‘Storytelling skills’* is now a requirement in job descriptions.

Courses and coaches centered on public speaking are spreading.

*Why* is that?
> # Great speakers masterfully use storytelling to achieve their goals: selling products or services, negotiating, influencing, inspiring and uplifting others.

Now, we all get why this skill is more and more important in *professional* life.

But let’s look at it holistically: is a world with more and better Storytellers a *better *world? Isn’t there the risk to have more noise poisoning the signal? Wouldn’t we set ourselves up for more BS, deceiving messages, manipulation?

What would a world with “enhanced storytelling skills” look like?

I believe the development of compelling, inspirational and entertaining communication skills such as storytelling would be a transformational tool that we should collectively leverage. Let me tell you why.

### **Self-awareness**

The ones of us who love public speaking share a common experience: the progressive and incremental self-awareness that comes with practice.

This path generally begins with becoming aware—and then killing— the “*uhm*’s” and the “*so’s”* and the “*you know*’s”, filling words that render a speech choppy and, worst case, make the speaker look hesitant or unprepared.

This is a route that’s paved with trials and errors, recorded rehearsals, embarrassing silences, goosebumps and tears, planned jokes that make nobody laugh… and spontaneous jokes that get a boast of laughter.

As far as I’m concerned, I learned on my own skin that spontaneity is key for me to convey my passion and enthusiasm. If I learn the speech by heart, I lose part of that energy.

More than once while delivering a prepared talk, I forgot the beginning of a sentence and had to endure a 5-second silence… which looked like an eternity.

That’s why I always plan a ‘maneuvering space’ for spontaneity. This applies to my verbiage, to begin with: I rather focus on having a clear structure with a powerful entry and a strong finale, great content throughout, and compelling stories — and I let the words flow. I rehearse the most important parts of the talk to make sure they will hit the target.

I also plan for 10%-15% of ‘buffer time’ in the agenda — to be able to tell a story that just came to mind or to entertain an unplanned interaction with the audience.

But this is just me: others may have different challenges or coping mechanisms.

The beauty is to find out what best fits *you*.

On this journey, feedback is critical. It’s the gift that offers us perspective and constructive insights. Yes, sometimes it’s tough to digest. Particularly if it takes you completely off guard. But if solicited, properly received and acted upon, it becomes the most important device for us to grow, adjust, expand.

In short: openness to feedback, self-reflection, enhancing our coping mechanisms and continuous practice are the cornerstones of the learning experience in public speaking — as for most other skills and arts.

### **Empathy**

With the purpose to impress, inspire, hook and entertain the audience, each Storyteller embarks on a journey of knowing what makes people interested, what catches their attention, and what keeps them focused on the story.

This aspect is easily measurable nowadays by how many in the audience begin typing on their mobile phones while you speak. And that’s when you wish to have Zeus’ power to throw thunders at people. Or it’s when you can read this behavior as feedback…. and ask yourself how you can become a more compelling speaker.

But catching the audience by the brain it’s not enough to have them jump on your bus. There’s an emotional aspect too.

Learning how to better connect with your audience entails as well understanding what touches people’s hearts, what stimulates their fantasy, what intrigues them. In my experience, this is an exciting training field for our ability to be more engaging, empowering, compassionate and empathic.

In this sense, you must anticipate to your audience that they will be leaving the room with tangible information that can help them get one or more of these: success, happiness, inner peace. Then make sure that your content fulfills that promise.

This requires the ability to listen and connect empathically and the desire to deeply understand who sits in front of you. Which takes me to my next point.

### The Healing Power of Storytelling

When people gather in a safe, moderated environment that encourages empathic listening, non-judgmental feedback and peer coaching, they can be stimulated to communicate leveraging the power of their own experiences and peculiar stories.

![A recent night @ the [InSpiral Club](https://www.valerianodonzelli.com/inspiral-club). No electricity that day — but a lot of positive energy.](1*DGBJtOsW3qGngnfVl9j2dw.jpeg)*A recent night @ the [InSpiral Club](https://www.valerianodonzelli.com/inspiral-club). No electricity that day — but a lot of positive energy.*

This is what I regularly experience during the meetings at [InSpiral](https://www.valerianodonzelli.com/inspiral-club), a club I founded two years ago in my city with the purpose to ‘*connect people through storytelling*’.

There are two psychological dynamics that I keep observing during our gatherings and always leave me in a blended state of flow and awe.

On the one hand, the safety net of not being judged for your story and being accepted for who you are.

On the other hand, the beauty of listening with the desire to understand and learn something from a culturally diverse group of people.

When these two conditions are met, people connect at a deeper level and open their hearts — and their minds.

That’s the state in which we all recognize the shared needs of being loved, appreciated, valued, accepted. In this sense, we can all learn from each other’s path. We can all grow both our self-awareness and capacity to empathize. And trust me, this is pure magic.
> # A safe, non-judgmental and compassionate setting fosters the healing power of Storytelling.

It’s healing because, when exposing your scars and vulnerabilities, you feel accepted and valued despite your screw-ups and imperfections. You feel you belong. You can make peace with yourself. You expand your self-love. You transcend the person you were and let your ‘new self’ unfold.

### A better Narrative for the World

You can argue that communication skills can be used as well to deceive, manipulate, distract. Yes, sure: there are and there will still be such situations. So what? You can use a hammer to build or to kill. Yet, hammers made the world a better place to live in. (Excuse the poor similitude… but it popped up now spontaneously — anyway, you get my point).

Imagine a world in which university professors and corporate leaders were all brilliant and inspiring storytellers. Wouldn’t they make schools, universities and workplaces much more interesting places?

Also, if we were to teach the art of Storytelling at school, we would have an opportunity to develop more self-aware and open-minded kids. In fact, we could aim at developing *Truth-tellers.*

The thing is, a world of Storytellers would be much better equipped at spotting non-genuine, manipulative messages. A world less prone to be deceived by false promises, populist proclaims and oratorical techniques.

Because a genuine Story-*teller* is also an empathic, attentive and considerate Story-*listener*.

A world with inspiring Storytellers is more colorful, more joyful, more entertaining — and less dull. It’s a world in which self-awareness, courage, compassion and empathy are *basic *skills.

It’s a world that opens doors to new narratives.

A world that gives language and vision to a better version of Itself.

Isn’t *that *a world you want to be part of?

# How I RE-ENGINEERED My Life&#58; This Will Help You.

## 

I can help you. I’m just a regular guy with a pretty stock standard upbringing.

I hit a massive brick wall and made the decision to take every piece of my life and put it back together in a way that works.

I call this process *“Re-engineering your life.”*

Yep, I like that description a lot.

Many of you have very similar challenges to what I faced and so I want to use storytelling and a few practical strategies to help you.

### Here’s how I re-engineered my life and how you can do the same:

## Dealt with mental health.

Mental health has always been a taboo subject. Last week, on LinkedIn, I came out of the closet. I shared a photo of me in primary school and told my lifelong battle with anxiety.

It wasn’t easy, but it was a must. A few years back I cured myself of my mental health issues.

### You can do the same by using these strategies:

* Admit to yourself that you have an issue (biggest one)

* Seek professional advice to begin with
Put together a list of fears and tackle them one by one (this builds confidence)

* Attend a Tony Robbins Event and walk on fire (helps you see that anything is possible)

* Practice meditation before high-stress events

Overcoming anxiety for me was not easy. It required me to break my comfort-zone and deliberately seek out strategies and practical things I could do. 
Re-engineering your life is about getting your mind in order first.

> # “You can’t get your mind in shape if you have mental health issues like anxiety weighing you down”

Deal with the issues of the mind and you’ll finally be able to see your future clearly and the possibilities that are available to you.

## Believed in myself through persistence.

During the re-engineering process, I wrote down what I was saying to myself. There were lots of insults I was saying to myself. Every time there was a challenge, my mind was telling myself that I couldn’t do it.
> **I had zero belief in myself. I was my own worst enemy. Acknowledgment of this fact changed everything.**

I altered the conversation in my head to *“I can do it and there’s no harm in trying.”*

I deleted the *“I can’t do it talk”* and chose blind optimism and a default response that would set me up to win. Sure there was failures. I tried lots of challenges and failed at most of them.

I went for job interviews and then vomited afterwards from nerves. 
I cried a few times when girls broke up with me.
I got a plane and nearly passed out from fear.

**Through every situation though, I built an inner belief. This voice of positivity in my head got louder and louder.**

The more challenges I tried, the more times I learned a few lessons. These lessons turned into goals that I was able to achieve.

It sounds cliche but believing in yourself is at the center of all transformation. You can’t re-engineer your life unless you believe in yourself.

I’d encourage you to go for blind optimism. It will allow you to fail more and gain much bigger wins. The choice is yours.

## Let go of anger.

All of us are holding anger inside ourselves (except maybe Nelson Mandella — when he was alive). That guy was a legend, but we’re not all Mr. Mandela.

![](1*eygCsPWcD_FQr_8PWQs0dg.jpeg)

I was holding anger from past relationships, an ongoing family feud, neighbors that stole my car spot, the guy that mowed the lawn because he let grass flick up onto my car and even the person in front of me that was walking too slow.

Everyone was consciously my enemy. This was a fucked way to live. 
The anger built up inside of me and it made mediating nearly impossible. The constant chatter in my mind from all the anger never stopped.
> # “Every person I met was violating some BS rule I had in my head that they were supposed to adhere to without knowing what it was”

Many of us are living in denial. We think we’re not storing anger, but we are. 
What did I do? What can you do? Start forgiving people who you’re angry at. Don’t do it to help them; do it to help yourself.
> Set yourself free from negativity by quitting the ‘Anger Games” (did I just turn a movie title into a catchphrase?)

### Practically I did the following:

* Gave the neighbor I was pissed at a lift when it was raining

* Forgave BS family issues from 10 years ago that had nothing to do with me from the beginning

* Stopped caring about the grass hitting my stupid car and washed it

* Showed compassion to strangers rather than wondering why they walked so slow

Re-engineering your life is about forgiving more so you can clear your mind and make room for awesomeness.

## Limiting beliefs about money.

The startup culture of wearing a t-shirt and jeans for the rest of my life and walking over everybody else in pursuit of the almighty dollar screwed up my ideas about what money really was.
> This #StartupLife made me become obsessed with money and the creation of it. I started to believe that I would never have enough money.

![Image Credit: 123rf](1*4XQ7K7j1gTa8NAPOD9zADA.jpeg)*Image Credit: 123rf*

I thought the dream of owning a home was unlikely because my idea of home ownership was a mansion with six bedrooms in the best postcode in Australia.

These beliefs have since changed and I’m now not obsessed with mansions. I’d rather spend money on experiences and holidays. This challenge with money, if I’m being honest, is not entirely fixed and still needs work. Such is life.

### With that said, what changed my beliefs about money was this the following:

* Spending time with the homeless

* Seeing what the regrets of the dying were

* Watching about 50% of my relatives die in a short space of time

* Looking back on when I had lots of money and seeing how unhappy I was

* Working with successful entrepreneurs that sold their businesses and became chronically unhappy

**It’s amazing what real-world situations can do to show you what’s real and what’s not.**

Don’t believe everything Instagram tells you about life through photos. You don’t need all those shiny toys and the wanting of them is distracting you from what matters.

## Felt sick and tired.

Our eating habits can often be forgotten. We’re trained through advertising to see cake, soda and deep fried food as okay.

What changed the game for me was when someone asked me the following:
*“How do you feel Tim? Energy-wise that is.”*

The real answer was tired and sick even though I didn’t want to admit it. Energy is a bonus but feeling sick is where the real problem lies.

You’re not supposed to walk around feeling unwell and having to take tablets from the chemist. Getting real about whether you feel tired is a big step. Once you acknowledge the truth, there are easy ways to fix the problem.

Imagine you felt high on energy every day. How would that make you feel?
It’s a question so many of us can’t answer because we’ve never experienced it. Once you do, you’ll never go back.
> # “Re-engineering your life is about feeling good and having the energy to do what you love — and care for those you love”

## Quit my boring career.

Lots of us are going to work and hating it. We keep doing it because the addiction to money that pays the mortgage on the oversize house we don’t need is too great.

Money can never replace a career where you wake up each day excited to go to work. I’ve left this nightmare of a life where work sucked. I’m sure you have too.

![](1*OdtDk6AosA8BhK6NRotoLQ.png)

When I quit doing work I hated and got closer to my passion for social media, blogging and personal development, I saw a drastic change.

Work became a driver for everything I did outside of work. I was able to marry my career and my passions together. They began to blend into one.
> # “Job dissatisfaction is very common and getting rid of it will make you feel like a new person. It’s not easy though”
> **I did tonnes of interviews.
Got a bunch of rejections. 
Persisted for a long time.**

Most of all, though, I kept taking small steps towards something that I loved. 
That last one was the defining moment for me.

Instantly transferring to your dream career is tough. Taking small steps towards it is much more practical and achievable in the long run.

Re-engineering your life involves doing work you love. Not for the money; for the love of it. Waking up will never be the same when you’ve got to do work you love.

# The Only 8 Words You Need to Motivate You to Take Action

## The Only 8 Words You Need to Motivate You to Take Action
> # *“Press on. Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful (people)with talent. Genius will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.”* — Ray Kroc

The next time you find yourself sitting there gazing at your smartphone, somehow expecting the answers are magically going to come to you, remind yourself first — it never works that way. And second, think of this great line from the movie *Boiler Room*,
> “Motion Creates Emotion”

I say this because the biggest thing that holds all of us back is:

* Indecision

* Complacency

* Sitting still and believe it or not, what may actually be worse…

* Tepid action. Lukewarm, half-hearted, uninspired, simply-not-gonna-get the job done… action.

I’ve seen this manifest itself in my life, and I’ve seen so many very intelligent people’s career dreams crash and burn because they just weren’t persistent enough. They didn’t know the right way to communicate. They thought they were doing the right thing, but they weren’t truly going all-in and giving things maximum effort.

Please don’t make the same mistake. You and I will make mistakes throughout our lives, and we’ll find that we actually improve and learn from those mistakes. But some mistakes tend to compound themselves, making it harder to rise from our feet. And no mistake is more damaging than repeatedly giving a half-ass effort. You must give things maximum attitude and effort if you want to live the life you dream about.

## A Story to Tell

Earlier in my career, I had a manager who genuinely cared about both my personal and professional development. It was more the “tough love” type of encouragement and motivation that I needed.

I was trying to move forward and make progress on some important tasks but I seemed to keep running into the typical red tape that plagues many organizations: Poor responsiveness to communications; multi-tasking and missed deadlines. I wasn’t getting responses. But then again, I was doing virtually everything by e-mail. Maybe an occasional phone call.

When I explained this to my boss, he patiently sat there and listened to everything I had to say. When I stopped talking he asked, “Are you finished? Because here’s my advice:

## GET OFF YOUR ASS AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.”

The point was taken.

It was blunt, somewhat startling, but the exact medicine that I needed. I was doing *something*, but I wasn’t doing enough. Sending emails weren’t as effective as physically getting up and meeting with someone to send the message I needed. The act and art of face-to-face communication was needed for me to complete my work.

It was needed for me to build the vital relationships in the organization with executives and senior-level influencers. It was needed for increased exposure and opportunities that would only help me grow and build confidence.

Sitting behind my computer was getting me nowhere. It’s a story, for sure, but it’s also a microcosm for where so many of us find ourselves all throughout our lives and career.

We complain about not knowing the way.

We complain about not getting a response for that opportunity we want.

We get so complacent when we don’t get what we want, and sometimes we stop right there and don’t think about what could be a more effective way. Far worse, we stop altogether and give up.

## Focus on Taking Action
> *“The only thing worse than starting something and failing… is not starting something.”* — Seth Godin

Part of the pitfall of living in a digital world is thinking that everything is going to come to us as instantly as the delivery of a Direct Message via Twitter. No matter how old you are, think about how truly astonishing it is that someone in Jakarta can send a message that is instantly received by someone in Buenos Aires. Communication, at the speed of now.

There is a way to give your all without burning out. There is a way to meet your obligations without feeling like you’re running around like a chicken with your head cut off. You have to start with planning, but here’s where most people get it wrong: They put together a plan, thinking it won’t change, and then end up terribly disappointed when their plan falls apart.

Life changes and as a result, plans must be modified accordingly. I encourage you to bake in to every plan the **values **that will carry you, enabling you to flourish and sustain you when you think you’ve hit too devastating a setback: Values like persistence, perseverance, hard work, optimism, courage and hope. These things are the bedrock foundation for success.

So what are you waiting for? The world is not going to come to you. There’s too many other qualified people. There’s way more effective ways to get things done that earn results. You can’t just sit around and function at lukewarm. Get inspired. Get fired up. **Get off your ass and make it happen!**

# Never Settle Your Curiosity

## 

The limited time that life provides us with: encourages us to use it well. And whilst using time effectively is a powerful strategy for [working with what you have](http://justincampbellplatt.com/work-with-what-you-have/); often this focus on productivity and usefulness from an early stage can trap many individuals into thinking they should have answers and should work from these answers. Whether you believe that the process of going through university prepares you entirely for your career in finance or thinking that impressing the right people is all that you require in order to progress; you are on an extremely costly path.

You are, in fact, not using time wisely, but simply allowing your fear of the unknown to dictate your decisions. In doing so, you will at first feel as though you are moving through life ahead of others: you will earn more money and will take pride in your feeling of temporary superiority as though you are more adult-like. In this state, as Ryan Holiday writes in his book: [*Ego is the Enemy](https://amzn.to/2JRABHJ)*, ‘we let the ego tell us we have graduated, learning grinds to a halt.’ This is extremely dangerous and its limit can serve you a future of regret and stagnation which will create a sense of untapped potential when your later maturity settles in.

Instead, you should use time wisely by seeking to be dumbfounded: to be present in a room where you are the least knowledgeable person. You must continually unlearn what you have learnt in order to accept new truths. The [resistance of new reality shifts](http://justincampbellplatt.com/improv-strategy/) stems from the fact that we tie confidence in ourselves so tightly to the understanding of truths. But true progression requires you to rid yourself of such a congealment. Security should not be found in structure — but in constant adaption. And despite common belief, to stand still when everything around you is moving - hardly sounds like security. As Robert Greene writes in [*Mastery](https://amzn.to/2LPcdUD)*, you should ‘be relentless in your pursuit for expansion. Whenever you feel like you are settling into some circle, force yourself to shake things up and look for new challenges.’

Make it your life strategy to never settle your curiosity. Allow yourself to dive deep into the pool of knowledge. [Read books that have you in awe](http://justincampbellplatt.com/books-for-life/) page after page, listen (as opposed to giving a speech) to those you struggle to keep along with and whom intellectually challenge you, and seek out challenges as though they are your oxygen supply. As you do this, you will become more and more restless when placed in a position with limited sources of new knowledge. Your mind will creatively find ways to fight you out of that corner and back into the wilderness of wisdom. For this wisdom is endless, and by understanding that, you will evolve many times more than you may have previously thought possible.

# How To Answer “What Your Greatest Weakness?” In A Job Interview

## 

You’re going to get asked.

At some point in the interview process, whether it’s first round or further down in the sequence, you’re going to get asked questions about your strengths and weaknesses. Whether the interview is going well or going poorly, you can count on running into the question “What would you say is your greatest weakness?” And not having a good answer prepared can make a good interview suddenly start to go very poorly.

So what does a good answer look like?

Well before we answer that, it’s important to understand WHY this question is asked so much. An interviewer isn’t just throwing out this question because it’s on a list of “top interview questions” they found online. If they ask you this question, it’s likely for one of two reason (if not both). First, they’re wanting to get a feeling for your level of self-awareness. Do you actually know yourself well enough to know your weaknesses? And second, if they manage a team, they’re looking to see how your potential answer would fit into the team they already have. It’s okay to have certain weaknesses if most of the team is strong in that area…but a relatively minor weaknesses might be a deal killer if everyone on the team is also weak there.

When we take these two reasons into consideration, we immediately see why trite advice like “turn a strength into a weakness” is such bad advice. No one believes “I’m a perfectionist” or “I work too hard” is a serious answer anyway, but more importantly it doesn’t help the interviewer with either of the aspects they’re looking for.

So the best answer is an honest one. Not a job-killing honest one like “I struggle with deadlines” when you know ahead of time the job involves working under a time crunch…it’s better to just not apply for the job. But an honest answer that demonstrates you know where you add value and you know where you need develop.

But after your honest answer, follow up with a simple phrase: “But I have learned…” and then go one to mention what you’re doing to work around that weakness or to personally improve upon in.

An honest answer and an honest attempt at bettering oneself.

These things tell your interviewer that you’re self-aware enough to know your weakness, and serious enough to work to improve it. They also let him or her know how you’ll fit onto the team. That’s what interviewers are looking for when they ask “What’s your greatest weakness?” and that’s what you’re looking for when you prepare your answer.

# Startup Lesson #6&#58; The art of focus

## By Richard Reis

*Recently, I started building an app, [Gurgeh](https://www.gurgeh.com/). **Every week I learn something new **(this is a common feeling among founders). So I decided to share my weekly lessons in the hopes that (1) I don’t forget them and (2) they help you on your own journey.*

Do you have trouble focusing because the world is full of distractions? Me too.

Personally, I find the worst type of distraction is the one that **makes you feel productive**.

What’s that you say?

Imagine you’re working on a project (in my case, [Gurgeh](https://www.gurgeh.com/)). You know what your focus should be (in my case, [iterating to perfection](https://medium.com/the-mission/startup-lesson-5-iterate-to-perfection-14ab1a3757e)).

**This is simple, but not easy.**

Because it’s not easy, the first thing you do is **look for distractions**.

And since you don’t want to admit you’re distracted (or procrastinating), you **look for distractions that seem productive**.

Here are two examples that **actually happened to me last week**:

### Example #1: Libra

Since I’m building a finance app, it’s obvious Facebook’s project [Libra](https://libra.org/en-US/) caught my eye.

*“What if users can send money using Gurgeh?” *I thought. *“I could build a faster, cheaper, and global Venmo!”*

Sounds like a fun idea.

In fact, I had a lot of fun reading Libra’s [documentation](https://developers.libra.org/docs/welcome-to-libra), playing with [their tutorials](https://developers.libra.org/docs/my-first-transaction), and browsing [the forum](https://community.libra.org/).

This was a waste of time.

It was **procrastination that made me feel productive**.

Why? Because guess how many users asked me for a Libra implementation?

Zero.

### Example #2: Augmented Reality (AR)

Last week, I saw Tommy Collison’s [tweet](https://twitter.com/tommycollison/status/1143353740012871680) about the Gyroscope app’s AR feature on Twitter.

How cool does that look?? Pretty sweet right?

*“What if I add AR to Gurgeh?”* I thought. *“People could see (in AR) how much money is safe to spend today, this week, and this month!”*

Sounds like a fun idea.

In fact, I had a lot of fun going through [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/) and [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)’s AR videos.

Again, this was a waste of time.

Just another **procrastination that made me feel productive**.

Why? Because guess how many users asked me for an AR feature?

Zero.
> # “Everybody loves the idea of focus. But what focus actually means is shooting stuff you love and turning down things you know you can make work.” — [Drew Houston](https://youtu.be/U_g-fBfPOF8)

![[source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/c7ru5b/distracted_app_developer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)](1*xhkMZRu_bb638UKYd3g4DQ.jpeg)*[source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/c7ru5b/distracted_app_developer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)*

### How to focus: Say no

The day I killed my social life, I believed I got the *“focused”* certification because *“focus means just working on my project.”*

I was wrong.

Truly, focus is about **saying no **(this includes saying no to all the mini side projects within your project!)

My users didn’t ask for an AR feature or a Libra implementation.

What did they ask for? The **ability to add ALL their bank accounts (including credit unions)**.

… That’s it.

But this is **super **hard to implement! I admit it. Hence why I was playing around with AR and Libra.

*Mea culpa*. I won’t do that again.

### A little gift for you

Below are a few of my favorite quotes on focus.

I couldn’t pick just one to end this post with, so **you get them all**!

I’m sure one of these will speak to you more than the others. Remember it.
> # “You have to have a real single-minded kind of tunnel vision if you want to get anything significant accomplished.” — [Steve Jobs](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a11185/second-coming-of-steve-jobs-1286/)
> # “I stopped listening to music and watching TV in my 20s. It sounds extreme, but I did it because I thought they would just distract me from thinking about software.” — [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Headspace-Guide-to-Meditation-and-Mindfulness)
> # “‘No’ is really really important. […] To really understand what you’re doing, you have to say ‘no’ a lot. […] That narrows in exactly what you need to do. And you’ll know whether you’re successful or not because you focused solely on this one thing.” — [Tony Fadell](https://youtu.be/IYj5X_dE2U8?t=659) (on what he learned from Steve Jobs)
> # “Focus intensely on the things that do matter. Every day, figure out what the 2 or 3 most important things for you to do are. Do those and ignore other distractions. Be a relentless execution machine.” — [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/startup-advice-briefly)

And that’s it for today!

See you next week.

Be well.

# The power of moonshot thinking

## 

In September 1962, President John F. Kennedy stood before a packed Rice University stadium and pledged to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to the Earth before the decade was out. “We choose to go to the Moon,” he said, “not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.”

At the time, this pledge was a moonshot — literally and figuratively. The Americans were lagging severely behind the Soviets in the space race. Much of the technology required for the Moon landing didn’t exist. JFK admitted as much: The giant rocket to take the astronauts to the Moon, he explained, would be “made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch . . . on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body.”

Yes, even the *metals *required to build the rocket hadn’t been invented.

We jumped into the cosmic void and hoped we’d grow wings on the way up. And grow those wings, we did. In 1969, less than seven years after Kennedy’s pledge, Neil Armstrong took his giant leap for mankind.

As astronaut, and later commander of Apollo 13, Jim Lovell put it, “It wasn’t a miracle. We just decided to go.”

In our personal lives, we equate moonshots with miracles. We pause to launch a new business because we think we don’t have what it takes. We hesitate to apply for a promotion, assuming that someone far more competent will get it. We don’t ask someone on a date if they seem out of our league.

If Kennedy were doing the same thing — if he were looking to stay within his league — his pledge would have been very different (and far more boring): “We choose,” he may have said, “to put humans in Earth orbit and make them circle round and round — not because it’s easy — but because it’s doable given what we have.”

I get it: There’s far more uncertainty in moonshots than in small bets. Once you decide to abandon the comfort of the center and the warmth of the crowds, once you decide to explore the edges, you might fail. You might make a fool out of yourself. People might even point at you and laugh.

Do it anyway.

Take comfort in Rumi’s wisdom that the path will appear once you start to walk out on the path. Once you pursue the extraordinary, you’ll rise above the stale neural pathways that dominate ordinary thinking. If you persist — and learn from the inevitable failures that will follow — you’ll eventually grow the wings you need to soar.

All moonshots are miracles. Until you decide to go.

# Place Your Bets&#58; Industries Most Likely To Score Big In Sports Gambling

## 

While sports enthusiasts living in Nevada have enjoyed wagering on their favorite teams for years, fans in the rest of the United States were unable to take part in the fun.

That is, until now.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s monumental decision to strike down a long-standing federal law opens up sports betting to the rest of the country. And although regulations are currently set on a state-by-state basis, the expectation of imminent federal control means we’re on our way to legalized wagering on sports events across the entire nation.

As new gambling platforms are being developed, a wide range of industries are well-positioned to benefit greatly from the massive revenue potential in this marketplace.

### **1. Fantasy Sports**

New opportunities abound in this sector. From opening proprietary sportsbooks and developing betting apps to entering into partnerships with casinos, sports bars, and media companies, fantasy sports enterprises are ready to meet the increasing demand resulting from nation-wide legalized betting. While there are two clear leaders in this space, DraftKings and FanDuel, it’s likely that new players will emerge as the market expands.

### **2. Casinos**

Deals are being signed quickly through partnerships with casinos, as gaming brands scramble to lead the rising U.S. sports betting market. Kindred Group is pursuing a Casino Service Industry Enterprise License in New Jersey via an agreement with Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City, while Canadian company The Stars Group and Atlantic City’s Resorts Casino Hotel extended their existing partnership to add online and mobile sports betting through European wagering brand BetStars. And the list goes on from there, as unprecedented deals continue to be solidified at a rapid pace.

### **3. Sports Bars and Restaurants**

And how about restaurants and bars? Eager to join the excitement, restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings entered into a partnership with Daily Fantasy Sports giant DraftKings to develop a customized fantasy football game in every one of its 1,200+ locations as a method to solidify its place as the go to destination for sports betting once it becomes legal across the country. Clearly illustrating the potential of legalized national wagering, sports bars and restaurants hold the cards to a massive new revenue stream.

### **4. Social Media**

Sports betting and social media go hand-in-hand. With a smartphone in the pockets of practically everyone, an increasing number of people are likely to follow games on mobile. Social media is now an essential tool in making an educated pregame and in game wager. Every gambler wants to win, and analyzing the insights available on social networks can make a major difference in the size of your wallet at the end of the day. Additionally, a significant number of online sportsbooks and other companies are now using social media platforms as a marketing and advertising tool, thereby creating yet another revenue stream with the potential for massive expansion.

### **5. Media Companies and TV**

After the Supreme Court decision was announced, billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said he believed the value of professional sports franchises were doubled as a result of the ruling. Although some may consider this hyperbole, there are others who think the statement was too low, with predictions that the amount of cash about to hit the sports gambling market is actually being underestimated. The related opportunities for media and television companies are enormous, as a 2016 Nielsen Sports study found that although sports betters composed just 25% of the NFL viewing audience, they accounted for 47% of the time spent watching games. If you have money riding on a game, you’re likely to watch more than twice as much as non-gamblers. And the media industry is listening. ESPN recently launched the first gambling-focused show, featuring experts picking their top 10 bets. FS1 went a step further by launching a daily sports gambling show called “Lock It In” with known betting personalities. Another concept involves in-game micro-wagering, which is expected to grow exponentially as states adopt sports gambling. However, current delays between the place where an event is happening and the place where the event is being televised prevent the possibility of play-by-play wagering. It’s expected that technology firms will quickly develop real-time picture-and-sound transmission to allow this expansive revenue potential to be realized.

### **6. Construction and A/V Industry**

Many people believe that sports betting will mark a rebirth of Atlantic City. A/V integrators will be a vital part of the technological solutions required to accommodate this expanding market. The need for installation of LEDs, suites, and loge seating at existing casinos may grow quickly as a result of the Supreme Court decision. The industry also sees a strong correlation between a more engaging video and audio experience in stadiums and the future of sportsbooks, leading to a range of tech opportunities for this sector. In particular, consumer demand will drive casinos to build sportsbooks to accommodate the betting public.

### **7. Sports Leagues, Teams and Associations**

In July, MGM Resorts International announced its agreement with the NBA to become the league’s first sports betting partner. The deal enables the casino chain to use teams’ official names, logos and data streams in its hotels. At a price of at least $25 million, according to an ESPN report, the three-year contract may be a sign of deals to come in other sports.

Although the NHL does not openly support sports betting, the Las Vegas Golden Knights have recently become the league’s first team to announce a sports betting partnership with William Hill, the world’s leading sports book operator. “Like the Vegas Golden Knights, William Hill US is a proud ‘Vegas Born’ organization. This partnership between a major professional team and a sports book operator is a historic, landmark agreement and we are delighted to be leading the way with William Hill in this space,” said Vegas Golden Knights President Kerry Bubolz. The new partners plan to engage with bettors via all kinds of media, advertising and promotional platforms. Though the NFL has publicly stated that is does not support the sports betting industry, the Dallas Cowboys have become the first team to announce a gambling partnership with WinStar World, a Tribal casino.

### **8. Sports Venues**

Why fly to Vegas when you can place your bets just outside of New York City? The Meadowlands Racetrack, located in the complex where the New York Giants and New York Jets play, marks the fourth sports betting outlet to open in New Jersey following the Supreme Court ruling. In addition to offering convenience, fan engagement with the games they watch is also expected to greatly increase as a result.

There you have it. As a growing number of industries seek their piece of the revenue pie, sports betting is on its way to being a central component of a fresh landscape, with innovators devising new monetization streams as we speak.

What are your thoughts about the creation or enhancement of other industries due to sports betting? Please share your opinions in the comments below.

# F*** Hustle&#58;

## 7 Reasons Hustle is Bad Advice

![](1*Ai_n3LFlxMCDMiIv1IScHg.jpeg)

*For a deeper discussion of these seven points and more, listen to: [Fuck Hustle with Christopher Lochhead](https://lochhead.com/fuck-hustle-with-christopher-lochhead/).*

Hustle, hustle, hustle.

This is arguably the top piece of success advice you hear today.

Entrepreneurial porn stars like Grant Cardone, Tai Lopez, and Gary Vaynerchuk, love to pontificate at the church of hustle.

Vaynerchuk says hustle is [“the most important word ever”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIJElPStJpg).

Cardone sells a “hustle muscle” [lime green wrist band on his website](https://store.grantcardone.com/products/hustle-muscle-wristband).

I wish I was making this up!

And Tai Lopez says, [“hustle until the haters ask if you are hiring”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4nlisxYlUQ).

I call bullshit. Here are 7 reasons why:

## 1) Hustle is a “no shit Sherlock”.

Success requires working hard.

Duh.

Telling people they are going to have to work hard to be a success is like telling people who want to lose weight, they are going to have to eat less.

You know it. I know it.

We all read Malcolm Gladwell when he told us it takes 10,000 hours to master something.

Everyone already knows it.

Success takes hard work.

Sure there are trustafarians whose parents give them a ton of money and therefore they don’t have to work hard.

And some people win the lottery.

But, the vast majority of people who achieve any kind of success had to earn it.

## 2) Hamsters hustle

![](1*ghedCZvykmVuBfvemVl5pg.jpeg)

People confuse activity and results.

Hamsters hustle.

And they never get anywhere.

The seminal question is, does the work I do produce meaningful results that create value or am I spinning my wheel?

## 3) Work smart, not hard

My friend, Pat Hiban, host of [The Real Estate Rockstars podcast](https://hibandigital.com/) makes the distinction between “horizontal” and “vertical” income.

This is something most of us didn’t learn in school.

Vertical income is money you have to do something for.

Sell car, make commission.

Punch clock, collect paycheck.

The vast majority of us get trained in this. We trade labor for pay.

The hustle pushers think the pathway to success is more work.

Horizontal income is money you make from investments.

You make one smart investment, and it pays you over and over again. I like to say it’s horizontal because you can get paid lying down!

[On my podcast](https://lochhead.com/pat-hiban/), Pat makes the argument that true financial freedom comes when you can pay your living expenses with horizontal income.

Thus, you don’t have to do any labor to pay for your lifestyle.

The hustle pushers often forget to mention that smart investments can get you out of the “hard work” rat race.

## 4) Don’t Hustle, Niche Down

In the movie “There’s Something About Mary”, there is a scene where the Ben Stiller character picks up a crazed hitchhiker — played by the legendary comedian Harland Williams.

As the vignette plays out, Williams’ a would-be entrepreneur who enthusiastically pitches his captive audience the can’t-miss business idea: a “7-Minute Abs” video that he is convinced will outsell the popular “8-Minute Abs” workout.

A no-brainer, right? Right?

A skeptical Stiller responds with: “That’s good — unless, of course, somebody comes up with ‘6-Minute Abs.’

Then you’re in trouble, huh?”

At which point, the hitchhiker and would-be entrepreneur starts convulsing in the passenger seat.

Most people and most businesses have a 7-Minute Abs strategy. They think they can win by playing a comparison game.

They compete.

And the hustle hucksters tell you, you just need to compete harder. Win at all costs. Do what your competition won’t to win the business/deal/job.

The most successful people differentiate themselves.

They proactively position themselves in a niche they can dominate.

They don’t compete in any traditional sense. They work smart to become known for a niche they can own.

## 5) There is a “burnout crisis”

According to Gallup, [44 percent of people reported feeling burned out sometimes](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/14/5-ways-workers-can-avoid-employee-burnout.html) and 23 percent reported feeling burned out very often or always.

And employee burnout costs [US corporations up to $190 Billion in healthcare spending](https://hbr.org/2017/04/employee-burnout-is-a-problem-with-the-company-not-the-person), according to the Harvard Business Review.

## 6) The entrepreneur mental health crisis

Recently I did [a podcast episode](https://lochhead.com/startup-founders-mental-health/) inspired by a post written by VC [Jake Chapman](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/30/investors-and-entrepreneurs-need-to-address-the-mental-health-crisis-in-startup-culture/) on this topic.

It turns out that entrepreneurs are:

* 2X more likely to suffer from depression

* 6X more likely to have ADHD

* 3X more likely to suffer from substance abuse

* 10X more likely to experience bipolar disorder

* 2X more likely to have a psychiatric hospitalization

* 2X more likely to have suicidal thoughts

Given this reality, telling entrepreneurial people to “hustle” more seems downright reckless.

## 7) Workaholics are not heroes

More than half of American office workers (58 percent) say they check their work email while still in bed after waking up and [48 percent consider themselves workaholics](https://nypost.com/2019/02/01/almost-half-of-americans-consider-themselves-workaholics/).

When did this become a badge of honor?

And making matters worse, [Americans only use about half of their vacation time](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/us-workers-to-forfeit-half-their-vacation-time-this-year.html).

Only 23 percent of employees take off all of the time they’ve earned, and nearly 10 percent take no paid time off at all, according to Glassdoor.com.

We’ve become a live-to-work society.

We’ve gotten life backward.

How often do you hear, “I’ll relax when I retire”?

I have to admit. I used to fall into this trap all the time.

What did I learn?

When you’re working 60–80 hours a week and 51.5 weeks a year, you cannot be good at your job.

Period.

Because you’re fried.

And you’re probably not exercising enough.

And you’re probably not eating well.

And there is no way you can be caring for the people and relationships you value in your life.

Just sayin’.

It’s time to fuck hustle.

It’s time to start thinking about how to design a life that works.

A 360-degree life.

With the right cocktail mix of work, relationships, experiences, and wellbeing.

# How Joining A Peer Or Mastermind Group Can Change Your Life

## 

The path to successful entrepreneurship is never straight and narrow, but I think the tipping point for many company founders comes when business as usual just isn’t working anymore. To grow, to expand — maybe even just to stay alive — means radical change.

For me, that moment came in 2011. I was running a small affiliate marketing company, [Acceleration Partners](http://www.accelerationpartners.com/), doing almost everything myself, and close to burning out. Though the company had just reached $1 million in sales, I was at a critical inflection point. Should I keep my business the same size and simply make a good living? Or, should I focus on building something bigger that could have more enterprise value and impact?

I was torn.

I told people and myself that I really didn’t want to have to manage people or deal with the bureaucracy that inevitably comes with more headcount and processes. I liked being entrepreneurial, I enjoyed having flexibility, and I wanted to focus on outcomes for my clients and be paid on performance. But, while all of this was true, I also harbored some doubts about my own ability to lead and take my business to the next level.

Fortunately, around that time, I joined the [Entrepreneurs’ Organization](http://eonetwork.org/) (EO), a global network of 12,000 entrepreneurs that enables business owners to learn from each other. In a monthly EO forum with a group of 7–10 peers, I began sharing my business challenges and opportunities. Sharing my personal doubts and fears — and finding others who could share their life lessons — opened my eyes to how much I could learn from those on the road ahead of me and enabled me to face my challenges head-on. I ultimately decided to get out of my comfort zone and try to grow my business.

I brought on a №2 and began to focus on creating a business I would want to come to every day.
> # My goal for Acceleration Partners was to find a better way — no more business as usual.

So, I committed early to challenging accepted principals around hiring, [compensation](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/302743), remote work, and [employees’ departures](https://hbr.org/2017/09/as-your-company-evolves-what-happens-to-employees-who-dont). I wanted my company to be about merit, performance, and [shared values.](https://www.slideshare.net/AccelerationPartners/acceleration-partners-culture-deck)

Six years later, Acceleration Partners has a full management team, and I have fired myself from every position that is not making the best use of my time and energy. I have hired smart people, coached them, and gotten out of their way. Our annual revenues have surpassed $10 million — with no outside funding and we are nearing 100 employees.

Outside of my main business, I am a husband and father of three and an author and speaker on performance marketing, company culture, and business growth. I also recently published my first book, [*Performance Partnerships](http://www.performance-partnerships.com/)*, an in-depth look at the affiliate marketing industry, and I am in the process of completing my second book, due to be released next year.

This has been possible because I took some good advice and spent the majority of my time on company culture and strategy. My team and I embraced and operationalized a deep set of core values, created a vivid long-term vision, developed a world-class hiring process, and implemented other operational systems that have allowed us to scale. We also decided to try and change the way people leave companies through a program we call [Mindful Transition](https://www.robertglazer.com/mindful-transition/).

Personally, I am happier, healthier, and more engaged with my family — even as I am reaching new heights in my business. None of this would have been possible without pushing myself outside of my comfort zone, raising expectations for myself, and challenging many of my self-limiting beliefs. For this, I needed help and guidance from many different people in my life — so now I am hoping to pass that kind of help forward.

Through this column, I hope to inspire difficult conversations, soul searching, and efforts to overcome the kinds of self-limiting beliefs that inherently hold businesses and their leaders back from reaching their full potential. I have made a lot of mistakes on my business journey. My team and I have hired the wrong people, failed to cut our losses, lost our focus, grown too quickly, acted too late with team members we outgrew, and more. But we continually focus on learning from our mistakes; we adjust quickly, and we move forward.

In future columns, I will share my personal challenges along with my business successes and failures in the hopes that others can learn from my experiences — much the way I learned from the other owners in my business group.

# 3 Types Of Books That Offer Better Advice Than Typical Leadership Books

## 

When it comes to leadership, you want a broad education.

And when I say “education,” I mean it in a sense that’s distinct from training. The concepts often get blurred, but training is about learning how to do specific things well.

You can take a training course in public speaking, or learn how to choose your words for maximum effect. Those are tactical things you can do to be a better leader. But that’s not the same as an education.
> # Education is about broadly increasing your capacity to learn, and it may not be immediately practical.

Think of it as learning to look at ideas from different angles, examining them and gaining new perspectives.

You’re creating questions, not answers.

In this sense, an education has more to do with the liberal arts-style learning than it does with books or courses specifically on leadership or business. In order to build this type of broad education, you need to look beyond the standard reading.

Here are the three types of books I’d recommend for giving yourself that education:

## **1. Biographies**

The reason biographies are so helpful is because they allow us to develop models in our head.

You get the opportunity to use the lives and experiences of people throughout history to help guide your own conceptions of who you want to be — or don’t want to be. It’s a chance to learn from the successes and mistakes of others, as you get to see the nuance to all the choices people in power had to make. And you notice the trade-offs that went into some of the most celebrated decisions we still talk about today.

### Eventually, you realize the complex interplay inherent in different complicated situations.

While people tend to worship the sheer will that drives great things, they’re often disgusted when they learn of the inner machinations and compromises that it took to make it happen.

[***The Years of Lyndon Johnson](https://www.amazon.com/Years-Lyndon-Johnson-Book/dp/B00WTILZEQ)*** by Robert Caro is a great example of this dichotomy. Johnson is a president who did many positive things during his presidency — passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and his Great Society efforts — but who also became known for the United States’ involvement in Vietnam. He’s a complex character who is easy to hate and admire at the same time.

But that complexity is exactly what’s important when it comes to studying people and learning from their lives.

## **2. Historical Accounts**

These accounts aren’t exactly biographies, but they provide a similar benefit. I find there’s a lot of value in reading about huge management projects or pivotal moments in history.
> # You may never find yourself working on something as complex and important as the Apollo missions or the atomic bomb, but that doesn’t mean you can’t learn anything from those projects.

As you read more and more historical accounts, in combination with what you learn about individuals from biographies, you’re inevitably going to take some of those lessons to heart.

When situations arise in your own life that require an ability to lead others and accomplish difficult goals, you’ll have a set of examples you’ve internalized that you can use to help guide you.

Here are a few recommendations to get you started:

* [*Nothing like it in the World](https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Like-World-Transcontinental-1863-1869/dp/0743203178)* by Stephen Ambrose

* [*The Path Between the Seas](https://www.amazon.com/Path-Between-Seas-Creation-1870-1914/dp/0671244094/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1536094202&sr=1-1&keywords=the+path+between+the+seas+by+david+mccullough) *by David McCullough

* [*The Making of the Atomic Bomb](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes/dp/1451677618/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1536094226&sr=1-1&keywords=the+making+of+the+atomic+bomb)* by Richard Rhodes

* [*Apollo, the Race to the Moon](https://www.amazon.com/Apollo-Race-Moon-Charles-Murray/dp/0671611011)* by Charles A. Murray and Catherine Bly Cox

## **3. Novels**

Reading fiction gives you a chance to understand human nature, relationships, motivations. Novels wrestle with some of the great questions regarding life and death that people have struggled with throughout history.

They allow you to hear someone’s thoughts and experience their feelings as they navigate a certain situation. You get insight into their motivations and the complexity behind them.

### I think when you take all of it together, reading novels can raise your emotional IQ and encourage more empathy for those around you.

Take [*Remains of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/Remains-Day-Kazuo-Ishiguro/dp/0679731725/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1536094367&sr=1-3&keywords=remains+of+the+day)* by Kazuo Ishiguro, for example. The overarching theme is based on regret. The main character struggles to justify an action that he felt was right at the time — but which he eventually begins to doubt.

Jeff Bezos mentioned this book in an interview, and said of it:
> “If you read “The Remains of the Day,” which is one of my favorite books, you can’t help but come away and think, I just spent 10 hours living an alternate life and I learned something about life and about regret. You can’t do that in a blog post.”

Similarly, [*Things Fall Apart](https://www.amazon.com/Things-Fall-Apart-Chinua-Achebe/dp/0385474547/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1536094532&sr=1-1&keywords=things+fall+apart+by+chinua+achebe)* by Chinua Achebe is a novel I read recently that had a real impact on me. Obama suggested this in his list of recommendations this year, and it’s the most widely read novel from Africa. The main theme is the role of fate in our lives and the power of adhering to principles in light of a changing world.

Finally, although this isn’t a novel, I’d also recommend *The Purloined Letter* by Edgar Allan Poe. It’s one of those stories that stuck with me from the moment I read it as a kid. Essentially, the advice within is to always look for the obvious — what’s missing is often right in front of your face.

I’m not sure many of the lessons in these books would have made as much of an impact if someone had simply told me them directly.

**The story that conveys the lesson is part of what makes it so powerful.**

That’s really why books are such great tools for educating yourself and becoming a better leader. You tend to internalize the messages better, and you get more nuance and subtlety than you’ll likely find in any training course.

# 3 Extraordinary WWII Heroines Who Changed History and Inspired Us All

## 3 Extraordinary WWII Heroines Who Changed History and Inspired Us All

What makes someone a heroine?

Saving lives? Doing the right thing in spite of great risk, even at the expense of one’s own safety?

The following three women all fit this description to a tee. They were normal women placed in extraordinary circumstances, who rose to the occasion and changed the world:

## [Irena Sendler](http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/righteous-women/sendler.asp%20): [Angel of the Warsaw Ghetto](http://www.pbs.org/program/irena-sendler/%20)
> “Every child saved with my help and the help of all the wonderful secret messengers..is the justification of my existence on this earth, and not a title to glory.”

Irena Sendler was a Polish social worker who was not yet 30 when World War II broke out in her country.

She watched as the German Nazis took over Poland and established the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw. With hundreds of thousands of residents crammed into a tiny space, people began dying of the poor hygienic conditions.

As a non-Jewish social worker, Irena Sendler convinced officials to allow her inside the ghetto to treat the people within. Sendler risked her own life to smuggle children out of the ghetto, using false identity papers to smuggle the children abroad.

Sendler kept careful track of the identities of each of the children, writing them down on paper and securing them in a jar which she buried underground.

When Sendler’s activities were discovered in 1943, she was imprisoned and tortured by officials. But Sendler resolutely kept her mouth shut.

Finally, Sendler was sentenced to execution for her “criminal activities” and only rescued at the last minute by friends in the underground resistance movement.

Yet when she was freed, Sendler didn’t go home: She returned to her underground activities and was forced to go into hiding.

Sendler and her colleagues rescued, in total, at least 2,500 Jewish children over the course of their smuggling activities.

For decades after the war, Sendler’s efforts were hidden from the public eye as she lived a private life in Warsaw. Then in the late 1990s, a group of high school students in rural Kansas were challenged by their history teacher to take on an independent project.

The students discovered Irena’s story and were stunned that they had never heard of her before, considering her incredible impact on the lives of thousands of children and families during the Holocaust.

Even more incredibly, when the students tried to track down Irena Sendler’s grave, they discovered that she was still alive!

The students wrote an original play based on Irena Sendler’s story, called “Life in a Jar” and flew to Poland to meet Sendler in person.

Partly through the efforts of the Kansas students, Sendler was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize twice, in 2007 and 2008. Finally, nearly six decades after her heroic actions, Irena Sendler was discovered and honored for her part in saving the lives of thousands of innocent children.

Irena Sendler passed away in 2008 at the age of 98, and her story was retold on film, in *The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler, *which came out in 2009.

## [Corrie Ten Boom](https://www.biography.com/people/corrie-ten-boom-21358155): [Guardian of the Hiding Place](http://tenboom.org/aboutthetenboomsc48.html)
> “The measure of a life, after all, is not its duration, but its donation.”

Corrie Ten Boom was the daughter of a Christian Dutch watchmaker who, along with their family, saved the lives of many war refugees — mostly Jews — by hiding them in a secret room.

During the war, food was scarce, and only non-Jewish Dutch citizens were allowed to have ration cards, required for obtaining food coupons. Ten Boom, however, acquired a hundred extra ration cards and distributed them to every Jew she met.

The Dutch Resistance heard of Ten Boom’s family and helped them build a secret room and safety buzzer to aid their work of rescuing Jews and other war refugees.

In 1944, Corrie Ten Boom and her family were betrayed by a Dutch informant, and arrested. Corrie’s father died not long after. The six refugees that the Ten Booms were hiding at the time, however, were all able to escape.

Corrie and her sister Betsie were sent to a concentration camp, and then to a women’s labor camp in Germany, where they rallied their fellow prisoners’ spirits by holding secret Bible studies with a Bible she had managed to smuggle in. Betsie died in Germany, but Corrie was released not long after, due to a clerical error.

Once she returned home, Corrie Ten Boom opened her home to mentally disabled people, who had been targeted for extinction by the eugenics-obsessed Nazis.

After the war, Ten Boom set up a rehabilitation center in the Netherlands for Dutch citizens who had collaborated with the Germans during the German occupation. In 1950, the center was open to anyone who needed care.

Corrie Ten Boom later traveled internationally in more than 60 countries, telling her story and inspiring others with her message of faith and forgiveness. She also wrote a best-selling book about her family’s experience during the war, *The Hiding Place*, which was also made into a film in 1975.

Corrie Ten Boom passed away in 1983, and a sequel film titled *Return to the Hiding Place *was released in 2013, based on the story of the Dutch resistance, from the perspective of Hans Poley, one of the Ten Boom’s first wartime refugee guests.

## [Miep Gies](http://www.miepgies.nl/en/): [Anne Frank’s Protectress](https://www.biography.com/people/miep-gies-21349765)
> “Even an ordinary secretary or a housewife or a teenager can, within their own small ways, turn on a small light in a dark room.”

Almost everyone has heard of Anne Frank and her famous diary, but many do not know the story of the woman who made the diary possible.

Miep Gies not only sheltered the Frank family for two years, allowing Anne to compose her now-well-known diary. She also saved the diary after the Frank family were betrayed and killed, returning it to the only survivor — Anne’s dad, Otto Frank — after the war.

Hermine “Miep” Gies was born in Vienna, but sent to live in the Netherlands after World War I. Gies loved her adopted Dutch family so much that she ended up staying there.

In 1933, Gies became Otto Frank’s secretary at his trading company, and became good friends with the entire Frank family. During World War II, Miep, her husband, and several other brave souls teamed up to hide two Jewish families in the Secret Annex behind Frank’s former office.

When the Frank family was betrayed, Gies tried to bribe officers to get the families released, but was unsuccessful. However, Gies saved Anne Frank’s diary and hid it in a desk.

In 1945, after Otto Frank discovered that his family had died in the concentration camps, Miep returned his daughter Anne’s diary to him.

Anne Frank’s diary was later published and became an internationally renowned bestselling book. In 1987, Miep Gies also wrote her own book: *Memories of Anne Frank.*

Miep Gies was involved in the Anne Frank House up to her death in 2010. She was 100 years old.

## Unsung Heroines

“I am not a hero,” Miep Gies once [wrote in her memoir.](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/world/europe/12gies.html)

And indeed, all three of these incredible women had no delusions of grandeur, nor did they have a speck of ego or arrogance.

**Yet it was their very selflessness that made these three heroic.** Irena Sendler, Corrie Ten Boom, and Miep Gies saved lives at risk of their own, endured the loss beloved friends and family, and continued serving and helping other wounded people all their lives.

They taught through their example the value of quiet courage, staunch devotion to doing the right thing, and true humility. Their stories have touched and continue to touch the hearts and lives of people around the world to this day.

And thus, although these three women never saw themselves as heroines, that is exactly what they are to us today.

# Guided by Governance&#58; Follow These 5 Best Practices to Build a Business for Good

## How to Walk the Fine Line Between Aspirations and Reality

![(Photo by [Ian Schneider](https://unsplash.com/photos/TamMbr4okv4?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/map?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText))](1*_hEDASII5u7vgqJ9NH4mYA.jpeg)*(Photo by [Ian Schneider](https://unsplash.com/photos/TamMbr4okv4?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/map?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText))*

Creating a business that balances purpose with profit requires a sturdy foundation—a structure that varies for each business, and one hat can adapt over time. While there is no single blueprint for this structure, the process of becoming a Certified B Corporation can help, and the B Corp community serves as a important resource.

Read on for five lessons learned by B Corps honored in 2018 as [Best For The World: Governance honorees](https://bthechange.com/making-the-most-of-your-mission-a-roundup-from-the-best-45842b1b7049)—those that exemplify how to build a company’s values and mission goals into its everyday operations and practices.

## 1. Build it into your foundation.

A company committed to having a positive social impact has to walk the talk in everything it does — something that’s much easier said than done. Putting that commitment at the core of operations can make it more manageable and keep it front and center.

Creating a clearly defined mission or set of values helps align work, people, and brand and serves as a ballast. Articulate that mission and brand guidelines so anyone who joins the employee team understands they are built into the company’s fabric. Reinforce this by weaving them into external messaging, such as websites, social media, or sales collateral, and make the mission part of staff performance reviews.

## 2. Make tough decisions quickly.

If an impact initiative isn’t working, move on quickly. This can be difficult, but the risk in not doing so could be devastating to your organization. In a mission-driven, for-profit company, the resources necessary to fund your impact initiatives typically come from profit margins.

That’s why it’s critical to quickly cast off initiatives that don’t work so you can focus remaining resources on those that do. Whether it’s dealing with a challenging employee, rethinking your corporate giving, or shutting down a project that hasn’t generated results, make a decision, take action, deal with the consequences, and move on. The sooner the better.

## 3. Be prepared to pivot.

In her [TedX talk](https://youtu.be/f4kySpcdvFg), Nadya Zhexembayeva notes that because of ongoing disruption, the average company must now reinvent itself every 3.5 years. But during the height of the Industrial Revolution, these transformations happened only about every 75 years. This quicker timeline is particularly challenging for mission-driven companies because every pivot requires you to reassess the resources necessary to maintain both margin and mission. It’s inevitable that some of your impact-focused efforts are going to fail. That’s OK.

As noted above, companies that [embrace organizational agility and continuous learning](https://www.mightybytes.com/blog/five-lessons-learned-from-agile-processes/) can pivot quickly. Failing fast and moving on or evolving efforts to produce better results reduces company resources and saves money. Devising lean, data-informed practices will ensure you reach (or, better yet, exceed) goals over time.

Consider this approach:

* Once you have defined an impact project, also define the organizational success (and failure) metrics that will frame your efforts.

* Identify small steps forward, measuring progress each step of the way.

* Use captured data to inform how best to improve the project.

* Make those improvements and resample your data.

* Lather, rinse, repeat — or pivot when necessary.

## 4. You are the company you keep.

Use the promise of doing business better to vet clients. After all, the people you choose to partner or work with are a reflection of your values. Some companies only work with individuals or organizations that have a positive social impact.

To create meaningful client relationships, work with other companies that have similar values and are kind, imaginative, and accountable to their stakeholders and communities.

And this goes far beyond the work you do. As a business owner and leader, it’s the advisors you engage with, the pet projects you take on, the friends you confide in.

## 5. Keep it simple.

Finally, the importance of simplicity in these governance efforts cannot be overstated. Don’t enact complex company impact policies that require their own manual to enforce or follow. Stakeholders, especially employees, want to engage with initiatives that are clear, easy to understand, and simple to act upon.

Certified B Corps have a collective goal of using business to create a shared and durable prosperity for all society — a lofty goal, to be certain. Creating this prosperity for others requires practicing self care first. Knowing what you can realistically accomplish with existing resources, then communicating that clearly to stakeholders is critical for long-term success.

# LinkedIn For Lead Generation — The Ultimate Guide

## 

What is the biggest challenge faced by any budding entrepreneur, business owner, or freelancer? Most of them struggle to generate good quality leads that can be converted into faithful customers.

With the advent of the internet and digital marketing, the techniques for lead generation have also evolved. You can no longer rely solely on age-old tactics such as cold calling and promotional SMS.

Instead, you should focus on using different social networking sites such as LinkedIn for lead generation. LinkedIn has grown by leaps and bounds since its inception in May 2003.

At first, it was considered a platform for professional networking. However, it has slowly evolved into an extremely powerful tool for brand building and lead generation.

* [11 Easy Steps to Create a Successful LinkedIn Marketing Strategy](https://shanebarker.com/blog/linkedin-marketing-strategy/)

* [14 of the Best LinkedIn Tools to Improve Your LinkedIn Marketing](https://shanebarker.com/blog/best-linkedin-tools/)

It is not surprising that LinkedIn has attracted more than [612 million users](https://about.linkedin.com/) from 200 countries around the globe.

Later in this post, we will discuss some of the most effective LinkedIn lead generation tactics. But first, let’s first take a look at what sets it apart from other lead generation tactics and social networks.

## The True Potential of LinkedIn

When you think of social media marketing, LinkedIn is not the most obvious choice. However, this professional networking site offers a goldmine of B2B marketing opportunities.

In fact, according to the [Sophisticated Marketer’s Guide to LinkedIn](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/marketing-solutions/cx/2017/pdfs/Sophisticated-Marketers-Guide-to-LinkedIn-v03.12.pdf), 80% of social media B2B leads come from LinkedIn. This is mainly because LinkedIn is often frequented by top-level influencers, decision makers, and industry thought leaders.

Armed with the right strategy, you can grab their attention and grow your business. You can also use LinkedIn to increase website traffic and reinforce brand credibility.

The following infographic published by LinkedIn sheds more light on its power as a marketing tool:

A robust LinkedIn lead generation strategy can take your business to new heights. However, promoting your brand on LinkedIn can be extremely tricky. You have to grab the limelight without appearing overly promotional.

Now let’s take a look at the best techniques for LinkedIn lead generation:

HANDPICKED RELATED CONTENT:

* [12 Things You Need To Know About LinkedIn Marketing Right Now](https://shanebarker.com/blog/linkedin-marketing-roundup/)

## Complete Your LinkedIn Profile

One of the most crucial aspects of LinkedIn lead generation is to have a complete and up-to-date profile. It offers the first glimpse of your skills and offerings to potential clients and recruiters.

Therefore, it must be captivating enough to make a powerful first impression. This is especially important for entrepreneurs and freelancers who are looking to bag new projects and assignments.

Your LinkedIn profile should contain comprehensive and relevant information about you including your work experience, job titles, academic background, professional achievements, etc.

Mention the projects you have worked on and provide a clear description outlining your role and contribution. Request recommendations from your colleagues and employers to strengthen the credibility of your profile.

In addition to completing your personal profile, you should also create a Company Page for your business/brand. Provide complete details about your company including its size, location, operational years, products/services, etc.

An up-to-date Company Page makes your brand appear more trustworthy and professional. Add your company logo and website URL to further boost brand awareness.

## Don’t Ignore Optimization

The potential of search engine optimization (SEO) isn’t limited to Google. In fact, you can use the same principles to optimize your LinkedIn profile and Company Page.

It ensures that your name or your brand shows up when someone searches for products or services related to you, on and off LinkedIn. This, in turn, makes it extremely beneficial for LinkedIn lead generation.

The first step is to identify the keywords you want your profile to rank for. This requires an understanding of the search queries and phrases that your target audience is likely to use. Just like SEO, you can also optimize your profile for long-tail keywords to target more specific leads.

Let’s say you are a fashion photographer based out of Chicago. You would want your LinkedIn profile to pop up when someone searches for “fashion photographer in Chicago.”

If you want to drive more traffic, you need to including your website URL in your LinkedIn profile. This, in turn, will open new business opportunities by connecting you with potential clients.

Once you have picked your keywords, the next step is to incorporate them into your profile. You can use these keywords in your job titles, description, skills, and other sections.

You can also run a LinkedIn search for these keywords and take a look at the top profiles. Observe how they have used the keywords in their profiles and try to replicate the same in yours.

If you have a Company Page, make sure you also optimize it for relevant keywords.

## Connect with Profile Visitors

LinkedIn sends you a “Someone has viewed your profile” email every time your profile gets a visitor. Most people end up ignoring such notifications. However, when it comes to LinkedIn lead generation, these emails can give you a plethora of useful information.

When someone views your LinkedIn profile, it is likely that they have taken some interest in your products or services. It is advisable that you track them down using the email notification.

Alternatively, you can also use the “who’s viewed your profile” section in the “Profile” drop-down menu of your LinkedIn profile. This can help you connect with more potential customers and in turn, grow your business.

## Publish Engaging Content

You can make yourself more discoverable on LinkedIn by optimizing your profile and Company Page using relevant keywords. However, in order to retain the attention of profile visitors, you must publish high-quality, original, and relevant content.

This will help position you as an authority figure on certain subjects and strengthen your reputation as an industry thought leader. This, in turn, will help with your LinkedIn lead generation.

When you are creating content for LinkedIn, you must understand why senior-level executives choose to spend their time on the platform. They are not looking for redundant and run-of-the-mill blog posts.

Instead, they are looking for content that will educate them and help them stay abreast with the latest developments in their industry.

Therefore, you should strive to publish content on industry trends and thought leadership. Make sure you lend your unique perspective to every piece of content.

You should accompany your posts with eye-catching headlines, graphics, videos, presentations, statistics, etc. Refrain from publishing self-promotional content too often. Take a look at the following graph to understand the type of content that fares well on LinkedIn:

In addition to creating engaging content, you should also ensure that you publish regularly. It is advisable that you create a content calendar outlining the topics and posts that you wish to publish in the next few months.

This will prevent your LinkedIn page from appearing outdated, and can help increase engagement and leads.

## Create Conversion-Friendly Posts

In addition to featuring high-quality content, you should also add attractive captions, bullet points, and visual elements such as emojis to your LinkedIn updates.

You must also accompany these posts with appropriate calls-to-action and links. This aids LinkedIn lead generation by [driving more traffic](https://shanebarker.com/blog/seo-case-study/) to your website, blog, or landing pages.

Make sure you don’t flood your posts with self-promotional jargon. Instead, you should provide your audience with additional resources that will help them acquire more information about you and your brand.

For instance, take a look at the LinkedIn Company Page of [General Electric](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ge/).

GE’s LinkedIn profile doesn’t bombard readers with promotional content. Instead, they are presented with interesting posts that link back to the company’s website. This is a very subtle way of increasing website traffic and thereby, acquiring genuine leads.

## Seek Help from Your Colleagues and Employees

Your company’s workforce can be one of your biggest brand advocates on LinkedIn. You should encourage them to share your content on their personal LinkedIn profiles.

That will help expand your reach and reach their networks on LinkedIn. This, in turn, increases brand awareness, boosts brand credibility, drives website traffic, and ultimately, helps with LinkedIn lead generation.

In addition, you should also ensure that all your colleagues and employees have completed their LinkedIn profiles. You can also ask them to list your company as their employer and provide a link to your Company Page.

This puts your brand on the forefront every time someone visits their profile.

## Join LinkedIn Groups

An effective way of widening your audience and escalating the LinkedIn lead generation process is to join all relevant groups on LinkedIn. Don’t restrict yourself to the groups that solely pertain to your industry/niche.

Instead, expand your horizon and join groups that might be remotely related to your niche and can help you grow your business. Take a look at [LinkedIn’s guide](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/186/finding-and-joining-a-linkedin-group?lang=en) on selecting and joining the right groups.

Once you have joined a group, make sure you contribute to the group conversations with relevant content. You can even include links to your blog posts or landing pages to increase website traffic.

In addition to establishing new connections, it positions your brand as an industry expert. Make sure your comments aren’t inundated with self-promotional content to prevent them from being deleted by LinkedIn’s spam filter.

## Utilize LinkedIn’s Advertising Options

If you want to take your content beyond your existing connections and followers, you should start exploring the various advertising options offered by LinkedIn.

The simplest way is to create sponsored posts using your most engaging and valuable content.

LinkedIn facilitates extremely specific and precise targeting; thereby helping you reach out to the right audience. For instance, [HubSpot utilized LinkedIn Sponsored Content to generate 400% more leads](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/marketing-solutions/case-studies/pdfs/LIHubSpotCaseStudy5-4-16.pdf)than other lead generation channels.

It has also been observed that the quality of leads from LinkedIn is far superior compared to those acquired from other channels.

Additionally, you can also create sponsored InMail campaigns to facilitate LinkedIn lead generation. InMail allows you to reach the LinkedIn inboxes of your potential clients using a personalized message.

You can use InMail to share top-rated content or upcoming offers with your target audience.

With the right strategy, you can grab the attention of potential clients easily. For this, you need to optimize your profile and keep it up-to-date. But more than anything else, effective LinkedIn lead generation requires a deep understanding of your target audience.

# Playing it safe is the way to success

## Playing it safe is the way to success

### How to stop giving up on your goals

I had to be creative.

My shoulder hurt, but I’m not the type to give up.
I went outside, and found a set of stairs close to my training spot.
Let’s make it fun.

I started jumping this set of stairs.
They were really wide, so I started small:

Two steps. “Easy”
Three steps. “I got this”
Four steps. “You know what? I’m sure I can do five.”

Every time I tried to jump to the 5th step, I landed on the fourth. Just about.

Then I noticed it: my gaze was aiming at the edge of the 5th step, the minimum for me to succeed. And I kept landing on the 4th. **One step below my aim.**

Next time, I added two extra steps: my gaze firmly aiming for the 7th step.

Guess what? I comfortably landed on the 6th step. Two more than what I thought was my limit.

![](0*UjgY3Bu6qLUtHOpU)

**Just by shifting my aim, I made an impossible outcome almost effortless.**

It was a great reminder.

Whenever we set goals, we tend to make them incremental — something we’re comfortable we can achieve.
*Have more of this, do less of that. Grow 10%. Get one more client. Meet someone who’s “ok”. Find a “better” job. Increase my day rate by $50.*

Incremental goals feel safe. But here’s why they’re not.

* **They’re not exciting.** Small, incremental goals would have minimal impact on your life, yet they require you to show up and do the work. In other words, they’re not worth it.

* **You don’t know how to do it anyway.** By definition, any goal will be a stretch: something you don’t have at the moment, and something you don’t quite know how to do. You’re likely to fall short of it or need more time.

So aim higher. Skip a step.
If you have to fall short of your expectations, then you better make them much bigger than “just” what you need.
Take a look at these :

* How can I increase my day rate?
**VS How can I double my day rate?**

* How can I take a weekend break?
**VS How can I travel for 6 months?**

* How can I make my business break even?
**VS How can I triple revenue?**

Notice how the easy ones require almost as much effort and learning as the big ones, but they’re not quite as rewarding.

Plus, would you rather fall short of the first set, or the second?
In one case, you’d feel defeated, in the other, you’d still have grown massively.

Whenever I set bigger goals than what was comfortable, that’s when I got the most results. Remember this: whenever you set a goal, aim higher.
**Playing it safe is the riskiest option.**

– Matt

# Restoring Faith In Business&#58; How Purpose-Driven Companies Can Serve the Common Good

## New Generation of Employees Seeks Profit Plus a Purpose

![Sojourners’ founder and faith leader Jim Wallis presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos on “Business and Values.” (Photo from Wikipedia Commons)](1*eEKea2v4I1FBAZMKIHovKw.jpeg)*Sojourners’ founder and faith leader Jim Wallis presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos on “Business and Values.” (Photo from Wikipedia Commons)*
> # “Ethics can’t be extracurricular with businesspeople. Unless ethics becomes central to the vocation of business, we’re in trouble.”

So says the prophetic voice of [Jim Wallis](https://sojo.net/biography/jim-wallis), president and founder of [*Sojourners](https://sojo.net/)*, a national faith-based organization that reaches more than 5 million Americans. A lifelong evangelical from the Midwest, Wallis launched Sojourners more than 40 years ago with other students at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Illinois, where they also established a community with a Christian commitment to social justice.

Since then he has become a *New York Times* best-selling author (most famously for *God’s Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn’t Get It*), public theologian, speaker, and international commentator on ethics and public life. He served on President Barack Obama’s White House Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and currently serves on the Global Agenda Council on Values of the World Economic Forum. The most recent of his 12 books, [*America’s Original Sin: Racism, White Privilege, and the Bridge to a New America](https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Original-Sin-Privilege-America/dp/1587433427/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=sojourners0c-20&linkId=0feb675d9f391b1b9eaf712418a52577)*, was released in January 2016 with a foreword by Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative and author of *Just Mercy*.

[Vocation](https://sojo.net/articles/common-good/10-decisions-you-can-make-change-world) has often been a focus for Wallis, who believes that business leaders must play an important role if America is to achieve liberty, justice, and equity for all. In preparation for a conversation we’ll be having about “Restoring Our Faith in Business” at [*Sojourners*’ upcoming Summit](https://summitforchange.com/) from June 13 to 15, 2018, in Washington, D.C., I recently talked with Wallis about why business leaders should work toward a just society — and where we might find unity in divisive times. We both hope this kicks off a series of conversations with other business and faith leaders about how just business can drive a just society.

### Why should business leaders care about a just society? Why should they be motivated to put personal ethics at the center of their professional lives?

You can make the argument, and many people do, that good business is good for business. You can make the mathematical case, if you care more about your employees, that you’ll keep them longer and you won’t have to pay as much for retraining. But beyond the business case, the new generation of businesspeople is feeling more of a need for purpose and not just profit. Young businesspeople aren’t just looking for the best salary and earnings package. They’re looking for how what they do can make the world a better place. I think that the vocational question is:
> # *“Is there purpose in this business, purpose that is serving the common good?”*

Business at its best is also working to serve the common good, not just make a profit. That’s a conversation that I think a new generation — at least of MBA students that I talk to — want to have.

### That sounds nice, but when someone says,“Well, I’d love to, but I just can’t do that,” what do you see as the big obstacles or constraints that might be standing in the way?

One of the issues is what is the venue inside of this organization where ethical questions can be raised? Few corporations or businesses that I know have a safe place to hold these conversations or raise ethical questions.

Smaller businesses and family businesses can more likely hold those conversations, but unless there’s a vocational commitment inside businesses at a leadership level, all the companies are doing is damage control. What’s the vocation of a business? Do the employees know? If they can articulate the business’s purpose, and they have a sense of believing in it, they will stay longer and they’ll work harder, and they’ll feel more ownership of what’s going on. If they can’t, it’s just a job.

That’s a conversation that I like to have with business leaders, because it’s a lot easier for a faith leader like me to raise these questions. I don’t have these easy, simplistic answers, but I do have questions.

### When business leaders say that their ethics conflict with the business imperatives and demands of the marketplaces, what questions do you ask them to help them through that reconciliation process?

Businesspeople have choices and influence within that marketplace. Sometimes they’ve got choices to make that conflict with the imperatives of the marketplace as defined. It depends on who’s defining what the imperatives are.

What does the board think? Is it considering stakeholders, or is it only thinking of shareholders? Where do you fall in terms of timeframe — are you looking at quarterly losses or thinking of the impacts on two generations from now? These are the kind of questions I would ask.

### What is the unique role of business leaders at a moment like this, where the politics seem so broken that many people want to throw their hands up and retreat into their own space? If that space happens to be a space of business, what are some of the things you want to see from business leaders who are taking this civic responsibility seriously as business leaders?

There were some chants I heard after the school shootings in Parkland, Florida, from teenage students. One of them was, “Dick’s, Dick’s, Dick’s, Dick’s.” Dick’s Sporting Goods made a decision to not sell assault weapons. These kids are not backing down on universal background checks and banning assault weapons. They’re clear, consistent, and they’re saying, “This is where we’re going, and if you don’t want to go here, we’re going to vote you out.” And they’re going to be able to vote people out over time. These young people are going to make a difference.

Dick’s Sporting Goods said, “We’re going to start right now. Let’s do this.” You’ve got businesses cutting off relationships with the NRA. You’ve got Dick’s not going to sell assault weapons. So you can make decisions before there’s a ban on assault weapons, not to sell assault weapons. So there are decisions businesses can make that don’t depend on government intervention, don’t depend on winning the political debate. You can lead by example.

There’s a new generation that is really waiting and hoping to see the kind of things that B Corp is committed to.

# Why Consistency And Persistence Are Two Vital Ingredients To Success

## “A woman on a ledge high over a wooded valley” by Mike Wilson on Unsplash

## The Measure of Consistency
> # “Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements and impossibilities: It is this, that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak.” — Thomas Carlyle

Consistency and persistence are two elusive virtues difficult to sustain if not regularly engaged.

Let’s peer through the lens of what they offer.

No doubt you’re well-versed in the merits of consistency within a practical approach. Attend any weekend course and the instructor will confirm the power of consistency as a key attribute toward accomplishment.

Consistency is defined as developing discipline in a chosen field, in support of a favourable outcome. Those who uphold discipline are rewarded with success since they harness enduring focus via concerted effort.

Let’s be clear while on the topic. Success in this context is not limited to particular areas of life. If losing weight and eating healthy is your primary goal, taking proper action consistently is considered a success.

Far too many people discount the power of consistent effort towards their goals. Consistency creates powerful neural networks in the brain known as grooving.

These grooved neural networks help form strong connections within the brain’s synaptic connections, thus enhancing your concentration on a task or goal.

When one applies intermittent effort to a goal, the brain does not receive enough stimuli to form powerful habits.

It is the Hebbian theory, introduced by the Canadian psychologist Donald O. Hebb who said: “Nerves that fire together, wire together.”

**With consistent effort, your brain gains the right neural connections due to prolonged application.**

Focussing attention towards your goals allows the brain to *lock on* to the target.

Consistency is perceived as the ability to sustain continuous effort despite external forces. Ceaseless determination is paramount to draw a favourable outcome in this instance.

Consistency builds character and sharpens the mind. Consistent people are triumphant, with an unyielding inner drive.

They are firm in their resolve to invoke positive results and do not compromise by cutting corners or taking the road less travelled. Their dedication pays off with the rewards that follow.

One final thought.

Consistency is essential in a task-orientated goal since it allows you to trace your results through to completion. For example, many people give up improving their nutritional and exercise goals as challenges arise.

Following success without a measure of sustained performance is likely to produce ineffectual outcomes.

In several instances ones desired results may not be visible for any length of time when implementing nutritional and exercise goals.

Often events are working in your favour behind the scenes and laying the foundations for future progress.

## How To Harness Persistence
> # “You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.” — Maya Angelou

Let us turn our attention to the power of persistent effort.

Persistence is a developed state of mind much like grit. It is the hallmark of accomplishment since persistent people push through pain which refers to the setbacks and roadblocks when pursuing a goal.

One’s ability to recover from failure and setbacks forms the basis for future success.

Persistence acknowledges the external forces that act upon us. These forces can hinder one’s progress, however the persistent person acknowledges these forces are working against them, yet endures in the face of resistance.

I referred to establishing a compelling WHY in earlier articles since I believe it to be a crucial measure of improvement.

Persistent people are endowed with an indomitable will to succeed, having connected with a persuasive WHY.

Behavioural psychologists long believed *showing up* is a good enough measure towards future success.

I believe that showing up is inadequate since people show up every day to mundane jobs they loathe. Whilst the body is present, their minds are looking forward to the end of the day.

Showing up means being present and engaged with absolute intention and purpose.

Another key influence is the power of momentum, a formidable ally toward goal attainment. Without momentum, one applies partial effort while expecting victory.

Think back to your last project in which you applied persistence and momentum. I imagine your efforts were easy as though you were in a state of Flow.

Momentum is the accelerator that drives persistence. As you maintain persistence, momentum takes the wheel to hasten progress.

Artists will tell you that every creative pursuit takes a life of its own through a powerful commitment.

I leave you with a final principle which ties together the power of consistency and persistence, known as the compound effect.

Author Darren Hardy who wrote *The Compound Effect* outlines ways in which success is leveraged through building on consistency and persistence.

According to the author: “The compound effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards from a series of small, smart choices. The most challenging aspect of the compound effect is that we have to keep working away for a while, **consistently** and **efficiently**, before we can begin to see the payoff.”

Thus the power of consistency and persistence are two fundamental forces that generate powerful and lasting success in areas of your life.

Use them wisely.

# 15 Super Smart Quotes on Success From Best Young Entrepreneurs

## 

Millennials get a lot of hate thrown their way. They’re called selfish. Spoiled. Self-absorbed. Slackers.

Enough with the generation bashing!

Labeling one group so broadly is dangerous and [flat out wrong](https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/7-things-you-should-know-you-re-getting-wrong-about-millennials.html).

Just as we can all learn and seek inspiration from entrepreneurial superstars, [billionaires](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/25-billionaire-quotes-about-success-in-business-amp-life.html), [pop megastars](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/these-7-quotes-from-taylor-swift-will-make-you-work-your-ass-off.html), and even [ultimate fighters](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/33-quotes-from-ufc-fighter-ronda-rousey-that-will-inspire-you-to-kick-ass-in-bus.html) on topics like [adversity](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/19-short-inspirational-quotes-for-overcoming-adversity.html), [resilience](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/19-inspiring-billionaire-quotes-about-resilience-in-business-amp-life.html), and [happiness](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/27-quotes-about-happiness-from-entrepreneurial-superstars.html), we can learn from today’s successful Millennial entrepreneurs.

Or, as I prefer to call them, entrepreneurs.

Here are some super smart tips from 15 of the young entrepreneurs who made this year’s [Inc 30 Under 30](https://www.inc.com/donna-fenn/meet-the-2015-30-under-30.html) list.

## 1. Carve Your Own Path

Don’t let someone else’s vision of success force you to stray from the path you worked to be on. Carve your own path and you’ll always be heading in the right direction. — Michelle Phan, co-founder of [Ipsy](http://michellephan.com/how-to-set-yourself-up-for-success-in-2015/).

## 2. Soak Up Knowledge From Smart People

I love the [Jim Rohn] quote “You’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” I’d encourage female entrepreneurs to find people that they admire and spend lots of time with those people that are more successful than they are and smarter than they are, because those are the people I’ve learned the most from. — Nanxi Liu, CEO of [Enplug](http://growtheverywhere.com/growth-everywhere-interview/nanxi-liu-enplug/)

## 3. Do It Now!

Don’t wait until you have all the answers because you will never have all the answers. — Zoe Barry, founder of [ZappRx](https://a%20href%3D%22http//www.womenonbusiness.com/women-innovation-zoe-barry/)

## 4. 99 Percent Perspiration

Be ready to work! Business is not simply built on innovation — we’ve had a great idea in a great industry that’s required quite a bit of “perspiration” and late nights to achieve. — Adam Lyonz, founder of [The Zebra](http://blog.rackspace.com/straight-up-startupfeaturing-adam-lyons-ceo-of-insurance-zebra/)

## 5. Find Solutions to the Right Problems

## 9. Kill Your Insecurities

As you start working on your company, you start working on yourself. Because this company is a reflection of who you are, and every single one of your insecurities are somehow going to be challenged; they are somehow going to bubble up to the surface. And you are going to have to defeat them in real time, in order to be successful at what you’re building. — Anda Gansca, founder of [Knotch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVVDEkUs_uY)

## 10. To Thine Own Self Be True

Just be yourself. Work hard, and do something you love. Focus: do less, but do it better. And give back when you can. — Jordan Fliegel, Founder of [CoachUp](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4871-jordan-fliegel-entrepreneur.html)

# How to Overcome Your Fear of Failure with The Bucky Method

## How to Overcome Your Fear of Failure with The Bucky Method

On a snowy day in late 1927, a young corporate executive looked down past his toes, past the trusses of the bridge he was standing atop, and stared into the choppy waters of Lake Michigan.

Earlier that year, his first daughter had died and he had lost his job as president of a building company.

For years, he had been plagued by a fear of failure and now it had all come true.

He had no job, no savings to fall back on, and his wife had just given birth to his second daughter. With no employment prospects and a hungry family, he had resolved to jump off a bridge so his family could get the life insurance payout. Standing on the bridge looking down, he had a realization that would define the remainder of his life.
> # If he was willing to end his life, he had nothing to lose by trying to live in ways he had not yet imagined.

Seeing as he was already prepared to die, whatever time he had left could simply be viewed as an experiment to see what he could contribute to humanity. It didn’t matter if it didn’t work out, it was all gravy.

That man was Buckminster “Bucky” Fuller, who became one of the most productive scientists of the 20th century. He published over thirty books, invented the term Spaceship Earth and designed [the geodesic dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome#Dome_homes).

Late in his life, he cited that moment as when he overcame his fear of failure. He began to view his life as an experiment to be the crucial turning point for what became an immensely productive life.

## Thinking Fast and Slow

[Thinking Fast and Slow](http://amzn.to/1WDulDB), the life’s work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, has come to serve as the bedrock model of behavioral economics.

It distinguishes between two systems within the brain:

**System 1** operates automatically and quickly, without effort or voluntary control. If you’ve ever found yourself halfway through a bag of chips you didn’t even realized you had opened, that was System 1.

**System 2** allocates attention to intentional mental activities. It’s associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration. System 2 is at work when you’re focusing all your attention and energy on a single, challenging problem.

What Fuller recognized standing on the bridge was that he could view his life as an experiment, in which part of himself (*System 1*) was the subject of the experiment and another part of himself (*System 2*) was the scientist conducting the experiment.

As Fuller’s career attests, this mindset has practical applications for how to overcome a fear of failure.

## How To Overcome Your Fear of Failure: The Bucky Method

Hedge Fund Manager [Ray Dalio](https://amzn.to/2Q0CO6L) calls this the “two yous:”
> “Think of it as though there are two yous- you as the designer and overseer of the plan to achieve goals [you(2)/system 2] and you as one of the participants in pursuing that mission [you(1)/system 1]. You(1) are a resource that you(2) can use to get what you(2) wants, but by no means are you the only resource. To be successful, you(2) has to be objective about you(1)”

For the sake of clarity, let’s call you(2)/system 2 “investor-you.” This is the you standing outside the system looking in about how to best allocate resources which includes you(1)/system 1 which we’ll call “operator-you.”

When operator-you is at the bottom of a bag of potato chips which investor-you didn’t want to eat in the first place, investor-you can design a better experiment in the future by making sure not to put chips on the shopping list, storing them on a tall shelf that is harder to get to, or pouring only part of the bag into a bowl first.

Investor-you goes through a three-stage loop:

1. Decide what investor-you wants, what are your goals?

1. Investor-you then builds a machine to achieve those goals, deploying different resources at your command, including operator you.

1. That machine produces outcomes which investor-you then analyzes and uses to adjust the goal

![](1*C5DMbwu5xsgl3b_MLB2uWw.png)

Investor-me can deploy salesman-me, writer-me, manager-me, or marketer-me without getting attached.

Like a diligent investor, Investor-me lays out a thesis with defined timelines, expectations, and, most importantly, safety procedures.

Let’s contrast two people with the same objective, and see how they would approach the problem differently.

The first says “I’m an author-author. I want to write books.” So they do the logical thing: they write a book. It sells very few copies. There are now more books getting published than ever before, and they haven’t done anything to stand out. They double down and write more books — “I am an author!”

Nothing ever takes off.

The second person says “I’m an investor-author. I want to write books.” They write a book and sell very few copies. They then step back, look at the new outcomes they’ve gotten from the first investment and say “If my goal is to write book for a living and I invest time in learning marketing, then I could sell more books, and I could get to a point where I could write full time much sooner.”

They come up with a new thesis to allocate some of their time to marketing, and gradually get better at it. They sell more books and are able to start writing full time more quickly.

This is a simplistic example, but it achieves the same ends Buckminster Fuller found so powerful: it transforms failure into learning.

So how do you apply The Bucky Method to your life? Here are the five principles of The Bucky Method:

![](1*f7bSpkln7oQonRJ-HTlwvw.png)

## 1. Treat Failure as Feedback, Not Fatal

In the example of two authors trying to write a book, each figure has different reactions to their first book doing poorly.

The author-author sees it as a failure. He is an author that writes unpopular books. The investor-author sees it as feedback. He is an investor-author that now has better data to inform his next hypothesis.

This is one reason I have found [planning in 90-day sprints](https://taylorpearson.me/planning/) to be so helpful for improving my personal effectiveness.

Each ninety days is an experiment in moving towards a long-term goal. Your role during those 90 days is simply to play out the thesis. If you are trying to start a business, and realize that you don’t like that business or the market is too small, that’s simply feedback to change your longterm goals and come up with a new thesis.

You can also still take what you learned over those 90 days and apply it to future projects. **You have not lost 90 days, you have acquired valuable, proprietary data.**

Thomas Edison embodied this principle:
> “I never allow myself to become discouraged under any circumstances. I recall that after we had conducted thousands of experiments on a certain project without solving the problem, one of my associates, after we had conducted the crowning experiment and it had proved a failure, expressed discouragement and disgust over our having failed ‘to find out anything.’ I cheerily assured him that we had learned something. For we had learned for a certainty that the thing couldn’t be done that way, and that we would have to try some other way. We sometimes learn a lot from our failures if we have put into the effort the best thought and work we are capable of.”

The result? By the time of his death, Edison owned 1,093 patents. He didn’t have a single light bulb moment of insight, his light bulb stayed on.

## 2. Have Strong Views, Weakly Held

In 1965 Arno A. Penzias and Robert W. Wilson, of Bell Laboratories, were testing a sensitive horn antenna. They discovered a low level of microwave background “noise,” like the kind of electrical noise which produces “snow” on an old television screen.

Their strong view was that the noise was caused by the instrument they were using, so they worked on eliminating it to be able to get more accurate readings. Even as they strongly believed they were correct, they weren’t attached to this view: they were open to changing the belief and sought out other explanations.

When they found a group at Princeton that had predicted there would be low levels of noise left over from the Big Bang, they submitted their data as proof of the Big Bang, and subsequently won the Nobel Prize.

Had they remained fixated on fixing their instrumentation (their initial strong view), instead of being open to changing their opinions, they likely would never have realized what they’d found: A little observation about a little thing called the Big Bang, from which everything (literally, all the things) resulted.

Good investors change their minds quickly. If you tell them something that changes their opinion, they don’t feel ego bruised about making a prior investment, they just change their position. You’ve given them a leg up on the market.

This is difficult because cultural mores frequently run counter to this. Political candidates are eviscerated for “flip-flopping,” also known as “changing your mind after getting new information.”

The investor-author that thought writing more books was the solution had a strong hold on his view that blocked out alternative explanations. By applying the Bucky Method, it let the second author realize that building up his marketing skills, in addition to writing a book, was a better path.

## 3. Double Down on Strengths, Don’t Worry About Weaknesses

One of the great disservices done by modern education is that it programs us to worry about fixing our weaknesses not doubling down on our strengths. If you have a student that excels in Math and Physics, but does terribly in English Literature, what do schools do?

They put her in extra study classes for English literature.

This makes no sense if you come at the issue like an investor. If you had an employee who was amazing at sales but terrible at product development, would you make them spend more time doing product development and less time doing sales?

Obviously not, you’d let them do sales full time and hire someone else to do product development.

LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has observed that “most strengths have corresponding weaknesses. If you try to manage or mitigate a given weakness, you might also eliminate the corresponding strength.”

Hoffman is not well organized. But, he suspects his day-to-day chaos partially enables his creativity as an investor and entrepreneur.

Remember that investor-you can use many resources, of which operator-you is only one.

I have the worst rote memory of anyone you know. I don’t know any of my family members’ birthdays and I don’t know what I had for breakfast yesterday. Investor-me doesn’t worry about this too much because he can invest in a smartphone that has reminders on it. As long as operator-me has reminders, his poor rote memory is not a problem (or, well, less of a problem).

Instead of trying to eliminate your weaknesses, look for ways to double down on your strengths and use other resources as part of your machine.

![](1*vy_E6zVDRLjHxt-ZJx6IlQ.png)

## 4. Manage Your Downside Risk

The investor mindset also means you need to manage your downside risk. Just as an investor wouldn’t invest all her money without a plan to take it out if the company started to fail, you need to decide what you can afford to lose.

[Research has shown](https://taylorpearson.me/what-do-i-want/) the popular narrative that people who start businesses don’t invest their life savings in an idea, they decide what they can afford to lose and keep the rest of the chips off the table.

Investor-you can decide: “I will invest six months of my time and $XXX into trying to achieve this outcome.” Then operator-you gets to work.

Once the six months and the money is up, you take a step back, analyze all the new outcome data and decide either that it’s working well and you should keep doing it or that another line of investing is likely to be more fruitful.

By deciding what you can afford to lose up front, if something doesn’t go as well as hoped, it’s not an existential crisis that’s going to end up with you on the street. It’s something that you knew was possible and so you can simply use it as feedback for making better hypotheses.

Edison didn’t do any experiments that were going to end his career if they failed. Investor-Edison knew most were likely to fail, planned for it, then fully committed Operator-Edison to making it work.

It’s important to make the scope and deliverables clearly defined before, because once you’ve started the experiment, your ego is involved, which is fine.

However, you need to understand that the success of that one experiment does not define your success overall, it’s just one iteration.

## 5. Be Process Driven, Not Goal Driven

The development of the scientific method in the 13th century was a watershed moment in history, but not for the reason most believe. It wasn’t “invented”, it was merely formalized. For hundreds of years prior, there had been people doing the steps, they just hadn’t realized what they were doing. They’d stumbled on the method by trial and experiment.

To the rest of the world, these people seemed like rogue geniuses or magicians. How could they make all these discoveries seemingly out of thin air?

Once it was written down, it was clear that there was a process and, if it was systematically followed, more discoveries were to be had. In the eight hundred years since the general acceptance of the method, there has been more scientific discovery than in all of human history preceding it.

Many successful people seem to have some magic power, but in reality, they are following a process they’ve discovered, through trial and error, and internalized.

A scientist wouldn’t start an experiment by making his objective: “Make amazing discovery.”

He would have a simple testable hypothesis and a procedure for proving or disproving it. Though his hope, in the long run, is to make an amazing discovery, he knows that the fastest way to get there is to prove (or disprove) the hypothesis as quickly as possible.

The worst thing a scientist can do is leave a hypothesis in limbo. By quickly disproving, he can move on. Edison is reported to have said “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” That’s a big discovery that only came from a lot of disproved hypotheses.

We make this same mistake in our businesses and careers. We start with the goal of, “make an amazing career,” instead of focusing on something discreet then quickly proving or disproving it.

This is another reason I like planning in 90-day sprints. If I choose something to work on that’s both falsifiable and within my control like “write 500 words every day”, then I can focus on executing that goal rather than worrying about if it is the right goal.

If it doesn’t get the results I want, that is data to make better future hypotheses. I am judging myself not by whether I was a magician that knew how things would work out at the start, but on whether I followed the plan I created.

It’s also demoralizing if you don’t hit the initial goal.

Instead of viewing it as feedback, you view it (and yourself) as a failure.

In the end, no investor-you can guarantee a single investment is successful — but they can control their long-term returns by following a simple process.

# The Upside of Quitting&#58; Why Quitters Always Win and Losers Never Quit

## 

“Quitters never win and winners never quit.”

These are the infamous words of legendary NFL coach, Vincent Lombardi, considered by many to be one the greatest coaches in American sport history.

Almost half a century after his death, Lombardi’s words are still a good representation of what we believe about success today — that winners never give up and losers always quit.

But, what if our beliefs about success are backwards?

What if quitting could improve the odds of success and grit or perseverance could leave us worse off?

## The Art of Not Losing Money

In the business of trading, roughly 90% of day traders lose their money, whilst the remaining 10% make obscene amounts of money. [1]

We’re talking hundreds of millions of dollars a year lost by the losers and gained by the winners.

At some point in the 1980s, Jack Schwager, a renowned expert in futures trading (the buying and selling of an item in the future, based on an agreed price today), began his search for answers to what separates the winning traders from the losing pack.

To solve this mystery, over the next twenty years or so, Schwager researched and interviewed the most successful traders of our time — including traders who had amassed billions of dollars, averaged 30 percent returns on their money each year for up to twenty-one years and grew thirty thousand dollars into eighty million dollars.

After putting together his findings, Schwager discovered a common trait — aside from skill level — shared by the top traders.

A common trait that provides some insight into a habit shared by highly successful people across all fields.

## The Cost of “Get-There-Itis”

![](0*H9OUgxpRCOz59cOm.jpg)

On one hazy, dark night in July of 1999, John F.Kennedy Jr. — the son of President John F.Kennedy — piloted the take off of a flight, en-route to Martha’s Vineyard for the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.

As Kennedy navigated the aircraft along the Connecticut coastline and over Rhode Island Sound, a sudden haze and darkness clouded his vision.

Kennedy was disoriented, he could no longer see what direction the plane was flying towards. And then, in a random series of maneuvers, he swiveled the plane to the right and the left, upwards, then downwards — all at varying speeds.

A few miles from his final destination, Kennedy lost control of the plane. Moments later, it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean.

A couple of days afterwards, a rescue team of divers recovered the dead bodies of Kennedy and the passengers — his wife and sister-in-law.

Since the tragic death of John F.Kennedy Jr, there have been several investigations into the possible causes of the plane crash.

Some point the finger at the poor flight visibility caused by the hazy, dark weather condition. Others point to his inexperience of flying a plane in nighttime conditions.

According to Dr. Douglas Lonnstrom, Siena College professor and experienced pilot, there is one standout possible cause — it’s called “get-there-itis.” [2]

“Get-there-itis” — a common word used and sometimes joked about by pilots — is the determination of a pilot to reach a destination, even when flying in conditions that are very dangerous.

Lonnstrom alongside a good handful of experienced pilots suggest that Kennedy had been blinded by “Get-there-itis” on the day of the plane crash.

Prior to takeoff, Kennedy had promised both his sister, Caroline, who was vacationing in Idaho with her family and his wife, Carolyn, that he would arrive at Martha’s Vineyard that night and attend the wedding.

Kennedy was determined to fulfill these promises and fly to the destination, despite two other pilots cancelling their flights due to the bad weather conditions.

In the end, Kennedy’s “Get-there-itis” cost not only his life, but also the lives of his loved ones.

If Kennedy had quit the flight plans, instead of persevering to reach his destination, three lives would have been saved on that day.

## Cutting Your Losses to Win Big

![](0*TnNUA2hfPrtC-N9d.jpg)

Just like Kennedy’s determination to reach his destination, despite bad weather conditions, “get-there-itis” could also blind us in persevering towards achieving a goal, even when the costs outweigh the benefits.

A headstrong determination to persist with a bad business idea, job, relationship, friendship and so on, could cost us much of our money, energy, health and time, which we can never get back.

Once a significant amount of time, money and energy has been invested towards a goal, it becomes more difficult to quit, even though sticking to the goal could cost us as much, if not much more than what we’ve lost already. [3]

Winners avoid “get-there-itis” and pick the right moment to give up on a goal.

In the world of trading, Schwager discovered that the common habit shared by the top traders was the ability to…

“Cut your losses and let your profits run.” (**source:** [Market Wizards: Interviews with Top Traders](http://geni.us/markettradersbook) ([Audiobook](http://geni.us/marketwizardsaudiobook)))

In the world of entrepreneurship, some of the most profitable businesses have been built, after the entrepreneur had quit on another idea and cut their losses.

For example, the social media platform, Twitter, was a *pivot* idea, built after the founders abandoned their podcasting company, Odeo.

Other examples include YouTube, originally a dating site, eBay, originally a platform for selling PEZ dispensers and Google, which began as library book search engine.

In the world of science, some of the most innovative inventions have been the sequel to a series of abandoned ideas and experiments.

For example, Sir Alexander Fleming abandoned his search for a drug to cure diseases to later discover the powerful antibiotic, penicillin.

What if these people refused to quit on their initial goals? What would the world look like today?

In the book, [The Dip: ](http://geni.us/thedipsethgodin)A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick) ([audiobook](http://geni.us/thedipaudiobook)), entrepreneur, Seth Godin, makes a strong case that winners quit all the time — they just quit the right stuff at the right time.

Winners quit on different things in their life, to create more time and energy to [devote towards something more important](https://mayooshin.com/eisenhower-matrix-important-urgent/) and rewarding to them.

Quitting also has health benefits.

According to psychologists Wrosch and Miller, ‘*goal disengagement’* — that is, giving up on our goals — could also improve overall well-being.

During their one year-long study, which involved tracking the effects of goal setting on 90 teenagers, the psychologists discovered that the participants who refused to quit on unattainable goals experienced higher levels of inflammatory molecule C-reactive protein — a protein linked with heart disease and diabetes. [4]

Winners cut their losses to win big in life.

## Quitting Like a Winner

Some goals are worth sticking with and some aren’t.

Sometimes, we have to let go of a business, friendship, relationship, job or idea, to make room for a better one — or in extreme situations, to choose life over death.

Winners quit strategically. They’re not afraid to quit, especially when the costs of sticking with a goal outweigh the benefits of pursuing a different one.

Meanwhile, just like a fighting army that has already been defeated in warfare, losers keep persevering, instead of retreating and waving a white flag of surrender.

In the end, quitters will always win and losers will never quit.

# Why you should let your children fail more often

## Why you should let your children fail more often

*I’m not going to apply for this job because I may not get it.*

I’ve heard this statement from several students in the course of my career as a law professor. And it’s not just job applications. Students are shocked when I criticize their writing. Students are distraught when they get anything less than an A-.

We’re raising a new generation that doesn’t know how to fail.

As Jessica Bennett [writes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/fashion/fear-of-failure.html) for the New York Times, “faculty at Stanford and Harvard coined the term ‘failure deprived’ to describe what they were observing: the idea that, even as they were ever more outstanding on paper, students seemed unable to cope with simple struggles.” According to the American College Health Association, this inability to confront setbacks has, in turn, correlated with an increase in depression and anxiety across college campuses.

And it’s not the students’ fault.

We’re genetically wired to fear failure. Centuries ago, failure meant getting eaten alive by a saber-tooth tiger. The ancestors who weren’t afraid of failing didn’t live long enough to pass on their genes to offspring.

We then reinforce this genetic wiring against failure in our own offspring. We don’t let them fall on the grass. We coddle them with participation trophies. We reframe their failures as successes. We focus on conventional metrics of success — the right grades, the right college, the right job.

We put their training wheels on but never take them off.

This attitude reminds me of [the famous scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FnO3igOkOk) from *A Few Good Men*. Our children are like Tom Cruise yelling, “I want the truth!” We respond as Jack Nicholson does: “You can’t handle the truth.”

To a child raised in this environment, failure can be a deeply unfamiliar experience. If children have never experienced failure, they assume they won’t be able to survive it. In their mind, failure is trauma. They become adults utterly unprepared to deal with minor setbacks and fathom even the possibility of failing — because we’ve never really let them fail before.

This deep-seated fear of failure is paralyzing. Behind every canvas unpainted, every goal unattempted, every business unlaunched, every book unwritten, and every song unsung is the looming fear of failure.

The solution?

Let your children fail more often.

I know you have the best of intentions. You’re trying to protect them and make them happy. But resist that natural parental instinct. By shielding our children from failure, we’re doing them a serious disservice.

Here are four ideas.

**1. Share your own failures with your children.**

While your children may rebel against you, they still put you on a pedestal. Tell them about how you’ve failed in your own life. Share with them your struggles at work — and even better, ask them how you should handle them. Encourage them to exercise their problem-solving muscles by developing potential solutions to your roadblocks.

**2. Allow opportunities for failure.**

I don’t mean deliberately imposing catastrophic failures on your children. I mean giving them the breathing room to fail. Encourage them to tackle complex problems, try new things, and push their boundaries.

By doing this, you’ll be vaccinating them with minor failures. Just like introducing weak antigens can stimulate learning in our immune system and prevent against infections, letting your children fail can help them build the resilience they’ll need as adults.

Take a cue from Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx. She went from selling fax machines door-to-door to becoming the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire. She credits her success to [a question](https://ozanvarol.com/contrarian-secret-success/) that her father would ask her every week when she was growing up: “What have you failed at this week?”

If Sara didn’t have an answer, her father would be disappointed. To him, failing to try was far more disappointing than failure itself.

**3. Turn failures into learning moments.**

When your children fail, approach their failure — not with dismay or angst — but with curiosity. *Isn’t it interesting how sometimes things work and other times they don’t? Let’s figure out what happened here.*

As Elizabeth Gilbert writes, “Interesting outcomes, after all, are just awful outcomes with the volume of drama turned way down.”

**4. Treat success and failure as the same.**

We assume success and failure are binary outcomes, but they’re not. The line between the two can be exceedingly thin, and we ignore it at our peril.

Learning moments for children should follow both success and failure. We tend to attribute our children’s success to their genius tendencies and good genes, and ignore the role that luck and privilege play in the process.

So, regardless of outcome, ask, *What went right here? What went wrong? And what can you learn from this?*

* * *

By the way, this post is a Trojan Horse. You should follow these strategies in your own life, as much as you do with your children.

# First I Asked Difficult Questions. Then I Quit.

## “A low shot of an elegantly dressed man with a leather bag holding a book in his hand” by Ben White on Unsplash

Several years ago, I was employed as a care worker in a large service for people with intellectual disabilities. I supported five men and five women to live independent lives in two different houses in a suburb an hour outside of Dublin, in Ireland.

Much of my job involved performing regular household maintenance and hygiene checks in these bungalows.

I ensured the toilets were clean and the fridges contained enough food. I balanced the houses’ financial accounts, paid bills on behalf of the residents and helped them shop for food in the nearby supermarket.

My job included doing all of the things necessary to keep the two houses running just as I would with my own.

Except I also had to document a significant part of what I did every day in several report books, administer medication and follow policies.

I also sometimes had to work overnight shifts for 12 to 24 hours and slept in a small, cramped bed next to the office desk.

## My manager summoned me a review.

These discussions took place every three months, and they served as a means for managers to assess the performance of their teams.

I sat on the bed next to the desk.

My manager pulled a large grey folder from the small wooden shelf, slapped it on the table and adjusted her black narrow-frame glasses.
> “I’d like you to reread this Bryan.”

She pushed the grey folder towards me.

I picked up the folder and edged away from her. She was a serious woman who believed her team wasn’t up to meeting their responsibilities, me particularly so.

On good days, I railed against her. On bad ones, I suspected she was right.

The hygiene policy was a heavy grey document. It contained dozens of pages about the household chores we had to complete each day including vacuuming, dusting, cleaning the toilets and so on. The policy also went into painstaking detail about the tick charts and daily reports to fill out.

I put the policy back on the office desk.
> “If I spend all day doing these cleaning exercises, how will I have time to take the residents out for coffee or to meet their friends?”

(A big part of the social care profession involves teaching people independent living skills many of us take for granted.)

She said:
> “When you’re on shift, the house is never clean enough. Please check there’re no crumbs in the toaster, and dust behind the back of the cupboards. We’re getting this place ready for a big hygiene inspection, and you’re letting us down.”

I asked:
> “Will this feel like a normal home for the men and women who live here if we’re going around inspecting the toaster every morning?”

My manager held her head high.
> “Just for once Bryan, I wish you would stop asking me questions. I didn’t make this up. It’s service policy; it’s your job; and if you want to work here, you need to follow it.”

## The work we were doing in the community was important and satisfying.

I enjoyed helping men and women with intellectual disabilities live full and independent lives in the community.

But I couldn’t handle the day-to-day rules and regulations. It’s in my DNA to ask questions and wonder why I should do things one way and not another.

After school, but before starting my career in social care, I trained for four years as a journalist.

We didn’t talk about fake news back then, but journalism lecturers highlighted the importance of speaking up to authority, of holding anyone who says, “This is how we do things” to account and of asking difficult questions.

My manager didn’t appreciate my difficult questions, and journalism wasn’t paying the bills.

Still, I struggled to get past her habit of criticising team members by leaving notes for everyone to read in a household communication book.

As a team, we relied on this book to hand over information to each other, but it had become a public ledger of my professional failings. My manager often recorded what I’d forgotten to do for everyone to read in this tattered red book, which sat on the office table.

I told myself my manager was doing her best to comply with regulations and policies she had no control over.

I needed to either fall right in line or rise up and into a new role within the service. The pay was OK, and who was I to put pride before compliance?

## I enrolled for a masters degree in intellectual disabilities.

I studied. I filled in the tick charts. I read the communication book. I checked the household car for defects. I wrote lengthy reports. I administered medication. I read every policy, and I worked day after day. even showed new team members the way and cleaned behind the toaster.

Most of all, I stopped asking difficult questions.

After I finished college (again), I imagined myself ready for promotion.

So when a more senior internal vacancy came up, I applied.

I was finally ready to manage my own house. I would hold my team in higher regard than my manager us. I would wield household policy with a velvet glove rather than with an iron fist. And I would do away with the household communication book.

A few weeks later, my manager called me into the office.
> “I’ve bad news.”

She pushed an envelope across the table. It was from HR.
> “Thank you for applying for the role, but we are not calling you forward for interview at this time.”

The HR director wrote about not recognizing my qualification as an appropropriate one and wished me well with my studies.

My manager smiled.
> “You have plenty of work to do here. Now about our hygiene inspection…”

I knew then I was irrevocably stuck.

## I came home after work and argued with my wife.

“I can’t deal with the depth of madness in that place, and my manager is complaining about my inability to clean the place,” I said.

“They want us to be caretakers, cleaners, doctors, nurses, mechanics, personal assistants and more, and it’s never enough. Why do I have to put up with their unrealistic expectations?”

“You don’t,” my wife said.

“What do you mean?”

“If you hate the job so much, why don’t you just quit?”

“That’s a ridiculous idea,” I said. “I need a paying job. Why would you say something like that? You don’t understand what I’ve to put up with.”

“I understand more than you realize.”

I went upstairs to write about our argument, but instead I reread old entries from my journal.

One began like this:
> “I came home from work last Thursday. I sat in the car outside the house for 20 minutes in silence. What is it about this job I hate so much?”

And another:
> “After work today, I could barely speak to anyone. It was all I could do to go straight to bed. What am I working for?”

In a way, my journal had become a personal communication book, and I needed to find an answer for questions that kept surfacing in my entries.

Worst of all, I was afraid.

## An office job came up outside of intellectual disabilities.

![Photo by [raquel raclette](https://unsplash.com/@raquelraclette?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*17SPCGyOK0DQehfC)*Photo by [raquel raclette](https://unsplash.com/@raquelraclette?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

At first, I was torn.

Did I really want to turn my back on years of study and hard work?

On the one side lay the security of my current job. It promised stable pay, tedious hygiene checks and stifling policies.

On the other side lay a pay cut and the uncertainty of a career change.

My masters and time spent building a career in an intellectual disability service be damned. Security was turning me into an anxious, depressed and prematurely bald man in his early thirties.

I resigned.

By then my manager was on leave, so I worked out my notice quietly. On my last day, I left my manager a note in the household communication book.

I explained all I had done. I took extra care to document everything there was left to do. I didn’t want them to miss a thing. I wrote:
> “The new team members are querying the latest policies and have lots of questions. They need answers.”

Was I retaliating by leaving a note like that in the communication book?

Perhaps. But a secure and well-paying job or career wasn’t enough to quench my inner nature. It burned like a fire in a neighbour’s house and threatened to leap out and burn me up unless I acted.

I’m compelled to ask difficult questions even if I don’t always like where the answers take me. Although my next job didn’t work out either, my only real regret is that I took so long to quit because I was afraid of what lay on the other side.

# Investing in Startups&#58; Three Traits of Mission-Driven Founders

## 

## What Makes a Mission-Driven Founder?

*By Ian Faison, Chief Content Officer of The Mission*

Here at The Mission, we are obsessed with working with companies that have a strong mission (it’s in the name after all!)

As we speak to executives, investors, founders, and leaders, one topic comes up often:

Does it matter to have a mission? Does it make your team better or more focused? Does it make economic sense? Are mission-driven companies really better?

In the first installment of this series, we spoke with two venture capitalists about the type of founders they look for and invest in.

Brandon Shelton and Nitin Pachisia have different backgrounds and seem to invest in different types of founders.

Brandon invests in founding teams with military veteran founders.

Nitin invests in founding teams with immigrant founders.

But as it turns out, those founders have very similar traits…

## Three Traits of Mission-Driven Founders

*By: Brandon Shelton, Managing Partner, TFX Capital*

At TFX Capital our motto is “Mission Driven, People Focused.” It is derivative of a Marine Corps saying of “Mission First, People Always.”

As investors, it is essential that you differentiate good founders from great early on. Top performing founders clearly articulate the company mission and drive results.

We have spoken with hundreds of investors to find what separates the good from the best. And they all come back to one thing: mission-driven.

Why? Because mission-driven founders are the ones who* will *produce results.

But how do you identify a founder as mission-driven? At TFX Capital, we pursue mission-driven founders who possess these three traits:

### **Empathy Through Adversity**

They possess “**Empathy Through Adversity.”**

We know that every member of the Veteran community chose to serve, generally during the ages of 18–25 years old, and started off with a very different problem set than their civilian peers. Salaries were public knowledge and promotion schedules in the early days were set, thus, individuals have no other choice but serve the team, something greater than themselves.

Each individual also undergoes professional leadership and operational training with straightaway opportunities to manage risks, lead direct reports, and explore their decision freedoms within a framework.

The US military has been forcing these young leaders to fail early and often as part of that leadership and operational evolution. When we add the volume and uncertainty of the post-9/11 mission set coupled with unprecedented levels of technology tools and the complexity of real-time communications, these young leaders face adversity at a near constant tempo.

For some leaders, they begin to harvest an empathy through this process — a certain humility. Sheer willpower, smarts, effort or luck will not win the day. Rather, leading others and self while moving forward accelerates the leader’s learning at a very young age. This set of experiences is common with junior leaders in today’s military and hard to replicate in the commercial sector until after a period of many years or decades.

### **Coachable**

They are “**Coachable”** even without distinct feedback loops.

Founders of startups are already driving in a direction others would not. They have stepped out to build a company, solve a problem and take maximum commercial risk to do so. They have departed known feedback or management loops from the military or their last commercial role at a larger company. Many times they are quite stubborn and close-minded but generally due to a passionate focus on executing their vision.

These founders have investors, teammates and perhaps even a Board, but they lack traditional feedback loops due to structure and time. But their desire to learn, improve as leaders, and serve their teams does not stop because they are mission-driven to solve the problem.

### **Domain Expertise**

Finally, they have “**Domain Expertise”** in the problem or market they are trying to solve.

These founders have felt the pain of the problem first hand which provoked the call to action. They believe equally in their hearts AND their minds that the problem must be solved —“if not me, then who?”

They are willing to risk it all because they understand the impact the solution could have on their network, their customers, and/or the issue at hand. They understand the landscape and confidently step forward to burden more than their fair share of the task.

## Why Choose Mission-Driven Founders?

*By Nitin Pachisia, Founding Partner, Unshackled Ventures*

At Unshackled Ventures, we are fortunate to have partnered with many purpose-driven entrepreneurs in our young journey as a VC. We don’t actively look for purpose-driven entrepreneurs as a thesis, but we tend to align with them when we meet them. This is most likely because of our own background of how we started Unshackled Ventures. Mission is not the largest weight in our investment decision, but it’s one of the factors we view positively.

### They Have Grit and Motivation

In my opinion, the biggest advantage purpose-driven founders (and by extension investors in those founders) have is that extra motivation to stay in the game, find a way to make things work, and not give up. It adds to their resolve, grit and adversity muscle.

Building a company is a long journey, and there are many adverse situations along the way. Having a mission or purpose provides the extra fuel to keep trying until a way out of the adversity is found. Since most startups fail, anything that improves the odds of success gives you an unfair advantage. Founders who are working in areas they are passionate about and feel connected by a purpose are more likely to succeed.

### A Mission Helps with Recruiting

The purpose also helps with recruiting. In the early days of building a company, hiring great talent is a critical factor. Startups that offer a way to associate with a bigger purpose are not only able to compete with larger companies, but also find people who are self-starters, driven, and motivated to go above and beyond. This separates great startups from good ones. While purpose is not the only way to attract great talent, it is one of the more effective ways.

### ‘Why’ is More Important Than ‘What’

We are not impact investors, so we don’t seek mission-driven founders. But given that we primarily invest in people (we invest closest to formation stage, pre-product, pre-customers), we often get to learn *why* the entrepreneur is doing what they are doing. So there is more focus on why they are building the company, not what they are building. This exercise helps you understand what drives the entrepreneur, their analytical framework, and value system. When evaluating startups, we’ve found this knowledge to be extremely valuable during the investment process.

# How To Get YourSelf Psyched Up To Do Something You Don’t Want To Do.

## Image Credit: Universal Pictures/Legend Film

Every day I’d park my car on the other side of Melbourne City next to a chemical factory because it was free.

As soon as I got out of the car, I could smell the chemicals and I would feel a burning sensation down the back of my throat. I’d walk about 30 minutes from my car to the call center where I worked, holding an old shopping bag with one muesli bar and a can of Minestrone Soup. **The office building was old and had smelled like cigarettes because half the workers smoked to escape the realization that their dreams weren’t working out.**

Working in a call center was tough. I had all my calls listened to by team leaders and these magical fairies called “Quality Assurance.” Their job was to listen to my calls and email me feedback on each one. They were also responsible for seeing if there were any breaches of compliance given that there was financial advice involved. Many of these magical fairies had never taken a call in their life but would talk down to you like they had. If they didn’t like you, or you question their feedback, they’d mark you down consistently. This led to your income capacity being reduced and in some cases getting fired.

The lady that listened to my calls was named Wendy. She’d been with the company for several decades and smoked more cigarettes than Marge Simpson’s twin sisters Selma and Patty. She was drastically overweight and proud of it. Her hair was grey like a witch and no meeting was complete without a bottle of Coke and a pack of smokes on the desk. She smelled like how I did when I flew to Europe and went two days without a shower because of the flight and back-to-back stopovers.

![](1*tF4vnkcC7TNJ0eQi5e4GWA.png)
> # Working in the call center was rough, but I thought in my mind “Somewhere there’s a guy/girl that’s doing the same thing and one day they are going to be CEO or start a seven-figure business.”

Someday I’d be working with that guy/girl because I knew I had similar potential. That same person was going through the same struggle I was — I wasn’t the first. I decided to use my ‘starting from the bottom career opportunity’ to go further than I could ever imagine. In week one, I hit 200% of sales target and won an award. By month two I was winning every award that was available. I was getting referrals to other departments when my colleagues said it wasn’t possible.

The guy sitting next to me ran the call center union. He spent his days fighting the company and saying *“We need more money and better benefits. We work too damn hard not to get them.”*

In reality, he’d have two-hour lunches, break for tea and a biscuit every 60-minutes, and gossip behind all the leader’s backs. He didn’t deserve anything because he didn’t work at all. I did though. My day job was very much an individual pursuit. I was part of a twelve-person team, but all of them were on performance review except me. They all hated their job and just wanted a payout. Not me. The downside of becoming like my colleagues was that I knew I’d have huge regrets.

![](1*vBfftX1NY8W7u70m2axdMw.jpeg)

These regrets would cause me to become pissed off and want to celebrate Friday like everybody else. I wasn’t going to have that. Not over my dead body!

I used my energy to do the best I could to break my personal bests and improve myself in the process. This led to me getting time off the phone, to use as I pleased. I used this time away from the phone to watch Ted Talks with my manager.

**I also made the bold decision to go to the company directory and ring senior leaders who typically made $500K plus bonus.**

I’d ring their mobile phone and they’d ask where I worked. I told them I was in the call center and had big dreams. To my surprise they didn’t laugh at me — they actually wanted to help me and they did. One of them ran the face-to-face sales business and offered to keep in touch with me about roles. 
I eventually got a role working for him and selling face-to-face with the six-figure pay cheque that went with it. In this role, I built up even more skills. A lot of it was done on my own and I had to find motivation within myself. On the way to an appointment, I’d pump Tony Robbins MP3’s in my car or read ten minutes of Think And Grow Rich.

The gig was hard and the sales targets were incredibly hard to reach. I did reach them though. Every. Damn. Week.

There were many painful moments during this process. I went through some rough breakups and even dealt with a mental illness that would come and go. My confidence levels were up and down like a yo-yo. While working this job, I’d keep looking for other jobs but often fall short. People would promise me careers and then it would never happen. At the same time, I tried to do my own interviews with entrepreneurs via Skype. No one online was that excited by them and I eventually stopped doing them.

One night out of frustration, I wrote a blog post that was all about my own struggles and how I overcame them. I felt like I was standing in the middle of the street with crowds of people walking past me on the way to the Football while I was wearing nothing at all and had all my bits showing and simultaneously freezing my ass off.

I hit publish on that blog post and a lot changed. **84,000 people shared it.** I got emails from lots of interesting people.

I’d then go to my sales job each day with a secret weapon in my pocket. I kept my overnight success quiet from my work colleagues. All of that changed when I was asked to present to the sales team. I shared my online story with them all. Many of them were shocked. They knew I worked the same rough job as them with all the pitfalls yet after hours I had somehow found this secret passion that others loved too.

I’d created this new life for myself.

![Image Credit Unsplash](1*bKvEVsKa0tfhoOkgzYFJmA.png)*Image Credit Unsplash*

Pretty soon I got a major promotion in my career and the online success grew quickly. Those years working in the call center were hard. I did the work when nobody else around me would. I put in the effort not quite knowing what was at the end of the rainbow.
> # Getting psyched up every day to work a boring call center job was all based on the idea that I could do something incredible if I started from the bottom and focused on small wins each day.

What separated me from everybody else was that I embraced the boredom and the pain of my call center job to take my life to the next level. I got the career I wanted and a side-hustle I love by being okay with the mediocrity I had to deal with in the short-term.

Pushing through boredom and pain is the difference.

# Build Your Reputation, But Don’t be Afraid to Destroy It

## 

This is the story of a guy who didn’t let his reputation stop him from being successful…

**This is an episode of [*The Story](https://apple.co/2G0hs4l)* podcast. You can listen to an audio version of the following story on [iTunes](https://apple.co/2MN4TKf) or [Google Play](http://bit.ly/2tqnLGk).**

## And now… onto [The Story](http://thestorypodcast.com)

A young man was brought into a company by its CEO to consult with its executives.

The executives were in the process of making one mistake after another, and the young man knew what was going to happen. They were going to kill the business, and then he told them so.

Each time he brought up a new solution to their problems, the executives found something wrong with it.

He told them his credentials. He’d done this before — and not to brag — he’d done it in a way that was at a far larger scale than any of them. So why weren’t they listening and taking his advice?!

The execs provided no argument at all except making scoffing noises, then looking at each other and laughing.

It was maddening.

The young man didn’t let disrespect like this go…

Now the conversation devolves into shouting — it was the young man against the older execs. None of the older businessmen could believe it. Nobody told *them *what to do, but this young guy, with a beard, who was not even a part of their company, was sitting at the head of their conference table and yelling at them!

Before the young man could continue, he felt a huge hand fall on his shoulder.

It was the CEO who invited him to consult with his team of executives.

Now everyone in the room was silent. The CEO told the young man to either calm himself or leave.

Crestfallen, the young man left. He walked out of the conference room and into the foggy California morning. In the parking lot, he sank into the seat of his Mercedes and started to cry.

A few minutes later, he heard a knock on the window.

It was the CEO. The CEO was shocked. He had been watching the young man sob. Did he really care that much about getting his point across?!

The CEO had never seen an outsider, employee, exec, consultant, advisor, investor or vendor — nobody — who cared this much about business.

The young man got out of the car and the CEO patted him on the back.

“‘It’s okay,” said the CEO. “I get that you’re trying to help, and you think that we’re making a mistake.”

“You are,” said the young man. “I was trying to warn your team so you don’t lose the business. If you don’t do what I recommended, the business will collapse.”

The CEO chuckled and shook his head. “You don’t let it drop, do you?”

“No,” said the young man. “Not when it’s a life or death thing for the business.”

“I think it’s just a different style of communicating,” said the CEO. “My executives aren’t used to it.”

‘I’m sorry. I’m too wound up,” he said. “I live in two worlds.”

“It’s okay. You should come back in,” said the old man.

“I’m going to leave. I know I was out of order. I just wanted them to listen.”

“It’s okay. Come back in.”

“I’m going to go in and apologize. And then I’m going to leave,” said the young man.

To the CEO’s disbelief, the young man, with streaks of tears still on his face, walked into the room filled with older executives, apologized, then left without saying another word.

The CEO and execs would never see the young man in person again. But they soon saw him everywhere else. As the years went by, they remembered his advice. It had been spot on… almost prophetic. They didn’t follow it, and because of that, almost lost the business.

An outsider or casual observer might look at this situation and think something like:

*What a highly emotional person, he must have ruined his reputation.*

*What a wimp.*

*Crying in front of business associates? You’re done.*

*Nobody will respect you if you get angry in public.*

*That young guy sounds unbalanced.*

*OMG, can you imagine having somebody like that working here?*

The young man had big ideas and he cared.

The problem was, at the time he gave his advice to the execs, his current situation didn’t suggest that they should listen.

He had been ousted from his first company, and now that company was in serious debt.

The young man had a reputation for having a never-ending stream of ideas. What was worse, he seemed to think that most of them were good. On top of that, the young man was trying to start two new companies at once.

These were all red flags to the execs.

Besides, the young guy couldn’t make it through a business meeting without yelling or crying!

You might think that the young man in the story would go on to a life of obscurity, or fail to have a successful business career.

For a while, it looked like this would be the case.

After being kicked out of his first company, the young man spent a decade in the wilderness. He had “destroyed” his reputation.

But what if destroying our reputation is exactly what we need?

What if not being afraid to destroy our reputation — in pursuit of truth — is a superpower?

The young man in the story is Steve Jobs.

![](1*aZi6qrYmlhYqZBh5uD-dtQ.jpeg)

Steve’s story forces us to ask some serious questions.

Is a full range of emotions, and extreme sincerity really so bad?

What if caring about something so much that you break down crying when you defend it… isn’t a bad thing?

So, what brings *you *to tears?

What things do you care so much about that you’d yell and fight for them?

We’re constantly told that reputation is something that takes decades to build, and can be destroyed in minutes. That’s only partially true.

One of Steve Jobs favorite poets, Rumi, has a great line:
> # *“Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.”*

What most people think of as their “reputation” is really just a narrow bounds of permissible behavior that the people around them will tolerate. They will not threaten their “reputation” for much of anything, especially the pursuit of truth. But what they don’t realize is that most of this is just a hallucination. Other people are watching and judging, but they have short memories and are mostly worried about themselves.

In order to pursue truth, serve others, and create a business that is a force for good, we might have to destroy our “reputations.” We might have to build a new reputation. One that rubs some people the wrong way. One that inspires other people… the right people.

If you have interesting ideas you care about, don’t be afraid to look like an emotional fool when you try to articulate or sell them to others.

Some people will think you’re stupid, weak, or unstable. They’ll report you, laugh, make fun of you… they’ll have a very narrow view of what your reputation should be, and they won’t be afraid to tell you.

But like the philosopher Epictetus says,
> # *“If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.”*

Sometimes they’ll be right — you might look, talk, or do something idiotic. So what? Go into the parking lot, cry if you have to… then come back in and apologize.

**The great achievements in this world are reserved for those willing to look like a fool in the eyes of society. **Reputation can be helpful to get things done. But sometimes what some people consider “reputation” is just a cult of politeness, nihilism, or an excuse for inaction.

To have a full life, we must find things that we care about so much that we’re willing to argue, fight, and persevere for. The only way we can do this is by exploring the full spectrum of human emotions. The only way to do that? By being willing to destroy our reputation if need be.

In today’s world and culture, it’s become cool to always be polite, and not show any strong emotions except offense for anything deemed “not polite” or “offensive.”

In the modern business world, it’s become cool to criticize people like Steve Jobs. There are many who have achieved nothing of note, yet feel compelled to critique Jobs as simply “mean.” Then, they spend their days protecting their reputation of being “nice” and polite.

Meanwhile, the lessons of Jobs and Apple go unexamined. If Jobs was really so “mean,” then why did so many people voluntarily seek him out and work for him? Why did so many of them show up at his funeral? And why is Apple the most valuable company in the world today?

As the writer David Foster Wallace’s famous commencement speech reminds us:
> “There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, ‘Morning, boys, how’s the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, ‘What the hell is water?’”

We are fish in water. We’re swimming in a cultural ocean and the water is politeness. People don’t dare show anger unless it’s directed at one or two socially and culturally approved lightning rods. There is no longer any room for nuances, overreactions, smart critiques, or righteous anger! If someone dare shows anger (for anything) there are thousands of other fish who will immediately isolate them, or try to force them to admit that they have a physiological problem.

So if your friend is getting ready to ruin their business, and you can’t seem to get them to change their mind, but they’re headed for a cliff they don’t see… and they’re refusing to listen to you…

Get emotional about it, and get angry if you have to! Don’t let them or their business fall off a cliff.

To get started, you’ll have to build your reputation.

But to take things to the next level, you might have to destroy your reputation and become notorious.

# Stop Overthinking&#58; 11 Simple Ways to Take Back Control

## 

“*It seems like you created a problem out of nothing*.”

At first, I tried to explain. I was perfectly right in my assumptions and speculations. I was right to be irritated and you know…. right.

But then, I realized… This person had a point. Not only had I been overthinking this particular situation, I had also created stories in my head that weren’t true. Stories that made me anxious, worried, and annoyed. Oops!

Eventually, I gave in. My ego and I surrendered in one big: “*You know what… you’re right.*”

Overthinking can start off as something small and innocent. Your mind might tell you something like, “*Oh, we’re just going to explore different options here*”. But unless you stop it at a reasonable time, it can bring you into a place of inaction and oh-so-many negative thoughts.

“*They said this… but what did they really mean?*“

“*Did I make the right choice? Yes, probably. But what if I didn’t? Oh damn… what if I didn’t?!*”

“*I want to write a book, but where, how and when do I start? Now? Tomorrow? Next year? Can I even do this? Who am I to write a book?*”

Overthinking turns small problems into big and scary Mount Everests. It triggers anxiety and might also keep you up at night. (Ever been there?) It can also turn you into the difficult person who wants to control everything.

I know what it’s like to overthink (projects, relationships, next steps — you name it). But, by now I also know how to get myself out of the* too-much-thinking* and to take back control. Here are some of my best tips to do just that.

## 1. Stop building momentum

Similar thoughts have a tendency to follow each other. Lousy thoughts attract more lousy thoughts. Fearful thoughts attract more fearful thoughts etc. If you start going down a trail of negative thinking and do nothing to stop it — you’ll walk into more negative thoughts. It’s like a black hole.

Your job isn’t to stop thinking (we’ve all tried that and it *doesn’t* work). No, instead, your job is to slow down the momentum of thoughts. To make the rushing train of thoughts go a little slower. So, instead of fueling it with more energy, choose to become an observer. Observing what’s going on in your mind can, at first, feel overwhelming. But after a while, the momentum will subside and you’ll start calming the chaos. Ahh!

## 2. Start asking yourself better questions

Your mind will give you the answer to whatever question you ask. If you ask yourself, “*What could go wrong?*” then your mind will tell you all the possible scenarios of what could go wrong. Useful? Perhaps during a short moment, but most people tend to freeze up when they think about negative outcomes. Instead, they end up doing nothing. (And let’s face it, 99% of those things will probably never even happen).

So, instead, make sure to ask questions that will benefit you. “*What can I do about this situation?*” is a much better question to ask. It will make your mind look for helpful and insightful answers.

## 3. Write down your problem and its solution

If you have a problem, there is for sure a solution available. But as long as you have your eyes fixed on the problem, you’re not going to be able to see, or figure out, the solution. (Because those are two different things, right?)

To shift focus, list your current problems or worries on a piece of paper. Then next to each problem, write down a solution. If you don’t know the end solution right now, write down the next logical step. Maybe it’s about making a phone call? Maybe it’s about giving something a try? Maybe it’s about deciding to focus only on what you can control (hint: yourself) in a particular situation?

## 4. Get into imperfect action

Ohoy! Do you have a little perfectionist inside of you? If yes, he or she might be the one stopping you from moving forward. As Elizabeth Gilbert said, “*I think perfectionism is just fear in fancy shoes and a mink coat, pretending to be elegant when actually it’s just terrified*.” She nailed it.

To move past your inner perfectionist, commit to imperfect action. Leave something 80% finished before you pick it up again, or before you hand it over. This can be scary as s**t, I know. But what I’ve discovered is that not leaving something “perfect”, will instead trigger new thoughts and ideas — both for yourself next time you pick it up, or for the other person. (Also, you can say, “*I left it about 80% done because I wanted your thoughts on it before I finalize it*.”)

## 5. Meditate yourself into calmness

According to the [National Science Foundation](https://subliminalpro.com/thoughts/), our brains produce as many as 50,000 thoughts per day. Some even say that it’s more like 70,000 thoughts per day. Out of them, 95% are said to be repetitive. Holy moly, right?

No question that we have a lot of thoughts per day. For many people, a big part of those thoughts are negative. One of the most ancient techniques to calm your mind is through meditation. When you meditate you reduce stress, anxiety, and enhance your self-esteem and optimism — among many other [scientific benefits](https://liveanddare.com/benefits-of-meditation/).

## 6. Zoom out to see the bigger picture

Do you find it easy to give someone else advice? But, when it comes to yourself it’s like executing mission impossible? That’s because your problem is right in front of you, and with someone else, you’re able to see a bigger picture. When we zoom out from our problem and add more perspectices, we’re often able to find better solutions.

To broaden your perspective ask yourself, “*Will this matter in 20 years?*” and “*What advice would my 90-year-old *self give* to me right now?*”

## 7. Declutter from social media

Oh oh oh! This is a key one. Did you know that every minute [300 hours of video](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/amazing-social-media-statistics-and-facts/) are uploaded to YouTube? And that the average user spends 35 minutes on Facebook per day? And that Google processes over 100 billion searches every month?

Crazy, no? No doubt that we live in a society with information overload. Often what we need, when we’re in a place of overthinking, isn’t a new strategy or recommendation — but to trust that we have all the information necessary to move forward. Decide to declutter from social media and instead focus on your next logical step.

## 8. Realize what’s within your control

Thinking stuff through, again and again, is often a sign that we’re trying to control everything. Because what would happen if you failed or made a mistake? Gulp!

So instead of trying to control everything, see how you can control what’s within your control: your perspective and reactions. Choose to see a potential failure as a learning, a rejection as proof that you tried, and an embarrassment as a sign that you’re one of the few people taking steps outside your comfort zone. Either you succeed or learn. Those are your two only options.

## 9. Give yourself the benefit of the doubt

If you’re in a negative spiral where you question yourself and your abilities, give yourself the benefit of the doubt. Maybe you’re more capable than you think? Maybe the solution is easier and closer than you think? Maybe you’ve been doing it right all along?

My point is this: beating yourself up isn’t the solution. That will only fuel the overthinking. Instead ask yourself, “*What would I tell someone I love if they were in the same situation?*” Not only will you feel better when you’re nicer to yourself, but you’ll also start opening up to solutions faster when you’re in a relaxed state.

## 10. Ask yourself, “What would this look like if it were simple?”

A while back, [Tim Ferriss](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminphardy/2017/12/13/by-asking-himself-this-9-word-question-tim-ferriss-changed-his-life/#2f20405b5df5) openly admitted to having, at least a partial, midlife crises. To move from the anxiety and overwhelm, he began asking himself, “*What would this look like if it were easy?*”

What I love about this question is that it forces you to turn complexity into simplicity. Often we have a tendency to complicate things. (Not only me doing that, right?) But perhaps, there’s often an easier way of accomplishing things than what we initially think? Let this question guide you towards the simplest path.

## 11. Start over tomorrow

Do you remember when your parents told you to “sleep on it”? This advice might be more powerful than you think. When we sleep the momentum of thoughts stops. So when we wake up in the morning we have a chance for a new start.

So if all else fails, choose to start again tomorrow. When you wake up the following day, start by counting three blessings. This will help stir your mind in a positive direction.

## Chill Down And Focus On Solutions

Overthinking often leads to inaction and general frustration. Eventually, we might find ourselves caught up in a negative spiral that’s not leading us in a desirable direction.

To stop the *analysis paralysis* and to take back control, start with one thing from the list above. Then, once you’ve done that, move on to another. Soon, you might become a master at moving from problem to solution, from inaction to action, and from overthinking to constructive thinking.

Boomshakalaka! You can do this.

# When to stop trying

## When to stop trying

### How to unlock the subtle shift between frustration and success

*I try to meditate every morning.*

*I try to go to the gym three times a week.*

*I try to launch a successful online business.*

The words we use to describe reality determine the set of choices we have.

Whenever you tell yourself that you try, you let yourself off the hook.

You have done your best, but somehow, external circumstances don’t seem to agree.

There is nothing else you can do.

We celebrate trying, and we say things like *“oh well, at least I tried”*.

By masking a defeat as a victory, you give up all the precious feedback and the ability to do better next time, and finally get close to your goal (so you can stop trying).

**Trying is playing not to lose.**

Here are three things you can do next time you use the word trying:

## Claim back what’s within your control

What’s really holding you back?

Too often, we get hung up on variables outside of our control and forget about those that actually are within our control.

You may not be able to decide when you need to be in the office by, but you can decide what happens on the way, at what time you wake up, at what time to go to bed.

## Check your present values

We technically all have time to go to the gym twice a day, but it may not be a priority (let alone sensible): there are other things you value more than that, and they should get more time resources.

Yet, we rarely manage this tradeoff intentionally.

Next time you find yourself trying to do something (without success), look at what you are giving priority instead. What other activities are taking up your day?

You [can’t fabricate more time](https://www.timezillionaire.com/waste-time/), but you can allocate it better if you know what matters to you.

## Look at the bigger picture

We often ignore the larger impact of a single action, thinking it happens in isolation, at the expense of everything else. So we have to choose between “me” and “them”, between “work” and “life”.

When you focus on the larger impact, you’ll find ways to align your activities, so they support each other instead of competing.

Meditation will impact your thinking at work; feeling great in your body will impact your confidence; investing in yourself will make you more interesting to others. The opposite is true

## Adjust your actions

Now that you know what’s within your control, what you truly value most right now, and what the larger impact of your goals is, it’s time to change your actions.

After all, repeating what didn’t work so far will only keep you stuck trying.

So look at the previous steps, and change your approach.

![](0*djF-0QOJC3QoqHvp.jpg)

To stop trying, focus on what’s under your control and be clear on what’s really important to you.

Then adjust your actions to go all in on what matters.

– Matt

# Take the “Free” Out of Freelance

## Take the “Free” Out of Freelance

### ***And Get Paid***

After freelancing for a decade, it’s safe to say I think about it quite a bit.

As a one man/woman army, a freelancer has to wear a lot of hats, constantly balancing all of the responsibilities that naturally come with working for yourself.

Now, this isn’t one of those “let-me-bury-the-point-of-this-post-so-you’ll-read-the-entire-post” posts that are scattered all over Medium.

In fact, I think both the headline and subheadline make the point of this post pretty damn clear:

### Too many people trick freelancers into doing free work. Do yourself a favor and don’t be one of them.

See? It doesn’t get any clearer than that.

Call me a pessimist, but when a company or a client sees a freelancer, they see an easy target — someone who most likely isn’t able to protect their own interests.

Don’t believe me?

If this wasn’t an issue, do you think a website like [No!Spec](https://www.nospec.com/) would exist?

If you’re not familiar with speculative work (spec work), then you probably don’t work in a traditional “creative” industry.

A lot of companies in these industries will ask for potential vendors (both companies and individuals) to complete unpaid work for the chance at capturing a paid project.

If this sounds completely insane to you, that’s because it is.

Can you imagine walking into a doctor’s office for the first time and asking them for a free checkup just to prove that he/she knows what they’re doing?

For some reason, freelancers (especially designers and writers) aren’t given the same amount of respect as their professional counterparts.

That’s why we need to stick up for ourselves because, when it comes down to it, no one else will.

As a freelancer, one of those previously mentioned hats needs to be “agent.”

In other words, you need to be your own advocate when it comes to doing spec work. Otherwise, you’ won’t be freelancing very long.

Now, you might be thinking:
> # “What’s the difference between spec work and doing pro bono work?”

It comes down to choice.

With spec work, someone else is asking you to work for free. With pro bono work, you are the one that is deciding to donate your services.

See the difference here?

In a perfect world, asking for spec work would be illegal since the blame usually falls on other companies.

Unfortunately, we don’t live in a perfect world. We live in this one, which means, we need to make sure we remain aware.

Aware of shitty companies who put profits above people.

Aware of ignorant clients who don’t know any better.

Aware of other freelancers who are desperate for more work.

If you’re considering spec work, stop and start looking for these opportunities instead:

* [Placement agencies](https://www.roberthalf.com/work-with-us/our-services/creativegroup)

* Paid internships

* Coworking centers

* Professional organizations

These are just a few ways to branch out and find new ways to connect with others because, at the end of the day, it’s not what you know — it’s who you know.

### It’s time to take the “free” out of freelance and get fucking paid.

# Do This Before You Make Your Next Big Decision

## “silhouette of road signage during golden hour” by Javier Allegue Barros on Unsplash

What should you do before making a big decision about your career, business or even your personal life?

Ray Dalio founded Bridgewater Capital in 1975. He transformed the institutional investment firm from a bedroom operation to a firm that employs about 1,700 people and manages funds worth approximately $160 billion for 350-plus institutional investors.

Over the years, Dalio built a framework for making better investments and business decisions, which he shares in his book *Principles.*

No matter your type of work or company, his framework is relatively easy to apply.

## Weigh Second- And Third-Order Consequences

If you’re about to make a big decision, pause to consider any unintended or long-term results.

Several years ago, Dalio decided to retire from his company. He wanted to spend more time on other pursuits like writing his book, but leaving a senior leadership role is difficult.

So Dalio initially spent even more [time working](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-spend-your-working-day-wisely-and-actually-get-things-done-2824628e31d6), which was the opposite of what he wanted. However, he had to manage his transition and find a suitable replacement CEO.

On a more practical level, you may find it difficult to get up before work and exercise for 30 to 60 minutes. An increase in energy and better health over the medium-term are examples of second-order consequence, while becoming more productive at work represents a third-order consequence.

At work, changing your company’s email service provider to a more advanced marketing automation tool might solve an immediate business problem. However, you’ll probably have to spend more time training your people to use this new tool.

Dalio said, “…first-order consequences often have opposite desirabilities from second-order consequences, resulting in big mistakes in decision making.”

## Own Your Pain

In 1982, Mexico defaulted on its debt to the United States. Dalio went on television to explain why the U.S. was heading for a depression. He also invested in gold and T-Bills futures to hedge his company against this economic downturn.

Instead, thanks to an intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. economy rebounded, the stock market went on a bull-run, and Dalio’s firm lost millions of dollars.

He wrote,
> # “My experience over this period was like a series of blows to the head with a baseball bat. Being so wrong — and especially so publicly wrong — was incredibly humbling and cost me just about everything I had built at Bridgewater.”

Wrong decisions are painful, but Dalio believes these moments are opportunities for growth. He wrote, “Self-reflectiveness is the quality that most differentiates those who evolve quickly from those who don’t. Remember: Pain + Reflection = Progress.”

A HR manager might spend months and thousands of dollars recruiting a star candidate only for the new employee to quit after a few weeks. In that case, he could reflect on the hiring process and on the role itself before going to the market again.

Or a developer could invest dozens of hours creating a product only to receive a series of angry emails from customers who complain it’s not up to scratch. Rather than wallowing, she could use these consumer insights to improve the [next version](https://medium.com/the-mission/do-this-if-you-want-to-dramatically-increase-your-odds-of-success-d57f1b992134).

## Weigh Your Decisions

It’s easy to obsess about a big decision and then fail to act.

Rather than letting emotions overwhelm you, learn what you can about the problem. Often you can triangulate a big decision by consulting other experts with contrasting views. Dalio wrote,…chances are you do it all the time — pretty much whenever you ask yourself, ‘Who should I listen to?’ But it’s almost certainly true that you’d do it a lot better if you gave more thought to it.”

Once you complete this process, dare to act.

You can always reflect on what worked and didn’t work and improve your principles for making future decisions.

# Stop Feeling Guilty About Having So Many Unread Books

## “assorted books on wooden table” by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash

Is your bookshelf teeming with more books than you have time to read? Or do your unread books induce feelings of guilt?

If so, you may be practicing the ancient Japanese art of tsundoku, that is, buying more books than you’ll ever read.

You could curtail your out-of-control shopping habits and put a plan in place to focus on your reading list like Warren Buffett or Bill Gates.

## Recognize Reading As A Source Of Learning

There’s nothing wrong with reading a cheap or trashy thriller for pleasure. A good business book, on the other hand, should stand as a source of learning or help you [solve a problem](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-spend-your-working-day-wisely-and-actually-get-things-done-2824628e31d6).

In an interview with the *New York Times,* Gates said,
> “These days, I also get to visit interesting places, meet with scientists, and watch a lot of lectures online. But reading is still the main way that I both learn new things and test my understanding.”[[1]](#_msocom_1)

Gates is not alone. When asked about the secret to his success, Warren Buffett told a body of students about to graduate,
> “Read 500 pages…every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.”

But how can you get through 50, never mind 500, pages a day?

## Read More Than One Business Book At Once

I like to keep two or three books on the go. This practice enables me to switch from one book to the next without getting bored. Reading multiple books means the ideas from the first book mix in weird ways with the ideas from the second book.

The trick is not to read so many books that you find it difficult to get through them. However, if you read more than one book, you’ll always have something to feel excited about picking up.

## Listen To Audiobooks

Audiobooks are a fantastic way to get through more business books from your list. You can listen to them while commuting to work, on the train or working out. After you’re comfortable with the format, increase the playback speed to one-and-a-half or even two times normal playback speed.

I particularly like how Amazon’s Whispersync technology enables me to listen to an audiobook on my phone and resume reading it from a Kindle later on.

## Abandon Bad Books

Oprah famously recommended putting a book down after 50 pages if it’s not enjoyable. I’d caveat that recommendation with “if it’s not enjoyable or useful.”

If you struggle with this practice, don’t worry.

Bill Gates has trouble putting down bad books too. Gates told *Time* magazine he [spends more time](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-use-the-4-ds-of-effective-time-management-61a7ff4bcf20) on books he dislikes because he writes arguments and counterpoints in the margins.

## Ask Your Peers For Book Recommendations

In an interview [with *Time](http://time.com/4786837/bill-gates-books-reading/),* Gates cited *Business Adventures *by John Brooks as one of his favorite reads of all time. He said,
> “[*Business Adventures*] is a collection of Brooks’s *New Yorker* essays about why various companies succeeded or failed. The essay titled “Xerox Xerox Xerox Xerox” should win an award for most clever chapter name, and the lessons inside the book are even better. I took inspiration from it while running Microsoft.”

You might not be able to run your purchases past Gates or Buffett before clicking “Buy now” on Amazon, but you can use their public reading lists to inform which business books you pick up next.

Gates keeps a running list of books he recommends on [Gatesnotes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Summer-Books-2018), while [Valuewalk](https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/05/warren-buffetts-book-list/) (or a simple Google search) reveals Buffett’s choices.

## Create Your Antilibrary

Lebanese-American investor and author Nassim Taleb believes the books you *haven’t read* contain more value than the ones you’ve finished.

In *Black Swan,* he told his readers to beware of reading too many books from a list or personal library without replenishing their shelves with unread titles. He called on us to build a personal antilibrary of unread books.

“The [antilibrary] should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allows you to put there.

In other words, there’s nothing wrong with tsundoku after all.

# “You Didn’t Make It” — How To Get Through A Low Point In Life.

## Image Credit: Art-of-man

I had a time in my career where everything didn’t work out. I was constantly told, *“You Didn’t Make It.”*

It felt soul-crushing to my spirit. There were days when there seemed like no point. There were days where it looked like everything was against me and I’d never come out of this crisis. Everyone else seemed to be doing okay except me.

This is not a story of pity but a story of surviving, and then ultimately thriving. We all have those deep, dark low points in life and there is a way out. There is a way to get back on top again.

### You have one month.

That was the advice I was given when my career took a turn for the worst. I was in the middle of an organisation that was transforming and I got caught up in the tornado of change. I wasn’t ready. I was scared even though I didn’t admit it.

Four weeks is not a long time. How does someone make such a radical change so quickly?

Well, for me, I ended up buying myself a bit more time. All of us can do the same. How? By learning to eat shit for a while. There’s always a way to fight your way to the next big chess move.

The plans I had to have an overseas holiday at the time were crushed. My girlfriend wanted to take a holiday and I couldn’t do it.

I had to be on the ground fighting the good fight and trying to find a way through the career issue I found myself stuck in the middle of.

![illustration by [Anna Jo Beck](http://www.annajobeck.com/)](1*zKUfd3q6mGEy2DGdj8lSsQ.jpeg)*illustration by [Anna Jo Beck](http://www.annajobeck.com/)*

I rang friends I thought could help. They didn’t assist.
I rang mentors for advice. They had nothing useful to say. 
I tried applying for my next career online. There was nothing but silence.

*What did I do?*

I didn’t give up or let the situation take control of me. I put my head up and reflected on all the huge wins I’d had in my life including being born. I told myself “This is temporary.”

I had a massive decision to make: Do I accept second best or fight to the very last minute until I’m out of time? I chose the latter.

### Here’s how I got through a low point:

## Back yourself in every moment.

The low point you speak of is really just an inner struggle of positive thoughts versus negative thoughts. It’s in your head where this low point will be decided. The way to crush the negative thoughts to pieces is to back yourself.

Put your shoulders back understand that it’s not you. You’re valuable, you’re special and you matter. What’s going to make the difference is that you believe this.
> **“If you don’t back yourself, no one else will”**

No one’s going to hand you an opportunity unless you believe you can do it first and foremost. You can see doubt on someone’s face like a tattoo on a young person’s arm.

## Movement keeps you positive.

There are some days when you won’t win the battle against your negative thoughts. It’s perfectly normal.

What will help balance out your thoughts is movement. Walking, running or gym. These forms of exercise help release endorphins that make you feel better.

**Exercise gives you empty space to be present.**

It’s hard to be pissed off with your low point when you’re doing one hundred push-ups and can barely breathe.

Exercise is like meditation; It cleanses the mind and gives you relief.

## Inner health reflects outer health.

Breaking through a low point requires brute force and energy. Your inner health is shaped by what you put in your body.

Pump your body full of veggies, beans, water mixed with lemon, relaxing teas and lots of nuts for energy.

Put things in your body that will give you the extra energy to deal with your challenging life issue.

## It takes a while. Have patience young, eager one.

When my career hit the dumps, it took longer than expected to get out of the situation. My ego told me I’d be onto my next gig within a few weeks.

The reality took a lot longer. I had to have patience and keep taking the daily actions that would lead me to my new career.

I kept looking for new career paths; I exhausted my LinkedIn connections; I had random online conversations to gain people’s feedback; I doubled down on my blogging to empty my thoughts; I told everyone I came into contact with what my goal was.

![](1*2V8v2Jmy8cbL3nOMkvGvDA.jpeg)

We’re all eager to get out of a dark place, but nothing worth its weight in gold happens overnight. Cultivating the mindset that your goal will be achieved if you remain patient will help you NOT make a short-term foolish decision.

It’s tempting to make a quick decision or commit to an action that ends up putting you further behind than where you were.

## Practice, practice, practice.

From every rejection, try to learn at least one thing. Learn one tool, one lesson or one tip that can help you win next time.

The number of job interviews I had to do during my low point was mind-blowing. By the tenth one, I had my own value proposition down pat. I had the stories that would inspire and win me my dream career memorized.
> **I studied every company I went and saw. I learned the name of the receptionist, the cleaner and all the names of the people that sat on the advisory board.**

I took stupid amounts of notes in the interview, so I had something at the end of it all — even if that wasn’t the career opportunity.

I put in the tiny habits each day despite the outcome. I knew that the result came from the habits I followed and not luck. Do the work. Tweak the plan. Do the work. Repeat.

## Give yourself a daily reminder.

Think about what’s worse than your low point. Do it every single day.
> # “You could be dead, or in jail or get kidnapped or lose a loved one. There’s always something worse that could be happening and that very idea will give you perspective”

Your low point is bad, but it’s not that bad. You had dinner last night, didn’t you? So many people didn’t get to eat last night.

You’re doing better than you think. Don’t let Instagram fuck up your crystal-clear reality which is this: You’re still doing pretty well.

![Image Credit: Unsplash](1*AdiUPz03PqP1IxGb-yYnCA.jpeg)*Image Credit: Unsplash*

## Talk to the oracles.

We all have what I call “Oracles” in our lives (borrowed that one from the Matrix). Oracles are people that speak nothing but wisdom.

No matter what you ask them, they say something truly profound. For me, it was two people: Karl and Clyde.

I asked them for their advice regularly. They dropped truth bombs to my face that knocked me flat on the floor.

Whatever I thought before I spoke with them, was completely forgotten by the end of one short conversation with these oracles.

Seek out people who are smarter than you and tell them about your low point. I bet you they’ve gone through the same and can tell you at least one lesson that will change your perspective.

This new idea could very well be the seed of your next dream.

## Swing to the next step like Tarzan.

Standing still while you’re facing a low point stops your momentum. During a low point, what I do is keep swinging to the next step.

![](1*axTmD18ScLt8KQIoUceHMw.jpeg)

Each vine typically looks like some form of rejection. I take that rejection and swing to the next one.

I’d get told I wasn’t qualified even though I’d spent five plus years doing what they said I couldn’t do.

Instead of accepting defeat, I moved on. Each time I took a new swing, I changed my strategy slightly. By the end of the low point, my methodology was totally different.

### I’d learned the following:

- Online career opportunities need a referral from an existing staff member 
- Bragging too much can destroy opportunities
- Most of the success comes from your actions — not favors off friends 
- Your first gut reaction is usually the right one

## Insert new information.

I’d sit down every day and read one new article, chapter or blog post. Feeding my brain with new strategies helped me come up with my own ideas.

Books, in particular, broke the pattern of feeling helpless. When I heard other people achieving their goals in a book, it gave me hope that I could do the same.

It’s this hope that I channeled into every action I took.

Books allowed me to rethink what my workweek had to be. I came up with the idea of splitting my week between two careers to get the best of both worlds.

## Be nice to the big guy/girl.

Who’s that? Yourself of course. During a low point, you need to be extra kind to yourself.
> # “Don’t sit there and tell yourself you’re stupid. All of us have low points that we deal with. It’s during the tough times that our mindset and lives are shaped”

Attacking yourself isn’t going to help you get what you want. It might feel like the obvious thing to do, but that’s your million-year-old brain that’s running that program for you.

There’s always more you could have done in hindsight. You did your best. You followed your gut and reached a dead end. I get it.

Don’t let one dead end become the symbol of your life. Let the climb back to the top define you instead.

# The 5 Things You Need To Discuss With Your Co-Founder Before Starting Your Business Together

## The 5 Things You Need To Discuss With Your Co-Founder Before Starting Your Business Together

### These questions will help you determine whether the opportunity in question is one you should actually pursue.

***By [Joe Gardner](https://medium.com/@joegardner.venturedevs), co-founder and CEO of VentureDevs***
> # *At the end of the day, what matters most here is learning as much about the other person as you possibly can before agreeing to move forward.*

One of my first co-founders — a man we’ll call “John” — felt to me, at first glance, like a perfect match.

Our company was a SaaS startup with plans to impact the modeling world, and John was a former part-owner of a modeling agency. He had access to our target market, a keen awareness of the technical deficiencies in the space, and key industry connections. But perhaps most importantly to me at the time, he seemed inspired to work hard together to build a great product which could create value for a lot of people.
> # *So when he approached me with his offer of partnership, it felt like a no-brainer.*

Through a handshake agreement, it was decided that he would act as the sales engine for the company while I handled operations and finances. (Our third partner, Wojtek, led the technical side.) For a short period, it worked. But as time passed, it became clear to Wojtek and me that John wasn’t delivering on what he said he would. The promises he’d made, we realized, were just a well-constructed facade.

Inevitably, the time came to cut ties. But because our partnership had been born on a handshake and nothing more — no documented agreement — the process was messy, to say the least. Lawyers were involved. Energy was wasted.

I was 26 at the time and altogether [too trusting](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/how-to-trust-our-intuition/), but I* do* believe the experience taught me a variety of valuable lessons that have benefited my career and my partnerships in the years that have passed since — like, for example, my partnership with Wojtek, who I’m still building companies with to this day.

Specifically, I learned you should always discuss and document 5 major ticket items with a potential co-founder, which, although potentially uncomfortable to talk about, will help you determine whether the opportunity in question is one you should actually pursue.

## 1) Expectations

The first thing you and your potential co-founder must define is who will be responsible for what, how you’ll hold each other accountable, and what will happen if your execution falters.

The importance of defining all of this so explicitly is best exemplified by what I call the [“college dorm room” scenario](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/founders-this-is-why-you-shouldnt-hire-your-friends/). Imagine: three young people are sitting in their college dorm room. Together, drawing on windows, they come up with a potentially brilliant idea and decide to ambiguously each own a third of the company. But when, inevitably, one or two of these “founders” loses interest or stops pulling their weight, and their responsibilities fall to the one remaining inspired founder of the company — well, that creates problems.

The reality is, whatever “idea” your company has been founded upon is actually pretty cheap. What really matters is the dedication, grit, and *execution* required over the course of several years to build your idea into something real and scalable.

And it’s to this end that you and your co-founder(s) must, on day one, plot out who will be doing what along the way — what each of you will do to merit your owning X percent of the company — and what processes you’ll abide by to hold each other accountable. Those processes need to include a means of judging whether any party at a given moment stops pulling their weight. They should also spell out what repercussions will be delivered if any of you don’t follow through on your agreement.

## 2) Vesting schedules

Every startup needs a vesting schedule, and it should be based on performance.

Based on the point above, you want to ensure that every partner has a clearly defined role and responsibilities by which to hold them accountable. But if each partner were granted some percentage of a company before *earning* that equity, it can lead to big problems.

If each co-founder’s ownership percentage vests over four years, however — and if that vesting is contingent upon delivering on certain promises — that not only encourages commitment, but it also protects all parties involved from being held hostage by someone who was gifted an ownership stake. Not to mention that if you ever plan to raise money for your company, any savvy investor will require this before investing.

## 3) Compensation

Similarly, you and your co-founder should spell out early on what your monetary compensation will be. Your ownership stake is only part of the equation, after all.

One reason this is so important is because there are key details which have to be outlined early on. For example, if one of the co-founders is leading the sales process, you have to decide: will they be making commission? What will your salaries be early on when the company isn’t making any money? Are both of you comfortable with taking less in the beginning stages for the sake of the company?

The answer to that last question can be telling. If your co-founder demands a large salary up front for an “idea stage” startup, for instance, I’d argue that illuminates something about their willingness to assume risk which should act as a kind of warning to you. And in this sense, this particular conversation doubles as another layer of vetting your partner’s reasonableness.

## 4) Understanding each other deeply

I’d argue that the most important step is to truly understand your potential partner, as this is someone you’ll be working closely with for the next 5 to 10 years. It’s one of the most important personal investments you’ll ever make.

And this should entail a lot more than a few conversations over a Philz coffee. You should meet with them multiple times in different social settings, preferably outside of a business meeting. (Remember, you want to get to know the person, not just the business mask they’re showing you.) You should get to know their friends and family. Assess their capacity for empathy and reason, their personal priorities, and the things that motivate them.
> # *The goal is to understand how your potential partner thinks, feels, and behaves.*

In fact, I would argue this is the most important step in the entire process. By having these difficult conversations early on, you will get a front-row seat to see: how your potential partner negotiates, how they express their opinions, what they value, and most importantly, whether they’re someone you’d be happy solving problems with for the next 10 years.

## 5) Take your time

You should also absolutely, 100% take your time. I, personally, will never rush into a co-founder partnership again because I know just how mentally exhausting entering into the wrong one can be. Luckily, because my partner at [VentureDevs](https://venturedevs.com/) is someone I’ve known since the start of my very first company, we’ve had the time and conversations needed to make sure our partnership will last.

At the end of the day, what matters most here is learning as much about the other person as you possibly can before agreeing to move forward. This *should* take time. Anyone can bring their A-game for a few initial meetings when excitement is high, but that excitement will eventually fade, and you will still need to work alongside that partner for years to come. So, you’d better make sure you have all the information and time needed to make a decision.

Nothing less than your company’s potential success is on the line.

# How Storytellers Change the World

## How Storytellers Change the World

### Change the metaphor; change the reality.

“Why do you want to make movies?” my mom once asked me. “Wouldn’t you rather do something that helped people? Like a doctor?
“A doctor can only help one person at a time,” I tried to explain. “A storyteller can help the whole world.”
Notwithstanding research doctors, I still hold this to be true. Here’s why:

Stories matter. They are how humans makes sense of the world and our place within it. Our self-identities are constructed as stories, as are our roles in society. When asked “what do you do?” or “who are you?” people will often respond with something resembling a story. When we reinvent ourselves after a crisis we speak of “changing the narrative.” Even “branding is storytelling,” marketers tell us. Throughout all human history, every culture and religion maintained an oral tradition of parables and mythologies as the most effective way to transmit wisdom across generations, until the technologies of the alphabet and writing were devised. Stories define social norms and enforce social order (bad guys are punished, good guys prevail), and create communities based on shared group histories. And today through film and television (and theatre, novels, comic books, and some video games), storytelling is a global trillion-plus dollar industry.

But what exactly is a story? And why are they so important to us?

### Wired for Stories: Pattern Recognition

The human brain is wired for stories. A story is a series of events linked by causal relationships, as perceived by an experiential point-of-view.*

**meaning a single observer capable of experience such as a narrator or protagonist, as opposed to a ledger account or flowchart of dates and events.*

It’s a pattern. And the human brain is essentially a pattern recognition machine. And that’s generally a good thing. It helped us survive. Patterns allow forward-extrapolation, which is actionable. Pattern-recognition leads to science, mathematics, language, philosophy, law, and technology. But it also explains why humans are so prone to religion, superstition, stereotypes, conspiracy theories, and pseudo-science based on anecdote, connecting-the-dots, and “common sense.” It’s the reason why people are so profoundly uncomfortable with ambiguity, uncertainty, and relativism. Chaos has no pattern, so it does not compute. On some level, it actually stresses our brains. By design, the human mind craves certainty, and this constantly compels us to try to make sense of the seeming randomness of life and the universe.
Every time somebody says they believe “everything happens for a reason,” that’s pattern-recognition at work. That’s retroactively injecting a causal linkage or thread through all the random events in their life. However if we don’t have that thread, that connective tissue through time that gives meaning to our lives, we quickly come unraveled.
In short, humans need stories to live.

### The Power of Metaphor

A metaphor is a mental equivalence between two disparate concepts. While initially selected for shared qualities (a “blanket of snow” — blankets cover beds evenly the same way a heavy snowfall evenly covers the ground), two things connected in metaphor can often absorb new and unexpected qualities from the other (that snowfall now seems ‘cozy’ and ‘soft’).

Marketers understand this consummately:
“Louis Vuitton is luxury.” No it’s not. It’s a nylon and leather purse that transports personal effects with the same performance metrics of any other handbag.
“A diamond is [love] forever.” Actually, a diamond is compressed carbon. On its own, it has nothing to do with love and commitment (pretty sure divorce statistics will back me up on this).
“A gun is protection for your family.” Statistically, a gun is a [*threat* to your family](http://www.bradycampaign.org/risks-of-having-a-gun-in-the-home), but that’s not the narrative we imagine when we’re at the range or watching Bruce Willis action flicks.
“Donald Trump is a self-made millionaire.” Nope. Donald Trump [started out in business as a millionaire](http://www.newsweek.com/2016/08/12/donald-trumps-business-failures-election-2016-486091.html), and [failed at almost every business](http://gawker.com/a-complete-list-of-donald-trump-s-business-disasters-1764151188) he tried to run.

In these cases and many more, the metaphors, no matter how flimsy and arbitrary, have real-world consequences.
In the first two examples, useless or over-priced luxury objects acquire new functionality (social signaling functions) when there is universal buy-in of their metaphorical narratives. Thus LVMH is able to charge a hefty premium for an otherwise parity product, and there remains a lucrative market for an [otherwise worthless mineral](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/aja-raden/modern-love-the-invention_b_9234280.html) (industrial cutting applications notwithstanding).
In the latter example, once one is able to conflate the idea of Donald Trump with the idea of a business whiz, the notion that he might be a good steward of the American economy and government does not seem so far fetched. A presidential candidate is born.
In short: By shaping thought, metaphors influence behaviour.

But the power of metaphor can be deployed for social change, not just profit. This is [explicitly](http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-electric-cars-plan-is-working-2015-10) what Elon Musk was trying to do with Tesla Motors. Prior to Tesla, “electric car” conjured something comparable to a golf-cart. It was a joke: slow, under-powered, and definitely not sexy. But that perception has changed. Post-Tesla, an electric car is a high-tech, high-performance, high-priced object of desire. Every major automaker is suddenly scrambling to develop electric vehicles, whereas twenty years ago they were [burying them](http://whokilledtheelectriccar.com/). Even if Tesla Motors were to go bankrupt tomorrow, they would still have succeeded in their mission to electrify transportation. They did it by changing the metaphor.

### The Making of Metaphor

As any marketer can tell you, brands (another word for metaphor) are established through stories. Go back to any one of the above examples and you can easily imagine a familiar story that supports the metaphor: He gave her a diamond ring and they lived happily ever after. She became successful and now goes nowhere without her Louis Vuitton. The villain broke into their house but was shot dead before he could do any harm. Donald Trump, the street-smart kid hustles his way to fame and fortune. Tesla races Porsche and wins (but costs just as much). There were always grass stains; then she switched to Bounty; now there are no grass stains. He was drinking Budweiser and became the most popular guy at the party. So on and so forth. It is through repeated exposure to these narratives that the concomitant metaphors take form in our own minds.

Here’s my favourite personal example: As a child I grew up on a steady diet of nature documentaries. My girlfriend grew up on slasher-horror flicks and crime fiction. Today, we both view the woods (forests) very differently. I see them as magical places of discovery, teeming with living things in delicate symbiotic relationships, cleaning the air we breathe and the water we drink. She sees the woods as scary places, where serial killers hide traps and no one can hear you scream. I always want to go walk in the woods, even at night. She thinks that’s either boring or dangerous. The forest as life vs. the forest as death.
Now imagine how each of us would vote if a builder wanted to bulldoze the last virgin woodlot in the neighbourhood, or if our kids wanted to go play there. The stories we are exposed to shape our metaphors, and our metaphors shape our behaviour. Stories change the world.

Look around you. The world we live in is built on stories:
National borders, imaginary lines in the sand, are stories: Once upon a time there were tribes and wars and negotiations which led to this line as it is today. None of us have ever seen these events, but we all believe the same narrative, so the border becomes real.
Fiat currency is a story: Countless others have accepted, and will again accept, this useless paper as payment for their goods so you should accept it in exchange for yours.
Religions are founded on stories: Once upon a time God imparted his wisdom through a prophet, and here’s what he said…
Many of these stories that make up our world are sprawling mythologies which evolved over time through countless contributions. Others, like those we saw above, are more focused. But even the small ones have the power to change our world.

### Build a Better World

This is why in all the stories we write, we must always take care to consider what metaphors we are constructing, reinforcing, or challenging. In my own writing, I always try to consider: Do the heroes always use force/violence to save the day, or are there other solutions to conflict? Are guns portrayed as empowering or dangerous? Are women only played as victims or trophies, or do they have real agency in the story’s outcome? Does black (or brown, ruddy, swarthy, etc) equate criminality and poverty, or something (anything) else? Is Mother Nature the enemy, or a friend? Because whether intentional or inadvertent, fictional stories and their implicit metaphors hold non-fictional power.

We can tell stories for the benefit of humankind. We can build a better world through storytelling. We can shape our metaphors to align with our aspirations and maybe one day, those fictions will become reality.

# The 1 Terrible Habit We’re All Guilty Of—and How Eliminating It Can Increase Productivity Tenfold&#58;

## 

6:13 A.M. — my alarm goes off.
> (I don’t like setting my alarms at times that end in “0” or “5.” I have absolutely no explanation why).

I grab whatever book I’m reading — currently between *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari and *4-Hour Work Week* by Tim Ferris— slip on my slippers, walk downstairs and brew a pot of coffee.

I read while it brews. When it’s done, I head back upstairs to my laptop, sit down, and write.

That whole process takes about 15 minutes.

## The first thing most people do when they wake up is check their phone.

I used to do it all the time.

I would wake up, unlock my phone half-blinded by the white light of the screen, send my girlfriend a good morning text, open Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and scroll.

I did this for about 30–45 minutes every morning without even realizing it. It’s not that I was “dying” for social interaction or consumption or anything like that. Half of the time, I didn’t even want to scroll.

It was just habit.

I got into a more ‘holistic’ lifestyle after a bout of stomach issues.

It started with nutrition but naturally grew into sleeping habits, meditation and healthier exercise like yoga. The more I learned about health, the more I realized how bad my morning habit was. So, I decided to make a change.
> # I made a promise to myself that every morning, I’d spend at least the first 15 minutes away from technology.

## My daily productivity increased tenfold.

I realized that checking social media first thing every morning only made me want to check it again and again throughout the day.

Each time I logged on, I’d stay for 20, 30, 40 minutes wasting time. I probably wasted 3 to 4 hours every day just scrolling.

Taking the first 15 minutes every morning to read, have a coffee and prepare for the day ahead has literally changed my life. I read more, write more, sleep better. The urge to check social media throughout the day has almost entirely disappeared.

By not opening my phone the second I wake up, I worry less and have immensely reduced my overall stress levels, allowing me to be more productive.

## Maximizing daily productivity doesn’t have to be a long, drawn out process.

You don’t need to jot down a million “to-do’s,” or go on a 5 mile run the second you wake up.

All you need to do, is take that first 15 minutes completely to yourself and find clarity.

# The Benefits Of Harnessing The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind

## Photo by Levi XU on Unsplash

## The Hierarchical Structure Of The Mind
> # “The conscious mind may be compared to a fountain playing in the sun and falling back into the great subterranean pool of subconscious from which it rises.” — Sigmund Freud

I wrote an article some time ago titled: Harnessing the Power of the Subconscious Mind in which I explored the distinction between the conscious mind (CM) and the subconscious mind (SM).

Recapping some of those points:

1. Your conscious mind is the logical mind that functions using reason.

2. You think with the conscious mind and it is the programmer of the SM, the creative mind that carries out the program.

3. You process anywhere between 60,000–80,000 thoughts a day.

4. The SM is the automatic pilot of the mind.

5. The SM regulates your vital body functions.

Let’s examine the background relevant in understanding the SM mind.

The brain does not compute answers to problems, it merely retrieves them from your memory.

Your mind draws on information from its hierarchical structure, recalling events from the past.

When you see a person you know, your mind retrieves information relating to your history with the person. It identifies the individual as either a friend, enemy or unknown.

## Untapped Potential
> # “Whatever we plant in our subconscious mind and nourish with repetition and emotion will one day become a reality.” — Earl Nightingale

In his book *The Mind’s Eye* author Oliver Sacks writes about his condition known as Prosopagnosia, the inability to recognise faces. Meeting people on many occasions, he is unable to recognise them in later encounters.

Being a qualified neurologist, he was courteous to acknowledge his impairment by asking the person if they had met before.

Whilst this is a rare condition, it highlights the complexity of the mind. Even the slightest malfunction can cause an impairment.

A great deal of literature has been written about the SM. As we learn more through scientific research, we discover the untapped potential of the inner workings of this mysterious organ.

So why all the fuss about the SM, you might ask?

How can you use this power to your advantage?

Most of your SM’s programming is formed from birth until the age of 6 years. During these formative years, your brain operates within specific brain waves conducive to your development.

Those brain waves are: beta, alpha, theta, delta & gamma.

The brain waves act at various frequencies known as Hertz. For example while you’re asleep, your brain wave functions within the theta and delta range, oscillating between 3.5–7 cycles per second.

This allows you to relax, and not tune in to external stimuli in your wakeful state. It permits the mind to regenerate itself, processing thoughts and emotions.

To fully explore and develop your mind’s capacity, it’s worth investing time and patience knowing your SM.

Your SM works best receiving the stimuli in a relaxed state. During beta and theta brain waves, you create an environment conducive to learning, formulating new ideas, thoughts and creativity.

You’re able to receive information and insights into events, processes and circumstances never thought possible.

## Benefits of Harnessing Your Subconscious Mind
> # “ The law of the subconscious mind works for good and bad ideas alike. This law, when applied in a negative way, is the cause of failure, frustration, and unhappiness. However, when your habitual thinking is harmonious and constructive, you experience perfect health, success, and prosperity.” ― **Joseph Murphy**

Your SM processes approximately 100 billion bits of information per second.

In contrast, the CM processes 40 bits of information per second. Therefore, many geniuses knew of the potential of their SM.

It takes time to master this skill, so be patient if you’re dedicated to making breakthroughs as they may be slow and arduous.

The key benefits include:

* Enhanced relationships.

* Weight loss.

* Improved health and wellbeing.

* Higher levels of creativity.

* Problem solving capabilities.

* More relaxed and composed.

* Ability to transcend limiting beliefs.

* Creating a sense of happiness and purpose in your life.

* Sense of control and empowerment.

I engage my SM in various problem solving capacities, having trained it with some success.

I speak to my mind (yes, it may seem silly at first) as though it were a friend. I use affirmations such as: “Thank you subconscious mind for being my partner in success.”

I allow the right stimuli to enter my mind that includes the people I associate with, the music I listen to, the books I read and the news I listen to.

Have you noticed when associating with a group of friends, you pick up words they use? It might include phrases used in a conversational tone, yet you use it regularly.

I’m certain you did not consciously programme it into your mind, it took place unconsciously via repetitive exposure.

Similarly, you may have heard a song you began singing without your conscious awareness. This is your SM working in the background.

Most of your habits and actions are influenced by your SM.

Recall earlier I mentioned from birth to 6 years of age, you learned in a subconscious state. Most of your adult behaviour has been programmed via your SM during these impressionable years.

I reasoned earlier that the brain does not compute answers to problems, it retrieves them from your memory.

Given this, we can conclude why adults act out learned childhood behaviour of: misery, low self-esteem, depressive states and abuse.

While I may be painting a grim picture, I’ve met people who fit this description. Some have created fulfilling lives while others remain trapped in their childhood behaviour.

Similar to exercise, your mind responds to the stimuli it is exposed to. You may not see tangible results for weeks, possibly months. Trust and have faith it is working.

I have practiced these principles for years. I use them regularly, having little attachment to the outcome. I trust once I’ve done the work (workout), I wait for the results to show up (rest).

As evident in the analogy, it is akin to exercise.

So make it your mission to master your subconscious mind in an easy and effortless way.

# Unmotivated? 5 Inspiration Hacks That Will Get You Back on Track

## 

It happens to all of us: The Paralysis of Unmotivation.

There you are, staring at your computer screen and you just don’t want to start anything.

You scan through your current projects and aren’t excited about even one.

Flipping through the day’s appointments, you wish you could just go back to bed.

Suddenly you realize you’re not as motivated as you were just a short time ago. You have become complacent. Before you know it, your goals and dreams start drifting away. Even if it’s for a short period of time, it can be hard to bounce back from.

No matter how much you have achieved in the past or how bright your future looks, you likely have become unmotivated at some point (or you will).

**Don’t panic. It happens to the best of us.**

The key is to gain back your lost motivation as soon as possible, because the longer you stay in a funk, the worse you feel. The longer you are stuck in that place, not tackling your dreams, the further away they will drift.

And that’s one of an entrepreneur’s biggest fears.

If you can relate — and I know you can! — then how can you get back on track with your goals? For starters, take a bite out of the advice below.

## **1. Think Back To Your Darkest Hour**
> *“It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.” — Aristotle*

This first strategy may be counter-intuitive, but it can work to jolt yourself back into feeling motivated. Think back to your darkest hour, even worse than how you’re feeling now, when you were really in the dumps. Remember just how you felt then, whether this happened years ago or in the near past.

You probably were not making much money. You were working at a dead-end job. Just remember how desperate you were for an opportunity to make your dreams come true! Wouldn’t you have done anything to get out of that current state?

While it’s always best to have a positive outlook on life, it can certainly be motivating to look back at a time when you came face-to-face with your darkest hour. If that is a place you never want to visit again, then you will do whatever it takes to get back on track.

Plus, when you come back to the present, look and see how far you’ve come!

## **2. Revisit Your Goals for Inspiration**
> *“Men more frequently require to be reminded than informed.” ― Samuel Johnson*

If you are unmotivated, then you have to find inspiration before you get too far off track. Sometimes finding the path back is as simple as revisiting your goals.

We are forgetful creatures. We need constant reminding.

It’s easy to forget about your goals if you aren’t looking at them every day, so force them back into your life. Write them on your mirror. Post them on your dresser. Frame them on your desk. Let these goals be your inspiration, and you will start enjoying the process of achieving them once again.

Another thing about goals: It’s okay to make adjustments or change up the deadlines along the way. The key is to not put your goals on the back burner altogether.

Looking for a tool to jump-start your sales success? [Check out my cheat sheet now](https://khe.clickfunnels.com/sales-success-cheat-sheet)!

## **3. Change Things Up A Bit**
> *“When you’re finished changing, you’re finished.” — Benjamin Franklin.*

When you get tired of the path you are traveling on a daily basis, change things up a bit!

Instead of doing your work during the first eight hours of the day, take a long break in the middle and do something you love to do. Go to the gym, read a book, catch a movie, spend time with your family, or hang out with your friends.

Tackle your most personally-fulfilling goals first thing in the morning instead of waiting until all of your business work is done.

Switch up when you work. If you usually work in the morning, try doing some of your work at night. If you have always been a night owl, start working in the morning.

The key is to find some way to change up your current process. Whether minor or major, make some adjustments. This is your life, and you have the ability to change it and shape it however you like — and you should.

Shaking things up a bit could be just what you need to get back on track.

## **4. If All Else Fails, Go On A Vacation**
> *“Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.” ― Terry Pratchett*

When you are feeling burned out, a vacation or weekend getaway is the perfect way to gain back your motivation.

Not only is it okay to take a step back from work from time to time, it’s healthy. After all, human beings are not machines — we need breaks!

Have you not taken a vacation in what feels like a lifetime? Can you remember the last time you had a day off? Don’t lose sight of the point of all your work: so that you can live a life you enjoy!

Renewal, refreshment, and even fun have to fit in with your lofty goals.

You will be amazed how quickly your motivation returns when you’ve been refreshed by some time away from it all.

## **5. What Do You Want To Be Remembered For?**
> *“All good men and women must take responsibility to create legacies that will take the next generation to a level we could only imagine.” — Jim Rohn*

When you are stuck in a rut, going through the motions, or feeling unmotivated, ask yourself this question: Is this what I want to be remembered for?

Is what you are doing right now what you want to be remembered for?

Are you happy with your current legacy, and the direction it is going in?

If you can honestly answer yes to that question, then keep on trucking.

However, if you want there to be more to your life, then do something about it.

This perspective will help you do one of two things: either get back on track with your goals or make new ones.

Whether you like it or not, people will remember you for who you ARE, not who you want to be. Do you want to be remembered as a successful entrepreneur, business owner, or visionary? Then start becoming that person now. Start doing what that person would do.

Make this your new mantra: **“I am motivated, positive, and persistent. I will NEVER give up.”**

## **Ready to Upgrade Your Sales Success?**

# I Just Turned 50. Here’s What I Wish I Had Known 25 Years Ago

## 

I turned 50 this year, and with the gravitas surrounding that milestone, I began thinking about all the things I *wish* I’d known at 25.

The thing about good advice is that people rarely take it.

The truth is, I know that 25-year-old me probably wouldn’t be able to understand the advice — or at least, he wouldn’t be ready to receive the message.

### A lot of times, you just have to figure things out for yourself.

You have to learn some lessons through experience. But if you’re in the right frame of mind to accept advice, you can internalize it and potentially avoid mistakes.

So, here are the five things I wish I’d known a quarter-century ago:

## **1. Pay attention to what has your attention.**

Daniel Coyle, the author of *The Talent Code*, wrote that his main rule with his children is to watch what they stare at. That’s what they’re interested in, so you want to help them focus on it.

I followed this practice with my kids but then realized I could also apply it to myself.

### You can reduce a lot of noise around you by noticing what fascinates you.

Put all your energy there — that’s what matters. If you aren’t quite sure what you’re paying attention to, you can easily fix that. Go back in your calendar and note what you did. Where were you? How did you spend your time?

You may be surprised at where your attention is being spent.

Tally those things up to see what fascinates you. And then take advantage of that knowledge. Just know that it will continually change.

## **2. Forget the low-hanging fruit.**

It’s human nature to go after the easiest and most achievable goals first.

But growth occurs during the toughest challenges — the difficult, complicated situations. That’s where you find the action and the value.
> # When it comes to work, what’s most difficult is often counterintuitive.

Knocking out all the little tasks on your to-do list is satisfying, sure. But it’s much more demanding to sit down, think deliberately about a subject, fill a blank page with your thoughts, and hatch a plan. It may feel like you’re “doing” nothing. Yet this hour or two of effective, precise, disciplined, and integrated thinking can be worth a month of hard work.

The payoff, of course, is that this will save you tons of time down the road — if the low-hanging fruit doesn’t get in the way.

## **3. Don’t chase brilliance.**

People often feel like they have to be the very best at anything they do. They pick one or two activities and refuse to try anything else, simply because they know they’ll be bad at them initially.

I’ve been having this conversation with my oldest son a lot recently. Kids today are under immense pressure to be the best at what they do, so everything seems like a competition. It’s easy to see the consequences of that play out in the decisions they make about trying new things. Why would they try something new when they know they won’t be great at it?

I always tell him, don’t be afraid to fail.
> # Don’t be scared to act a little awkward, to shake things up.

Follow your interest, even if it’s something you’re not sure you can accomplish. You don’t have to be brilliant to get far in life.

## **4. Build your network by figuring out how to add value.**

When I was younger, I was fairly conscious of the importance of [building a network](https://theascent.pub/the-key-to-building-lasting-business-relationships-936b49db057a?source=user_profile---------29------------------), meeting people, and making friends. But I didn’t really appreciate the concept of adding value or understand the method behind doing that.

It’s one thing to meet with someone, get their business card, and send a LinkedIn request. It’s another to actually *provide* something that could be useful to them.

### Instead of leaving it at the LinkedIn connection, take time to do a little research.

Let them know, “Hey, I’ve been doing some work on XYZ company, and I found three great articles when researching. Here are the links and some of the things that I’ve learned. I would love to see if you might be willing to contribute to my knowledge or point me in the right direction.”

You want to be known as someone who adds value to whatever situation you find yourself in.

## **5. Be careful with advice — even good advice.**

You only want to gain knowledge from people who have experience. Listen to what they have to say because they know what they’re talking about. They understand the rules.

But I would be a little careful about what particular advice you listen to. In many cases, it’s best to ignore or disregard advice.

You don’t want to blindly follow every piece of information people hand out because a lot of it is very generic. So, you’re essentially going to do what everyone else is doing.

### A better way to think about advice is to try to understand what happened to the person who is giving it.

Ask yourself, why did they do something a particular way? How did they end up in that position? Does this advice make sense in my own situation?

You don’t have to follow the advice I’ve outlined in this piece to a T. But I can say for certain I wish my 25-year-old self had understood it.

# It Is Time You Took A Trust Fall

## It Is Time You Took A Trust Fall

### The Mission Newsletter, 9/25/18

![](0*j9_Ebf70eAitk3-w)
> # “To be trusted is a greater compliment than being loved.” –George MacDonald

## **The Most Important Currency**
> “Most businesses that we interact with are built around money, and money only goes so far. Money is the currency of transactions. Trust is the currency of interactions.” -Rachel Botsman, Author of “Who Can You Trust?”

One of the fundamental principles in developing meaningful relationships is trust. Impactful companies rely on radical transparency, strong connection and the ability to trust their team to get the job done.

The most successful leaders in the world have all embraced and suggested trust as the main component to thriving in business and in life. To celebrate today’s kickoff of Dreamforce 2018, [here are eight quotes on trust](http://themission.acemlnb.com/lt.php?notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=35A53A2A975) that will help you succeed anywhere.

## **As The Wise Philosophers Aerosmith Said, Walk This Way**

[Everyone has a specific speed that they find most comfortable to walk](http://themission.acemlnb.com/lt.php?notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=35A53A2A976), however, almost no one walks at that pace. That’s because how you walk is dependent on who you walk with. Men tend to slow down when walking with women especially romantic partners, but when strolling with other dudes, they pick up the pace.

Around the world, pace changes, too. A new study found that people in Uganda walking alone travel much faster than those walking solo in Seattle, Washington. But in groups and with children, they slowed waaaaay down, opposite of how those in the Emerald City behaved.

## **Does Your Boss Trust You?**

Google is producing a [new tool that will allow managers to find out if their employees are using the G Suite productivity tools](http://themission.acemlnb.com/lt.php?notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=35A53A2A977). Called “Work Insights,” the feature will be helpful in giving managers an idea of how well employees are adopting tools, how teams are collaborating and whether meetings are being held on Google hangouts.

The idea is to aid in the collaboration process, but it still raises some questions and concerns about what your boss is looking at.

## **Coca-Cola Might Be Getting A New Secret Ingredient**

Okay, that may be overstating things a bit, but [Coke is thinking about getting into the cannabis business](http://themission.acemlnb.com/lt.php?notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=35A53A2A978). Recent reports state that Coke is monitoring the cannabis industry and could be interested in entering the market of weed-infused drinks.
> “We are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world,” Coca-Cola spokesman Kent Landers said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg News. “The space is evolving quickly. No decisions have been made at this time.”

## **The Quest for Better Mental Health Services**

For students continues, this time in Louisiana, where the federal government awarded the state a [multi-million dollar grant to expand mental health services](http://themission.acemlnb.com/lt.php?notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=35A53A2A979).

Every year for the next five years, the state will receive $1.8 million to fund the Louisiana School Mental Health Support Program, which is targeting 34 schools where students are struggling.

# Unraveling Success

## So you don’t lose your mind…

![](1*wgOy7JOoSMsQQxzO_uR0zg.jpeg)

One of the first western dictionaries way back in the 1800’s defines success as;
> # “fortunate, happy, kind, and prosperous.”

I can’t believe Oxford was knocking about back then either! Regardless, it’s a definition I could get behind.

Success is an interesting topic with many facets to it, so I posed the question to the community to get a better understanding of how others define success in their lives.

While the responses poured in, none were too dissimilar with many containing the buzzwords one would expect like purpose, freedom, inner peace, happiness, and of course, making the world a better place. That and not having to wear pants — *which is winning all day in my book!*

One of the first points which stood out to me was a lot of emphasis being placed on emotion — and emotion is fleeting. Freedom is fleeting. Peace is fleeting. Happiness is fleeting.
> Is success fleeting?

If so, my first distinction is this: to succeed you must fail. Or at least be prepared to fail. And fail often because even the most self-righteous can bathe in their glory for so long.

My second observation was most focused explicitly on their career with finances, understandably, a major component. This didn’t surprise me. What did surprise me was few explicitly mentioned connection and relationships. Or love. *Fuck it.* Maybe that’s a given, but I would have thought it would be up there at the top. Is this the Tinder effect? Personal branding? Social media and the mini-narcissists it makes of us all? Or is it evidence we are all now striving for complete independence while using the Internet as a vehicle to attain the unattainable? *Hmm…*

## So, how do you attain success?

First and foremost, I have no clue how YOU attain success because I have no clue what you value. We need to be agile, though, I’m pretty sure of that. We must be prepared to tweak our definitions to both accommodate our current values and rein in that which is attainable.

For example, when I was younger, success would have been a house on the lake, a chalet in the Alps, nice cars, a boat, a hot wife and three kids. And everybody getting along. Sure, some of that might still be attainable *(the bird would kill me if I said otherwise)* but let’s just say I’m not on track. Because of that, I’ve had to tweak my definition of success to facilitate new found values, and of course, a new reality. Otherwise, I’d lose my mind — *and I’m barely clinging on to the fucker as is!*

Most dangle success so far ahead of them they’ll never be able to grab it. They shoot for private jets before the bank will lend them money for a Volvo, and listen too intently to motherfuckers (relax, it’s endearing) like Grant Cardone telling them they have a duty to be a millionaire. Don’t get me wrong, I like his shit, but one would have to wonder with all his success, why he now feels the need to one-up Tai Lopez by taking up every ad space on YouTube to show off his new private jet? Is it because his definition of success has evolved also?

This might explain it: Fast forward a few centuries and today’s definition of success will read something along the lines of…
> # “the attainment of fame, wealth, prosperity or social status.”

Ok, now I get it. It must be the fame?

This new definition can certainly shine a light on the superficial world we’re living in where so many are falling victim to stress-related illness.

I love how John Wooden defines it the most…
> # “Success is a peace of mind knowing you did your best to become the best you can be…..
> # Don’t pitch yourself against your friends or others around you because you’ll never find peace as you’ll always be at war, but never cease to be the best you can be.”

I love it because it gives us permission to be successful in what we deem to be a failure, which more often than not leaves us feeling miserable for no other reason than the fact we are trying to impress others.

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is composed of basic needs, psychological needs, and self-fulfillment needs — or self-actualization, which is considered the holy grail. If you follow Mr. Wooden’s advice and stop pitching yourself against others, success (for you) will always be just above where you currently stand in the pyramid with self-actualization being the last to fill. Therefore, success will always be out of your grasp, but never too far that you can’t grab it.
> Like our emotions, it will be fleeting.

On the one hand, you could have someone who grew up in poverty feel overwhelming success because they landed a job in McDonald’s that affords them to pay the bills and eat. On the other hand, a Harvard graduate whose parents paid for everything and pushed them into law may feel like a failure because their environment doesn’t align with their values and they’re too terrified to confront their parents about it. Most would look at the Harvard graduate as successful and the individual working in McDonald’s as a failure—b*ecause we’re kinda dicks like that!*

Tony Robins believes we have five basic human needs. The need for certainty, variety, significance, love and connection, growth and contribution. If you fall out of alignment with two or more, your shit will soon get sour, and before long, you’ll need to book a date with destiny to meet the man himself. To give you an example, you can see unhealthy relationships with the need for significance played out on social media all day every day. And yes, my writing this is almost certainly an attempt to contribute to my need for significance.
 
With Maslow’s theory, one is simply climbing the pyramid to fulfillment (or success). Many shoot straight for the summit, only to learn when they get there they missed out on many of the vital components which Tony places more emphasis on. Even though everybody behind them is looking on in envy, thinking, *“you bastard. Do you know how lucky you are?”*

Of course, life is not linear. And this, if you ask me, is why Maslow’s hierarchy is outdated and Tony’s shit is da bomb! Success is about balance. You can move up the Hierarchy using Tony’s needs to balance you and ensure you don’t lose your mind in the process.

What stands out to me from both theories is you must continue to strive for more, but you also must carefully manage and not neglect the spiritual side of things like love, connection, and contribution on your journey to fulfillment *(which Tony places great emphasis on)*.

Suffice to say, from reading the responses, a lot of it comes down to values. So the first step should be figuring out what you value (if you don’t already know) and building your career and life around those core values. If two of your core values are lifestyle and freedom, my guess would be a suit, tie, and a corporate job in the center of Manhattan isn’t the career for you. But if you love power suits, martinis, and sports cars, then no pants all day everyday is probably not for you!

## So, what is success?

Success is an adventure. A never-ending journey. Something arbitrary you strive for defined by you for you alone. Many wealthy people we deem successful are miserable. Many poor people we deem unsuccessful are happy. If that is fact then it has to be about values and balance. The scales should always tip to that which you value most, but not so much that you fall flat on your face.

As long as you’re true to your values and what’s important to you, you’ll find your success. Don’t make it a destination you may never reach. Keep it within your grasp so you can grab it often and keep pushing it forward. That should be enough to keep you humble and honest while preventing you from losing your mind.

To your success!

# Don’t Plan Your Year. Here’s Why It’s Better To Look 18 Months Ahead

## 

Nearly everyone thinks annually when creating long-term calendars.

Planning one year ahead of time just feels right. It provides you with some easy start and end dates — your schedule begins today and finishes this time next year. And you can break it up into smaller time spans of three months each. Simple.

But I’d argue that you’ll be more organized and get more done by planning just a little further ahead.
> ***Instead of one year, lay out your schedule for 18 months.***

Planning a year-and-a-half ahead gives you a little more room to identify trends in both work and life—and lets you take advantage of fluctuations in your calendar.

Think of it like planning a vacation. There are always peak seasons and off-seasons. Depending on where you want to go, it’s better to plan your vacation during one time instead of another.

Being off cycle has its advantages.

The same logic applies to business. Eighteen months provides you with the necessary length of time to identify the different seasons in your industry and to decide how to make the most of them. So it’s an ideal time frame for any corporate strategic planning.

Here’s why it works:

## **You can perceive trends and changes in your schedule well ahead of time.**

Look at your calendar right now. I’m betting the next two months are packed. The months after that, however, are probably fairly empty.

That’s a misleading view.

Those months aren’t really empty at all. As the weeks go by, your schedule will begin to fill up. And if you’re only looking a month or two ahead, you’ll be shocked when you reach an extremely busy portion of your year.

Even something that’s not on your work schedule — say, the start of your child’s Little League season — can have an outsized impact on the amount of time you have at your disposal.
> # By planning in[ a long-range fashion,](https://medium.com/swlh/what-drug-development-can-teach-companies-about-long-term-planning-45eab66cb396?source=user_profile---------19-------------------) you’ll begin to notice trends that you wouldn’t have using an annual style of planning.

One year isn’t always enough time to pinpoint and analyze those patterns. Sometimes, events and invites are right on the edge of your year-long schedule.

For me, an 18-month calendar provides a different perspective about my schedule. But this time frame isn’t a hard-and-fast rule. The point is to consider upcoming commitments and work trends beyond the standard business year.

It’s a unique way of looking at the future, although not many people take advantage of it.

## **You can reach out to your network when it will maximize your impact.**

We all know there are times during the year when offices turn into ghost towns.

When I started working in corporate America, I was surprised to find that the end of August was so slow. I’m Indian, and the notion of going on vacation at the end of August wasn’t something I grew up with. Fourth of July, New Year’s, Labor Day — most people use these holidays to go on longer vacations.

But not everyone.
> These idle times are actually when it may be easiest to set up meetings or get in touch with people who are normally harder to reach.

If the person you’re after is in the office that week, you may be able to connect with them on short notice. You won’t catch everyone you’re trying to get ahold of, but even just one or two meetings during typically less-productive times will enable you to get much more done.

And a good long-range schedule helps you stay cognizant of these opportunities.

## **You can get a sense of what’s coming and plan accordingly.**

Just as there will be times when you want to plan a meeting or catch-up call during “off-season,” there will also be times when you’re trying to do something at the same time as everyone else.

For instance, I go to the JP Morgan conference every year. It’s a lot of fun, but it’s also takes some real endurance. I’m meeting people, chatting, and listening to speakers all day. I have to be “on” from roughly seven in the morning to 11 at night. My schedule is packed during the day, then there are dinner meetings (sometimes more than one) and corporate events at night.

This goes on for a week.

I’ve even noticed that on the way to the event, the airport and plane is buzzing with chatter. But on the way back, everyone is trying to avoid each other’s gaze — exhausted from non-stop meetings.
> ***If you know to anticipate those hectic events, you can arrange your schedule to reflect your exhaustion afterwards. You may want to take some time off, or schedule a break to recuperate.***

I know plenty of people who take the weekend after the JP Morgan conference to stay in California, go to Sonoma Valley, and generally relax before getting back to work.

## **You can internalize your schedule.**

This planning method works best when you create your schedule from scratch.

There are all kinds of great calendar apps that work really well for keeping you informed about your daily, weekly, or monthly obligations.

But I’ve found that I internalize my long-term plan best if I create it by hand. Seriously, I take a big 11x17 piece of paper, physically draw the lines to break it down by month, and [write out my next 18 months.](https://artplusmarketing.com/1-unique-writing-method-to-make-your-mind-more-effective-988b245c224d)

Once I’ve done that, I don’t have to continuously check it. It’s not like I’m dragging the schedule around with me everywhere I go. It’s more a mental model that I’ve plotted out in my head by drawing it physically.

It can be difficult to think this far in advance. It’s tough to plan 18 months into the future when you have so much on your plate this month alone.

But if you take the time now to create a long-term plan, I promise it will make the rest of your scheduling simpler.

# How To Answer ‘What Do You Want To Do?’

## Think first about how you want to be remembered.

![](1*fsA2Ia_BDnxkq84RNjFJ_Q.jpeg)

The punchline: Think first about how you want to be remembered. It will help you answer what you want to do in life.

### So, what do you want to do?

I struggled with this question for the longest time.

There was a storm inside me that constantly reminded me of my potential. The problem was I didn’t know how to apply it to answer this question.

Practicality told me to earn money to pay rent.

Experience told me to rust on to the best leaders to accelerate my learning.

Military service told me to never underestimate the power of high calibre teams and mateship.

My upbringing told me to respect people’s perspectives, motives and religion.

And hope told me that hard work’s payoff would reveal my ‘why’.

But hope isn’t a strategy and I was also no closer to answering what I wanted to do when asked by friends, colleagues or recruiters. And when the question came up when a military career was no longer an option and after my first venture failed, saying ‘I don’t know’ or fabricating an answer was exhausting.

I was desperate for an answer. The frustration was palpable and it kept me awake at night.

That’s no longer a problem.

## Answer a better question

In 2015 LinkedIn acquired [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com/), an online guided learning platform. The acquisition was a push towards LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner’s strategy to increase the importance and convenience of education.

I remember reading a summary of an interview between [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com/) co-founder and CEO Lynda Weinman and Jeff soon after the deal closed. Jeff asked Lynda about her future ambitions. Much to his surprise, Lynda responded that she prefers to think about *how she with be remembered*.

Jeff was astounded by Lynda’s answer. I was too.

Lynda started with the end in mind. Her end in mind. She could clearly describe *how* she wanted to contribute.

In strategy, that would be called describing a vision. Lynda didn’t talk about the intermediate steps or objectives. Instead, she outlined the principles or guideposts for how she would make career decisions.

Strategy set by organisations guides a large proportion of our working life. Unfortunately, corporate strategy often lacks clarity and meaning to inspire the people who are employed to deliver it.

This is because defining strategy starts at what’s known before attempting the very difficult task of describing the future state. Ironically, and to Lynda’s point, people charged with strategy at an organisational or profession level rarely ask how it will be remembered.

For example, if you’re a doctor the career path comes with some choices but it’s relatively linear. The same is true for bankers, electricians, teachers and other important jobs in established professions.

The thing is that if you fit into a traditional profession or organisation, answering what you’re going to do is largely already decided for you.

The bigger issue, [as I’ve written about before](https://philhsc.com/inspireteams/), is that a growing number of people don’t fit into a traditional career mould. And for those who do, their institutions are [facing massive disruption](https://philhsc.com/bringing-knife-gun-fight/). This means that organisations face the real threat of becoming utilities (e.g. financial services companies) or just obsolete.

The net effect is that traditional employment pathways are breaking down. Consequently, those people who used to be guided by tradition movements within an industry or profession will start being asked ‘what do you want to do?’ more often.

In other words, they will start joining entrepreneurs, those transitioning from the military and corporate refugee who is being asked the same question.

## How do you want to be remembered?

The penny immediately dropped for me when I heard Lynda’s comment. Shortly afterwards I had clarity on how to guide career decisions.

The most liberating aspect of this shift was that it didn’t rely on highly specific and exhaustive rules.

I want to be remembered for being family first, increasing collective wisdom and making the greatest net-positive impact on the world possible.

That’s my answer to ‘what would you like to do?’ and here’s how actions map to philosophy:

### On being family-first

Anyone with children will tell you how priorities change when they arrive and how quickly they grow up. We’ve made a decision to choose ventures and companies to work with that enable us to minimise (or concentrate) time spent travelling for business. Sometimes that means leaving money on the table, but rarely.

On a practical level that means being able to be home for bath time (for little ones), getting them into bed and then jumping back into work afterwards.

### On increasing collective wisdom

This means putting experience-based knowledge into the hands of people who can use it to move the world forward.

This journey consists of two parts, both of which are works in progress.

The first is learning. For me, learning comes from:

* **Finding ways to collaborate** as quickly as possible to understand perspectives and incentives

* **Speaking last** as often as possible so as to not bias conversations

* **Fighting to thoughtfully disagree** which essentially means not reacting but thinking about and formulating an argument that will (hopefully) yield a positive learning experience for those involved. It’s not always possible but you know it’s working when the people you thoughtfully disagree with come back for more.

* Finding rooms where I am easily the least smart!

The second part is paying the knowledge forward. I do that by [making the time to write each week](https://philhsc.com/writing-week-makes-difference/) and [surfacing interesting conversations with other entrepreneurs](https://foundertofounderpodcast.com/).

### On making the greatest net-positive impact

This is all about time and how you invest it to get this return. For me, that means being curious about big problems and enjoying the process of sizing the opportunity (which I love).

It also involves:

* **Exercising humility** because you won’t always get it right

* **Being kind** because the world is in a massive deficit and being kind creates unexpected opportunities with others

* **Being strong** because building new things is bloody hard

* **Making every day count** because you’re running out of time

While these ideals aren’t unique, and I’m sure many subscribe to similar notions, these three are specific enough to help me and my wife make decisions about how to invest time.

## One last thing…

I reflected on this event as part of writing *In Between*. It was a major psychological shift and turning point for me even having already started two companies at the time.

There is an inherent simplicity in this approach, like most things with hindsight, and I do hope it’s as valuable for you as it was for me.

# 5 Ways to Live a Simpler and More Intentional Life

## 5 Ways to Live a Simpler and More Intentional Life
> What makes a simple life?

This is a question that can be defined in a million different ways. *My definition* of a simple life is one that:

* **Is intentional** — meaning you do the things you want to do

* **Is easily navigated **— meaning major life decisions are few and far between, and the day-to-day decisions don’t require much serious thought

* **Is uncluttered **— meaning “less is more” and that there aren’t many things in life — material or otherwise — that weigh you down

I made a list of five ways to live by this definition. There are only five because I feel like a list of any more than thatwould make things too complicated.

Some of these are hard to do and might seem harsh or brash. Just because this list is about making things simpler, doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy to implement.

## **1. Do More Things You Enjoy**

Life’s too short to do things that suck. When you think about it, there are only a few things that humans must do to survive: eat, have shelter, and sleep (and arguably companionship).

Do what you have to do to cover those bases and plan to enjoy the rest.

I bet if you looked at your calendar for any given week, there would be at least a handful of activities on there that you aren’t looking forward to. Ask yourself:
> “Do I really need to do this?”

If after serious thought the answer is yes, then do it.

If no, then ask yourself:
> “Is this something I** enjoy** doing?”

If yes, then do it.

If no, don’t do it.

Life doesn’t have to be any more complicated than that. Sure, you might piss a few people off or make them disappointed. But at the end of the day, you’re doing ***what you want to do***.

No body else’s opinion matters.

## **2. Seek Quality Over Quantity**

More friends, more family, and more stuff don’t make you happy. People try to make this work but it doesn’t. At the end of the day, all you’re left with is more things to cause you headache.

Instead, seek quality over quantity.

If you choose to surround yourself with positive, uplifting people — whether family or friends — life becomes much simpler.

If you choose to buy only high-quality things you need, they will last and you won’t have to worry about buying more things. What you have will be enough.

This way of thinking works with just about everything.

* Love

* Food

* Alcohol

* Pets

* Exercise

Find your high quality things in life and dismiss the rest.

## **3. Get Out of Debt and Ruthlessly Cut Your Expenses**

Financial problems plague America. According to [a 2017 study](https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/savings-advice/half-americans-less-savings-2017/), 57 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings. Money issues are also still among the leading cause of divorce.

As you might already know, money can’t buy happiness…at least past a certain point. The problem is we’re manipulated by society into *wanting* things that we don’t need, causing us to buy more things and forcing us into a work-slavery relationship with bills.

We weren’t meant to work, pay bills and keep working more to pay more bills.

So instead of living like the status quo, how about you open your eyes and stop buying more things you don’t need?

Make a plan to get out of debt and then ruthlessly cut your expenses. If it’s overhead you can drop, immediately give it the axe. Netflix, Sling, cable TV, and Hulu? Do you really need ALL of them monthly? No, probably not.

If it’s a one time thing — try using the stalling technique.

When you feel the urge to buy something,*** don’t***. Wait a few days and see how you feel. If you still absolutely need it, go ahead and buy it. If not, let it go.

The less stuff you have the less money you’ll need to spend to maintain your life, so cut it all out.

## **4. Practice Mindfulness**

We live in our heads most of the day — thinking about the past, regretting it, overanalyzing it, or wondering about the future, anxious and stressing over things yet to happen.

Mindfulness isn’t anything fancy or spiritual. Its only goal is to focus your attention on the present. This moment. Right here. Right now.

When you live more in the present you have less worry, stress, and anxiety. Past troubles and future problems don’t rob you of your joy today.

There isn’t any reason I can think of NOT to practice mindfulness. It makes your life better in every way — and also much simpler.

You can learn how to meditate. Or don’t, if that’s not your thing. After all, you don’t *need* to sit like a Buddhist monk to experience the benefits.

If you can’t stand meditation, try taking a few moments to breathe deep instead — in the shower, during your commute, or while on the toilet. It doesn’t matter where you do it, only that you focus on your breath and what’s going on in the present moment.

Life’s much simpler when your focus is on today and not everything else.

## **5. Define Your Moral Compass**

Some time ago, I took a couple hours out of my morning to do something most never do in their entire lives: *define their values*.

I followed an online course that I have since forgotten, but you can Google “how to define your values” and find a plethora of guides and tools to help you.

If you do this work to define your core values, life becomes infinitely easier.

My main values turned out to be health, growth, and relationships. Knowing that, I am able to make decisions much easier.

For example, when on my way home and feeling hungry for fast food, do I stop at McDonald’s or wait until I get home and choose a healthier snack? The decision is easier with my values defined — I should do the thing that best helps my health.

When laying in bed, tired and not wanting to wake up, do I go back to bed? Or do I wake up and write an answer on Quora? If I don’t wake up, I probably won’t have time to do it later. Since growth is a core value, the decision is easy to wake up and get to work.

Not all decisions are going to be easy, and you will certainly have procrastination and other feelings acting against you. But, knowing which decisions to make will be simple, since you’ll know the right answer every time.

# Do this one simple thing with your phone and get more done in the morning than most people do all…

## Do this one simple thing with your phone and get more done in the morning than most people do all day

I do one simple thing with my phone that feels like a secret weapon. It makes my mornings incredibly productive.

Each night, around 10 p.m., I put my phone in “Do Not Disturb” mode, and I lay it face down on a table in my living room. I don’t touch the phone again until the next morning, after I’ve worked for a couple of hours.

Because of this one simple action, I’m able to write on Medium almost every day. Because of this one simple action, I [quadrupled](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-i-quadrupled-my-creative-productivity-in-2016-13fbdde5c4c3) my creative productivity, and published [three books in only six months](https://writingcooperative.com/24-things-i-learned-publishing-3-books-in-only-6-months-1b8f743e9e86).

If you want a similar result, you don’t have to put your phone face down on a table in your living room. You just have to do this one thing: Don’t allow your phone in your bedroom.

I used to keep my phone on my nightstand. I used it for an alarm. It ruined my mornings.

One morning I was scrolling through Facebook and couldn’t stop. I had already checked my email, muttering cuss words to myself as I unsubscribed from newsletters I never signed up for.

And then it hit me: I could be doing something else right now. I could start my day productively. I could start it without requests from other people, and news stories that make me feel bad.

I thought, maybe I could take control of my mornings, instead of letting my mornings take control me.

I eventually settled on one simple rule: My phone is not allowed in my bedroom.

I tried making the simple rule of not scrolling through social media or checking email before getting out of bed. That didn’t work.

I tried making the simple rule of not looking at my phone while turning off my alarm. That didn’t work.

I even tried making the simple rule of not using my phone as an alarm at all. I’d let it charge next to an alarm clock. That didn’t work.

Then I remembered something: I’m a designer. What does a designer do when they want to prevent a behavior? They make it hard to do.

This is why your computer asks for a confirmation when you delete a file. This is why you have to break the glass to get to the fire extinguisher. This is why that annoying popover is hard to close.

It’s called a forcing function: When something is designed to prevent a behavior. It’s also known as a behavior-shaping constraint. The Japanese call it poka-yoke.

If your phone isn’t in your bedroom, it’s that much harder for you to grab it. If it’s harder for you to grab your phone first thing in the morning, it’s harder to check email, read news, or do any number of things that can waste the precious first hour of your day.

If you’re like most people, your first hour is your most vulnerable. Your willpower is low, you can get distracted more easily, and each distraction can lead to another. A distracted first hour can spiral into an entire distracted day.

If it’s that much harder to waste your first hour, it’s that much easier to use it wisely.

Some people think they “can’t” keep their phone out of their bedroom. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. Here are a few of those ways:

* **Don’t use your phone as an alarm.** Get an alarm clock, or use your Amazon Echo or Google Home. If possible, don’t use an alarm at all!

* **Worried about missing emergency calls?** iOS has an option whereby certain contacts can [bypass Do Not Disturb](https://lifehacker.com/ios-10s-emergency-bypass-feature-forces-calls-and-texts-1786722365). Leave your phone outside of your bedroom, with your ringer turned on high.

* **Live in a studio apartment?** Keep your phone as far away as possible. Hide it if you need to. Some people keep their phones in a lockbox.

The first step to being productive is to prevent yourself from being unproductive. There’s little that can sabotage your productivity worse than wasting the first hour of your day.

Do one simple thing: Keep your phone out of your bedroom. It will make it harder to make bad choices, and easier to make good choices. This one good choice will lead to others.

# An Introduction to the Principles of Hermetic Philosophy

## An Introduction to the Principles of Hermetic Philosophy

## “Open Your Eye…”

One of my favorite lines from one of my favorite films, [*Dr. Strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Strange_(2016_film))*.

This is what **The Ancient One** says to Strange before she sends him hurtling through a series of multi-dimensional, reality-bending visions.

If you haven’t seen the movie (shame on you) the scene is an absolute trip — literally.

[Watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayhTVShJCt0) and then come back here.

Got that out of the way? Cool.

What this scene boils down to, and what *The Ancient One* is ultimately trying to convey to Strange, is a message that applies to all of us -

***There is far more to this reality than what lies within the scope of your senses.***

To believe otherwise would be limiting to your potential and honestly borderline ignorant — just think of all of the things we do and use on a daily basis that would have been considered “magic” by those who lived only a few hundred years ago.

And it will happen again — one day, humans will be capable of things that we currently consider impossible.

We go from a lack of understanding to understanding. That’s all that separates the possible from the impossible.

And where does that transition take place?

Why, in the mind, of course. Every part of reality that has been influenced by Man has started as the same thing —

A thought.

The takeaway here?

***Thoughts shape reality. Period.***

And that’s why this email is outlining the principles of [hermeticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism) — A philosophy predicated on the idea that the mind is the ultimate, fundamental force driving reality, and that the cultivation of this force will give one the ability to better shape reality in accordance with what they visualize.

And while you may not be creating portals to other worlds or pulling things out of thin air anytime soon, that doesn’t mean this isn’t *extremely* powerful knowledge.

Please, use it wisely.


## The 7 Hermetic Principles

**1. The Principal of Mentalism **— The All is Mind; The Universe is mental — The fundamental force driving reality is based in consciousness.

**2. The Principal of Correspondence — **As above, so below; As below, so above — Reality has a fractal nature, the micro reflects the macro and vice versa.

**3. The Principal of Vibration — **Nothing rests, everything moves, and everything is in a constant state of vibration — Reality is constantly and fundamentally in motion, nothing ever truly rests.

**4. The Principle of Polarity **— Everything is dual, everything has its pair of opposites — Reality is balanced, opposites are the same but different in degree, all truths are but half-truths. What is everything is also simultaneously nothing.

**5. The Principle of Gender — **Gender is in everything and manifests on all planes — Masculine and Feminine energy are built into the fabric of reality.

**6. The Principle of Rhythm **— Everything flows in and out, all things rise and fall — Rhythm is what regulates the balance within reality — Life, death, and rebirth are the “breath” that makes existence possible.

**7. The Principle of Cause & Effect **— Every cause has an effect, and every effect has a cause — Everything that happens, happens in accordance with this law, “chance” does not exist with this reality.

Over the next few weeks we’ll be delving into each one of these principles in depth, providing you with practical advice on how you might implement them into your own life.

I’m excited, and you should be, too.

Tell your friends, because this information, when harnessed properly, will change your life in any and every way you could possibly imagine.

# 6 Copywriting Mistakes That Are Killing Your Landing Pages

## 6 Copywriting Mistakes That Are Killing Your Conversion Rates
> # Are you struggling converting your website visitors to paying customers? Your copywriting may very well be to blame. Here’s how to fix it.

Having high-quality, persuasive copywriting within all of your marketing materials is something every brand should be striving for. When it comes to your landing pages — a critical component of any brand’s marketing — without convincing copy, all of the traffic and paid advertising in the world won’t be enough to make up for your lost sales. Luckily, almost all copywriting mistakes I commonly see on company landing pages require little effort to fix.

Here are six copywriting mistakes that could be killing your conversion rates on your web pages, plus how to fix them.

## 1. Trying to Speak to Everyone

![](1*nlaW4buMUmWB5N8-JkB5TA.jpeg)

Unless your brand is one as all-encompassing as Amazon or Walmart, trying to speak to everyone in your copywriting is an all too common mistake. By trying to appeal to everyone, your copy will come off as stale and inauthentic.

Instead, speak only to your target audience. By using the verbiage your core customers tend to use, thinking the way they think and more, they will naturally find your brand relatable, increasing the chances they will buy.

## 2. Spelling Mistakes

As basic as this point may seem, in today’s cutthroat marketplace where consumers have a seemingly endless number of providers to choose from for nearly any industry, perception is truly reality. As a result, if your brand comes off as cheap, unorganized or unprofessional, individuals will naturally think that’s how your company really is at its core — and nothing says unprofessional and lackluster quite like spelling errors.

## 3. Passive Aggressive Email Pop-ups

![](1*AItEjP9J2yDQA00SGmqTlg.jpeg)

Chances are high you’ve seen the pop-ups I’m talking about. These are the pop-ups that give you the option to either sign up for the company’s email newsletter or to exit out. Only thing is, the copy next to the exit out button reads something along the lines of, “No, I don’t want to become a successful entrepreneur”.

Please don’t use this tired tactic. It will make your brand come off as desperate. On top of that, if your secret formula was so good, would you really have to shame people into subscribing to your newsletter to download it?

## 4. Too Big of Text Blocks

In a marketplace such as today’s, when you’re competing with everything from Candy Crush to cat memes, a person’s undivided attention is currency. If your website copy is nothing but huge, intimidating blocks of text, then it’s unlikely your visitors will allocate their time and attention to read every word.

If you have a lot to say, just break up those chunks of text into 2–3 line snippets. This will make it much easier for the visitor to scroll through and skim your copy. Lastly, by keeping everything short and sweet, you’ll also be optimizing for mobile, given less text can comfortably fit onto a smartphone screen than a desktop computer.

## 5. Not Answering All of Your Customer’s Questions

No matter what product or service you’re selling, potential customers will always have a list of questions in the back of their heads they’re begging to get answered.

Because of this, why not make it easy for your customers by answering their questions before they ask you the question directly? Once you do, you’ll naturally be building up trust between your brand and your customers on top of saving time you’d otherwise spend answering questions.

If you don’t do this, customers will inevitably think there’s a catch — and for brands that have a catch, there’s always a viable competitor without a catch your customers can choose instead.

## 6. Taking Too Long to Get Your Point Across

The human attention span is officially less than that of a goldfish. Couple this will the obscene amount of content available to anyone with an internet connection and you’re left with a harsh reality: you’ve got to get your point across as swiftly as you can.

Now, this certainly doesn’t mean you should sacrifice quality of writing, building up anticipation, or maintaining your brand voice for the sake of speed. However, what this does mean is you should be inputting all of your brand’s necessary landing page components, from general information to FAQs, with the least amount of copy possible. Short, persuasive copy is oftentimes the most effective copy given more people will actually read it.

No matter what kind of business you own and operate, landing pages are more than likely a crucial piece to your online marketing puzzle, and within these landing pages, powerful copywriting is paramount to your success.

When it comes to landing page copy, there are a handful of simple mistakes that I frequently see which are absolutely killing a company’s conversion rates. By using the tips laid out in this article, you’ll be equipped with the tools needed to fix these rookie mistakes, quickly and easy.

# “Fake” Toughness Versus the Real Thing

## 

Observation: The strongest people I know — those who deadlift over 500 pounds, run 4-minutes for the mile, throw a discuss hundreds of feet, run ultramarathons, or save lives in emergency rooms — tend to be caring, considerate, and calm. The people I know who *want* to be strong and tough — but who are not — tend to be loud, defensive, and overly proud.

This is one of the great paradoxes of toughness. Once you have it you don’t need to show it. Working for it, going through challenging experiences, earning it — this stuff humbles you. It makes you compassionate. It makes you see beyond yourself. It makes you real.

***Toughness isn’t walking around with your chest puffed out trying to intimidate. It’s making the right decision under uncertainty and distress.***

***Strength isn’t yelling and shouting. It’s having the inner resources to navigate storms.***

Now, more than ever, it seems we are in desperate need of a new conception of strength and toughness, especially as it relates to masculinity. Just imagine if we started to raise our sons with the following core values:

* **Wisdom:** Allowing yourself to be open to and shaped by experience. Not being scared of change; and not being scared *to* change.

* **Real toughness:** Composure, clear-headedness, and stability in the midst of uncertainty. Not to be confused with machismo acts of strength.

* **Vulnerability:** Putting yourself out there. All of it. Even, and perhaps especially, the imperfections and flaws that make you human.

* **Humility:** Knowing what you don’t know, which, for almost all of us, is the vast majority of everything. Understanding that your view of the world is merely one of billions. Being curious instead of narrow, open instead of closed.

* **Authentic self-security: **Not feeling the need to intimidate, one-up, or make others feel bad in order to feel okay with yourself. And knowing that when you aren’t feeling okay with yourself that’s fine too — what you should do is ask for help.

It’s so important to remember that those who feel the need to make a show out of projecting their strength — be it in the gym or in the boardroom — are often the weakest. These people aren’t manly. What they are is trying to mask their insecurities. They are scared and suffering inside. It’s a shame they aren’t strong enough — aren’t tough enough — to ask for help.

For far too long we’ve glorified the idea of toughness and masculinity without thinking deeply about what behaviors we are promoting.
> # It’s so important to remember that those who feel the need to make a show out of projecting their strength — be it in the gym or in the boardroom — are often the weakest.

If you’re a man, think back to your childhood and what lessons you were taught. For most of us, we were trained to ignore or push away discomfort instead of learning how to feel it, seek support, and navigate our way through it.

Feel any-sort of pain or anxiety? Bulldoze your way through, don’t give it a second thought. Want to achieve social status? Do so through a display of power and strength: join a sports team or date the Homecoming Queen, but never speak openly about being scared, sad, or lonely. Far too often, self-worth was inextricably tied to portraying ourselves as what we *imagined — *what culture told us — strong to be.
> # One of the great paradoxes of toughness is that once you have it you don’t need to show it.

Our behaviors and expectations of men are tied to what is valued in male culture. We have this misguided idea that toughness is an outward display. Something that must be shown. The reality, though, is that it’s something deep inside. It’s a reflection of who we are. It’s being calm and collected in the storm; having the humility to navigate it openly and with curiosity; and knowing that whether we succeed or fail isn’t the point, but how we do so that matters.

The message needs to change.

Don’t confuse fake strength and toughness for the real thing. And, particularly if you’ve got young boys, be sure to call-out the former and celebrate the latter.

# How to Raise Money Without Begging Investors

## 

Trying to generate funds for your new business idea, especially an attempt to raise money online, is fiercely competitive and can easily become discouraging — if you let it. But as we all know, the most tenacious and driven entrepreneurs are most likely to succeed.

Approaching VCs and angel investors with [your pitch is one way to get funded](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/your-startup-s-pitch-only-needs-these-10-slides.html), but what’s the next step if it’s not panning out? Check out these 3 ways to raise money without begging investors to give you a shot.

### 1. Get smarter in how you approach investors.

If you feel like you’ve been pitching and begging without getting anywhere (or worse, not even getting to present and collecting a stack of rejection letters), you probably need to rejig your approach. I was totally put out by the first pile of rejection letters I received early on when I was trying to get WordStream Inc. funded, but eventually I had to take a step back and [rethink my reaction to that rejection](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/4-things-learn-from-investor-rejection-letters.html).

It became a learning experience and one of the most important lessons I took from those letters was that I needed to make a greater effort to get to [know and understand each VC and angel](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/17-venture-capital-and-angel-investors-to-follow-on-twitter.html), and [the types of businesses they were most likely to fund](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/get-to-know-your-typical-angel-investor.html). It was an epiphany that completely changed my approach — and my results.

### 2. Stand out if you’re trying to raise money online.

Crowdfunding has opened doors for tens of thousands of entrepreneurs by enabling them to tap into microfunding from many people, rather than trying to convince just a small group of people to back an idea. It’s insanely competitive, though.

Kickstarter, for example, likes to share the fact that 100,945 projects have been successfully funded through their site. But in the smaller print [in their publicly available stats](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats?ref=hello), you can see that 285,056 projects have been launched (at time of writing), meaning 64% of Kickstarter projects are not funded successfully.

Now, that’s not to take anything away from Kickstarter or other sites like it, as they provide a fantastic service to pair investors with [entrepreneurs](https://mobilemonkey.com/articles/work-life-habits-of-successful-entrepreneurs) in need of funding, and not every idea has merit. So how can you stand out and increase your chances of getting funded?

Start by identifying what compelling elements of your story are going to set you apart. [The most successful crowdfunding](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/most-successful-feel-good-crowdfunding-campaigns-of-the-year.html) campaigns often have a human interest angle, whether it’s the circumstances that led the entrepreneur to create what they did, or that [the product or service they’ve created will help others](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/this-restaurant-s-unusual-business-strategy-gives-convicts-amp-prostitutes-new-c.html), for example. Find that differentiating factor and use tell your story if you want to raise money online.

### 3. Know your value, even if your startup isn’t sexy or crazy innovative.

Not every business is going to be as exciting as [billionaire Elizabeth Holmes’](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/the-unusual-business-strategy-that-made-this-woman-a-multi-billionaire.html) revolutionizing the blood testing industry, or [Kevin Henrikson](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/this-unusual-startup-strategy-led-to-a-200-million-acquisition-by-microsoft-in-1.html) and his co-founders at Acompli deciding to reimagine mobile email. If your product isn’t super innovative or pushing technological boundaries, you might be wondering how to raise money when it seems everyone else’s ideas have more appeal.

Often, the most brilliant ideas solve a problem or a need by taking something we take for granted — something totally boring that you probably never even really think about — and making it better. [Stance used this strategy to raise $86 million](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/the-unusual-business-strategy-this-startup-used-to-raise-86-million.html) — for socks! Not every product is inherently sexy and flashy and exciting, but if you can improve an existing thing in such a way that it gets people excited and just makes more sense than the old way, you have your unique angle for pitching funders.

Compelling funders to believe in your idea enough to put their investment into it is one of the greatest challenges new founders face. It’s a learning curve, but as [successful entrepreneur Lisa Falzone says](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/5-pieces-of-startup-advice-from-under-40-entrepreneurs.html), self-motivation and a willingness to learn as you go is key to your startup success.

Still wondering how to raise money? Check out these [5 critical success factors for early stage startups](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/5-critical-success-factors-for-early-stage-startups.html) and see how you stack up, and where you can make the most impactful improvements that will lead you to funding success.

# 15 Years Of Addiction&#58; An Intense Account Of Heroin Withdrawal

## 15 Years Of Addiction: An Intense Account Of Heroin Withdrawal

### “… from a lived experience.”

It was the 10th of August 2013, and after fifteen years of chronic addiction, I had lost everything: my job, my mind, and every important relationship in my life. I was out of options, out of luck, and my body was rapidly deteriorating.

I finally decided that I needed help, but the world had other ideas. With too many drugs in my body, I was too much of an insurance risk for detox. They told me to come back when everything except opiates had left my system. Fearful that I would change my mind, I decided to go cold turkey at home. The next four weeks were [the most painful of my life](https://medium.com/the-mission/what-its-like-to-die-before-you-die-ba3fbef91e5), but the hardship was worth it. I managed to stay off everything except opiates, and I was finally allowed to go to detox. Now there was just the minor issue of a 15-year opiate withdrawal.

### The farm

Like something out of an IRA film, I was picked up on the outskirts of Dublin (Ireland) and driven to an unknown location about 20 km away. As I sat in the front seat of a beat-up minivan, I reflected on my predicament. I was entering the unknown, in more ways than one, but my new journey was strangely exciting. Energized by the idea of freedom, I was ready for the fight.

The detox facility was a little farm in the countryside. The long tree-lined driveway led up to an old house which sat in the middle of eight acres of land; four football pitches to you and me. The perimeter was lined with huge blackberry bushes and there was a tranquil little stream that cut across the far right corner. Under different circumstances, it might have been a nice little retreat, but there was something about the place, something haunting, that seemed to hang in the air.

I was introduced to seven other addicts on my arrival, and over the next few weeks, we’d cook, clean, talk, cry, and look after the farm together. We grew our own vegetables and went for walks around the grounds. There was also pigs, cats, donkeys and chickens on the farm. I loved being around the animals, and I grew particularly affectionate with the chickens. Give me a break, I was about to go through hell hah!

### Special worms

Detox was a weaning process, so baseline anxiety aside, the early days weren’t too bad. After three weeks, I was down to a dribble of methadone, 10 ml to be precise. This was tiny compared to my usual 100 ml dose, but I felt OK. I was amazed, and became fully convinced that withdrawal had given me a pass; be damned with biology. “Special me” came to mind — it’s an addict thing. While some people think that they’re special, others feel lost and depressed, like sad little worms in a big bad world. Addicts are different, however, we think we’re special little worms, and that was me in a nutshell. But I was wrong; I didn’t get a pass. A few days later ‘the sickness’ hit hard, and every bit of ‘specialness’ was kicked right out of me.

It is difficult to describe what opiate withdrawal feels like. It is often compared to flu, which is close, but with several key omissions. It is a roller coaster of emotions, feelings, and physical sensations, many of which have not been felt for a long time. My gums were throbbing, my feet were on fire, my insides were a mess, and I was terrified of the craziest things, even my wardrobe.

But the most intense physical symptom was the fever. The sharp shivering sensations cut to the centre of my bones. I vividly remember one night as I lay on the bed, quivering for hours, as the loneliness of the early morning seemed to taunt me. I put on as many clothes as I could, including my jeans, my jacket, and a huge grey bathrobe. I got back under the covers, but it was no use, I was freezing, and soon realized that time would be my only salvation. As I lay there trembling, cold sweat streaming off my body, it finally dawned on me why the mattress smelled so vile. I wasn’t the first one sweating in that bed; I’ll let your imagination run wild with that.

### Ripples from within

The physical symptoms were bad, but manageable in comparison to what came next. Combined with chronic insomnia, the biggest challenge was coping with the intense waves of anxiety. Amplified to levels I’d never experienced before, it felt like electricity rippling up and down my body, or insects crawling under my skin. I wanted to run, but there was nowhere to go. One night I thought about climbing out the window, but I was afraid of my bloody wardrobe, never mind the pitch black night of the countryside.

I was now in the depths of withdrawal, and couldn’t face my bedroom anymore. I hadn’t slept in days, and spent the next six nights sitting at the kitchen table; all the other rooms were locked. It was a small kitchen, about 12 x 20 feet, and although it was homely, it was stained, worn, and old. As I sat at the end of the table, I wanted to run away from myself, escape the relentless anxiety; I must have done 10,000 laps of that little kitchen, but I couldn’t outrun my demons.

The nights stretched for miles, and I still remember the “Tick Tock” of the clock, chugging in slow motion. Again it seemed like time would be my only saviour, but for the first time in my life, I was unsure if I would make it. I didn’t specifically think of suicide, but there was no end in sight, and I couldn’t see a way out. Now I knew why they locked the knives up at night. I’m not even mildly religious, but that’s when I decided to pray; it was all I had left. I had lost my grandma a few months previous, and we were very close. She was a devout Catholic, so I just sat in the kitchen and asked her for strength. I’m still not religious — maybe I should be — because I firmly believe that my grandma got me through those nights. Below is a photo from the diary that I kept — the last word is “answered” — I must have still been shivering!

![](1*AYsfxKUqrNIieA-SzkNo2Q.jpeg)

### Take away message

After writing about my experiences before detox, which included ‘[the most painful night of my life’](https://medium.com/the-mission/what-its-like-to-die-before-you-die-ba3fbef91e5), several people asked me what happened next. This article was my response, so I hadn’t specifically thought about a takeaway message.

On reflection, however, the message here perfectly aligns with my mission in life: to show people that [change is possible](https://medium.com/the-mission/15-years-addicted-to-heroin-5-years-addicted-to-life-heres-what-s-changed-5fb74cc0c767). It is exactly five years since I left detox, and in that time I’m proud of the changes I’ve made. I’ve rebuilt broken relationships, I’ve launched my own personal development business, I’m doing a PhD in Trinity College Dublin, and I’ve become a university lecturer teaching neuroscience, mindfulness, and addiction.

Using boldness as a core value, I’ve also reached out to highly successful individual’s in both Ireland and abroad. This has resulted in some fantastic opportunities, and I’ve made some unbelievable friends and connections along the way.

*How did I make these changes?*

I like to push boundaries, and that helps, but I made these changes through [relentless consistency](https://medium.com/the-mission/life-is-simple-if-you-follow-these-steps-f8d4bd41b5ba). I [meditate every day](https://medium.com/@brianpennie/mindfulness-social-media-an-observers-perspective-6d2ae6a69748). I read every day. I look after my physical and mental health every day. I neutralize negative influences from my life every day. I have identified my [core values](https://medium.com/@brianpennie/values-and-principles-a-forgotten-life-compass-5fa6fa83aa5c), and I act towards them every day. I don’t always do this perfectly, but I show up… EVERY SINGLE DAY.

*“There is growth in suffering if you harness its power.”*

You don’t have to take massive action, [but you do need to be consistent](https://medium.com/@brianpennie/change-your-habits-change-your-life-e9bd724a8c33). We are defined by what we repeatedly do, so just make a start, and your actions will breed more action. Before you know it, you’ll be making changes… EVERY SINGLE DAY.

# Why Small Continuous Improvement Leads To Success

## Photo by Austin Distel on Unsplash

## Small Continuous Improvements
> # “Perfection is not attainable. But if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence.” — Vince Lombardi

The smallest step towards your goals can lead to your greatest breakthroughs. Yes, I realise you’ve heard this message before, however have you ever contemplated its significance? We all want to achieve our goals and highest aspirations, that’s why you’re reading this article. But few are willing to put in the work and hours to realise success. Only a few will sacrifice their time and energy for weeks, months and sometimes decades to achieve their vision. How about you? Where do you stand in the grand scheme of things? Have you been labouring away at a goal for a while? Have you experienced any breakthroughs or is it still a work in progress? Don’t despair if you haven’t achieved the success you desire; it doesn’t mean it’s not coming together.

Cultivating success involves attending to the smallest details that may show little results initially because they are foundations that lead to the realisation of our goals. Let’s face it, the smallest tasks can be laborious and tedious at the best of times. Mostly, they are tasks that must be attended to daily, yet many find excuses to skip over them because of the boredom involved. How do you feel about this? Are there tasks you dislike doing, yet know they must be done because they contribute to your goals? It is what author Robert Maurer refers to in *One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way* as looking for solutions in uncomfortable places: “When life gets scary and difficult, we tend to look for solutions in places where it is easy or at least familiar to do so, and not in the dark, uncomfortable places where real solutions might lie.”

Small continuous improvements lead to success because just like the compound effect, if we focus on real improvements and constant practice, the success we yearn for may be closer than we think. Now, let me clarify what I mean by success in this context. Success denotes achieving a desirable outcome related to a goal or effort and may not result in an intentional victory. It is what the Stanford Professor of psychology Carol Dweck refers to in her acclaimed book *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success* as a [Growth Mindset vs a Fixed Mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/).

I won’t go into much detail here other than to say, when we have a Growth Mindset, our focus turns to continuous improvement and excellence. These are the building blocks to success as long as we assess and refine our practices to achieve our desired outcome. Similarly, undesirable outcomes may also be beneficial providing we learn from them. You no doubt know how the Post-It Note came to be invented? Through a series of accidents, Dr. Spencer Silver, a chemist at 3M was trying to invent a strong adhesive, but instead came up with a weak one which became the Post-It Note as we know it.

## Be Purposeful And Clear In Your Intentions
> # “Continuous improvement requires systematic evaluation. Continuous improvement requires unfiltered evaluation.” — Anonymous

In a similar vein, the Japanese are well known for a method called the [Kaizen approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) which involves small, continuous and incremental improvements to achieve a desired outcome. It involves a process of iterations like many software companies and apps undergo today. If we improve at 1% a day, consider the result of that improvement over 12 months. Few people focus on small improvements because it can be tedious, and it rarely delivers immediate results. This same process works in just about every area of our life, particularly our health and well-being. For example, when was the last time you set out to lose weight and became discouraged by the third or fourth week? Most people abandon their health campaign at this point preferring to find an easier way that delivers immediate results. But as you know, immediate results don’t translate to long term efficacy.

If we want to cultivate more success, we must focus on activities that deliver results and sometimes these can be tedious tasks, which explains why many people abandon them. If we set out to pursue a goal, then gradual and continuous improvements is something we must take into account, even if we cannot see the signs of success early in the piece. **The goal is much too important to leave to chance and so we must give it life by attending to the smallest tasks. **Equally, we ought to focus on the personal growth that takes place within us while pursuing our goals. Success is of little value if we have worked hard to achieve it and are unfulfilled once attained. So be purposeful in your intentions towards your goals. If you work towards it with a concerted effort, success may be closer than you think.

# How The Past Creates The Present Creates The Future…

## Using Yesterday And Today To Build Tomorrow

> # “Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.” ― Frank Herbert

### **Food For Thought**

## **Past, Present, Future**
> “Civilization is in a race between education and catastrophe. Let us learn the truth and spread it as far and wide as our circumstances allow. For the truth is the greatest weapon we have.” — H.G. Wells

How does our evolutionary makeup influence our modern-day habits? In what ways is A.I. changing our healthcare system? What can we do to create a better tomorrow? All these questions (and more!) will be answered in this week’s Mission Daily theme; **Past, Present, and Future. **🚀🚀

This past has created our present and our present will create our future. What we choose to discuss — what problems we choose to address today — will impact how we evolve and overcome in the future.

The world is changing faster than ever. The only way to tackle the challenges as quickly as they arise is to learn as fast as we can.

And that’s what this week is dedicated to — learning from the good, the bad, the terrifying, and the exceptional.

We will undoubtedly face existential problems in the future. Our only hope to solve them is if we address them now and start building our arsenal of knowledge today.

[In today’s episode,](http://bit.ly/2uT5fHB) Chad and Stephanie give a preview of our AMAZING guest lineup for this week and share some thoughts to keep in mind as we spend the next five days diving into the history and future of humankind.

**The Guest Lineup:**

Tuesday — Geoffrey Miller / Evolutionary Psychologist**
**Wednesday — Diana S. Fleischman / Evolutionary Psychologist**
**Thursday — Dr. Eric Topol / Author — Deep Medicine**
**Friday — A.G. Riddle / Scifi Author — Winter World

If you have any stake in what the future holds (spoiler alert: we all do!), then you won’t want to miss [this week’s](http://bit.ly/2uT5fHB) mind-boggling interviews.

### **Deep Dive**

## **How Do We Shape Each Other’s Behaviors?**
> “Throughout history, evolutionary advantage meant being best adapted to surviving in a wild and harsh environment… Fast forward to today and our biggest moments are no longer hunts or harvests, but conversations, meetings and dates. Our environment is a distinctly human one. It is an intricate web of complex social networks… Surviving in the modern world means being best adapted to interacting with, working alongside, and getting what you want out of other people…”

### **Further Reading**

## **Can Science Fiction Predict the Future of Technology?**

According to writer Arthur C. Clarke, “A critical . . . reading of science fiction is essential training for anyone wishing to look more than ten years ahead.”

Author Orson Scott Card echoes the importance of sci-fi, stating that, “We have to think of [these futures] so that if the worst does come, we’ll already know how to live in that universe.”

But can we really turn to science fiction novels to help us understand and predict the future? 🤔

## **Monday Mindbenders**

[In today’s episode](http://bit.ly/2uT5fHB) of Mission Daily, Chad and Steph discuss the Dark Forest Theory. The theory states that the best way to protect ourselves from outsiders is to not let them know we are there — to conceal ourselves in the proverbial “dark forest” where we can’t be found. We’ll discuss this concept in more detail later on in the week, but to get your gears turning early, start with these resources:

# How to protect yourself from communication overload

## Whatever your job title — freelancer, project manager, designer, or CEO — you probably spend more time than you’d like on email and chat platforms.

In fact, a recent survey of 50,000 designers and knowledge workers from around the world found that [most people can’t go six minutes without checking their inbox](https://blog.rescuetime.com/communication-multitasking-switches/).

Even worse, the majority of people never get an hour of focused time a day. That’s without email or [Slack](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/slack-designs-delight/).

I don’t know about you, but those are pretty scary statistics. How are we supposed to [focus](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/designers-ideal-workflow/), or simply do our job, if we can’t go 10 minutes without being sucked into email?

Email and Slack aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. So let’s learn how to use these tools efficiently.
> # “Communication overload is real. And we need to get a handle on it.”

## Why we’re so addicted to email and Slack

The problem with communication is that it’s become such an integral part of our jobs. We ask questions, share knowledge, and [collaborate](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/collaboration-and-great-products/) on email and Slack — so they don’t always seem like distractions.

But what else would you happily forfeit your attention for every six minutes?

It’s easy to point the finger at notifications. But the truth is, our vulnerability to FOMO and social pressure to be “always on” makes us just as likely to distract ourselves.

Just think about this: A recent study found that [84% of people keep their inbox open in the background at all times, with 70% of emails being opened within six seconds of receipt](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1240624.1240730).

Basecamp’s Jason Fried wrote in his now-famous essay, *Is group chat making you sweat?:* “[The] problem is that a chat window is a black hole for your attention — constantly pulling your gaze, constantly chipping away at your focus. Playing whack-a-mole with unread indicators across dozens of rooms/channels causes manic context-shifting.”

Communication overload is real. And we need to get a handle on it.

## 5 ways to keep your communication in check

I’m not trying to vilify communication tools here. And the answer definitely isn’t to delete your email accounts, go off the grid, and start sending messages and mockups via carrier pigeon.

Instead, we’re trying to find ways to balance your need for focused time with your need to be responsive and available. It’s no small task. But with a bit of preparation and dedication, it can be done.

## 1. Commit your first hour (or more) to the most important work

Beating communication overload isn’t just about spending less time on email or Slack. It’s about having time to make progress on the work that matters most to you.

This isn’t just important for your job, but also your well-being. When Harvard’s [Teresa Amabile](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins) looked into the daily habits of hundreds of knowledge workers, she found that out of all the things that can boost our mood and motivation during the work day, “the single most important is making progress on meaningful work.”
> # “How are we supposed to focus, or simply do our job, if we can’t go 10 minutes without being sucked into email?”

If you know your day is going to be hectic with communication, try to find space to make progress before it begins. As entrepreneur, blogger, and podcast host Ryan Robinson explains:

“Even though I wake up most days with the goal (and plan) of spending the majority of my time [growing my blog](https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/), more often than not I look up just before lunchtime and realize I’ve been sucked into emails or putting out a fire in Slack. **For me, the best option has been simply to accept that communication is going to take up a big chunk of my day and work my schedule around that.**”

For Ryan, this has meant spending the last five years getting up at 5am to tackle his most important work before the rest of the world starts demanding his attention.

Whether you call it “[eating the frog](https://www.fastcompany.com/1592454/work-smart-do-your-worst-task-first-or-eat-live-frog-every-morning)” like Mark Twain or “tackling your MITs” ([Most Important Things](https://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/)) like *Zen Habits* founder Leo Babauta, starting your day with some heads-down, communication-free time is a great way to get an early win.

## 2. Set “office hours” to avoid constant context switching

One of the worst things about bouncing between emails or Slack and your core work is just how much that [task-switching](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/multitasking-ruins-productivity/) can mess with your productivity. According to [Dr. David Meyer](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx),”Even brief mental blocks created by shifting between tasks can cost as much as 40% of someone’s productive time.”

Once the day has started, you can still protect yourself from too much communication by limiting when you’re available on chat and email. I like to call these **office hours**: set times when everyone knows you’re free for questions or meetings.
> # “Even brief mental blocks created by shifting between tasks can cost as much as 40% of someone’s productive time.”

Not only do office hours help protect your focus, but they force those seeking your advice to come prepared with questions instead of off-the-cuff inquiries.

## 3. When you need to chat, practice “bursty” communication

There’s no getting over the need to communicate during the day, especially if you’re on a [remote team](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/eliminating-remote-work-distractions/). But simply leaving your Slack open for long, asynchronous chats is counterproductive.

In a [new study](http://behavioralscientist.org/bursty-communication-can-help-remote-teams-thrive/) published in the *Academy of Management Discoveries*, researchers discovered that teams who communicate in “bursts” — exchanging messages quickly during periods of high activity — perform significantly better than those who let their conversations linger throughout the day.

As the study’s authors explain, “People often think that constant communication is most effective, but actually, we find that bursts of rapid communication, followed by longer periods of silence, are telltale signs of successful teams.”

Unlike office hours, this method needs to be implemented on a team-wide scale to work. Talk to everyone about expectations around communication. When are you expected to respond? Can you find specific times during the day that are more high-volume than others?

![](1*q32aHH_H7ifA8DkIRdtXMQ.jpeg)

## 4. Use do-not-disturb mode to give yourself some “maker time”

As investor and Y Combinator founder Paul Graham explained in his essay on [“maker” vs. “manager” time](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), designers, coders, and writers need more than 30-minute or hour-long chunks of focused time to get serious work done. Unfortunately, as we’ve already seen, the modern workplace rarely allows for that.

Even if someone doesn’t realize they’re interrupting your focus, a poorly-timed email, meeting request, or cat gif in Slack can knock you out of your flow. As [Basecamp’s Jason Fried explains it](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d):

“If someone was interrupted every 15 minutes while they were trying to sleep, you wouldn’t think they’d be getting a good night’s sleep. So how can getting interrupted all day long lead to a good day’s work?”
> # “Designers, coders, and writers need more than 30-minute or hour-long chunks of focused time to get serious work done.”

To protect yourself, the simplest way is to make yourself completely unavailable to distractions. Pretty much every major operating system — from Apple to Windows to Android — has a [do-not-disturb mode](https://blog.rescuetime.com/do-not-disturb/) that will silence all notifications when activated.

Get to know this mode, and use it a reprieve when you need to get things done. Your notifications will still be there, waiting for you, when you’re ready for them.

## 5. Actively train your brain back into focused mode

The problem with leaving communication overload unchecked is that it trains your brain to be more easily distracted. Every time you jump into your email or check Slack, you’re killing your ability to focus.

As [Catherine Price](https://blog.rescuetime.com/catherine-price/), author of *How to Break up with Your Phone*, explains, “The time you spend allowing yourself to get sucked into the cycle of distraction and reward seeking, is undoing some of the hard work that you’ve been doing over the course of your life to maintain the ability to avoid distractions.”
> # “The problem with leaving communication overload unchecked is that it trains your brain to be more easily distracted.”

It’s no small task re-building your attention muscle. But it starts with putting some distance between you and your communication tools.

Quit Slack when you’re not using it, and don’t keep your email inbox open throughout the day. Get rid of all your desktop notifications.

Just a bit of space can help you retrain your ability to focus for longer periods of time.

## You’ll never get rid of communication. But you don’t have to let it take over your day.

Communication tools are awesome. They help us connect remotely, collaborate on fun projects, and stay abreast of important information. But if left unchecked, they can become major productivity-killers.

Like everything in life, balance is key. Try a few of these recommendations, and you’ll be surprised what you can accomplish in an hour of uninterrupted time.

# This Top Astronaut Explains What Separates Winners From Losers

## Photo by NASA on Unsplash

U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly is famous for spending a year on the International Space Station in 2015–16.

Kelly captured the attention of people around the world by uploading videos to YouTube explaining how to live, work and even grow zinnias at zero-g.

Spending a year in space was the culmination of a lifelong dream for Kelly, but how did he achieve it?

## He Embraced Lifelong Learning

While attending State University of New York Maritime College, Kelly was an indifferent student, at least at first.

In his autobiography, *Endurance,* Kelly recounts when a big calculus exam loomed over a particular Labor Day weekend, as did an alluring frat house nearby.

Kelly phoned his twin brother Mark (who also became an astronaut) to tell him about the party.

Mark was horrified.
> # “You’re in school. You need to absolutely ace this exam, and everything else, if you want to get caught up. You need to spend this entire weekend at your desk, doing every problem in every chapter this exam is going to cover.”

So, Scott spent his weekend studying instead of partying. When he took the exam the following week, he understood all the questions and received his first 100 out of 100.

Throughout his book, Kelly describes the many exams he had to take to become a navy pilot and astronaut. He cultivated a mindset of lifelong learning to acquire the skills he needed [to win](https://medium.com/@BryanJCollins/mastery-its-the-secret-to-your-success-9df59779adbc).

He said,”I knew how to work hard and enjoyed seeing it pay off. It almost became a game I played with myself: Let’s see how well I can do at this.”

## He Learned How To Manage His Mistakes

Mistakes are a normal part of work, but they hold more consequences for pilots of navy planes or space shuttles.

(In his book, Kelly writes about his grief when friends were killed in plane crashes.)

One of Kelly’s biggest and earliest mistakes occurred while learning to fly the T-34 during navy pilot training. His flight went relatively well until time to land the propeller-driven plane.

A navy pilot must remember to lower landing gear below a certain speed to avoid damaging the plane, but Kelly lowered his too fast and too soon. Luckily, the landing gear was undamaged, and he was able to land safely.

Kelly reflected on this mistake:
> # “There is a saying in the navy about mistakes: There are those who have and those who will…Bearing this in mind can guard against the kind of cockiness that gets pilots killed, and in retrospect my error overspeeding the landing gear was a good early lesson.”

## He Did Many Difficult Things

Throughout his long career, Kelly’s goal of becoming first a navy pilot and astronaut drove his efforts.


He was remarkably [focused](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-spend-your-working-day-wisely-and-actually-get-things-done-2824628e31d6) on this goal for years, and he credited doing many hard things with helping him work toward it.

Kelly took many exams and completed advanced flight training programs around the world with the US Navy before joining NASA in 1996.

He said,”The goal that had driven me to become an astronaut was to fly more and more challenging aircraft until I got to the hardest thing there was to fly: the space shuttle.”

Even then, his job demanded he perform difficult tasks outside of a typical pilot’s skill set.

He explained space station astronauts spend a large part of their work day on science experiments.
> # “Dissecting a mouse is a far cry from landing a space shuttle — but then again, so is unpacking cargo, repairing an air conditioner, or learning to speak Russian…I’ve come to appreciate that this job has challenged me to do not just one hard thing but many hard things.”

A commitment to lifelong learning helped Kelly focus on his goals and win over the long term.

Although Kelly made mistakes during his career, he overcame those setbacks and focused on doing many hard things to [achieve his goal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2018/06/21/goal-strategies/#3206d8727b5a) of becoming an astronaut and spending a year in space.

# You Can’t Afford to Ignore These 4 Soft Skills When Hiring Your First Employees

## 

It’s the fourth quarter, and your team is down. There’s only a minute and a half left on the clock. You’re dead tired. Your body is aching. And you would much rather be home in bed than out there, in front of everyone watching. You’re the underdog, so giving up is easy. The problem is, giving up would only prove everyone else right.
> It’s in tough times like this when you have a choice to make: do you fight through the pain to victory, or give in and accept defeat?

Anyone who has been part of an early startup knows that it’s the most grueling team sport on the planet. Underneath all of the media hype and perceived glamour there is a lot of blood, sweat, and tears that goes into making your underdog team succeed. So who you have on your team during these hard times is critical.

In fact, as the founder of a young startup, there are few decisions you’ll make that are more important than your first hires. Unfortunately, when it comes to hiring, there is one big, common issue…

## **Soft skills and team culture are the least intuitive aspect of the hiring process. As a result, they are often overlooked early on.**

While you want all of the hard skills you can get (i.e., engineering, design talent, etc.), it’s often the soft skills — and the resulting team cohesion — that will decide whether your underdog journey becomes the backstory of the next Moneyball, or whether it goes straight to DVD.
> Your initial hires set a standard that all future employees will then try to meet, which means those first few hires will have a long-lasting impact on your company.

Your processes, your turnover, your ability to recruit, and, most importantly, your ability to go into high-gear and deliver results will all depend on the soft skills of the early hires.

As startup founders, and now Heads of Studio at [Glu Mobile](https://www.glu.com/), my co-founder Alex and I have made many hiring decisions — both good and bad — over the past few years. Initially, we fell for the trap of prioritizing hard skills and raw engineering power over culture and soft skills — likely because hard skills are easier to measure via resume, github activity, and test task results.

Soft skills are much harder to measure and [test for](https://medium.com/@paley/the-5-non-coding-tests-you-should-always-give-a-candidate-before-hiring-them-f1bc17b61bd0). However, looking back, they have been the key to our company’s success — and they likely are just as important to your company, too, whether you realize it or not.

To help others establish some process around measuring soft skills, we have come up with 4 that we value most, which we call CCCP (a small ode to my Soviet heritage) — Crank Mode, Collaboration, Creativity, and Polish. Here’s what they mean.

## **1: Crank Mode — driving toward a clear goal and working well under pressure**

The first skill we screen for is something we call “Crank Mode.”

To say that an employee possesses “Crank Mode” is to say they’re willing to put in extra effort or time to complete something critical or motivate others to do the same. It’s a matter of identifying a goal, whatever it might be, and pushing yourself into high gear to actualize it. Think Tom Brady leading his team down the field in the fourth quarter, refusing defeat.

Crank Mode has a lot more to do with an ability to drive something to completion than it does with working overtime. An employee doesn’t necessarily need to work weekends or stay in the office until midnight to meet this criteria, but they should be willing to if that’s what a given situation or project requires. As a young startup, there will be situations that necessitate long hours and late nights, and you’ll need people on your team inspired to step up and work their asses off when needed.

## **2: Collaboration — being a good “passer”**

The second part to being a good quarterback, besides turning on Crank Mode in the fourth quarter, is actually “passing” the ball well to others.

Ultimately, there are few tasks in growing startups that can truly be completed individually from start to finish. Nearly every process is on some level cross-functional, requiring a certain amount of back and forth across teams, specialties, or even departments. Just as you have to be able to grab the ball and drive down the field, employees also need to be able to set others up for success, either in the midst of or upon completing a project or task.

This is a trait that’s less common than you might think — and it’s multifaceted. Skilled collaborators don’t just finish their job and sit quietly. They proactively reach out to those around them to make sure they understand that the ball is in their court now. That means that the materials are actively passed from one collaborator to the next, and everyone knows who they can turn to for questions.

Good collaborators anticipate points of confusion (and key moments in time in a workflow) to make sure that everyone up and down the chain of command possesses essential understanding regarding the process or job in question. For example, if a designer is handing a new interface off to a client engineer, the designer should proactively check in with his or her engineering counterpart at least 3 times:

1. First, during feature planning, to give the engineer a forward-looking time estimate on when the assets will be ready and prepped for hand-off.

1. Second, when the assets are actually done, to make sure the engineer knows that he or she can start implementing them. A lot of designers fail at this step — they finish their design, and assume that everyone knows when and where to find them.

1. Third, once the design is implemented, the designer should test the assets in-game or in-app to make sure there aren’t any glaring issues. You will be surprised what QA might miss that a designer’s “eagle eye” can catch in under 30 seconds.

That’s the pass — that’s the collaboration.

## **3: Creativity — coming up with original ideas and improvising on the fly**

Of course, in startups, another critical skill for employees to hold is creativity — the ability to contribute original ideas and improvise solutions. Many think that this only applies to Product, but in reality it also applies to Process.

For one thing, employees at young startups will often be explicitly tasked with creating processes and functions that have no formula or official documentation. Examples of this can be automation of manual processes, optimization of your art pipeline workflow, or improvements to your new hire onboarding. It’s critical that employees are able to fill in gaps where information is missing and contribute to the formation of new standards.

Plus, even if certain processes have been established, early team members need to identify when those more systematic functions can be improved, along with why. Building a company, especially early on, is a fluid, malleable process — there will almost always be components of your various workflows that can be streamlined or otherwise made more efficient.

After all, one of your main advantages as a startup is moving fast and adopting unconventional processes that are hard for the big players to copy.

## **4: Polish — doing things right and having an intuition for quality**

Finally, the last skill we screen for in new employees is “polish” — evidence that the employee in question won’t hand in sloppy work and simply go home for the day.

There’s a difference between meeting the technical bare minimum when completing a task, and creating something of value that can be expanded upon and used elsewhere. The latter is what young companies rely upon. Founders build their businesses like houses: piece-by-interdependent-piece. A sloppily-engineered feature or a mismanaged sales channel amounts to a shaky foundation, sure to imperil your company somewhere further down the line.

What we look for to ensure we’re not hiring people who might put our company in danger are people with a high internal bar of quality — people who invest the extra time, effort, and focus required of ensuring something is truly of use, complete, and forward-thinking.

This amounts, in a sense, to awareness and judgement, and people who lack it inevitably require a lot of micromanagement. They’ll routinely drop the ball by completing the bare minimum requirement, not considering edge cases or how a product may evolve. This laziness and lack of forward-thinking will be something that you and the rest of your team will pay for in folds later on. Such systemic and constant inefficiency from even one link in the chain can poison team culture and performance from within.

## **Don’t ignore soft skills just because they are harder to measure and screen for.**

From a practical standpoint, it’s difficult to systematically screen for these traits above, but I’ve learned through experience that each of them is absolutely critical.

One way to check for them is to hire potential employees part-time (or on a full-time trial period) before bringing them on full-time. Giving potential team members a “trial period” allows both sides to field-test for cultural fit, and gives you the time and insight to determine whether or not the employee has what it takes to truly add value to your growing company.

In practice, a trial period can be done via a creative pay structure that gives both the employee and the employer good incentives — like, for example, reduced pay for the first 90 days with a signing bonus if the trial period is passed successfully.

# What the Most Shared Content on Facebook Can Teach You About Engagement

## 

When publishers post content on Facebook, the goal is to grab as much positive attention as possible while engaging with your audience. But figuring out how to do that isn’t always easy. Luckily, some recently released research can teach you a lot about [viral content creation](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/this-report-will-make-you-rethink-how-you-use-face.html), particularly when it comes to [how you use video](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/3-ways-youll-be-using-facebook-video-differently-next-year.html).

The minds at [BuzzSumo](http://buzzsumo.com/blog/the-most-shared-facebook-content-posts-videos/) analyzed two billion articles and posts that were published on Facebook in 2017, releasing their findings to the masses. Here’s an overview of the top content over the year, and some insights that can help you [improve your Facebook post game](https://mobilemonkey.com/blog/2017/12/facebook-power-user-tips).

## A Look at the Most Shared Content on Facebook in 2017

![](0*CQyPE9O842aLIUtY.jpg)

Image source: [BuzzSumo](http://buzzsumo.com/blog/the-most-shared-facebook-content-posts-videos/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=non-european)

Examining the most shared content on Facebook list shows that users are often quick to spread material that is entertaining, heartwarming, or inspiring, even if it the article or video doesn’t originate on the platform.

While most posters can only dream of engaging with an audience at the level of a music video, the data also shows that content with a strong tribal element can be incredibly powerful.

Additionally, a lot of people use Facebook to keep up with the news, but the results can be somewhat hit and miss, as multiple organizations generally cover the same story. However, exclusive or breaking content can reach unicorn levels of engagement, particularly if it connects with a large audience.

Quizzes have been popular since they began popping up on social media, including those that [examine personality types](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/4-major-personality-types-amp-ideal-careers-for-each-one-infographic.html) and knowledge levels in particular subjects, but they aren’t reaching the level of engagement they once did, possibly due to the degree of saturation. They also rarely result in backlinks, even though they are widely shared, perhaps because these posts are seen as fun, but not necessarily evergreen.

Travel and adventure pieces, such as those discuss [hot vacation destinations](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/drop-work-right-now-and-head-to-one-of-these-5-top-vacation-destinations-for-201.html), can also reach epic heights, often because the content is inspiring in nature and augmented by the fact that these articles tend to use striking visual images that could serve as a mental escape from the day-to-day.

Heartwarming stories can gain a lot of traction, as most people enjoy seeing the good in the world, especially in the wake of a tragedy. Further, content that is supportive in nature, acknowledging a group’s hardships and offering reassurance, may also get a lot of attention.

The results of research studies or articles about scientific findings are another category that can do well on Facebook, particularly if there is an attention-grabbing headline.

On the other side, opinion posts can be big on social media, especially if they speak to something at the forefront of everyone’s minds.

## 2017’s Most Viral Facebook Posts

![](0*jUpOTHIu-WbJ7tgF.jpg)

Image source: [BuzzSumo](http://buzzsumo.com/blog/the-most-shared-facebook-content-posts-videos/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=non-european)

The graphic on the most viral Facebook posts genuinely highlights the power of videos on social media, with 17 of the top 20 posts featuring that format.

Again, music videos are featured heavily, as well as heartwarming and inspiring content, including multiple cute animal videos.

Practical hacks and food-related videos are also frequent entries on the list.

One point some may find surprising is that four of the top 20 posts were published in Spanish and one was in French, showing that those who may not speak English, either fluently or at all, are a powerful force online.

## What This Research Can Teach You

One of the most important points made in the research is that these posts are outliers, and many of the pages that shared the content has massive audiences. The more followers a page has, the easier it is to get the content in front of users’ eyes, increasing the potential for a huge number of shares.

However, having engaging content is the key to potential social media success, as that is what attracts people to your page, leads to followers and likes, and results in shares.

As the research showed, on Facebook, [video is huge](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/this-report-will-make-you-rethink-how-you-use-face.html), making up the vast majority of the top posts. That means, you need to start posting videos, if you aren’t already, particularly because engagement levels with [images and link posts](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/this-is-why-facebook-engagement-is-falling-for-bra.html) have been declining rapidly.

Additionally, Facebook is favoring video content, including those produced on Facebook Live, increasing the odds of it appearing in news feeds. Since the battle against Facebook algorithms, which seem always to be changing, is on-going, shifting to a preferred format helps you get ahead.

Having a video-based strategy means your organic reach may increase and your [Facebook ads](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/my-top-10-favorite-facebook-advertising-features.html) could gain more traction (which is incredibly helpful if your [organic ready has been dying](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/4-facebook-algorithm-hacks-to-revive-your-organic-reach.html)), helping you make the most of your advertising dollars and connect with the widest possible audience. As your audience grows, it will be easier to get your content shared, especially if your focus on high-quality clips and engaging content.

The videos don’t have to be lengthy to be successful, as clips as short as 90 seconds can do the trick. However, it must have a high production value, including striking images and high-quality sound, or your message isn’t likely to be heard, let alone shared.

If you are looking for an angle for the video, focus on being entertaining, inspiring, or heartwarming, as these may be the easiest to incorporate. However, if practical hacks match up to your product offerings, don’t ignore that route as a possibility.

# Is it a problem? Or a blessing?

## Is it a problem? Or a blessing?

We all have them.

Yeah, you guessed it. I’m talking about *problemos*.

It doesn’t matter how rich, beautiful, or lucky you are. You’ll still *always* have problems.

So, instead of aiming for a life without any problems. (Because that life doesn’t exist, unfortunately). Maybe it’s time for us to shift focus. To start looking at our problems as our blessings in disguise or as guidance.

Before you go all, “*Seriously Maria, what are you talking about??*” stay with me.

Problems offer us two paths. The first one is where we allow our problems to put us down. To act as proof of what *isn’t *working.

*“See, I’ll never find love again*.”

*“Another ‘no’, that must mean I’m not cut out for this*.”

*“I’ve tried so many strategies or plans, and nothing seems to be working*.”

The first path can be especially tempting for those sticky problems. You know those problems that doesn’t seem to disappear no matter what you do. (So frustrating, isn’t it?)

If you got one area of your life you’re not satisfied with — like your health, body or work situation — and you allow your problems to be the excuse to why things aren’t improving. Then your only option is this: to lower your standards. To accept things as they are, without striving to improve the situation. (Or maybe do a half-hearted try, but then give up because you feel that everything is stacked up against you).

**Your other option is to look at your problems as your blessing in disguise. As your clue or guidance to the area you need to grow, expand and elevate in.**

Obstacles, difficulties and life-crises can often be the fuel you need to figure out a solution. Just consider the problems these successful people had to deal with:

* Bill Gates’ first business failed.

* Jay-Z couldn’t get signed to any record labels.

* Stephen King’s first novel was rejected 30 times.

* Oprah was publicly fired from her first television job.

* J.K. Rowling was a single mom living on welfare when she began writing Harry Potter.

Because here’s the thing: problems suck. It’s as simple as that.

But what’s the good things about something that *really* sucks? It’s hard to ignore. It’s hard to tuck away, or pretend it’s not there. Thanks to your itching problem, you’re basically *pushed* to act and to find a solution.

As Tony Robbins said:

*“The only problem we really have is that we think we’re not supposed to have problems! Problems call us to higher level.*”

**Maybe your greatest problem isn’t there to make your life miserable. Maybe it’s there to teach you something important? Maybe it’s there to help you elevate, find a better solution and to rise to a higher standard?**

Start looking for the blessing in disguise. Start shifting focus from what *isn’t *working, to what you can *win* if you move past it…

What would you be able to give to others?

What kind of person would you become if you moved past it?

What kind of improvements could you see and expect in your life?

One of my biggest struggles, a few years back, was that I didn’t know what work I was “meant to do”. I knew I was destined for something, I just didn’t know how I would go about finding it. Through lots of trial and error (including tears, stress and frustration) I found a process that works. Today, I’m lucky enough to guide others through that process. Here’s what Dave said about it:

*“Maria helped me navigate through a sea of external pressures and personal expectations to rediscover the things that are truly meaningful and fulfilling for me. She helped me work through a number of deep-rooted blockers that have hindered me throughout most of my life. One of the most eye-opening exercises helped me whittle down an overwhelming list of personal goals into a very tangible set of common themes that define my core passions*.”

# Forget Your Stock Options. This 1 Thing Is the Key to Choosing Your Next Job

## NakedPoppy Instagram

Over the years, I’ve been lucky enough to work at some pretty cool companies.

Yes, two of them tanked; not the outcome anyone writes home about. :) But three were acquired by brands like Apple and Amazon, and three successfully went public.
> # This has led some people to ask how I “choose companies so well.” The implication is that I decide where to work based on how likely the company is to enjoy a high, liquid stock price.

This question heated up recently when two of my former organizations, Eventbrite and Upwork, both had IPOs within a two-week span. People were beginning to wonder if I have a secret.

And the truth is, I do — but it’s probably not what you’d expect.

I don’t pick companies as stocks to invest in. In fact, I’m a terrible stock picker. If someone gave me a million dollars and said, “Here, invest this in the stock market,” I would panic and bomb.

## **My secret? I choose *people*. Not companies.**

I place my stock in the people at any organization for three reasons:

### *1. Passionate people who are good at what they do are the safest business bet there is.*

Great people on a mission stop at nothing to delight customers.

They’re maniacally focused on winning. Great people are adaptive — they relentlessly seek solutions to customer problems, seize opportunities and continuously learn and grow.

Most importantly, they’re good at identifying what priorities to focus on —** the 20 percent of the effort that gets 80 percent of the results **— and then executing with excellence.

### *2. Great people, who put the customer and business ahead of themselves, coalesce into unstoppable teams.*

Most of us spend many hours at work. So I think it is a big deal to enjoy one’s daily experience. When you’re part of an inspiring team that is innovating and accomplishing exciting things, work doesn’t feel like work.

At my favorite companies, the journey genuinely is the reward.

### *3. Great people travel in packs.*

Teams that move mountains together have a way of regrouping.

When I first moved to Silicon Valley, I received two job offers: one at a company that offered generous compensation, and one at considerably lower pay, but brimming with incredible people.

You can probably guess which position I went for.

The company offering less money was an Apple subsidiary, and the [positive energy](https://theascent.pub/this-1-quality-is-key-to-a-successful-career-68692ed4b88a) there was palpable. Led by the late, great Bill Campbell, the team was energetic, passionate, and on a mission.
> # It drew me in stronger than a number on a paycheck ever could.

Sure enough, my subsequent job was with a startup alongside a number of former colleagues.

We had quite the adventure, building our little company from scratch. And, for the rest of my career, I intersected with many of the same people, sometimes as co-workers and sometimes as investors and board members.

## **So, my advice is this: pick your next job based on the people.**

How do you *identify* great people?

Be relentless about doing reference checks on your future boss, your colleagues and the company itself.

Check out reviews on Glassdoor.com — they help you get a feel for the culture.

Search high and low for people in your network who know the cast of characters you’d be working with. Probe extensively for what they know. Be sure to ask about shortcomings as well as strengths.
> # After all, you’re looking at the next several years of your life. You should be putting as much investigative work into the people and culture as analysts writing up stock reports.

Here’s what happened when Gary Swart, the CEO of oDesk (since renamed Upwork) reached out about a role with the company. I spent a great deal of time getting to know him, and spent even more time grilling anyone who would talk to me about him and others at the company.
> # Gary realized I cared deeply about the team. So he did something quite clever and arranged a breakfast with two senior marketing team members who’d report to me: Adrian Fung and Mollie Carter.

I loved them.

After our breakfast, which was accompanied by a lot of laughter (this is because Adrian is a brilliant person who is always laughing), I thought, “I have to work at this company because I love this team.”

Adrian and Mollie sealed the deal. And I worked at oDesk/Upwork for nearly four cherished years.

And where am I now? At my little clean beauty startup, [NakedPoppy,](https://nakedpoppy.com/) (in which Gary is now an investor) working — yet again — with some of my favorite former colleagues.

This includes my co-founder Kimberly Shenk with whom every day is a joy. Creating this company out of thin air is the most difficult thing I’ve ever done, yet there’s nothing I’d rather be doing.

I invite you to consider this approach. Choose the best people. An excellent adventure will surely follow.

# Overheard in real life, “My phone is like a prison.”

## Overheard in real life, “My phone is like a prison.”

### The Mission Newsletter, 9/14/18

![](0*MSGwo3QEHtGJb28v)
> # “Certain things catch your eye, but pursue only those that capture the heart.” — Ancient Indian Proverb

## What happens when people don’t ask Q’s.

During the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, a Japanese wearables company rolled out the very first step-counter called a manpo-kei, which translates as [“10,000-step meter”](https://themission.activehosted.com/lt.php?notrack=1&notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=26A38A2A725). Why? Because it sounded “healthy-ish”. No one stopped to ask whether 10,000 steps was the right goal or if it should be say, 9,000 steps or maybe even 11,000 steps. 54 years later, FitBit is making a killing on this 10,000 steps thingy and Americans are obsessed.
> “One of the major problems with the 10,000-steps-a-day goal is that it doesn’t take into account the intensity of exercise. Getting out of breath and increasing your heart rate may well be even more important than the exact number of steps taken.”

![](0*zgPutb2tvhi9LlVf)

### Boston is becoming bougie.

Analytics firm NeighborhoodX got real nerdy with their data recently and broke out the [price-per-square-foot](https://themission.activehosted.com/lt.php?notrack=1&notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=26A38A2A726) of New York City’s and Boston’s most popular ‘hoods. The big takeaway: Boston is catching up, fast. In fact, Boston’s second hottest area, the Seaport District, fetches higher prices at $2,019 per square-foot than Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood. (One giant asterisk — the study only examined areas with new construction. Old homes didn’t make the cut.)

![](0*JA2cDmQeXojSVQb9)

### Happiness is possible if you just put. the. phone. down.

[Google’s UX research team](https://themission.activehosted.com/lt.php?notrack=1&notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=26A38A2A727) conducted a pretty meaty study across several continents to find out why phones are causing human beings a colossal amount of s-t-r-e-s-s.

Reason №1: It’s addicting. One of the study participants literally equated their phone to a prison. You can’t get out.

Reason №2: There’s too much obligation to respond. It’s the new “pet.” Without the shedding.

To help people find a sense of balance, they’re piloting a new Digital Wellbeing effort complete with features to encourage greater usage awareness, and urging people to embrace JOMO, the “joy of missing out.” It’s kind of sweet.

**iWheels are coming. Maybe in the winter. (Maybe not.)**
A leaked patent from Apple’s super-top-secret-locked-down-vault indicates the tech company may be plotting a brand new product: [A car](https://themission.activehosted.com/lt.php?notrack=1&notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=26A38A2A728). Analysts predict it could be tearing up the roads as soon as 2023. No word yet whether it will come with a custom emoji paint job. One can only hope.

![](0*jq1wpgBl1b0AP6qO)

### Hulu can’t quit you.

If imitation is the highest form of flattery, then Amazon should be feeling very good. Hulu is making moves to spin up [their own feature films division](https://themission.activehosted.com/lt.php?notrack=1&notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=26A38A2A729) and the docu-genre is first on the “honey-do” list. The streaming service released two original docs in August, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap and Stephen Maing’s Crime + Punishment. Both have received two fatty thumbs up from critics with more on the way. (Movies, not thumbs. Keep up, people.)

### Celebrities are teachers in disguise.

MasterClass [has raised $80M in Series D funding](https://themission.activehosted.com/lt.php?notrack=1&notrack=1&s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&i=26A38A2A730) to pay already rich celebrities even more. The company plans to introduce 11 or more new classes to online students by the end of the year.
> “In the last year, MasterClass has added a writing class with Margaret Atwood, a comedy lesson from Judd Apatow and more. Co-founder and CEO David Rogier told TechCrunch this morning that he hopes to bring Elon Musk, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and J.K. Rowling on board one day.”

# One Thing Everybody Should Know Which I Learned From Paul McCartney.

## Image Credit: damaraalif.deviantart.com

I was browsing YouTube the other day which is probably a bad idea.

I clicked the ‘Trending’ tab and saw a video which completely changed my reality. The lesson I learned from this video is this:

*“We can do anything.”*

The video was of Paul McCartney on Carpool Karaoke. He drove around the streets of London with James Corden. It was a pretty stock standard episode.

Then, at one point, James told Paul they were going to stop at a pub he used to play at in the early days of The Beatles (a rock band for those of you who don’t know).

## They stopped at the pub where people were enjoying a quiet afternoon.

The patrons in the pub had no idea what was about to happen. James pretended to work behind the bar and asked one of the patrons to try the jukebox.

The young lady pushed her favorite Beatles song and the black curtain that covered the stage opened wide. Paul and his band started playing the song at full volume. Everyone in the pub was stunned.

All the patrons could do was stand up, clap, sing along and dance.

Many people couldn’t come to grips with just how famous the man was in front of them. At this point, I felt myself become overwhelmed with emotion.

## My plans for the afternoon were thrown out the window.

I was so mesmerized by how this random act of happiness had affected the strangers in the pub that day. Even though I already knew the power of music, such a simple idea had never made complete sense.

I’d seen what the simple things in life like music could do, but I’d never felt it the way I did that afternoon.
> # “Suddenly everything I do in my side hustle made sense. Making people feel good and serving others is the greatest joy there is”

My writing makes people happy just like Paul McCartney’s music does.

## One girl showed the camera her Beatles tattoo and cried.

Towards the end of the video, there’s a young girl who shows the camera her Beatles tattoo and starts crying.

When we’re so happy, it can be emotional. We live our entire lives without feeling much emotion — holding back emotion if anything.

Then a moment like this hits us right in the heart and all we can do is cry. I was left thinking *“Why don’t we be more emotional more often?”*

### **It shouldn’t take a random performance by The Beatles to make us happy.**

That very feeling is open to us at any time if we practice getting into the right state and not suppressing everything in our lives.

1. It’s okay to cry.

2. It’s okay to be happy.

3. It’s okay to be overcome by emotion.

These three things are what it means to be human. We should experience them as much as possible rather than be numbed by our surroundings and distracting ourselves with more technology, websites and social media apps.

![Image Credit: [**Lewy Dohren](http://www.lewisdohren.com/)**](1*6VHu7XroV90tDMpPb8FZ0w.png)*Image Credit: [**Lewy Dohren](http://www.lewisdohren.com/)***

## Imagine if we could all be Paul.

***Without the millions of fans and fame though***

Imagine if each of us could be happy by making other people happy. Imagine if we dedicated our entire lives to not being all about ourselves.

Then, multiply that idea out by the entire human race. If this idea was not lost on us all, imagine what we could achieve together.
> **Imagine what it would be like to make each other happy and be more selfless.**

That notion may sound like an impossible dream, but it’s not. It may sound like a fantasy, but it’s not.

Watching Paul McCartney the other day made me see what is possible.

I learned a lesson in happiness. I learned a lesson in the simple things in life.

# Employees Are People, Too

## Building and Supporting a Team That Lasts

![](1*Kga5EkpTY-IS4dDkmg_PDg.jpeg)
> # “Remember, teamwork begins by building trust. And the only way to do that is to overcome our need for invulnerability.” — Patrick Lencioni

### **Food For Thought**

## **Growth Happens Together**

One of our favorite comedy movies is *Dodgeball. *A group of misfits band together to form a dodgeball team so that they can compete in a tournament for a $50,000 cash prize — money that they want to use to save their beloved Average Joes Gym from being bought out by White Goodman and Globo Gym.

(Stay with us… we promise there’s a lesson to be pulled here.)

Their team includes Steve the Pirate, unicorn-obsessed Kate Veatch, cheerleader Justin Redman, struggling husband Gordon Pibb, nerdy Owen Dittman, and gym employee Dwight Baumgarten. All lead by gym owner Peter LaFleur.

It’s an unlikely crew and at first, their team is terrible. But adversity and time together not only allow them to better understand the ‘sport’ of dodgeball; they also begin to better understand and know each other.

Steve the Pirate isn’t so sure he is a pirate… Cheerleader Justin unexpectedly has to perform in a competition… Nerdy Owen is falling in love with one of White Goodman’s lackeys…

It’s only after they are all willing to support one another through their personal crises that they are able to come together and win as a team.

The lesson: If you want to win, not only do you need to know how to dodge a wrench, you also need to have genuine connections with your team members.

The leaders that fail (aka the White Goodmans of this world) are the ones that see or treat their employees as foot soldiers. They don’t put in the time and effort to understand their teammates beyond the professional sphere.

Successful leaders do the exact opposite. They recognize that an employee’s personal goals, challenges, and values greatly dictate how well that employee can build up the company.

Employees are people, too. As teams grow and working conditions become less intimate, it’s easy to let those close, personal connections fall by the wayside.

Here are three ways you can encourage connection amongst your team so that you remain a strong unit:

### **1) Ask Questions**

[Today on Mission Daily](http://bit.ly/2V6P6Ns), we were joined by Elizabeth Gore, President and Cofounder of Alice. The first thing she asks her employees is: “What do you want to learn in this job to prepare you for the next one?”

People are very busy. If you aren’t intentional about helping employees identify and meet their goals, they’ll lose sight of what they are working toward. Without a goal in mind, people fall into ruts, get complacent, or even start to resent their job.

### **2) Encourage Training**

This piggie backs off of our first point. After you give employees opportunities to express where they want to be, help them identify what they need to improve. Let them know that any points of improvement are not to be ashamed of and that the company will provide them with the training they need to reach the next level.

### **3) Create An Environment That Encourages Work-Life Balance**

You may not share the same values of those that you lead, but it’s important you accept how their values might affect how/when they work. Work-life balance means something different for everybody — for some, it’s having time to exercise, for others, it’s being able to travel, and for others, it’s the freedom to be home to the family early. As a leader, you should strive to create an environment where your team members feel like they aren’t sacrificing an important part of their life for work.

Creating a high-functioning team is not easy, but it all starts with properly valuing each individual. Engage with and respect your employees as the humans that they are and you’ll find your company on a path to success.

### **Mission Daily**

## **Leading The Way For Small Businesses**

Your network is your biggest asset. Elizabeth Gore, President and co-founder of Alice, knows that better than most.

Elizabeth has spent years working in different roles across the country and around the globe. Today, her network has helped her build her dream business — an A.I. service that supports other small business owners as they build their own network.

In this episode, Chad and Elizabeth discuss the value of a strong social and professional network, creating a company culture that supports work-life balance, and how small business owners are the backbone of our economy.

## **What Questions To Ask The People Who Report To You**
> “Questions are great if they’re asked the right way. They help you resist the temptation to judge the situation before you understand it. They prompt the other person to find an answer for themselves, rather than do what they’re told. And they help you listen more. It’s not by accident that we all have two ears and one mouth.
> Good questions help you to be a supporter and a guide, rather than a master and commander.”

# Why you shouldn’t think outside the box

## 

No five words in the English language make me cringe as much as “Let’s think outside the box.”

Coming from someone [who writes about contrarian thinking and non-conformity](https://ozanvarol.com/), that sentence might strike you as odd. After all, you redefine the status quo by stepping outside of it.

But here’s the problem. “Thinking outside the box” has become a massive cliche. And cliches, by definition, are unoriginal. They’re terrible at creating change. When we tell ourselves that we’re going to “think outside the box,” we rely on the same methods, the same brainstorming approaches, and consequently the same stale neural pathways. To come up with answers to this cliche, we look in the rear-view mirror and use the same worn-out methods or copy-the-competitor strategies. It’s no wonder that the resulting innovations aren’t innovations at all. They’re at best insignificant deviations from the status quo.

Conventional questions produce conventional results.

It’s only through unconventional questions — questions that others aren’t asking — that unconventional results can follow. Here are a few to get you started:

[What if I did the reverse of what everyone else is doing](https://ozanvarol.com/this-conversation-stopper-should-be-a-starter/)?

[What would a science-fiction solution look like](https://ozanvarol.com/the-power-of-moonshot-thinking/)?

[How could we destroy our own company](https://ozanvarol.com/to-catapult-your-life-destroy-it-first/)?

[How do I turn this constraint into an advantage](https://ozanvarol.com/freedom-doesnt-increase-creativity/)?

How can I take a 6-month project and finish it in a week?

With these questions, the goal isn’t to find the right answer — at least not initially. This isn’t your high-school chemistry class where the outcome of each experiment was predetermined, leaving no room for curiosity or unexpected insights. If you didn’t get the “right result,” you’d be stuck in the lab fiddling with test tubes and beakers, while your classmates trekked off to the movies.

Rather, the goal is to ignite a process of open-minded inquiry that can jolt you out of your autopilot mode.

Instead of letting the world shape your thoughts, you’ll let your thoughts shape the world.

Instead of being a passive observer of your reality, you’ll become an active intervener in it.

And instead of simply thinking outside the box, you’ll be able to bend the box to your will.

# Top 20 Reasons Startups Fail (Infographic)

## 

It’s a reality all entrepreneurs must come to terms with: the potential for failure.

Over 51% of businesses will fail in their first five years ([U.S. Census data](http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/failure-is-a-constant-in-entrepreneurship/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1)), and even [25–30% of venture-backed businesses fail](http://icfs.com/education-center/venture-capital).

If you want to innovate and put yourself out there, you have to accept that every entrepreneurial venture is a risk.

But how can you [reduce that risk of failure](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/8-success-factors-even-more-important-than-iq-infographic.html) for your next startup?

Often, it helps to turn to the experience of others, to learn what lessons we can from their failures, and cut the learning curve for ourselves. Even if you feel like you’re reaching (or surpassing) your prime, it’s never too late! Jeffrey Brotman, founder of Costco, didn’t launch that successful company until he was into his forties.

In fact, [35 is one of the most common ages to start a successful company.](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/why-your-mid-life-crisis-might-be-the-key-to-your-success.html)

It takes time to learn how to launch a successful company and all too often, that success is learned through the failures of companies before it.

So why do [startups fail?](https://mobilemonkey.com/articles/things-to-avoid-in-startup) In understanding this, you can begin to evaluate your own startup efforts and make sure you aren’t falling into one of the pitfalls that commonly drags companies down.

In this infographic, you see the 20 reasons startups most often fail, as determined by research from venture capital database [CBInsights.com](https://www.cbinsights.com/).

Some are common knowledge — no market need, for example, is the top reason startups fail. If you aren’t [solving a need or coming at a problem with a unique solution](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-investors-recognize-a-successful-startup-early-on-infographic.html), you have no differentiation and no competitive edge.

Others might surprise you. I know I was surprised that [disharmony on the team](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/5-tips-for-handling-toxic-people-in-the-workplace.html) or with investors was a top cause for failure. We don’t like to think interpersonal issues like that are unresolvable to the extent the company fails, but it seems that happens more often than I realized.

Use these insights to evaluate your own startup strategy and make sure you’re staying away from known problem areas. See if you were aware of each of these potential pitfalls, in the Top 20 Reasons Startups Fail:

# Changing Career&#58; A Humbling Experience For All.

## Image Credit: Shutterstock

*“It’s been quite a humbling experience.”*

That’s the one line I’ve heard from three senior leaders over the last month. Many of them went out into the job market looking for their next leadership role thinking that everybody wants to hire them.
> **I too suffered from this delusion.**
> **When I decided to change careers, I told everybody I’d be gone within a month. That was seven months ago.**
> **As it turns out, finding the right gig is harder than you think.**

Changing career is a humbling experience all of us need every few years. It helps reduce that over-inflated ego that keeps telling you that your shit doesn’t stink — it does.

## Showing your value.

In your current company, everybody probably knows your value. When you go out into the big, bad world of trying to get hired, they don’t know you.

That’s right. Everything you say is seen as bullshit. Your previous sales record doesn’t mean that much.

*Do you fit the culture?*

*Are you exaggerating your career success to date?*

*Who do you know that they know?*

These are the questions that a new company will ask you. You’ll be asked to sit through 3 rounds of interviews, complete case study’s and possibly meet the leadership team at their next board meeting.

I made the mistake of talking about my success on social media to realize early on that it didn’t matter. By the end of the process, I became a lot more humble. I started saying things like:

*“I’ve done well on social media and reach millions of people a month. But, I know you don’t care. What it means for your business though is that I can reach key decision makers much faster because I have social proof via a large audience and the chance of me having mutual connections with a decision maker is higher.”*

This communicated my value and got people’s attention.

The self-promotion nonsense I was spitting before that was getting me nowhere fast.

## You’ll be judged by your resume first and foremost.

This fucking sucks, but it’s the truth.

The first thing that will happen when you apply for roles and attempt to change careers is that you’ll be judged by your resume.
> Somehow, through a fashionable 2–3 page resume, you’ll have to show companies the human side of who you are. You’ll have to make them feel some sort of emotion or gravitation towards you through one of the following sections: the cover letter, your responsibilities, your values or your key achievements. That’s bloody hard to do and this barrier stopped me for at least the first three months.

I thought my resume was better than Seth Godin’s book ‘Purple Cow.’
I thought my shit hot LinkedIn profile with 50,000 followers would help me stand out.

All I got was crickets. I needed to become humble again.

## Your first few interviews.

Interview number one was a disaster. I talked about myself way too much and kept name dropping people I knew. None of what I said was tied back to what the hiring manager was looking for.

This was because I needed to be humble.

The next handful of interviews were similar. It was only after having lots of rejection emails that I decided to try a different approach.

![Image Credit: Unsplash / [Raw Pixel](https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel)](1*Pyy6Mwk3I2Rr4Dgh1xu5sQ.jpeg)*Image Credit: Unsplash / [Raw Pixel](https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel)*

Instead of rolling up to interviews thinking I knew everything, I did my research on the company. I spoke to people that worked their first and understood what the key challenges were they were facing into.

In other words, I got smart.
> # The rejection is what brings you back to reality.

The company you are interviewing at is thinking only one thing:

*“Sorry who are you again candidate number 37?”*

You’re just a number to them until you prove otherwise. How? By having a connection with them and seeing things from their perspective.

## Salary is going to look different.

A humbling part for many senior leaders, when it comes to career change, is the salary discussion. It’s typically going to be lower. Why?

*“Again, who the heck are you again?” *That’s what a company is thinking about you when you walk through the door wanting $500k because you outsold everyone else in your previous company. They don’t care.

Who are you again?

## You better know what you want.

Time and time again you’ll be asked with no warning to explain what you want. In the beginning, you’ll have no idea. By the end, you’ll sound like how I do right now:

*“I want a role that is either sales, leadership or social media.”*

That’s how succinct you’ll become but only with practice.

## You’ll get mighty good at selling yourself.

That’s the humbling part of this career change process.

*“Who are you again?”*

You’ve got to slap them over the face with what you can do and why they should trust you. Remember that if you’re a total screw up they’ve gotta replace you and this costs them money — plus their reputation is affected when their boss says *“Why’d you hire a dud dickface.”*

![Image Credit: [Multiple Sclerosis](https://multiplesclerosis.net/living-with-ms/non-ms-injuries-illnesses/)](1*HnYotoOCMfAIVCT3nm4x1g.png)*Image Credit: [Multiple Sclerosis](https://multiplesclerosis.net/living-with-ms/non-ms-injuries-illnesses/)*

Don’t walk through the door like many people and say *“I’m a leader, coach, part-time business owner, board member, advisor, social media expert, surfer and a carpenter between 8am and 9am on Saturdays.”*

**You sound like an idiot.**

Pick three things tops and talk about those. Relate them back to your research and what they’re looking for based on the job description.

One role I went for said we need more innovation and revenue streams. 
I went in and said, *“Here are three ideas I’ve researched that can produce new revenue streams.”*

I then said, *“Here are three people from other companies that can help us quickly scale these solutions.”*

My next line went like this *“If you hired me today then I’d look to build out the team. Here’s a list of candidates that I’d hire to help me execute on the ideas I mentioned.”*

You look prepared this way.
You’re saving them time on finding other people to hire. 
You look determined. 
You look humble.

## Working the same gig makes you lose touch with the market.

That’s what the three senior leaders above had forgotten.

The market changes and often you can get lost in the bubble of your own company and the people around you who you’ve built a relationship with over many years, and who would trust you with their own kids.
> # “What’s humbling is realizing that the market is different to what you thought”

I realized quickly that partnerships, API’s and disruption from startups were top of mind. While I had experience in those areas, often, it wasn’t enough.

**The more exposure you have to tech, the better.** You can never get enough exposure as we go through this current phase where software continues to eat every industry.

Heck, learn a bit of coding if you can.

Companies like Stripe force every candidate to go through a coding test even if you’re the receptionist answering the phone. Welcome to the humbling experience you’ll have when you change your career — and you will.

Career change, multiple employers and freelancing are quickly becoming the norm. Keep up.

Get humble.

# 4 Ways Automation Can Give You An Edge in Your E-commerce Campaigns

## 

Did you know that [51% of businesses](https://www.emailmonday.com/marketing-automation-statistics-overview/) currently use marketing automation? And, another 58% are planning to adopt the technology. What’s the reason behind this shift?

Marketing automation saves you time — both in lead generation and lead nurturing by efficiently accomplishing the task. So you can invest that time into creating greater brand awareness and retaining your existing customers.

A study found that [71% of people prefer personalized ads](http://www.adlucent.com/blog/2016/71-of-consumers-prefer-personalized-ads/) that take into account their interests and preferences. And marketing automation can help you create such ads quickly and easily. The best thing about using marketing automation for ecommerce is that you can target both existing and potential customers in a personalized manner.

In this post, we’ll take a look at how marketing automation can help you improve your ecommerce marketing campaign and achieve the desired results. You’ll also see how efficiently automation translates into enhanced brand visibility and revenue.

## 1. Increases customer trust and loyalty

The tides have drastically shifted in SEO and strategies such as random link building are out. You need excellent content, a decent social media presence, and high-authority sites or influential people talking about you. You also need to put your content in front of people who are more likely to share, comment, or mention it.

Influencer marketing is one of the best ways to boost your social presence and gain customer trust. Recommendations from influencers have been known to [increase purchase intent by 5.2X](https://blog.twitter.com/marketing/en_us/a/2016/new-research-the-value-of-influencers-on-twitter.html) when coupled with tweets from brands.

A great way to boost trust and loyalty (and even sales) is to share sponsored blog reviews written by your influencers. Hershey’s, for example, partnered with 15 popular family, lifestyle, and food bloggers to promote their birthday-themed packs of “Kisses.”

The campaign had great photos and ideas for inspiration, [creating a lot of hype and engagement](https://izea.com/2016/05/03/hershey-offers-birthday-inspiration-through-sponsored-blog-posts/). Content generated from such campaigns can be very effective building your credibility and increasing customer loyalty.

Hershey is of course a giant, but small businesses can also leverage influencers. A major challenge in this endeavour is finding and connecting with the right influencers and this is where marketing automation can be really beneficial, by helping you find relevant influencers for your ecommerce business.

Influencer marketing platforms usually provide a large database of influencers that you can filter by category or social platforms. Platforms like [**BuzzSumo](http://buzzsumo.com/), [BuzzStream,](https://www.buzzstream.com/) or [HYPR](https://hyprbrands.com/)** can help you identify and connect with the right influencers for your brand.

## So how can marketing automation help you run influencer campaigns for your ecommerce business?

Once you are able identify your target audience, create a smart marketing plan. This strategy will impact how you create your landing pages, email marketing campaigns, and keywords. It will also impact your choice of influencers for your campaigns. You need to find influencers who have the same kind of target audience as you so that your campaigns reach the right people.

Tools such as [Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/) will help you accomplish this task. Mautic is a powerful marketing automation platform that has the capability to organize multiple campaigns based on your target audience. Mautic allows you to test keyword strategies, landing pages, and form conversions. So you can better identify your potential leads the smarter way.

## 2. Improves customer retention

Have you heard of the 80–20 rule? It refers to businesses that are making 80% of their profits from 20% of their customers. Returning customers generally make up the major portion of the profits of any business. It’s also a lot cheaper to encourage existing customers to come back.

Capturing new prospects and converting them into customers is a much more expensive proposition. So, while you do need to attract new clients, makes sense to devote a portion of your marketing efforts to enticing your existing customers back.

Subscription services are great at ensuring your customers keep coming back to you. Amazon Prime is a really good example of this. The program was based on a simple promise: Pay $10.99 per month or $99 annually to get free two-day shipping. Membership basically doubled in 2 years.

Though the shipping isn’t actually free — as the customers have paid for it — they’ve managed to boost satisfaction by making users feel as if they’ve been granted free shipping. The CIRP analysis found that Prime members spend almost 2X more than non-members due to the frequency of their visits rather than purchase amount per visit.
> *“Amazon Prime membership encourages much more frequent shopping, likely because the free shipping benefit knocks down a key barrier to buying online often and makes Amazon their first stop for online purchases.”*
> *Source: [CIRP](http://files.constantcontact.com/150f9af2201/1ade4980-7297-467a-86b5-d6a4b93371e4.pdf)*

The option to gift Prime memberships to non-members is a further ingenious way to reward existing loyal customers.

## So how does marketing automation help with all of this?

With marketing automation, your ecommerce campaign subscriptions can become much easier to manage. The system automatically triggers alerts to remind subscribers it’s time to renew, monthly or annually. Automation keeps everything running smoothly and frees you from the tasks of running batch processes or time tracking individual accounts.

## 3. Helps to re-engage inactive customers

Although the definition of inactive customers can vary from brand to brand, marketing automation can be pretty useful in [re-engaging inactive customers ](https://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/powerful-strategies-shopify-stores-retarget-zombie-customers.html)of your ecommerce business.

To achieve solid results, you need to first identify your inactive customers. Analyze the following data:

* Who has subscribed to your newsletter but not purchased?

* Who purchased from you about a year ago and never returned?

* Who inquired about a specific product and vanished?

For each of these cases, segment the users. You can then use automated email workflows from providers such as [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) to re-engage them by offering exclusive deals or discounts.

Email remains a highly effective way to reach customers and done correctly, is permission based, ensuring you stay on the right side of privacy regulations.

Here’s a great example from clothing retailer Boden.

Feedback forms, competitions and surveys are also good ways to try and reactivate dormant customers. If you have a loyalty scheme, you can remind people of how many points they have or offer a boost.

## 4. Boosts your social media reach

In this age of social media, its vital for brands to be present in all the right places. Customers are everywhere and they want you where they hang out. With marketing automation, you can connect with your target audience on different channels, at the right time, without spamming them. This can prove real handy when it comes to interacting with hard-to-engage customers.

Most businesses have a presence on multiple social channels, and it’s difficult to manage them all — to post content that’s tailor-made for a particular platform and engage with audiences on all of them.

## Wondering how you can pull this off?

Simply integrate marketing automation tools like Sprout Social, Marketo, or Hootsuite with your social media accounts.

[Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/) makes social media management a piece of cake. It monitors your social media mentions across multiple platforms and brings them to you in a single stream. You can easily join conversations, answer questions, and reply to comments to make sure you’re engaging effectively with your audience.

[Marketo](https://uk.marketo.com/) helps you engage with your social media followers in innovative ways such as sweepstakes or polls.

[Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/#) integrates all your social media profiles into a centralized dashboard making social media management really easy. You can automate your publishing and quickly respond to comments or mentions across all channels.

Remember, when coupled with segmentation, automated social media ads add great value to your brand’s email marketing campaigns.

You can use automation to share your content with the right audiences. It will also ensure that your content is shared across various social media channels instantly after publication.

## Final thoughts

These easy to implement automation ideas will help you improve your ecommerce marketing campaigns. Identifying and engaging your target audiences and then tailoring your campaigns to their needs is a crucial part of marketing. Not only does it help to increase your brand awareness, it also strengthens long-term customer relationships.

Remember, with all email marketing — and especially following the GDPR privacy regulations — it’s important that you have consent from your users to contact them and store their details.

# How to Build Lasting Relationships

## 
> “What’s the world’s greatest lie?” the boy asked, completely surprised.
> “It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie.” — Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist
> # “There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendship.” –Thomas Aquinas
> # “Don’t it always seem to go, that you don’t know what you’ve got, ’til it’s gone.” –Joni Mitchell

To learn more about Stoic practices, listen to:

[The Mission Daily Episode 39: Stoic Insights for Happier Relationships](http://bit.ly/2M9NpXr)

To hear a deeper discussion of the topics discussed below, listen to:

[The Mission Daily Episode 40: Debunking the World’s Greatest Lie](http://bit.ly/2KaVnPv)

One of the Godfathers of logic and humanism was Aristotle. Two of the quotes attributed to him perfectly articulate the philosophy of meaningful relationships. These quotes are both relevant for deep friendships, as well as romantic relationships:
> “Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies.”
> “Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.”

The lists, questions, and prompts below can be completed with or without a significant other.

How would we feel about losing what we love? This is the Stoic practice of mentally preparing for loss today, in order to care and value it properly today.

How does it feel to consider the future prospect of losing those you love?
> 1.
> 2.
> 3.

After hypothesizing about feelings from the future loss, what can we do today to better value our relationships? How can we effectively give the middle finger to fate, and all that we cannot control?
> 1.
> 2.
> 3.

Now, brainstorm 5 questions we can ask which demonstrate genuine curiosity. The aim is to try and work them naturally into conversation. These can be questions we don’t know the answers to, or have been meaning to ask for years.
> 1.
> 2.
> 3.
> 4.

## Reflecting on Growth

A great quarterly exercise to help build satisfaction in our relationships is to list how we’ve grown together.

What are three things that, as a couple or friendship, we’ve achieved or have accomplished together?
> 1.
> 2.
> 3.

Remember: Everything we love will eventually be taken from us.

**Curiosity + Growth = Contentment / Apatheia**

Growth and curiosity aren’t always easy, and in the next episode of [The Mission Daily](http://bit.ly/2jWLdGQ), we’ll accelerate the growth and cover more ways to discover, find, and build better relationships.

# 3 ways to tell your inner critic to f**k off and create anyway

## Pixabay

There it is again. That voice in your head that tells you your art work is crap, or your writing is appalling or it’s not worth bothering. The inner critic is the same voice that tells you your creative ambitions are too scary and it is best if you stay in your safe little box.

It is the voice that will make you delete the first draft of some writing rather than just getting it down and fixing it later.

It is the voice that makes you scribble over a drawing rather than learning how you could improve it.

It is the voice that tells you that you are not good enough and you never will be.

## The inner critic can cripple you

The inner critic can stop you from getting started in your work and it can make you feel wretched even after you have put in lots of effort.

Its job is to protect you from creative risks so that you never get hurt. The problem with that is that creativity is a risky business. You never know how your work will turn out or how it will be received. But that is not a reason not to do it.

Unfortunately, over time the inner critic can hurt you far more than any creative risk gone wrong.

In *The Artist’s Way*, Julia Cameron refers to the inner critic’s role as the censor:
> The Censor is part of our leftover survival brain. It was the part in charge of deciding whether it was safe for us to leave the forest and go out into the meadow. Our Censor scans our creative meadow for any dangerous beasties. Any original thought can look pretty dangerous to our Censor.
> The only sentences/painting/sculptures/photographs it likes are ones that it has seen many times before. Safe sentences. Not exploratory blurts, squiggles or jottings. Listen to your Censor and it will tell you that everything original is wrong/dangerous/rotten.
> Who wouldn’t be blocked if every time you tiptoed into the open somebody (your Censor) made fun of you?

## Three ways to defeat the inner critic

### 1) Develop a good work ethic

The best way to defeat the inner critic is to develop a good work ethic with your creative projects. Creativity is like physical exercise. You have to do it regularly and it is best if you keep to a schedule even on the days you don’t feel like it. Like physical exercise, you’ll always feel better after you have done it and over time you will get stronger and better.

If you were at the gym and someone said that you weren’t running fast enough to make it to the Olympics you would probably find that a bit strange and just carry on. How is this different to the inner critic whispering to you that your writing will never win a Pulitzer prize?

Both are ridiculous statements. Why as a regular gym goer should you be good enough for the Olympics? And why with your writing this morning should it be prize winning material? Isn’t it enough just to be writing or keeping fit?

In the gym analogy such a statement might motivate you to up your pace and see if you can improve. In your creative work, having a routine that you do in spite of the inner critic is one of the best ways to beat it.

I like to write in the mornings. As soon as I get up I do a page of journaling then sit at my computer for between 30 and 45 minutes and either write something new or edit something that I have already written. I do this whether I feel like it or not. Sometimes what I produce is amazing and other times it is utter crap. But either way, I start the day by being true to myself and knowing that today, I have been creative. The inner critic doesn’t feature. What matters is that I create.

### 2) Keep good feedback

In the past you must have produced something you have been happy with. Maybe you have sold a painting or one of your friends wrote you a lovely note about how much they liked one of your songs.

Sometimes I get emails from people telling me how much they have enjoyed my writing and saying how useful it has been to them.

Keep these snippets of praise and look at them when you are having a bad day. They can prove your inner critic wrong.

### 3) Give your inner critic a name

Give your inner critic a name. Then when it rears its head you can say something like “oh there goes Desmond again, worrying about failing” or “Oh, it’s just Emmaline worrying about the small pernickety details.”

Julia Cameron calls her inner critic Nigel. In *The Artist’s Way At Work* she says of him:
> He has an upper-crust British accent, and he looks down on the rest of me. Nothing is ever good enough for Nigel.

By naming the inner critic you are acknowledging it is there but you minimise its effect.

You aren’t the only person who is cursed with an inner critic. Everybody has one. The people whose creative work you admire have learned how to create despite their inner critic. So must you.
> # **The world needs you to keep creating. We need to hear, see and experience what you have to say. Don’t let the inner critic rob you and us of this.**

## Now I’d love to hear from you

What are your tips for dealing with the inner critic? How do you tell it to f**k off and create anyway? Please be brave and leave a comment. You never know, what you say might be just the exact right thing that someone else needs to read.

# Is There A Formula For Happiness? Science Says There Is

## 

Lately, it seems that we talk more and more about success and satisfaction and less about being *truly happy.*

This is especially true for young people, who have to work harder than ever for financial security. While NYU Stern Professor of Marketing, Scott Galloway, has done his fair share of research on how we perceive “happiness” in modern society, he’d like to make it known he’s no social psychologist.

Most importantly, he thinks we should all be thinking more deeply about what makes us truly happy — the things in life that give us that warm, enriching sensation of *genuine* [happiness](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/the-ceo-of-zappos-coined-the-term-delivering-happiness-heres-why-thats-an-outdated-approach-to-customer-service/).

I was stoked to have Scott on the “[Follow Your Different](https://lochhead.com/episodes/)” podcast. He told me that, over the arc of our lives, we cannot lose sight of happiness as we strive for [success](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/founders-love-the-mantra-were-creating-value-in-the-world-heres-how-to-tell-whether-youre-actually-succeeding/). Scott has worked tirelessly to differentiate the two — in both self-interest and the interest of others.

At one point in his career, he felt like he was on a hamster wheel. Constantly working to level up his economic status, he was unsure as to why he felt the need to make more money and boast a more astute job title. After much introspection, Scott, an atheist, decided he wanted to maximize his time on Earth by trying to feel genuinely happy as often as possible.

He knew he wanted to always “live in the moment.”

**But what exactly does that mean?**

Binging Netflix, eating Chipotle, and taking a Cialis to perform with your partner all provide short-term happiness — and when it came to fulfillment, Scott said he was looking for something more. When looking back upon his life at some later stage, he knew he wanted to be able to say he checked the right boxes.

In order to determine what exactly “the right boxes” were, he conducted a ton of research, made lists of observations, and created a series of algorithms — before turning all of those findings into [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMW6xgPgY4s) and a book titled “[The Algebra of Happiness](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Happiness-Pursuit-Success-Meaning/dp/0593084195).”

Scott isn’t an eternally happy individual, by any means. He’s struggled with anger and depression and has experienced a profound personal loss — something we both have in common. But instead of coping with drugs or alcohol, he’s chosen to relentlessly pursue true *happiness*. He lives by the belief that “success equals resilience over failure.” Explaining this philosophical equation in the aforementioned video, Scott said, “Everyone experiences failure. Everyone experiences tragedy. You will get fired, lose people you love, and likely have periods of economic [stress](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/how-to-manage-high-stress-at-work/). The key to success is the ability to mourn and then to move on.”

**The arc of happiness.**

Appropriately, the arc of happiness looks like a big smile.

On the happier (not happiest) end of the spectrum is childhood — years spent watching cartoons and playing outside with friends. High school, with all its sexual exploration and football games, is also up there. Young adulthood, when we discover partying and alcohol and find freedom, is also generally quite happy. These, of course, are all times in our lives when we have little stress due to financial insecurity. (They say money can’t buy happiness — and it can’t, but [financial security](https://www.thebillfold.com/2017/10/how-important-is-financial-security-to-happiness/) can.)

Around 25 is when “shit gets real,” says Scott. Many experience a quarter-life crisis in which they realize they may never have their own fragrance line or become President. This realization often coincides with personal loss — a loved one’s death, a rough breakup, the loss of a job — and the weight of life crashes down on you fully for the first time ever.

Generally speaking, 25 to 45 is the bottom of the arc of happiness. Of course, that doesn’t mean we can’t be genuinely happy during this stage. But this career-focused stage of our lives is usually very challenging, emotional, and stressful.

It isn’t until we’re 45 or 50 that we begin to appreciate what we have, reflect on the meaningful relationships we’ve built, and take stock of our blessings. And, of course, the happiest people in the world are the ones who perhaps shouldn’t be, given that they deal with the most health issues: senior citizens. With wisdom comes happiness, apparently.

**True happiness requires being willing to find the right zip code.**

Migration has proven transformative throughout human history.

Moving to a new place requires us to adapt and develop new skills. And the best of us are willing to move to a mega city like San Francisco, New York, London, and Dubai when we are young — where we’re most likely to succeed. We find and join the right environments. An aspiring pro skier will move to Aspen, a motivated stock broker will set his or her sights on Wall Street.

But you don’t have to stay in that prime environment forever. Once you’ve honed your abilities in a challenging environment where only the elite survive, you can return home. If you built a successful tech startup in San Francisco because you were good at it, you can eventually move back home to Indianapolis where you’ll be one of the best at the sport.

Especially with research suggesting that, over the next 30 years, two-thirds of [GDP growth](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/urbanization/urban%20world/mgi_urban_world_mapping_economic_power_of_cities_full_report.ashx) will occur in a small number of super cities, it’s imperative that you’re willing to move to succeed. To find ways to “put the wind at your back, ski on better snow, surf with better waves,” as Scott puts it.

**Telling someone to follow their passion is dangerous.**

Most of us are passionate about finding something we’re good at, becoming great at it, and making a living at it.

But there are plenty of happy millionaire tax accountants who aren’t passionate about tax accounting — but are passionate about making a good living and supporting their families. And are driven by going to conferences, networking, and becoming a better tax accountant. This considered you don’t have to be passionate about the actual work you do to lead a passionate, fulfilling life.

You can be passionate about professional success in any industry.

Telling people to “follow their passion” is dangerous because they perceive that as “if it’s hard, if it feels like work, then it isn’t for you.” People think, if they’re passionate about something, it should come easy to them. But that’s not the case.

We’re often most passionate about risky prospects — trying to make it as a professional athlete or a movie star, opening a bunch of flashy night clubs as an entrepreneur, or setting our sights on writing for *Vogue* magazine. Of course, it’s possible to make a living doing these things.

But even if you do succeed, there was likely an easier path requiring less emotional and time investment leading to a similar financial reward. In other words, a less-sexy industry would have been a safer, easier bet.

As an investor, Scott prefers non-sexy industries. “If it sounds cool, I don’t go near it,” he says. “A friend of mine is opening a members-only club focused on music and artists downtown. Sounds amazing. I want to be a member. But I will not invest.”

Obviously, his ideology on choosing a career and choosing industries to invest in parallel with each other.

Scott disagrees with the idea that we should “never give up.” There is a point at which we need to realize it’s time to abandon ship. “There’s a balance. You need people to advise you when you need to persevere through obstacles, but at the same time don’t just bang your head over and over again.”

We’re all going to fail and some point — so we’re better off failing fast, learning from the experience, and moving on better for it. Scott has had plenty of failed business ventures. One cost him $3 million out of his own pocket. He doesn’t regret them. “The best thing that can happen is success. The second best thing that can happen is failing fast.”

At that point, Scott had gotten away from the connection between success and happiness. “I want to finish where I started,” he said. “Depth and a number of meaningful relationships are key.” He says young people need to recognize when they’re unhappy, whether it be because of substance abuse, unhealthy relationships, or a lack of professional success, and address the underlying issues.

Above all, being happy requires removing the things separating you from being happy.

# When to Outsource Accounting for Your Small Business

## When to Outsource Accounting for Your Small Business

As a small business owner, there’s always a lot to worry about. You’re often pressed for time, and you may find controlling every aspect of your business is a hard nut to crack. One crucial area you’ll likely need help in is accounting. The reality is there are many benefits you can enjoy from outsourcing your accounting and we’ll explore when and why you should consider it.

### **Stay Focussed**

When it comes to small businesses, the owner is generally the vision bearer. No one can grow your business better than you can. However, there are many accountants who can oversee your financial situation better than you. Therefore, doing your own accounting might be a considerable waste of your valuable time or perhaps even a mistake. As you focus on business growth activities such as hiring, selling and raising of finances, your outsourced accounting team can come in handy in processing your payments and invoices, managing your vendor relationships and looking after your overall financial direction.

### **The Best Expertise**

Can you really put a price on peace of mind? Accounting firms specialize in accounting services, so they are the best when it comes to getting your accounting tasks done quickly and correctly. As well, they can provide the expertise you need for such things as loan applications and determining your legal structure. These are experts who can help you file your taxes and prepare financial reports that correspond to compliance and regulatory standards. They can also help you ensure you stay within your budget and be incredibly helpful when dealing with the government, purchasing your competition, selling your company or just creating a solid business plan.

### **Financial Savings**

Outsourcing accounting services, as opposed to having an on-staff accounting team, will save you some cash. Why? You only pay when you require their assistance. That’s obviously not the case if you hire an in-house accounting services team because then you’ll have to pay ongoing wages and benefits, as well as any overtime. Additionally, you’ll need a wider working environment fitted with the necessary hardware to make their work efficient. That means more overhead expenses for your business. The money you save can be reinvested to help grow your business.

### **Access To The Best Technology**

Choosing the best invoicing and expense reporting software can be challenging. The good news is that an accounting firm is in a better position to suggest the best available and proven accounting technologies in the market. Why is that important? For example, cloud-based accounting applications allow you to access up-to-the-minute financial records on a web browser. And, that’s important because you’ll want to ensure quality bookkeeping without always reaching out to the accounting firm.

### **Make Adjustments**

Besides the accounting services you’ll receive, a firm is also typically in the position to offer your business sound advice that can improve your cash flow by pointing out where to cut and where to improve costs. With positive cash flow, your business is likely to grow.

If this type of guidance appeals to you, be sure to shop around for an experienced firm. Most experienced accounting firms are likely to assign a team to your business that will make available your accounting records any time you need them and will offer you insights into potential trouble. Also, sound knowledge of your accounting books enables the firm to help you create a reliable business forecast that allows you to know what to expect from your business and how to handle it in your favor.

Outsourcing your accounting truly does offer many benefits to a small business owner. However, to reap the maximum returns, it is essential that any business owner looking to outsource their accounting does their research. Be sure to look into the background of any potential service providers. Check on their areas of expertise, security practices and reputation. You need to be comfortable with whomever you choose to work with and that’s only possible once you know exactly what they have to offer.

# When You Take Control Of Your Life, You Move Closer To Fulfilling Your Destiny

## Photo by Joshua Ness on Unsplash

## Own Your Thoughts And Emotions
> # “A sign of wisdom and maturity is when you come to terms with the realization that your decisions cause your rewards and consequences. You are responsible for your life, and your ultimate success depends on the choices you make.” — Denis Waitley

Whilst we are not always in control of the currents of life, we have the power to direct our reaction to what unfolds by greeting life’s changes with openness.

In his book *Way of the Peaceful Warrior, *author Dan Millman reminds us of this truth: “Once you have released the arrow from the bow, it’s only a matter of waiting in anticipation as to where it’ll land.”

While we have limited control over certain aspects of life, by casting the arrow as it were, we surrender to the forces of life to direct the unfolding of events — that is where the arrow will land.

This simple metaphor reminds us of our role as co-creators of our life’s events, although in a number of ways we ultimately surrender control to a greater power which takes care of the details.

You might call it fate, destiny, pre-determinism or a higher power.

In order to accept control of your life, it is essential that you inhabit your body by aligning with your mental and emotional self.

Be present by owning your thoughts and emotions — do not dismiss them as an inconsequential facet of your being.

You are the director and producer of your life’s narrative. When I talk about inhabiting your body, I am referring to a state of ownership and connection of your mind and body.

I am referring to being present and grounded in the moment, not at the mercy of your past or future thoughts or any runaway emotions which vie for your attention.

When you inhabit your body you do not require stimulants to create an ideal *physical state*. Being in your body means honouring your natural gene expression as nature intended.

You are in command of your thoughts and emotions.

You do not blame others for the way they treat you, since you assume ownership of co-creating every experience in your life.

## Release The Past
> # “To control your life, control your mind. To control your mind, control your breath.”― Stephen Richards

It is said **we coach others how to treat us**.

If you frequently play the victim role which says: “He/she is responsible for the way I act or feel” you deprive yourself of your potential to enjoy life since you are at the mercy of others.

You yield power to others and lose sight of your self-worth.

As you surrender your power, others will use it according to their level of awareness.

That is **you bind yourself to others** by assuming control of the relationship rather than being a balanced union.

In many ways it is fundamental you release past mistakes and regrets so as not to carry them into the future.

The present is your gateway to the future. What occurred in the past resides merely as nothing more than a memory.

To replay the past by inviting it into the present moment is not conducive to living a remarkable life. You are held captive by your thoughts and emotions when you habitually replay past memories.

Thoughts and emotions create a kaleidoscope of chemical reactions within your body which influence your genetic destiny.

Releasing the past requires making peace with it and learning from the wisdom gained from your experiences.

It invites you to bring love to the process by letting go of hurt or anger or any other untoward emotional state. The lesson from your experience served its part in your soul’s journey toward personal growth.

The present moment contains the seed of opportunity which invites you into the future.

If you re-live the past through toxic thoughts, you deny the future from making its way into your life, since your frame of reference is stuck in the past.

**Your mind cannot dwell in two places at the same time. It cannot live with past regrets and strive toward future happiness.**

Liberate yourself of one and subsequently another door opens to transport you into your future. The mental and emotional energy required to live in the past is lost on opportunities that are better served for your future.

Similarly, assuming control of your life by getting out of your own way invites you to accept what shows up in your life, despite your perception of how life should unfold.

Roll with the punches calls for accepting the perfection of what is currently unfolding and owning the moment.

![Photo by [Denys Nevozhai](https://unsplash.com/@dnevozhai?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*3VnzXfLwWkwnBWv8)*Photo by [Denys Nevozhai](https://unsplash.com/@dnevozhai?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

## Roll With The Punches
> # “And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.”― Haruki Murakami

Stepping out of your way represents dropping the resistance brought to each moment. Through your resisting to life, you block the goodness unveiling itself through you.

Many struggle with the concept of universal intelligence working in their favour, since they focus purely on the negative aspects of life’s events.

Your perception creates and colours your reality.

What you focus and dwell upon becomes your focal point; irrespective of whether it is good or bad.

As you relinquish the need to control outcomes, you accept what permeates as valuable lessons contained within each experience.

Your lessons become the experience you are having right now. Like it or hate it, the universe brings you this experience for your personal growth and is vested in the expansion of your connection to the deepest aspect of your nature.

How you respond to the experience serves as your lesson.

Equally, your lesson may not be packaged in the form you might expect.

For example, if it is in your interest to learn the value of friendship, you may find yourself in opposition with a close friend whom you do not share the same outlook.

In such a way universal intelligence assumes this experience as vital to help you accept your personal power within the friendship.

We may be bestowed the opposite experience of what we expect the lesson to be. The boxing metaphor, rolling with the punches encompasses accepting what shows up in your life as a valuable lesson which serves your highest growth.

Wisdom has taught me that everytime I refused an important life lesson, I’ll be given a new one disguised in different form.

It is worth appreciating as you create a remarkable future, to expend less energy toward material possessions, people or circumstances which do not matter.

If it does not feel right, let it go — follow the wisdom of your heart by feeling your way in to the experience.

A quote by Dave Ramsey reminds us of the need to please others at the risk of a contracted self-worth: “We buy things we don’t need with money we don’t have to impress people we don’t like.” Can you identify with this quote?

It involves courage to go against the crowd and stand for something different. People will influence your decisions advising you of your inability to achieve a certain goal or dream.

Don’t waste time validating yourself by succumbing to this way of being. The energy required to validate yourself stems from resistance and is futile to living a compelling future.

Rather, pursue that which brings you joy.

Let go of material possessions and relationships which do not enhance your personal evolution so as to usher in the new.

Think with your heart asks you to feel the world instead of think of the world.

## Move In A New Direction
> # “Don’t be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.”― Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart

Connect with your feelings often — **feel** your way toward a fulfilling job, career, relationship, life etc.

How does it feel when you consider each of these scenarios? Your feelings are accurate representations of your call to action.

As you assume control of life while seeking to create an extraordinary future, employ the habit of consistent persistence — be unrelenting in your pursuit of the ultimate experience that is. Do not accept no for an answer.

Know when to back down and when to advance forward.

Create your set of rules and abide by them. Do not subjugate yourself to other people’s way of life assuming it is the accepted model or simply because others have always done it that way in the past.

Be consistent in your pursuit of the truth and a way of life that serves your potential.

If you desire to be the best in your chosen field, practice daily or as Malcolm Gladwell advises in *Outliers* — embrace the 10,000 hour rule while focusing on deliberate practice in order to be world class.

Do not give up at the slightest hint of failure.

You are frequently being tested by the powers of the universe to determine your courage and tenacity. You will be presented with more challenges along the way, each time you conquer a new one.

Refuse to accept anything less than your best insofar as your heart’s desire. Find a way; create a new path if none exists. Recognising when a pursuit is futile is equally important.

Sometimes it may be vital to relinquish your current path in order to follow a new path. This simply means you have ventured down the path as far as it will lead you and it is now time to move in a new direction.

Life may pull you away from what seems like a futile cause in order to provide you with a valuable skill to use in another area.

An unexpected U-turn may pose as a blessing in disguise and does not imply that all is lost. It is upon reflection and with the passing of time that we see the value of the experience.

Create the life you deserve with enthusiasm — create it with unbridled passion towards the process of life. Be inspired in your pursuit of your ideal future, since motivation alone is insufficient to create a compelling and powerful dream.

Motivation wanes as the going gets tough.

Inspired people harness the power of infinite creativity as the source of their wisdom, often with less effort and greater reward.

Create the life you dare possible.

It exists on the other side of your fears, doubts and anxieties — be so bold and approach life with vigour and enthusiasm.

# One Piece Of Simple Advice That Changed My Life.

## Image Credit: Daniel Klowes — Patience

*“Stay positive no matter what happens.”*

That’s one simple piece of advice that changed my life.

I learned the importance of this advice the hard way when my life was traveling along just nicely. I had a high paying job, a booming blogging career, a partner who loved me, and enough money to live and enjoy a few simple pleasures.

I got to travel overseas to exotic locations and work even allowed me to have some pretty unique experiences like sleeping on a yacht and going surfing with a crazy bunch of entrepreneurs.

I thought I had it all.

People looked at my life and thought it was spectacular.

## Deep inside of me, I knew something was not quite right.

I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Something about this so-called perfect life felt wrong.

Before I knew it, I broke up with my girlfriend, lost all of my work colleagues to competitors and found myself staring into a glass half full of instant coffee.

When I hit challenges, I found myself getting pissed off. I’d say to myself “Why me?” and “Get out of my way idiot, you’re blocking the path in front of me.”

*How could an internet proclaimed self-help blogger have these crazy, messed up thoughts?*

What was wrong was I’d forgotten how to stay positive. I thought that I was past the point of having to deal with challenges and I’d reached a level that I could never go back from.
> # “Personal development and inspirational content can make you feel invincible — especially when you’re the one creating it”

![Image Credit: [**Art-of-man](https://art-of-man.deviantart.com/)**](1*-7GOgrtket3M2p_GmhEc_w.jpeg)*Image Credit: [**Art-of-man](https://art-of-man.deviantart.com/)***

Sometimes the very thing you preach can be the one thing that is your own downfall.

As I analyzed the situation, I saw that I’d forgotten how to practice positivity.

## How does one practice positivity?

By deciding to. Positivity is a choice.

Positivity is like going on an adventure and forcing yourself to see at least one good thing about the journey.
> **One little hack I used was writing down three things each day I was grateful for. I forced myself to do it at work and locked it into my diary for 9 am every morning.**

During the career challenges I mentioned earlier, the lady that sits a few desks away from me described my situation as like being on the Titanic. She called my business unit the “Sinking Ship.”

Outside forces are going to have an effect on you if you let them. I chose to see positivity in what she was saying. I wrote down notes of how this could be positive.

It took a while, but eventually, I got the answer: The Titanic she described was a forced career change into something I liked even more. I’d become comfortable and that was the issue.

At that moment, I realized that I had the power within me to always see positivity if I wanted to.

## It’s not about getting rid of negative thoughts necessarily.

It takes a lot of energy to remove or block negative thoughts. Choosing positivity is a much easier process to go through and it takes less energy.

Committing to yourself that there is at least one good outcome from every situation, forces your mind into positivity. It can be done.

You’re supposed to have negative thoughts. They keep you alive. Having zero negative thoughts is impossible. What helped me was balancing my thoughts to be more of the positive variety.

## Gossiping and complaining breeds the opposite outcome.

Trying to stay positive no matter what is extremely difficult when you’re in conversations with people who are egging you on to complain, or gossip about someone or something.

The temptation is huge because whether we like it or not, it feels good.

The trouble with complaining or gossiping is that it only breeds more negativity.

You’re asking your brain to dish up negative possibilities and recall negative situations. The other person’s reaction to your negativity only rewards your brain for its hard work.

You can’t focus on being positive if you deliberately hijack your brain every time with gossip talk and picking faults with your co-workers.

People stuff up; they have different beliefs to you; they have other priorities.

Gossiping and complaining doesn’t make anyone else wrong. It does make you practice negativity though and that’s not going to change your life.

## Take a long hard look at yourself.

Are you being positive most of the time? When I asked myself this question, I could see clearly that I was not.

I’d fallen into bad habits and allowed outside forces to manipulate my thoughts and turn them toxic.

My life started to change when I acknowledged what was going on and took ownership for it.
> # “It’s damn hard to admit as a self-help blogger that you’re being extremely negative and ruining your own success. It’s somewhat counter-intuitive. Either way, this reality was my truth and I owned it!”

Ignoring the problem is not going to make it magically disappear.

**So, what did I do?**

* Stayed clear of the people who were fuelling my negativity

* Focused on the positivity that already existed in my life like blogging, love and family

* Chose a new career path that was closer to what I loved

* Spent more time with other bloggers to learn how they dealt with negativity

* Took accountability and stopped focusing on outside interference

* Doubled down on my blogging so I could spread more positivity

* Spent lots of time watching videos on a Facebook page called Human Kindness

## Above all else, one thing that helped was being more kind.

When you’re kind to everyone you encounter, positivity comes at you a hundred miles an hour.

People will make you feel positive when you are kind towards them. You don’t have to hand out millions of dollars in donations or build an orphanage either.

Simple acts of kindness like holding the door open, complimenting someone, or letting a driver into your lane is all it takes.

## Tragedy will strike everyone.

That’s not something to be sad about it’s just a fact of life. When you can go through any event and always find a way to be positive, you’re able to recover much quicker. This allows you to support others during these tough times.

## Positivity can make you see another way.

By seeing positivity, you’ll discover other options that those around you can’t see.
> # “Positivity is closely linked to creativity”

Seeing hidden opportunities doesn’t happen when you’re pissed off and want to kill your neighbor because of their dog that always barks when you’re sleeping.

Positivity sparks possibility and that’s where your next opportunity will come from.

## Final thought.

Positivity really is the simple advice that will change your life. We can all use more of it and it’s missing in so many souls around the world. Find another way to move forward and don’t be afraid to take a step back once in a while.

Choose positivity in every situation and your life will change. You’ll see a brighter future, and better yet, you’ll create that future for yourself.

You deserve to be fulfilled and do what you love. Let positivity get you there faster.

# How to Improve Website Accessibility for People with Disabilities

## Make It Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust

![(Photo by [Ilya Pavlov](https://unsplash.com/photos/OqtafYT5kTw?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/computer?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText))](1*UWkL4QRmHnvLiIoXPoU2qA.jpeg)*(Photo by [Ilya Pavlov](https://unsplash.com/photos/OqtafYT5kTw?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/computer?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText))*

Worldwide, there are an estimated 1 billion people with some sort of disability. And in the United States, that number could be as high as 20 percent of the population.

Many disabilities can make it difficult for people to browse the web. Some people with disabilities rely on assistive technologies — like magnification software, head pointers, and motion or eye trackers — to access content. But if your website or digital product doesn’t include features to support these assistive technologies, it can be difficult or even impossible for people with disabilities to experience your content.

Certified B Corporation [Mightybytes](https://mightybytes.com) recommends that clients adopt version 2.0 of the [World Wide Web Consortium’s](https://www.w3.org/) (W3C) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (WCAG 2.0).

Four primary principles that are not technology-specific shape the guidelines:

* **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

* **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable with a variety of tools.

* **Understandable**: Websites must use clear, concise language and offer functionality that is easy to comprehend.

* **Robust**: Websites should work well enough across platforms, browsers and devices to account for personal choice and user need.
> # Mightybytes created a [website accessibility checklist](https://www.mightybytes.com/web-accessibility-guide-download/) to help organizations with this process. For more in-depth information, read the full [article on B the Change](https://bthechange.com/make-your-website-more-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-132f59d19292).

To get started with the guidelines above, take these steps:

* **Perform an accessibility audit**. While no replacement for the manual audit of an entire site, using an online accessibility tool can quickly provide a baseline from which to gauge time and workload. Try [AChecker](https://achecker.ca/checker/index.php) or [WebAIM’s Wave tool](http://wave.webaim.org/) for starters. For more detailed information, [this helpful post compares three popular automated accessibility testing tools](https://medium.com/myplanet-musings/comparing-3-top-automated-accessibility-testing-tools-wave-tenon-io-and-google-lighthouse-d3897d7bb311).

* **Create a plan**. Outline priorities and timelines for each of the four guidelines. It is inevitable that some things on your checklist will be easier to implement than others. Prioritize.

* **Implement changes**. Make improvements in small, manageable chunks based on your available resources.

* **Train your team**. Get company stakeholders on board with keeping your website compliant over time.

* **Embrace transparency**. Make sure everyone knows this is a priority for you and your organization. If you’re in the process of transitioning your website, let people know.

# Why Timing Is Everything In Life

## Photo by Luke van Zyl on Unsplash

## With Minimal Effort
> # “All things entail rising and falling timing. You must be able to discern this.” — Miyamoto Musashi

Author Dan Millman wrote in *Living on Purpose:* “I learned that we can do anything, but we can’t do everything… at least not at the same time. So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them. Timing is everything.” Timing is that compelling force apparent when chance and coincidence collide. It is observed in universal order and the seasons which arrive and recede. The ocean tides are influenced according to the moon’s gravity and the planets’ orbit in accordance to the sun’s gravity. Recognised by Carl Jung, synchronistic events relate to *meaningful coincidences* that occur with no causal relationship, yet are related. When you have a pressing question and a book falls off the shelf containing the answer you’re looking for, or the phone rings from a friend you were thinking of, these are typical examples of synchronicity. How does timing and synchronicity play its role within the cosmos? The wise man learns to collaborate with this occurrence, just as a farmer sows his seeds expecting the coming harvest.

In my book [The Power to Navigate Life](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Navigate-Life-Journey-Freedom/dp/0992433800/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439259760&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Power+to+Navigate+Life%3A+Your+Journey+to+Freedom), I elude to timing as the art of allowing: “Rather than becoming attached to your own agenda, that governs the timing of how things should play out in your life; you come from a place of allowing which is seeded in infinite possibilities.” What works one season may be unsuitable the next. We adjust by working with the forces of life instead of opposing them. Is there a connection between timing, fate and destiny? Consider Amy Neftzger’s perspective in her book, *The Ferryman *in which she writes: “The problem with Fate is that no matter how many times you call out to her, she has her own timing that’s irrelevant to whatever anyone else happens to be doing.” Why do particular goals transpire with little effort, compared with earlier attempts? Certainly, timing must play a role. To make better use of timing is to be in touch with intuition. Most people use conscious thought alone to make major life decisions. Read any biography on successful CEO’s, and it’s clear they profited from using intuition to make astute business decisions. What does this mean to you? Appreciate that universal forces are at play in the backdrop of your life cultivating your life’s circumstances. Often plans may not work out as expected because timing commands something better is yet to arrive. Viewed in this light, timing serves to guide your passage through life. Decisions correspond to the flow of universal energy instead of opposing *what is*. Ho do you feel about this? Are you inclined to believe in universal timing or are you one of those people that prefers to leave it to chance?

![Photo by [Deva Darshan](https://unsplash.com/@darshan394?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*0L695ux-_sw9BQ8H)*Photo by [Deva Darshan](https://unsplash.com/@darshan394?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

## Timing Is Everything
> # “Timing, degree and conviction are the three wise men in this life.” — R. I. Fitzhenry

It is natural for people to associate timing with meeting their life partner. In several instances the individual may have experienced relationship misfortune leading up to the successful connection. Timing serves a role to uphold cohesive order and orchestrates the natural flow of events. Actions fall into place because of universal timing and when combined with synchronicity, bring those events into your awareness to seize your attention. How can you make better use of timing in your life? For starters, appreciate the natural rhythm of life. You needn’t push for things to happen, instead recognise circumstances seldom follow an ordered pattern. Your emotions guide your actions in harmony with the natural flow of events. For example, if you resist conditions beyond your control, timing may be a barrier. To labour ahead obscured by the truth may prove unfavourable to achieving a positive outcome. Thoughts are also subject to timing. It may be difficult to grasp ideas at a certain time, while later with a raise in awareness the learnings are reinforced with little effort. The flow of thoughts dictates some days are tempered while other days are erratic.

Thus, timing gives rise to changes in the psychological process which affect us. It bodes well to co-operate with the natural forces of life by linking time, coincidence and opportunity to favourable outcomes. Ordered chaos can be a powerful phenomenon so events unfold in your favour. If you stay grounded, life will serve your needs beyond your limited knowledge. My greatest life experiences happened when I least expected them, through random chaos. What seemed erratic from first impressions was my mind’s perception of the event. As I suspend judgement, I let go of how these events should materialise and allow universal timing to play her role in establishing my reality. My task is to keep my thoughts and emotions in check without succumbing to what unfolds. Knowing that, we return to Dan Millman’s opening passage, which invites us to perform all our activities in line with timing. Timing is everything since it is the glue which binds the cosmos and the natural flow of events.

# Buckwheat&#58; God’s Gift to Startup Founders

## 

As a young startup founder, a healthy and consistent diet is one of the first things to fall by the wayside. And for me at least, I’ve found that the following 3 factors are extremely important when choosing a new diet.

1. **Cost**: The diet has to work on a startup budget.

1. **Preparation Time**: Meals that require too much prep time simply don’t work if you have a uniquely limited amount of time to spend in the kitchen.

1. **Sustainability**: Your diet cannot be overly restrictive where it prevents you from socializing with friends/peers or encourages binge behavior.

In searching for a diet that met these needs, I’ve tried a ton of different options and have rated them on the above criteria:

### **Vegan **(Length of Time: 1 Year)

1. **Cost**: **Medium** but higher than expected given I was mostly buying vegetables and soy products.

1. **Preparation Time**: **Low** if you eat lots of salads, but can get higher if you start making trendier vegan dishes.

1. **Sustainability**: **Low** — The diet is very restrictive. A vegan diet not only excludes animal-based foods, but it also excludes all animal-derived ingredients — like honey. Also, if you don’t supplement with vitamins and protein, it is difficult to maintain muscle, especially since plant protein is less bioavailable.

1. **Conclusion**: A vegan diet is great for weight loss, especially if you won’t miss the taste of meat. However, it is very restrictive and can cause you to miss key nutrients for staying healthy (so be sure to supplement). Be careful of eating a lot of cruciferous vegetables on this diet as they can cause serious stomach discomfort.

### **Raw Vegan **(Length of Time: 2 Weeks)

1. **Cost**: **Medium** but higher than expected to actually buy raw vegan food that tastes good. The supermarkets that stock raw vegan foods are usually the higher-priced ones like Erewhon Market and Whole Foods.

1. **Time**: **Low** if you eat lots of salads.

1. **Sustainability**: **Very Low** — The diet is even more restrictive than regular “vegan.” Not only do you need to look at the nutrition facts behind every meal you eat to make sure it’s vegan, but you also need to research if the food you are eating was ever cooked or processed in its supply chain. The philosophy of raw foodism is that cooking a food removes some of its healthy nutrients.

1. **Conclusion**: A raw vegan diet will likely make you shed weight very quickly. I did it for 2 weeks and dropped nearly 10 pounds. It is actually very difficult to consume a lot of calories eating mostly raw foods and vegetables. However, because it is extremely restrictive, it made socializing with friends/peers frustrating, and I also ended up losing a fair amount of muscle due to not getting enough protein (a lot of supplementation necessary on this diet).

### **Ovo-Vegetarian **(Length of Time: 2 Years)

1. **Cost**: **Medium**

1. **Time**: **Low**

1. **Sustainability**: **Medium**

1. **Conclusion**: On an ovo-vegetarian diet, you are allowed to eat eggs, which are a great source of protein for building or maintaining muscle mass. However, if you are a male, be careful of eating too much soy. Also, no sushi on this diet. :(

### **Pescatarian **(Length of Time: 1 Year)

1. **Cost**: **High **if you are buying good quality fresh fish. Frozen fish is cheap for a reason.

1. **Time**: **High** — On a pescaterian diet, you need to cook a lot — so much so that your kitchen starts to smell like fish.

1. **Sustainability**: **High **— a pescatarian diet won’t feel restrictive at all unless you are a huge carnivore. You can order fish at nearly any restaurant and with fish, you can easily hit your protein and fat macros for the day.

1. **Conclusion**: I loved the taste and sustainability of a pescaterian diet. It didn’t feel restrictive at all (sushi is back!). Fish are also an amazing source of protein/collagen as well as Omega-3 fatty acids. However, the cost of buying fresh fish coupled with the time needed to cook fish properly made it a less than perfect fit for a startup lifestyle.

### **Keto Diet **(Length of Time: 1 Week)

1. **Cost**: **High** — if you are eating a lot of high quality meat and fish in order to hit your protein/fat macros for the day, you can rack up quite the food bill.
Side Note: Don’t do “Dirty Keto” and start simply buying bun-less McDonald’s hamburgers. It may cost less and you may still lose weight, but it’s definitely not healthy.

1. **Time**: **High **— In order to not be tempted to snack throughout the day, you really need to prepare your keto meals in advance.

1. **Sustainability**: **Low** — For me, cutting carbs so drastically made me feel very low energy and have serious carb/sugar cravings. The Keto Flu can also knock you out for a few days to the point you can’t go to work and be productive.

1. **Conclusion: **If you love meat and eating fat, this is 100% the diet for you. You can eat a ton of bacon and burgers and lose massive amounts of weight when you’re in ketosis. However, getting into ketosis and maintaining your ketone levels requires near-perfect adherence to the diet. Even a small slip-up like eating too many carbs or not enough fat on a single day can kick you out of ketosis very quickly.

At the end of the day, none of these options were a perfect match compared to what I was looking for.

## **Coincidentally enough, I ended up finding what I was looking for traveling around Eastern Europe: buckwheat.**

Buckwheat is actually a fruit seed, and not a wheat like it’s name would make you think. It’s extremely popular in Eastern Europe, which is where I first tried it. ([Glu Mobile](https://www.glu.com/) has an office in Minsk.)

But buckwheat is also efficient. It’s low-calorie, yet filling. It’s a complex carbohydrate, meaning it’s slow digesting, and it’s also gluten-free, meaning that it’s a good alternative to barley and wheat. If you eat it by itself, it’s actually a highly bioavailable plant protein and source of fiber, but I like to combine it with meat, fish, etc. to make meals more sustainable and interesting.

So, how can you start the buckwheat diet? It’s easy.

* **Buy buckwheat**: Look for the packages with Russian letters on them like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Russkoe-Pole-Buckwheat-Groats-Pack/dp/B01J26HQUY/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1535630205&sr=8-5&keywords=buckwheat). The buckwheat produced in the U.S. isn’t as good — it’s mushy and watery, while the Russian one is more hearty and firm. So if you want the good stuff, go to a Russian supermarket or order the packages with Russian characters from Amazon.

* **Buy protein**: Your choice of which — turkey, chicken, fish, steak, etc. Make it in whatever way you want (besides deep frying, given we are trying to be healthy).

* **Plate it**: Put them on a plate together. For more savory meals, buckwheat functions very similar to rice, barley, or quinoa.

* **Sauce it**: Put your sauce of choice on them. I like sriracha on it (who doesn’t). But you can go for any low-sugar condiment you want — just be careful of ketchup, which is loaded with sugar.

## **Logistical Benefits of Buckwheat Diet:**

### **Filling**:

Buckwheat mixed with meat or fish is very filling as a meal. Buckwheat is a complex, slow-digesting carb, which makes it much more filling than simple carb dishes like pasta, bread, cereal, etc. The combo of buckwheat and animal/fish protein also makes this diet very easy to workout on and either maintain or build muscle.

### **Versatile**:

Buckwheat is very versatile, so you can make it savory or sweet. On one hand, it’s used in sweet crepes, pancakes, and porridges. On the other hand, it is also great in savory dishes as a “rice” substitute, which is what I use it for primarily.

### **Super Cheap**:

Whoever thought Ramen was cheap hasn’t bought buckwheat! You can literally buy a package of buckwheat for $10 from Amazon that will last you the entire week. In Eastern Europe, you can buy it for 5x cheaper in the supermarket, since it’s a government subsidized crop.

### **Easy to Cook**:

* For buckwheat, let it soak for 10 minutes in a pot of water, and then let it boil for 20–25 minutes. In one sitting, you can make enough for a week. Be careful about putting too much buckwheat in the pot, however, since it expands significantly as it retains water.

* For the protein portion, you can pan-fry chicken or fish very quickly, and make enough of it to last a week.

## **Health Benefits of Buckwheat:**

* **Low Glycemic Index**: Foods with a low GI are digested and absorbed much slower, resulting in a gradual increase in blood sugar and insulin levels. Low GI foods therefore are a better choice for those with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

* **Gluten-Free**: Buckwheat is actually completely mislabeled as it is not a wheat. It is a fruit-seed, which makes it gluten-free. Buckwheat is related to sorrel, knotweed, and rhubarb. Because its seeds are rich in complex carbohydrates, it is referred to as a pseudocereal.

* **High Protein**: Buckwheat is a good source of protein, with 13.2g per 100g. It is also a “complete protein,” since it contains all 9 Essential Amino Acids. It is particularly high in lysine and arginine. It is also highly “bioavailable,” which means it is efficiently digested by the body (while many other plant-based proteins are not).

* **High in Magnesium**: Buckwheat is a great source of Magnesium, which is one of the biggest nutrient deficiencies in people today. Some of the benefits of Magnesium are [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/286839.php). My favorite benefit of Mg for startup founders in particular is that it can really help you manage your stress and anxiety.

* **Prebiotic / Probiotic Properties**: Buckwheat is a great source of dietary fiber and is considered a “prebiotic.” Prebiotic fibers help grow the good bacteria in your gut flora. Since buckwheat is high in magnesium and fiber, it provides many benefits to both your digestive health and overall well-being. A study that took place in Spain in 2003 found that the group that was fed buckwheat emerged with a lower body weight and more beneficial bacteria — which in turn led to them feeling generally healthier and more energized.

* **Anti-Inflammatory**: Foods rich in rutin, such as buckwheat groats, have also been credited with fighting inflammatory conditions such as arthritis.

* **Skin & Hair Benefits**: Buckwheat is supercharged with B complex vitamins including thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), and folate (B9). These vitamins work both synergistically and individually to promote healthy skin and strong hair. In addition, the rutin in buckwheat has strong antioxidant properties which can help keep premature wrinkles at bay.

* **Heart Health**: In clinical studies, findings suggest that buckwheat can help lower inflammation and unhealthy cholesterol levels while helping to prevent heart disease.

* **Disease-Fighting Antioxidants: **Buckwheat nutrition contains protective phenolic compounds and antioxidants that can help fight cancer or heart disease formation, in addition to supporting brain, liver, and digestive health.

* **Immune System: **Buckwheat contains flavonoids, tocopherols, selenium, and phenolic acid, all of which find and eradicate free radical agents from the system, preventing diseases and infections from occurring.

## [**The Buckwheat Cleanse](https://www.livestrong.com/article/286348-buckwheat-nutrition/)**

* If you want to lose an insane amount of weight and remove toxins from your body in 10–14 days, you can try The Buckwheat Cleanse/Detox. This is a mono-diet where all you eat is buckwheat for about 2 weeks. I lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks and felt super revitalized — Burning Man preparation :). It was also much easier for me to stick to than a juice cleanse.

* Be careful, though, and do not do this cleanse if you have health problems, and definitely do not do it for longer than 14 days, or it can become detrimental to your health.

## **Fun Facts**

* The reason buckwheat is filling is because the type of complex carb that is in buckwheat is slow-processed by the body, and as a result creates the same feeling of being full longer that consuming fat does.

* Since buckwheat has a very fast growing cycle relative to other crops, and grows typically on non-farm land plots, it doesn’t absorb as many pesticides/chemicals/etc. as many other crops do. It’s usually non-GMO and organic out the gate.

* In the Soviet Union, a Buckwheat Cleanse used to be prescribed by doctors as a detox treatment for a lot of different medical problems.

* Other Names for Buckwheat: Kasha, Buckwheat Groats, Grechka, Soba (yes, like “Soba Noodles.” “Soba” is the Japanese word for “Buckwheat”).

Look, finding and sticking to a sustainable diet that works for you is a challenge for everyone. But for those of us who spend entire days sitting in poorly lit rooms, clacking at laptops, drinking coffee, stressing, neglecting exercise and sunshine, it’s paramount.

# Want To Build A Truly Amazing Team?

## Want To Build A Truly Amazing Team? Focus Less On Talent And More On Personality How To Build A Great Team

### Here’s why you shouldn’t overlook the intangibles when building your team:

***By [Andrew Wolfe](https://twitter.com/AndrewWWolfe), CEO of Skiplist***
> # *If you want to build a truly great team, focus on the individual personalities your employees introduce to your organization.*

There was a time when I thought building a strong culture simply meant hiring the most talented programmers.

And I’m not alone. In an increasingly competitive tech landscape, company leaders are going to great lengths to attract “top talent.” But I’ve since learned there’s more to consider.

After a few years dealing with hotshot programmers who didn’t gel with the rest of the team, I now know that there are far more important traits to seek than “talent.” If you want to [build a truly great team](https://www.forbes.com/sites/womensmedia/2018/01/19/how-to-build-the-amazing-team-of-your-dreams/#59d4bc71204f), focus on the individual personalities your employees introduce to your organization. The collection of those personalities, and how they individually complement or contradict one another, is the chemistry that makes or breaks your startup.

It also has a lot to do with your company’s culture. Especially in tech, where disparate teams-R&D, user experience, visual design, sales & marketing, etc.-must work together seamlessly, strong chemistry and culture are a must. In business, personality traits are often called “soft skills”-work ethic, flexibility, etc.
> # Here’s why you shouldn’t overlook the intangibles when building your team:

## Tech leaders put too high a premium on hard skills.

Every tech company needs coders, programmers, etc. who are good at their jobs. That’s a base requirement.

But in Silicon Valley, there’s too much focus on surface-level qualities-technical abilities listed on resumes. There are other things to consider, like interpersonal “soft” skills. The truth is, soft skills-a candidate’s ability to communicate well, for example-are incredibly important, too. And often the toughest to identify when you’re interviewing candidate after candidate.

**We all like to think we’re great communicators, but in reality, a lot of us are pretty bad at it. **A strong communicator is a tough-to-find asset to any company. After all, communication is crucial to building chemistry and culture.

There are too many high-potential companies chock full of high-end talent that overlooked one crucial element: the ever-important *human* side of business.

## Talent is great, but teamwork is better.

With teamwork, nearly anything is possible. Without teamwork, things become much more difficult.

I’ve known plenty of hotshots who look great on paper but are incredibly problematic once thrown into the mix. As a result, the team (and company) suffer because a non-team player acts as a broken link in the chain, and is a detriment to your company’s ability to work together.

It’s just like the Golden State Warriors. They’re stacked with talent, from Steph Curry to Kevin Durant to DeMarcus Cousins. But the real reason they’re so lethal is because they have [great team chemistry and culture](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/according-to-nba-star-andre-iguodala-success-on-and-off-the-court-is-all-about-designing-your-life-heres-how/). Everyone is always on the same page. And no one is unwilling to pass the ball.
> *In my search for team players, above all, I look for kindness and a great attitude.*

It’s true that how someone treats a waiter or cab driver speaks volumes about their character. Kind people positively influence their peers, and as a result, they’re typically good team members. Unkind people, on the other hand, typically like to work in solitude.

When you have a bunch of people trying to work on their own, avoiding teamwork at every opportunity, less work actually gets done. Disorganization ensues. And the more disorderly your teams, the more managers you need.

People who work well together solve problems on their own.

## People who are passionate about problem-solving will always work harder.

In the startup world, passion is key.

But it’s not important solely in context of your own career. A growth mindset is important, but it should apply on an organizational-not purely individual-level.

And the most valuable passionate people are passionate problem-solvers. Those with a strong desire to help their company overcome challenges. If you can find team players who are driven by overcoming challenges, you’ll be in great shape. Because you’ll be able to work toward a common goal everyone’s invested in.
> *I’ve found that passionate people are often universally passionate.*

For example, someone with many hobbies and passions outside of work, whether that be homebrewing beer or playing classical piano, are typically also passionate at work. So I always ask people about their life passions in interviews.

Passionate people produce great results because they truly care about the work they do. And they’re excited by great end products. They’re inspired by awesome end results.

## The right attitude is what defines high-quality people.

People with great attitudes win more often. That’s a fact.

You can teach a barber to program if they have the right attitude, but you can’t teach an asshole to not be an asshole. And in the same vein, a world-class person can become a world-class anything.

So it’s actually pretty simple, company leaders: Find amazing people and give them access to the right resources. Watch them-and your company-flourish.

Well, maybe it’s not that simple. To bring this full circle, you also need to make sure the amazing people you bring in all work well together. Because that will build chemistry, which will create strong culture, which will motivate and inspire your team to achieve and accomplish at the highest level possible.

At the end of the day, you’re not buying a tool when you hire a programmer or data analyst. There’s a vital human element to every hire, no matter how technical the role. This considered, it’s time we start focusing less on talent and technical skills and more on people.

# The Five Golden Rules of Digital Transformation

## Give me what I want, what I really, really want

![](1*ZjYaRaXZVCEMmZ3Pj-B9bw.jpeg)

*Digitalisation is not digital transformation. *Spoiler alert: don’t get excited over the first one.

That seems obvious, but many companies are, right now, doing just that — getting very excited — in the mistaken belief that all digital is equal. That “digitalising” will be a cure all. It won’t. A company can put all its costly eggs into the digital basket, and move forward not one bit.

Recently, Lloyd’s announced it was spending £3 billion on “digital transformation” to “further digitise the Group”.

But will it transform? We’ve all been at the end of computerised answering systems or stood in the long line for supermarket self-check-out tills wondering what *we *as customers get out of all this digitalisation. Digitalisation can be irritating and turn customers off.

So, what are the golden rules?

### **Rule 1: Build digital propellers, not sails**

On 17th August 1807, the North River Steamboat made its maiden voyage in New York, complete with a paddle wheel…and a large sail. The makers of the ugly hybrid were still at the scoping out phase. Later, steamships got propellers and reliable engines and took to the seas, revolutionising shipping.

Today, some companies are already at the propeller stage of digital — Amazon, ASOS, Google etc, but many others are still fitting sails and paddle wheels.

We’re over digital for digital’s sake. We want more than propellers and sails.

### **Rule 2: Don’t be a digital despot**

If corporate boards took a truth pill, what they usually mean by “digitalisation” is making the customer more efficient for the company. Good digital transformation is about making the company more efficient for the customer.

Many firms narcissistically overestimate loyalty. They think we won’t notice that they’ve axed human interaction in favour of automation which simply turns customers into unpaid employees. Think long forms, and repetition of your D.O.B. and address twenty times. Newsflash, boring automators, we won’t stay with you for eternity. We’re walking already.

People don’t want to be told how to do things — they want autonomy, choice, convenience.

### **Rule 3: Don’t try and sell a Tesla to an arctic hunter**

The first prerequisite of a good user experience is that you have users. It’s no good having fantasy ones listed on a lofty business strategy that in reality aren’t even online yet, let alone up to using the complex interface designed by your technologically adroit team of UX “specialists”.

The NHS is a prime example of this. With a driven desire to digitalise, it runs the risk of sending into chaos a large number of users who aren’t now, nor ever will be, sophisticated digital users. Some will never be able to use digital tools at all — and if they do, they want something that works pretty much like the iPhone in their pocket.

Which doesn’t mean that the organisation doesn’t need digital transformation — it badly does. But this can happen without the need for the patient to become heavily involved or digitally “educated”. Automation and digital change in the NHS systems themselves can be a game changer for the users, both medical staff and patients, who can simply experience a more productive journey, while digital improvements speed up access to information.

### **Rule 4: Don’t replicate the process, change it**

Business transformation requires improvement for what is needed now. Not simply to replicate that which used to be in place before computers and the internet.

Some travel companies are major offenders. Say we want to book a trip. We go to the travel agent, a supposed fully-digitalised company. “Oh, let me find that out” says the travel agent. And proceeds to visit the very website we’ve trawled through at home. Much like a system where we fill in the form online, only to then be told to print it out and fax it over.

In contrast, industry game-changers SkyScanner and Expedia save us the misery of a thousand searches, aggregating information and comparing data for us. *The basic process has changed: forever.*

### **Rule 5: Give me what I want, what I really really want**

The Spice Girls refrain summed up the mores of a generation that, 20 years later, matter for decision makers. When digitalisation first started, customers didn’t know they wanted it and had few expectations. It was blessed with novelty factor an element of sheer curiosity. Not so now. The user is a sophisticated, fickle creature with high expectations.

They want to be able to do things easily, fast and smoothly. Wading through reams of process, typing in information that they are used to algorithms detecting just won’t cut the mustard.

Give what they want, delight them, engage them or they’ll walk. Businesses that *actually* transform will survive and thrive, those that simply “go digital” will perish, either slowly and painfully, or pretty fast.

# Simplify Your Life With These 9 Principles

## Simplify Your Life With These 9 Principles

### “…because that’s how the world is governed.”

Self-made billionaire investor [Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/) is the founder of Bridgewater Associates. They are the world’s largest hedge fund managing over $160 billion for some of the [largest global institutions in the world.](https://www.bridgewater.com/)

According to [Dalio](https://www.principles.com/), whose book [*Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021)* inspired me to develop a set of my own, principles serve as the foundations for behaviour that get you what you want out of life. In fact, he attributes much of his success to them.

*So what are principles?*

Principles are fundamental truths that are universal in nature. For example, if you drop something, it will fall on the ground. This is a natural law that is controlled by the principle of gravity.

Human behaviour is more complex but still follows the same rules. If I consistently lie, you won’t trust me; this is a natural law.

*“We control our actions, but the consequences that flow from those actions are controlled by principles”* — Stephen Covey

Leadership expert [John Maxwell](http://www.johnmaxwell.com/) describes this process with great clarity:
> Imagine you have a large tree in your garden and you want to cut it down. You acquire a large sharp axe, and strike the tree five times every single day. And I mean every single day — this is important. So every day you go out to your garden and strike the tree five times. Another day, another five times. Another day, another five times. Another day, another five times.

*What do you think will happen?*

You **WILL** get closer to your goal every single day, and the tree **WILL **eventually fall down. This is a fact. This is a universal law of nature.

It’s the same for human behaviour. If you always walk your talk, people will respect you. If you meditate every day, you will be less reactive. If you regularly remove negativity from your life, you will be happier.

The point is, if you implement principles on a regular basis, it is a natural law that corresponding improvements will occur over time.

I apply principles to every aspect of my life. They guide my actions in times of uncertainty and provide me with a road-map when life gets tough. My life is much simpler, and the gains have been extraordinary.

Here are 9 principles that have led to remarkable changes in my life.

### 1. Life it up

This is one of my favourite life principles. It directs me to bring joy, energy and present moment awareness into my encounters with others. Even when I’m not 100%, I just ‘life it up’, and the energy it creates is astounding. I recently extended this principle after listening to [Adam Robinson](https://tim.blog/2018/06/21/adam-robinson/) on the [Tim Ferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss) show. He suggests that we should lean into every moment expecting magic — what a way to live.

### 2. Keep all of your fires burning

I have a tendency to get excited by things I love. This might sound great, but it can lead me to ignore other important areas of my life. I use this principle to ensure balance, and regularly assess several key areas of my life. These include relationships, social, career, health, learning, spiritual, finance, and personal growth.

### 3. Take relentless action

If nothing changes, nothing changes. This seems obvious, but so many people expect change without ever taking action. They talk action but rarely act.

I like to take relentless action, which simply means taking action every single day. I meditate every day. I write every day. I practice gratitude every day. I work on my number one goal every day. I show up every single day. When you do this, you’ll see massive progress in your life.

### 4. Practice consistency over intensity

Action is what gets you started, and intensity has its place, but consistency is the holy grail. Ten hours on a treadmill won’t prepare you for a marathon; it might kill you, but only consistent daily exercise will make you fit. It’s the same for anything worthwhile: eating healthy, building a business, personal development and relationships. Buying your partner flowers on Valentines Day is great, but if you’re a dick for the rest of the year, well… you’re a dick!

### 5. Seek negative feedback

This is not for everyone, but I ruthlessly seek negative feedback on a daily basis. This is not ‘negative’ in a conventional sense. It is a form of learning which, for me, is 100% positive. When I’m neck deep in a project, I find it difficult to see the wood from the trees. So I simply ask someone I trust: “what would you do differently?” or “what am I doing wrong?”

Another question I often ask people is: “how do you see me limiting myself in life?” Not everyone is comfortable answering these questions, but when I do get feedback, the benefits are immense.

### 6. Set audacious goals, and don’t forget to zag

Most people are competing for the same things. *“The level of competition is thus fiercest for ‘realistic’ goals, paradoxically making them the most competitive.” — [Tim Ferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss). *I’m a big fan of Mr. Ferriss, and I’d love to meet him someday. But not as a fan — I plan to appear on his podcast. I even know what I’m going say. I’ve been zagging for over a year now, and the results have been phenomenal. It doesn’t always work, so it’s important not to get too attached to your goals, but when it does work… WOW. Chat soon, Tim.

### 7. Play the long game

One of my audacious goals was to [reach out and learn from some of my countries most successful individual’s](https://medium.com/swlh/the-email-that-landed-me-interviews-with-the-most-successful-people-in-my-country-b0a8d76bfed0). It worked, and I acquired some fantastic tools and connections along the way. But I wanted more, and I impatiently felt the urge to contact them again. As you can imagine, these are very busy people, and might not take kindly to an eager beaver harassing them for their time. To alleviate my impatience, I implemented the principle ‘play the long game’ into my life. This has paid huge dividends, and I have since developed close relationships with several of these high performers. This would not have occurred if I pestered them with emails.

### 8. Prioritize and execute

I stole this principle from former Navy SEAL commander and leadership expert [Jocko Willink](http://jockopodcast.com/). It is particularly useful when you have a heavy workload. It involves taking a step back to assess a situation, choosing the task that will have the biggest impact, and executing it. When that’s taken care of, you move on to the next task, and then the one after that. When I feel overwhelmed, this is my go-to principle.

### **9. What would ‘Eckhart’ do?**

In times of uncertainty, I think of someone I respect and ask: “what would they do in this situation?” This provides me with an alternative perspective when I feel stuck. I often use spiritual teacher [Eckhart Tolle](https://www.eckharttolle.com/), but depending on the situation, it’s best to be selective.

There is nothing fancy or special about these principles, but life is so much simpler if you follow this process. Instead of feeling stuck, uncertain or overwhelmed, you’ll have a road-map to guide you in times of need.

I’m not saying it’s easy, and you’ll need to show up every day. But if you follow these steps, you’ll be amazed by the results.

# Starting A Search Firm? Here Are Your First 3 Steps

## 

Executive Search is an inherently entrepreneurial business. Recruiters who hustle find success. That’s one reason why so many recruiters eventually decide to start their own firms.

Of course, there’s more to it than that. Retained search is an interesting business. You get to work with senior executives at exciting companies and help them solve challenging problems.
> # If you’re already working in the recruiting industry, branching out on your own amounts to seizing control of your own future.

Yet, starting a search firm can be a huge leap. And if you — like many recruiters — are thinking about taking that leap right now, you might not know where exactly to start.

As the CEO of [Clockwork Recruiting](https://clockworkrecruiting.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=search-firm-steps), I’ve worked with many first-time founders. I’ve seen many succeed (and I’ve seen some fail).

Here are the first 3 steps you should focus on to prosper in your new venture.

## **Step 1: Take the time to figure out what exactly you want to build.**

As is true of any new venture or project, before you get started building anything tangible — like hiring other people or investing in technological infrastructure — you must first identify what exactly your ultimate goals are.

Think about where you want to be in two, three, or five years down the line. What do you want your firm to look like at that time? Do you want to be a one-person operation that conducts specialized work for a select number of clients? Or do you want to build the next great, global firm?

This sort of goal-setting may seem superfluous but it’s critical to stay focused on what you want. When you know what you want then you can plan appropriately for it. In all the chaos of starting your own firm, it can be easy to forget what you’re working towards.

*Have a goal. Plan accordingly. Revisit and repeat.*

## **Step 2: Figure out what tools you actually need to grow your firm.**

Once you’ve identified what you want to accomplish with your firm, think about what resources you’re going to need to build it.

If you’re looking to scale quickly, ask yourself:

* What sort of infrastructure do you need to have in place? Will you provide employees with a physical office or will you allow everyone to work remotely?

* If your team is distributed, you’ll need tools to help you communicate effectively. Should you go with Slack or Discord? Will you need Asana for task management?

* You’ll definitely need software to help you execute your search process — a platform like [Clockwork](https://clockworkrecruiting.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=search-firm-steps) which helps you in every stage of your search projects.

If part of your goal is to build a brand, you have to think about how to do that. Will you focus on email marketing or start by building an attractive website? How are you going to find clients? Do you already have a solid reputation to generate referrals or do you need a more technical system for lead generation?

Then there are legal, financial, and operational considerations.

* How are you going to bill your clients?

* How will you manage contracts? Will you hire lawyers?

* What will be your primary means of researching candidates? (LinkedIn will suffice for most.)

* How will you organize candidates? What about engaging them?

When starting a search firm, there’s definitely a lot to think about. Proceeding blindly and trying to figure all of it out on the fly is not a recipe for success.

*Take the time to plot out all the administrative pieces you’ll need in place to build a strong firm.*

## **Step 3: Make sure you have a good lead and exit gracefully**

The primary reasons a lot of new search firms fail? They couldn’t land their first client.

Aspiring founders, before they step completely out on their own, should *always* have a client lined up who can act as an eventual anchor for their business. Especially if you’ll be bootstrapping, you need a client you can rely on in the early days. Likely, this will be a client or corporation with whom you’ve worked in the past and established some trust with.

But, for goodness sake, don’t do anything that will put you and your new firm in hot water with the one you’re leaving.

* Don’t be sneaky. Don’t steal clients. You’re stepping out because clients *want* to work with you.

* Don’t take data. Contact data are literally a dime a dozen. Not only is taking data wrong it is just plain stupid.

* Don’t burn bridges. Be aboveboard. This is a transient business. You’re not the first to step out on your own. You won’t be the last. Don’t put yourself in the position of having to deal with some firm lawyer because you left under the cover of night.
> **DO take your shot.**

Tell your firm of your plans when you’re ready and know that they will likely be upset (because you’re a big biller and they will hate to lose you). Remember, this is a very close-knit business. Exit gracefully. The firm you leave today might acquire you down the road.

At the end of the day, all these steps amount, essentially, to approaching this exciting new chapter with purpose, prudence, and patience. The more time you put into building a solid foundation — intelligently designed and carefully constructed — the more likely your success will be.

# The Answer To Life, The Universe And Everything…

## …is 42.

![](0*c646u53WKW_h84Cg)
> # “There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.” –Douglas Adams

### **Food For Thought**

## **The Answer To Life, The Universe And Everything…**

… is 42. 😂 😂

![](0*RXlZHWuivkapvRYe)

On this day in 1978, the first episode of *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* radio show broadcasted. Written by Douglas Adams, the show originally aired on BBC Radio 4. After only a few episodes, they had already accumulated a cult following. BBC World Service, NPR, and CBC Radio picked it up and from there it spread like wildfire.

For those of you who aren’t familiar, the show follows the adventures of Arthur Dent, an Englishman, and Ford Prefect, an alien who writes for *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.* We join Arthur and Ford right after the Earth has been destroyed by a Vogon constructor fleet that is making way for a hyperspace bypass. They escaped the demolition by hitching a ride on a passing Vogon spaceship. From there, their story really begins.

What on Earth (or in the Galaxy?) lead to Adams writing this story? The idea came to him while he was hitchhiking from London to Istanbul with a stolen copy of *Hitch-hiker’s Guide to Europe*. According to Adams:
> “I got frantically depressed in Innsbruck … When the stars came out I thought that someone ought to write a Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy because it looked a lot more attractive out there than it did around me.”

So what made *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy *so noteworthy? Outside of how absolutely hilarious and well written the show is, it revolutionized the audio entertainment industry.

It was the first BBC radio comedy produced using stereophonic techniques. Before the show aired, it was thought to be impossible to use stereo for a radio comedy. After it aired, it became mandatory.

In 1978, the technology for mixing sound was very limited. Adams’ studio had only one eight-track tape recorder so many of the effects in the show had to be mixed live. To do that, they had to set up tape loops of background sound throughout the studio and play them while the actors talked.

For actors whose voices needed to be edited in post (to sound like an alien or robot, for example), they had to be recorded separately from the ‘human’ characters.

Supposedly, Stephen Moore, who played Marvin the Android, recorded his performance in a cupboard and didn’t meet any of the other actors in person until after the first recording session was complete.

But no matter the details of how the show was recorded, each 30-minute episode was revolutionary in its use of music and sound effects. It changed how we do radio, pushed the limits of audio storytelling, and remains an inspiration to all of us in the industry. 😊

# 30 Pieces of Wisdom from The Future of Cities

At The Mission, we’re building a network of podcasts and media that focuses on solving some of the most important challenges in the world. Cities and innovations in building and construction have lagged behind for decades, but meanwhile there is a small group of doers that is hard at work fixing these challenges.
> “Why do people resist [engines, bridges, and cities] so? They are symbols and products of the imagination, which is the force that ensures justice and historical momentum in an imperfect world, because without imagination we would not have the wherewithal to challenge certainty, and we could never rise above ourselves.” –Mark Helprin

We’ve brought them together to cross pollinate ideas and find the best solutions. Let’s start with housing.

Humanity is facing a housing crisis. Millions of people are migrating into cities every week and supply isn’t keeping up with all the new demand. How severe is the crisis? A former Habitat for Humanity executive helped us put it in perspective:
> “It was fun to travel around speaking to audiences and say ‘Isn’t it great that somewhere around the world Habitat for Humanity is starting a new home every six minutes?’ And you get all the cheers and the enthusiasm and surprised looks on people’s faces.
> And then you say ‘Oh by the way, we’re only about 96,000 houses a day short.’ It’s sort of a deflating way of approaching the issue but it’s really to drive home the reality of how significant the need is.”

That was Marty Kooistra, the executive director of the Housing Development Consortium of Seattle-King County. We need to create new and better cities. FAST.

To better illustrate why the future of cities is so important, we compiled 30 of our favorite quotes from our world class guests that came on Season 1.

> “Cities hold surprises and I think part of what people love about the urban experience is being able to explore those surprises.”
> “We need services that don’t require people to park vehicles at the train station. Rather, we need services to get them to the train station.”
> “I think that it’s critical to block off time on your calendar for proactive work and then require that when people put meetings on your agenda that they have a stated objective.”
> “I’m excited for car ownership to become a thing of the past. It’s been the most negative influence in affecting urban life in the last 60 years, and we have an opportunity now to undo that and reclaim our cities.” –Emily Warren

> “For me what makes a great city is the movement piece. It’s allowing people not to have to spend half their time getting to the destination, but bringing the destination to them.”
> “You know, most people say you can be better, you can be faster, or you can be cheaper, but there’s no way you can be all three of those things. Most people say you have to pick two. I think in this industry, you don’t. You can give a better product and you can do it faster and cheaper.” –Trevor Schick

> “We think in timelines that are well beyond the political term of one elected official in office.”
> “If you try to compete in a way that doesn’t play to your strengths and isn’t true to what you are, it’s not going to be a successful strategy, and that applies to cities too.”
> “Cities are really great because they provide people opportunity. Sometimes that’s opportunity to be the sort of person you want to be…ultimately it’s really about economic opportunity and the opportunity to make something better for yourself.” –Jed Howbert

> “If you’re looking to travel, tap into the greatest natural resource that exists in any community, and that’s its people.” –Chris Lehane

> “By the year 2050, we’re going to have to fit another 2.5 billion people into the cities, and already infrastructure is crushed as it is. If we can’t solve our operational problems now, we’re going to have a bigger problem then.”
> “What makes a city great is the micro-interactions of the people, fostering an environment and a culture of the citizens where they feel connected.”
> “Culturally we need to wrestle technology into being of service to humanity. What do we want our cities to be? When we decide that, we need to force technology to serve it.” –Di-Ann Eisnor

### **Jody Kelman**

![Jody Kelman, Director of Self-Driving Platform, Lyft](0*JRpxJB6YWX5BnUQd)*Jody Kelman, Director of Self-Driving Platform, Lyft*
> “One of the things we are really good at Lyft is figuring out how to take a technology that seems super futuristic and turning it into something that is incredibly familiar and comfortable for passengers.”
> “A happy city is one that is built around the types of human connections you and I are having right now rather than around cars.”
> “We believe that we can build cities that are built around human connection.” –Jody Kelman

### **James Timberlake**

![James Timberlake, Partner & Co-Founder, KieranTimberlake](0*Apnb5DXiEP22z5oK)*James Timberlake, Partner & Co-Founder, KieranTimberlake*
> “The diversity of people, I think, makes a city great. We as architects think it might be the urbanism or the architecture but it’s how people use the urbanism or the architecture and the landscape that ultimately defines a city’s greatness.” –James Timberlake

### **Stephen Kieran**

![Stephen Kieran, Partner & Co-Founder, KieranTimberlake](0*i6mYjxAHWL-Pz8Vj)*Stephen Kieran, Partner & Co-Founder, KieranTimberlake*
> “I certainly believe time helps make a city great. When I think across the trajectory of urban history at the outset, it’s really hard to say any city is great at its beginning. I can’t think of one that really started off great, and those that are fully planned often take decades and centuries to fully realize the plan.” –Stephen Kieran

### **Deano Roberts**

![Deano Roberts, Senior Director of Global Workplace and Real Estate, Slack](0*WuLjNPOQRoFuHKWV)*Deano Roberts, Senior Director of Global Workplace and Real Estate, Slack*
> “I think what makes a city great is probably what makes any community great whether it’s a workspace [or] a family. It’s a shared understanding of what its core values are and what it wants to be authentically[…] I think I want a thread of continuity in the community that is predictable, dependable, and authentic to who it is and who its history was.” –Deano Roberts

### **Ryan Popple**

![Ryan Popple, President & CEO, Proterra](0*lv51O_M5gJZGAO_u)*Ryan Popple, President & CEO, Proterra*
> “I think one of the biggest changes we’ll see that people aren’t ready for is the fact that moving people within the urban core is going to get to the point where it has 0 marginal cost. I liken it to how we used to pay for mobile phone service. I’m old enough to remember nights and weekend. And now the idea of that just seems crazy. The cost of movement in a city keeps going down. Mass transit in the urban core in some cities has already moved to a free model. You can just get on the vehicle. A lot of cities have realized that the congestion relief is more valuable that the incremental cost of collecting a fare.” –Ryan Popple

![Craig Curtis, Head of Architecture, Katerra](0*QBCDjVeA39ayLGOj)*Craig Curtis, Head of Architecture, Katerra*
> “In order to really execute on these problems, I am now convinced that it takes something like the SIlicon Valley disruption model in order to make it work. It’s never going to just come from within. Lots of people refer to this same issue around the way Uber was started. It was not started by a cab company. Airbnb did not come from within hospitality. I don’t really see that any construction company or […]architecture firm would ever have the kind of capital to invest to take on a problem that is this immense without that Silicon Valley disruption mentality.” –Craig Curtis

> “If a hospital decides they want to open up a new tower [or] expand, from the time that the board and the CEO make that strategic decision to the time that that facility opens is tremendous.

> “Buildings should create context for the places in between. In a way they’re the backdrop. And they can be a beautiful backdrop. But in a way they’re a backdrop to making sure that the people are the success of the city.”
> “Our job as architects is not just to make an object, it’s to solve a connectivity problem with people.” –Michael Green

Depending on the city and on the traveler, there might begin a mutual love, or dislike, friendship, or enmity. Where one city will rise a certain individual to glory, it will destroy another who is not suited to its personality. Only through travel can we know where we belong or not, where we are loved and where we are rejected.” –**Roman Payne**

# How to Use the Small Army Strategy to Build An Audience for Your Work

## Photo by Stijn Swinnen on Unsplash

[This is one of the greatest times in history for creatives](https://unmistakablecreative.com/greatest-time-history-creatives/). It’s easier than ever to start something. But it’s also harder than ever to stand out in a sea of noise.

You can compete with the mainstream media, write sensationalist clickbait, or put “Trump” in the title of your latest article. You might even get someone’s attention. But it’s not a viable long term strategy to build an audience.

The alternative is to employ what Chris Guillbeau calls “The Small Army Strategy”.

**The small army strategy isn’t about reaching as many people as possible. It’s about reaching the most fanatical people possible.** It’s about reaching people like Kamga who will message your friend on social media, show up with a gift in hand, and write you a blog post for your birthday.

It’s about fanatics and true fans, not followers and visitors to your website.

## Media Fragmentation and the Smallest Viable Audience
> # *The challenge for most people who seek to make an impact isn’t winning over the mass market. It’s the micro market. They bend themselves into a pretzel trying to please the anonymous masses before they have fifty or one hundred people who would miss them if they were gone. **— Seth Godin***

[You’re not going to become the next Steve Jobs, Oprah, or Beyonce.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/youre-not-going-to-be-the-next-steve-jobs-oprah-or-beyonce/) Today’s fragmented media landscape gives people access to over 500 million channels. In addition to television and radio, the internet gives us media in all forms. You can’t grow tomatoes by planting seeds in the cement.

There won’t be another Oprah. People who want to become the “next Oprah” are chasing illusions.

Tribes are the logical result of a fragmented media landscape. Everybody has a metaphorical microphone.

* You can shout louder in an attempt to reach a bigger audience. Or you can create something that resonates for the people who are already there.

* You can hack, optimize, and employ tactics. Or you can pour that same energy into the work of creating something people can’t help but pay attention to.

In both scenarios, the second is harder because there’s no map for emotional resonance. There’s no formula for work that’s unmistakable.

## **Mass Media is Rarely Unmistakable**

When was the last time you heard someone say “last night’s segment on CNN changed my life”? Media for the masses is for the most part noise. We might believe it’s designed to inform us. But the real purpose of mass media is to sell ads. It doesn’t matter whether it’s right or left.

When asked about the 2016 Presidential campaign, Les Moonves said, “It may not be good for America, but it’s been damn good for CBS. Who would have guessed this circus would come to town?” The head of NBC admitted to giving Trump more coverage during the 2016 election because he was good for ratings.

I never really watched news before. But these days it’s so insane, I find it entertaining.
> # **If you reach a million people who don’t give a shit, you haven’t succeeded. You’ve just made noise.**

If the goal of your work is to change someone for the better, it makes no sense to pursue the largest possible audience. There’s a difference between producing media for the masses and creating art for what Seth Godin calls “the smallest viable audience”.

## Starting With an Audience of One

Everybody starts at zero. You publish a blog post hoping you’ll be discovered. Crickets. It’s hard to build an audience by interrupting strangers on the internet. It always has been, but this is even truer today.

* Just look at the home page of a website like Medium. It’s impossible not to be overwhelmed by the paradox of choice.

* There are thousands of podcasts in the iTunes library.

You can attempt to cater to the people you might never reach. Or you can create for an audience of one. You can do something that will be worth it no matter how it turns out. Besides, [what you create for an audience of one](https://rebrand.ly/ac7b3) is much more likely to reach an audience of millions.

I choose podcast guests based on personal curiosity. I design free e-books like The Scenic Route because I love designing interesting experiences. If it resonates with people, that’s a bonus.

You can’t expect someone to be excited about your work if you’re not.

So who is your second reader?

The people you already know are the most underrated potential audience for your art. Find one person who cares. Then find, another, and another until you reach 1,000 true fans.

## The Most Important People in Your Audience

We prioritize growth over service, reach over depth, and eyeballs over hearts. We chase meaningless metrics. We overlook the infinite value of what can’t be measured. Who are the most important people in your audience? The ones who are already there.

The people who are already there are your biggest fans. They’re the ones who have the potential to change your life, to be there when shit hits the fan, and stick by your side when you’re lost. Not only is it easier to serve the people who are already there. It’s more effective and more profitable over the long-haul.

A few months ago I was in Colorado for a speaking engagement. One of my listeners found out. Because I was on hiatus from social media, he messaged my friend. My friend said, “Dude, some internet stalker messaged me about wanting to meet you.” I saw who it was and said, “Oh yeah, I know that guy. Tell him to email me, and I’ll meet him on Tuesday.” I was five minutes away from where he lived.

Why would I go and meet someone like [Kamga Tchassa](https://twitter.com/tchassakamga)? He’s shared my work. He’s supported me. He even wrote me a blog post for my birthday. I went and met him because he’s one of the most important people in my audience.

## Perceived Status does not Equate to Value

When we judge a person by their perceived status on the internet, we overlook their potential impact on our lives. One of the most important mentors in my life had a hundred followers on Twitter and a blog that was six weeks old. He was a “nobody.” But I wouldn’t be where I am without his guidance.

Genuine curiosity is a much better filter for relationships than perceived status. Some of the most amazing guests we’ve had on the Unmistakable Creative aren’t famous or well-known. Everybody has a story worth telling. Don’t overlook it because of how many followers they have.

As I said on Mark Schaefer’s blog years ago, emerging talent is the most undervalued asset on the internet.

## Do Things That Don’t Scale

At the heart of every unicorn or success story is a willingness to do things that don’t scale. When nobody knows who you are, doing things that don’t scale is your competitive edge.

After struggling to convert advertisers, our copywriter suggested I talk to my listeners. Even after 10 years of The Unmistakable Creative, I find myself doing things that don’t scale. I’ve been having one-on-one conversations with listeners. But there’s more to it than this.

Every tactic in that small army strategy requires you to do things that don’t scale.

* **Send personal emails to the first 1,000 subscribers or customers of your product.**

* **Talk to one user or customer every week on the phone.**

* **Send someone a gift in the mail. (It’s the least crowded inbox in their life).**

Yes it takes time. Yes it takes effort. But isn’t it worth it to light people’s eyes up? Isn’t it worth it to find your way out of lingering in obscurity? Isn’t it worth it to turn followers into fans and fans into fanatics?

## Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You

You can buy ads, build a brand, and accumulate a massive following. Maybe people will pay attention. But as [John P. Weiss](https://medium.com/@johnpweiss) once said, “Social media success is a byproduct.”

The alternative is to be so good they can’t ignore you. When you [commit to mastering your craft](https://unmistakablecreative.com/if-you-want-to-build-an-audience-focus-on-mastery-instead-of-metrics/), it’s a commitment to your audience. It’s a signal that you value their two most precious resources: their time and attention.

For me, that has meant pissing off podcast guests. It’s meant asking people to do a second take. It’s meant scrapping interviews when I wasn’t happy with them. It’s meant saying no to people everyone else would say yes to. It’s meant listening to every episode and making note of what I could do better.

## Mastery Instead of Metrics

Chris Brogan once said to me, “Nobody ever won a race by looking sideways”. But every time you check your ranking in the iTunes store or Amazon, you are doing exactly that. Every time you salivate over the glamorous life of your heroes on Instagram, you’re doing that.

This doesn’t just prevent you from growing. It leads to madness instead of meaning.

* **Nobody has ever increased traffic by obsessively checking their Google Analytics.**

* **Nobody has ever sold more books by obsessively looking at their Amazon ranking.**

* **Nobody has increased their amount of podcast downloads by checking iTunes constantly.**

All of those things are byproducts of focusing on mastery instead of metrics.

Mastery means focusing on the right things. It doesn’t mean:

* **Focusing on the perfect profile picture or tagline for your Twitter profile.**

* **Optimizing the home page of your website that nobody visits.**

* **Spending thousands of dollars on podcast equipment when you don’t have listeners.**

But people focus on the above because it’s easy. You don’t really have to put anything on the line. You can find tutorials online to do just about everything I’ve mentioned above.

But you can’t watch a video, read an article or listen to a podcast to become so good they can’t ignore you. That takes years of deep work and deliberate practice. It takes doing things that aren’t always fun and easy. It takes what Seth Godin calls “emotional labor”.

## Make Something Unmistakable

Standing out is essential to the survival of any business, brand, or creator.

A few months ago, a friend sent me a list of potential podcast guests. All of their sites looked exactly the same. When people take Marie Forleo’s B-school course, mimicry often follows. You can use the same fonts. You can use the same lighting in your photos. You can use the same layout that a successful person’s website has. But you are not going to become that person.

It’s not a knock on Marie. But people believe, “If I do what she does, I’ll get the results she has.” This completely overlooks the blatantly obvious variable that throws off every formula for success: YOU. In doing so, people overlook their gifts, and deny the world the very thing that might make them unmistakable.

If there are a thousand other options for what you’re offering, you’ve created a commodity.

On the flip side, Mars Dorian is the definition of unmistakable. You know his work the moment you see it. But it’s not for everybody. Some people think it’s too edgy, too masculine, or not “upmarket enough”

A few months ago, I was doing a workshop for a major bank. They had rolled out a new campaign. I had seen their posters at the local shopping center. But the only reason I noticed them was because I was speaking to the marketing team the next day. Most people didn’t notice them.

Asking a brand that has been around for 100 years to bring in a provocative edgy illustrator from Berlin might make heads roll. But it would also make customers pay attention.

Asking a publisher who has designed their covers in-house for decades to hire Mars will be met with resistance. But he’s also the person who caught Glenn Beck’s attention while he was randomly browsing Amazon. He’s the person who designed a cover for a self-published book that became a Wall Street Journal best-seller.

A thousand things are competing for everybody’s attention every day. If what they see doesn’t stand out, they won’t remember.

## Build a Permission Asset
> # *Permission marketing is the privilege (not the right) of delivering anticipated, personal, and relevant messages to people who actually want to get them. -Seth Godin*

What is a permission asset? It’s something that gives you permission to engage with your audience. It gives you an opportunity to connect directly with them. It’s something you own. The best permission asset is an email list. Your Instagram feed where you get a thousand likes, or your Facebook group with a million fans just causes you to confuse attention with accomplishment.

## Avoid Building Communities on Rented Land

When people offer online courses, they setup Facebook groups. When we offered our Fearless Writer’s Masterclass at the beginning of this year, Kingshuk encouraged us to use Discord. We created a space where nothing else was competing for everyone’s attention. Engagement went through the roof and interaction between our students was at an all time high. If you want to build a highly engaged audience, don’t build your community on rented land.

## How Long Does it Take to Build an Online Audience?
> # *It takes one crucial ingredient that most of us would rather sidestep: plain, old-fashioned hard work.- [Jeff Goins](https://twitter.com/JeffGoins)*

It’s hard to say how long it will take you to build an audience. You can’t control how fast your army grows. As Steven Kotler said to me this weekend at his workshop, “There are no secrets to high performance.”

It’s taken almost 10 years to build our audience at the Unmistakable Creative. We’ve grown slower than people who started after us. We’re smaller than people think we are. But, I’d like to think our audience would miss us if we’re gone.

Your job as the leader of your army is to keep showing up, and lead your soldiers through their battles in the lifelong war of art.

# How To Create a Spark in Your Social Interactions

## Photo by William Stitt on Unsplash

I’ll never forget my first Tinder date way back when it was Plenty of Fish. After a little back and forth, it was time to take my online credibility offline to see if I could replicate a spark in the real world, which I can confirm — *I fucking could not!*

When I arrived at the venue, I went straight to the bar to A) get drinks, and B) see if my voice worked, and hopefully use it to strike up a rapport with the barman to give the confidence a much-needed boost.

The good news is I could talk. The bad news is I sounded like I was having a stroke. And with that revelation, I grabbed the drinks and prayed to God she’d be at least 30 mins late—affording me time to get my anxiety under control. I thought it was a fair request. The big man didn’t agree. With the first gulp of my pint still stuck in my esophagus and nowhere near the bloodstream, in she strolled…

If I can paint you a picture — picture one of those cringe-worthy awkward dates you see on reality TV — with a panic disorder thrown in for good measure!

Because there was no spark, the evening turned out to be painfully boring, but just because there wasn’t a spark, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be able to create a spark, right? And I’m not talking about getting laid. I’m talking about a social spark. I’m talking about people skills and having the ability to be fully present in the presence of someone you don’t know so you’re both enjoying yourselves.

Much of this comes down to a lack of practice and preparation — and acceptance that social skills can and should be worked on.

Maybe you shit yourself at the thought of a Networking event. Maybe you get sweaty palms when someone swipes right on your Tinder. Maybe you hate parties, day-to-day interactions or the thought of going to work because you struggle to create real connections with your colleagues. And perhaps that in itself is a contributing factor to you hating your job in the first place?

Relationships matter. Connection matters. Too many are walking around in a permanent state of [loneliness](https://medium.com/the-mission/escaping-the-loneliness-trap-2373bb2c5f0b) because they deny the work that needs to be done instead of accepting the fact that a little work can go a long way to creating the life you want.

It all starts with a spark — words that make a mind perk up and think, *“ok, this could be interesting.”*

My chat was shit because I didn’t ignite any spark. A conversation with the Undertaker would have been more interesting. I didn’t uncover what made her tick and thread the conversation around that, so the evening ran as an interview — and a terrible one at that.

A boring conversation starts with a boring question, so the first thing you need to do when creating a spark is cut out the boring questions.

Sounds simple I know, but most of us have and initiate boring conversations every day. And there’s a reason for that: boring is comfortable.

If I’m stuck in a lift with you, I could ask if you’ve spotted any UFO’s recently or I could comment on the weather. Granted, you’d probably think I’m nuts if I went with the former, but which do you think you’d remember? Exactly. So why not practice novelty, and have a little fun in the process? When they look at you like you’re an alien, just laugh and tell them you’re doing a social experiment where you have to ask strangers weird questions.


Vanessa Van Edwards, author of, [“Captivate — The Science of Succeeding with People”](https://amzn.to/2wq7WRo) had her research team carry out a study to identify the questions which most led to boring conversations.

Unsurprisingly, the three biggest culprits turned out to be the ones we use the most.

1. What do you do?

2. How are you?

3. What brings you here?

They’re boring because there’s no novelty. We hear them every day. How often are you asked, “what do you do” before anything else? And how often do you ask it yourself?

If you’re truly interested in connecting with someone, you need to create an emotional connection.

Novelty makes the brain perk up. A spark creates dopamine, and you know how much we love our dopamine. One of your biggest competitors —* their phone* — is sitting in their pocket with an endless supply of the stuff!

A lot of us get caught in small talk because it’s comfortable. But for the good stuff — *conversations you get lost in *— you’ve got to go beyond your comfort zone and bring fresh topics to the table because therein lies the dopamine, and with that, they’ll want to go deeper and explore more.

The following questions were considered less boring and a catalyst for great conversation.

1. What was the highlight of your day?

2. What’s a personal passion project you’re currently working on?

3. Have anything exciting coming up in your life?

See how they differ? They’re not the mundane. They must shut down auto-pilot, perk up and think.

Asking these questions may act as a catalyst, but remember, to be interesting, you need to be interested. Most people these days are so fixated on being interesting that they forget to be interested. And that’s a problem.

Jazz your questions up how you feel fit and pay attention for cues to further thread the conversation towards that which will make them feel good about themselves. Because that’s what it’s all about — becoming a personal dopamine dealer and making a lasting impression.

A subtle change to the words you use to initiate an interaction can have a profound impact on your relationships in all walks of life. That’s crazy. Embrace it. You don’t have to be on all the time. That’s exhausting. But the more you practice a little discomfort in your interactions, the sooner you’ll land yourself in memorable conversations which will leave you feeling pretty damn good about yourself.

Finally, don’t forget to;

- Ask their name

- Shake their hand

- Repeat their name

- Remember their name

- Make eye contact

- BE INTERESTED.

And most importantly, don’t be a dick.

If you’re interested in this stuff, I highly recommend the book, [“Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People.”](https://amzn.to/2wq7WRo) It’s an absolute belter.

# How To Maintain Your Mental Health While Grinding For Success

## How To Maintain Your Mental Health While Grinding For Success

### Lessons from founders who have done exactly that.

***By the [Minutes](https://twitter.com/minutesmag) staff***

There* is* a way to grind and chase your goals without completely sacrificing your sleep, sanity, or general mental well-being

By this point it feels almost cliche to say, but it’s true: young professionals are in the grips of an ongoing and perilous [mental health crisis](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/millennials-are-facing-a-mental-health-crisis-and_b_58b812f4e4b0e9d19b926583).

The primary inciting factor? We’re all working [too damn hard](http://redalertpolitics.com/2016/06/08/millennials-prove-world-wrong-working-longer-hours-older-generations-study/).

This is something of a Catch-22. We believe — rightly, for the most part — that the best way to accomplish the things we want to accomplish is to work harder than our competition. But we also know that overworking is decidedly unhealthy. At the very least it’s making us unhappy.

See, we’re aware that life is too short to be [busy all the time](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/), but we know that if we stop to take a breath — relax with a movie or a book, or God forbid a Saturday hanging out with friends — we’ll fall behind our peers who are focused on their side hustles, their books, or those extra projects for the partner. And that feeling of falling behind? Of [not living up to our potential](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/) while our peers chase their dreams? Well, that strikes us as just about the worst feeling in the world.

## And so it can feel, at times, like we’re trapped.

The truth, however, is there *is* a way to grind and chase your goals without completely sacrificing your sleep, sanity, or general mental well-being. In fact, a more balanced, responsible work ethic very well may prove more productive and effective in the long run. The best way to achieve your dreams, turns out, is to take pains to ensure you remain your best self.

We know this because, here at Minutes, we collaborate everyday with founders, c-suite executives, and *New York Times* bestsellers who attest to as much. Who’ve achieved great things — built [massively-profitable companies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2018/10/18/next-billion-dollar-startup-entrepreneurs-create-750m-bra-business-by-exposing-victorias-weakness/), competed in the Olympics, sold their massively-profitable companies — while still protecting their happiness.

So, we rounded up what just a few of these folks have to say about maintaining mental health while grinding for success, and compiled their advice below. We hope you find it as useful as we have.

Enjoy.
> # “No matter what, go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. “ — [Heidi Zak](https://twitter.com/heidizaks), co-founder and CEO of ThirdLove

![](0*Ai1AEM03KCzq4kqF.png)

“My normal sleep schedule is to be in bed by 10:30 p.m. and wake up around 6:30 a.m. I say “around” because I don’t use an alarm clock. My routine is so ingrained at this point that I wake up at almost the same time every morning without an alarm. Yes, I try for eight hours of sleep a night. And many times that doesn’t happen with sending out late-night emails or being woken up by one of my kids in the middle of the night. Life happens. But if you’re able to aim for a consistent sleep routine, I’ve found it helps prevent stress and sickness.”
> # “Adopt the 80/20 principle.” — [Sami Rusani](https://twitter.com/SamRusani), CRO of ShipChain

![](0*pr_oyCz7Qfzj7Wo9.png)

“This is when 20% of your effort produces 80% of the results. I can’t harp on time management enough. The 80/20 principle is real, and you should utilize it to become more productive. “Working” all the time isn’t actually the most productive strategy. Sure, it *looks* impressive to people who don’t know any better, but you can get the same amount of work done by really focusing yourself for manageable periods of time.”
> # “Learn how to say ‘No’ “ — [Samantha Radocchia](https://twitter.com/SamRadOfficial), Co-Founder of Chronicled.

![](0*v794mT7rLcn0y4fF.png)

“The Art of Saying No really comes down to setting boundaries and making decisions from a place of abundance, rather than fear. When you make fear-based decisions, you’re generally thinking about missing out. Will I miss the biggest opportunity of my life by saying no? Will this client drop me? Will I lose the reference I need? The worry that you’ll miss out on *something* leads you to take on *everything*. But when you consider decisions from a place of abundance, you think about how an opportunity will fit into your life. You consider that it might be a good option, but you realize there will be plenty more opportunities if you turn this one down. And the only way to get to that mindset of abundance is by setting boundaries.”
> # “Find what makes you feel cared for, then build a routine around it.” — [Michael De La Maza](https://medium.com/@michaeldelamaza), Co-founder, DemingWay.com.

![](0*emA9FererHUiHrTZ.png)

**“**When you start to take care of yourself with the same devotion as you would a problem at work, or a big project for an important [client,](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/michael-de-la-maza/3-ways-agile-coaches-use-technology-to-improve-teaching-techniques-cater-to-client-needs-and-reach-a-global-audience/) you’ll set yourself up for success over the long term. And especially after a particularly hectic week, a few restorative practices can help you come back first thing Monday morning, ready to go.”
> # “Delegate your responsibilities at work.” —[Taffi Dollar](https://medium.com/@taffidollar), CEO of Arrow Global Entertainment.

![](0*oIT0Y6vTUBgO6TMJ.png)

“Early in my career, I thought that to give up the chance to *take on more *was akin to forfeiting my chance at a future promotion or raise. But the truth is, if you accept more responsibility than you can reasonably handle, you’ll end up doing more damage than good. So, when you reach your breaking point, don’t try and barrel past it. Define what your boundaries are, speak up when you’ve reached them, and delegate some of your responsibilities to your people. If this sounds hard, you’re not alone. I know many ambitious, inspired people suffer from the same false belief I sometimes suffer from, which is this idea that we have to do *everything* ourselves. It’s a belief compounded by the anxiety that if we’re not pushing ourselves past our limits of capacity, we’re not doing enough to get ahead or succeed. But your ambition cannot supersede the importance of maintaining your mental health. Because it’s true: at a certain point, overworking really does become unproductive.”

# Never Forget To Make Time For These 3 Things As CEO

## 

Thirty-hour work weeks and three-day weekends are trending lately, supposedly boosting productivity and satisfaction.

I’m sure there’s some merit to the idea. But honestly, I can’t even think about that without getting a little anxious.

Personally, I don’t even have enough time to get through everything I need to in five days as a co-founder and co-CEO. That’s why I generally spend nine hours in the office each day, and then hop online later at night once my kids are asleep.
> # Leading a company doesn’t come with a lot of wiggle room for laid-back work weeks.

But no matter how busy it gets, there are some things CEOs should always make time for:

## **1. Holding one-on-one meetings.**

In my mind, there’s nothing more important than holding one-on-ones.

Each senior leader who reports to me is managing a specific area of our business, and everything the company does flows through their teams. If they don’t feel like they have the answers, or if a problem is slowing them down, then nothing gets accomplished.

Generally, each weekly one-on-one meeting runs about 30 minutes. Some may go longer, but this is usually enough time if you’re holding them consistently.

I recommend never going into these meetings with any kind of personal agenda. Let your direct report set the intent. Everyone is different — some focus on tactics and some on strategy. But the most important thing is having that time with your direct reports to talk about their team, their projects, what they’re struggling with, and how you can help.
> One-on-ones are also the best opportunities to [give and receive feedback](https://medium.com/@heidizaks/every-startup-needs-to-develop-a-feedback-process-heres-why-840be375845f).

It can be difficult to get into the habit of sharing feedback, but having time every week tends to make it easier. Once you begin giving and soliciting feedback with someone, the conversation really opens up.

And that’s what you really want to make time for — honest communication that moves the team forward and keeps everyone on the same page.

## **2. Engaging with the press.**

I recently spoke with a reporter who was writing an article on the influence of shape versus size in today’s clothing companies. We initially ran into a scheduling conflict, but I didn’t brush it off. Instead, I moved things around on my calendar to make sure I had the time to speak with her.

Reporters work on tight deadlines, and requests often happen last-minute.

It’s critical that you make time for any form of press when you can, for two very important reasons: For one, press is free. All your other marketing initiatives are generally expensive because you’re creating content and paying money to place it somewhere. The nice thing about speaking with the media is that it’s an excellent way to get your name out there without a large investment.

Second, if you’re [a consumer brand](https://artplusmarketing.com/how-to-create-a-brand-customers-cant-get-enough-of-d8b5aaf3d131) like we are at ThirdLove, building your reputation is a huge part of your success. The more people see your brand, the better.
> # Doing interviews and answering questions about your company is crucial, because it provides you with another opportunity to reach potential customers.

What you’ll find is, the more press you get, the more press you get. It’s a positive cycle wherein the more people talk about you, the more you become an object worthy of writing or talking about.

It’s difficult to create that cycle on your own, so don’t discount the power of press when the opportunity comes your way.

## **3. Developing your people — the ones who matter most.**

The success or failure of your business always comes back to your people.

Your culture, organization, and strategy all come down to the happiness and motivation of [the people working in your office.](https://artplusmarketing.com/heres-what-happens-when-you-hire-people-without-experience-2ffc0d38857?source=user_profile---------10------------------)
> *You have to remember that everyone, at every moment in time, is growing and developing. And part of the CEO’s responsibility is to help facilitate that development and provide people with opportunities to learn and mature.*

For instance, our team is currently working on our company process for updates. Essentially, we plan to have a different team present at each monthly company update meeting, so each has a chance to showcase what their team is working on.

I’ve been spending so much time on it because I think it’s important for everyone in the company to have an understanding of what other people do — and how difficult and time-consuming their jobs can actually be. That exposure creates more empathy and respect throughout the company.

It’s also an opportunity for people to work on public speaking and presenting. They get an opportunity to show people what they do, but they also develop as individuals. It doesn’t matter who you are or what your company does, you have to put people first.

Your days will always be hectic and fast-paced, but it’s up to you as a leader to create time for the things that matter most.

# How Your Definition Of Success Changes Over Time.

## Image Credit: Irish Printed Record Cover

When we’re teenagers, our definition of success is very different to when we get older.

Many of us when we’re younger grow up watching TV and movies where we’re taught to admire money.

I grew up believing that if you weren’t an entrepreneur, you would work for someone else and be a loser. I thought how much money you made was a measure of how much you’re contributing.

## At 18…

I thought I was the coolest kid on the block. I had a brand new car worth $37K. It had a subwoofer in the boot, 18 inch SS mag wheels and an mp3 player.

I’d worked my entire teenage life to get this car. Girls thought it was a cool car, but it didn’t make me any more desirable. I went out every night drinking lots of alcohol and partying because that’s what I thought was success

This definition of success changed as I got older.

## At 21…

I thought that I’d discovered the definition of success: Having people work for your business, who you could delegate to, was supposed to be success — according to the entrepreneur way of doing things.

Delegating was supposed to allow me more time to be creative because I’m brilliant, right? Owning a business seemed like the ultimate goal.

What no one tells you is that it’s hard work, emotionally exhausting and the chance of failure is incredibly high. Each day, as a startup, your future is on a knifes edge.

You go to work thinking *“If this all fails then I’ll have no business and no experience to get hired by a company. It will all have been for nothing.”*
> Meanwhile, your other friends are working for Deloitte, Meryl Lynch and Bain, and having the time of their lives while meeting their ideal romantic partner. While they had fun, I was in the office trying to unload a container in 40-degree heat.

This definition of success changed as I got older.

## At 24…

I became obsessed with money. I bought flashy suits, designer Italian leather shoes and built a recording studio in my house with all the cool tools. 
I also got my first luxury car — a BMW Coupe.

Every day became about trying to get more money in my account than I had the day before. I started looking at investment properties and taking luxury holidays.

![**Image Credit: [Kotszok](https://www.deviantart.com/kotszok)**](1*MklyVCD32yhKNUFuji7UVA.png)***Image Credit: [Kotszok](https://www.deviantart.com/kotszok)***

**I worshiped Mr. Calvin Klein. 
I spent $2000 on dinner to prove a point. 
I hung around dudes that drove Bentley Turbos.**

Never before had I felt so empty. The things that money bought me would only give me satisfaction for a maximum of a month. After that, a BMW felt like a Holden. It was all the same.

This definition of success changed as I got older.

## At 25…

I thought that finally finding a woman would make me happy. My other mature friends had partners. They’d go on ‘couple dates’ and attend the drive-in cinema where they’d kiss and pretend they were the happiest people in the world.

Some got married. 
Some just had lots of sex.
Some had new partners every few months.

Meanwhile, I hadn’t figured it out. I was all about me and my DJ career. I thought that making music and playing in front of people made me special.
> **I watched everyone else be seemingly happy, yet I’d go home lonely each night. There were a few rare occasions where I’d date a girl for a month or so, but it would never last.**

Then, I met one girl who changed that. We were happy and got to do couple things. This wasn’t the holy grail though. I still felt unsuccessful.

This definition of success changed as I got older.

## At 26…

I thought that working in corporate was the answer. I quit my startup and went out into the big, bad world trying to find a gig in a well-known company.

No one would hire me and they thought my startup experience was stupid. I had no brand name companies on my resume. Everything just said “Self-employed.”

I’d then have to show my pay slips to prove my employment history and it was obvious I’d come from startup land. Then the question was *“If you’re such a good entrepreneur, where’s the startup now?”*
> # “I eventually landed a job in the finance world, but I had to take a huge pay cut. I went from $20 lunches each day to eating a can of vegetable soup that I got on special every month for half the price”

I worked the corporate job and realized that big companies were not perfect either. They had red-tape, people politics and lacked innovation. You couldn’t just do what you wanted like you could in the startup world.

You actually had to ask for people’s permission. LIKE WHAT THE HELL…LOL

This definition of success changed as I got older.

## At 27…

I thought success was about fitness.
> # “I went from 60KG to over 100KG in one year. My arms got bigger, my chest got stronger and I could grunt like the muscle men I trained with”

The bigger I got, the more tired I became. I’d go to nightclubs and start nodding off at 10:30 pm. I couldn’t understand why. I eventually figured out it was all the food I was consuming.

When you eat a lot, your body has to work extra hard and so there’s no energy left to be a useful member of society.

This definition of success changed as I got older.

## At 28…

It was all about my health and wellness. While working my finance job, I became obsessed with getting better. I’d go into 1-on1 meetings and feel anxious for no reason. I’d feel physically sick when I had to give a presentation.

I sought counseling and discovered that I suffered from mental health issues. I’d worked so hard as an entrepreneur that my body only understood pressure. At the same time, I looked at my diet. I was eating lots of sugar because I was trying to numb the pain of anxiety.

Every night I came home, went to 7-Eleven and got one packet of chips, one chocolate bar and a Slurpee. I’d then go home, turn on the DVD player and watch a movie.

After attending a live event about health, I became vegetarian, drank green juice every day and walked more. I replaced sweets with vegetables. I became obsessed with pesticide, the concept of Acid/Alkaline balance and giving up coffee/alcohol.
> # This resulted in me not having a single alcoholic beverage for two years.

While I felt better, something was still missing.

This definition of success changed as I got older.

## At 29…

My follower count on social media began to grow sharply. I became obsessed with gaining more followers. I thought that the larger your audience was the more impact you were having (‘impact’ was just a fancy word for success).

I went from 100 followers on Facebook to 2000. 
I went from 600 followers on LinkedIn to 5000. 
I had two viral blog posts racking up millions of views.

All of this happened in a short space of time. The dopamine hit was incredible. Suddenly I thought I’d found my definition of success. I hadn’t.

1000 followers felt like 10,000. 10,000 felt like 100,000. It was all just an empty game. There was always someone with more followers than me. I was always playing catch up.

This definition of success changed as I got older.

## At 30…

I thought I was getting old and time was running out. I became obsessed with time and getting the most out of each day. I started saying no a lot. I multi-tasked everything.

If I was on a train, then I’d be listening to a podcast. 
If I was eating, then I was watching a self-improvement documentary. 
If I was walking, then I was chatting on my mobile phone.

**I attempted to squeeze every minute out of every day.** I was using all my minutes to do something, but that was the whole problem. There was never time to think. There was always another to-do list to complete.

This definition of success changed as I got older.

## At 31…

I overcame my fear of public speaking and competed in the State Championships of Toastmasters.

I had swag and I could inspire a large audience. 
Getting up and doing presentations for work became easier. 
People admired me for my boldness to say the unthinkable and be able to speak my mind. Many people around me were scared of public speaking.

It felt okay for a few months and then it became business as usual. Public speaking is cool but it didn’t make me feel successful.

## At 32 (my age today)…

Today I measure success much differently. I want to inspire the world through entrepreneurship and personal development. My definition of success is this:
Help one more person than I did yesterday and be just a bit more self-aware than I was yesterday.

Success is no longer about what I can get out of every situation. There’s a much bigger game I’m playing and it doesn’t end. I’m trying to leave a lasting legacy that can help people overcome the same hurdles I’ve dealt with.
> I don’t want people to fall for the same false definition of success that I fell for. I want to speak the truth and set people free from bullshit.

That’s what my definition of success today is.

Your definition of success will change over time. One day, like me, your definition will become about something much bigger.

That’s when you’ll know the definition of success.

# 3 Free Tools to Understand Your Audience and Quickly Grow Sales

## 

Technology is a massively important tool for growing your company. [Re-marketing](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/5-proven-ways-remarketing-will-make-your-business-successful-first-90-days.html), [Facebook ads](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-important-reasons-you-need-to-use-facebook-ads-right-now-first-90-days.html), and [your website](https://mobilemonkey.com/blog/2018/02/increase-website-sales) are just a few marketing tools that have the potential to drive amazing business growth and profits.

But all the technology in the world won’t help you if you don’t understand your customers.

It blows my mind how many companies fail to understand their target market(s).

(Spoiler alert: selling to “everyone” isn’t a target market!)

Your business needs to nail the precise demographics, behaviors, and interests of your customers so that:

* You can find more customers like them and sell more stuff.

* You can align your company (sales, marketing, customer service, product management) to all be marketing, selling, servicing, building the right stuff, which has huge leverage on the effectiveness of your organization.

If you don’t understand your target market(s), you probably won’t be able to scale.

Buyer personas, or fictional representations of your ideal customers, are notoriously difficult to build and thus are underutilized. But here are three technologies that make building customer personas ridiculously easy.

## 1. Google Analytics

More than 10 million websites use Google Analytics. If you have Google Analytics set up for your website (and you should!) you can start gaining insights about your target market.

You’ll want to focus on the Demographics and Interests sections of Google Analytics. Basically what you’re trying to figure out is, of the people who actually buy stuff from you, what are the smoking guns in terms of common denominators?

![](0*yNCt1jqEUjw5FcD4.png)

## 2. Facebook Audience Manager

Because Facebook has more than a billion users logging in every day they have tons of information about what people buy, what they like, their demographics, and so much more.

If you have a Facebook business page (and you should!), you have access to an Audience Insights tool. You can use to analyze either:

* **Everyone on Facebook:** You can think of this as a way to do a user survey to understand what a market looks like in general.

* **People who like your page: **Here you’ll take a more targeted look at people who are interested in your business and service.

* **Any custom list of emails and/or phone numbers that you upload: **This will give you insights into the people who have bought from you, or converted in some other way (signing up for a newsletter, whitepaper, webinar, etc.).

![](0*wlWLCXZoj0gK20LU.jpg)

Once you’ve chosen an audience to analyze, Facebook will tell you everything about them. You’ll discover job titles, education level, lifestyle, location, household information, purchasing behavior, and much more.

## 3. Twitter Audience Insights

If you have a Twitter account (and you should!), you can use Twitter’s audience insights tool to figure out the different interests, demographics, occupation, lifestyle, consumer behavior, political affiliation — there are literally hundreds of dimensions, too many to list out.

You can do this analysis on your Twitter followers, or on any Twitter ad campaign that you run. This is important because ads let you reach people who aren’t already your customers — so it’s less biased.

Also, just like Facebook, you can upload emails and Twitter will do this demographic analysis on your list.

## Conclusion

This year, spend time to *really* get to know your audience. Using these new website tools, it’s easier than ever to do this research and create fantastic buyer personas.

Knowing exactly who your target market is — their demographics, behaviors, and interests — is a huge force multiplier that you can use to drive massive growth.

# If You Want To Live Without Fear, Trust That Every Outcome In Life Is Perfect

## “woman walking on beach shore” by Rachael Smith on Unsplash

## **Life Is A Process, Not An Event**
> # *“I’ve come to trust not that events will always unfold exactly as I want, but that I will be fine either way. The challenges we face in life are always lessons that serve our soul’s growth.” — Marianne Williamson*

I don’t know a single person who doesn’t have any fears, do you? Knowing this, it begs asking: What are your predominant fears? Are you aware of them? In order to live without fear, we must trust whatever outcome arises in life is perfectly orchestrated for our highest good. I’m reminded of a delightful tale by the late spiritual teacher and psychotherapist Anthony de Mello who explains that while fear protects us, it also keeps us trapped and insecure: “How shall I rid myself of fear?” “How can you rid yourself of what you cling to?” “You mean I actually cling to my fears? I disagree.” “Consider what your fear protects you from and you will agree! And you will see your folly.”

Most people’s fears relate to: financial matters, safety and security, relationships or career. It is natural to entertain these fears, though when they impose on our way of life, we are at the mercy of succumbing to them. This is when we stop living because we are being dictated by our fears. Allow me to explain what I mean, since it may be misunderstood. Everything that happens to us has a larger purpose in our life. I am not invoking God, nor religion but suggesting a greater plan is in order which may not be apparent at the time of the event. If we look back on our life, we would notice that every event comes together to create the rich tapestry of our life’s narrative. Because life is being experienced by us, it may feel as though our challenges are permanent. However, we’re not seeing the entire picture unfold because we’re absorbed in the drama and miss the opportunity to see how it can lead to something greater.

Are you comfortable with this so far? I hope so, because it’s worth acknowledging that **life is a process, not an event**. Now, sometimes horrific accidents occur where people lose loved ones and we might ask how this is a perfect outcome. That is, how is the loss of someone to illness, especially a young child considered a perfect outcome? These are reasonable questions that have plagued mankind for centuries. I don’t know why these events occur and why some people survive and others don’t. This dilemma has perplexed philosophers for ages and it’s widely debated whether there’s an all-powerful and all seeing source presiding over our lives. For now, let’s consider outcomes not as catastrophic, such as being passed over for a job promotion or your beloved no longer wanting to marry you. In these instances, there may be more that develops to unravel the story. Namely, something good can arise out of a seemingly undesirable situation if we are attentive and not consider the worst scenario.

I’ve witnessed this in my life and those I’ve coached over the years. Unfortunate or unforeseen events may turn out to be a wonderful blessing if we are patient and wait for the picture to unravel. For example, I recall working with a client whose fiancée decided to call off their wedding at the last minute after dating for years. The experience was heartbreaking since he never expected it, especially from his betrothed. After he recovered from the tragedy, he moved abroad for work where he enjoyed a wonderful time in his new surroundings. He met a beautiful woman and dated for a while before proposing to her and married soon after. He later mentioned to me that his previous breakup turned out to be the best thing to happen because it forced him to move to a foreign country and meet what he described as the love of his life. Had he been caught up in a destructive pattern of self-pity, he would have never taken the chance and met his wife.

How about you, have you had similar experiences in your own life? Whilst it may not be relationship related, think about those experiences where it seemed hopeless, yet as time passed, it turned out to be the best thing to happen. To live without fear we ought to trust that every outcome serves a greater purpose in our life. Sometimes the answer may not come immediately because it involves going on a journey to discover it. It is why I am drawn to the message by the Toltec author Don Miguel Ruiz who writes in *The Three Questions: How to Discover and Master the Power Within You* how our irrational fears have a way of shaping our reality if we succumb to them: “Fear has had a big effect on the way we learned to view the world. Physical fear is natural and essential to our survival, but it’s important to remember that irrational fear is not. It is irrational to be afraid of what doesn’t exist. In fact, it can cause actual harm. And yet we’ve learned to let irrational fear shape our reality. We’ve learned to react emotionally in ways that other people do and to fear what we only imagine.”

Whilst it is difficult to silence our fears, we can do the next best thing as author Susan Jeffers explains in her popular book: *Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway*. Embrace our fears and take action knowing whatever outcome transpires, it is perfectly arranged for our greater good. We acknowledge whatever unfolds, we will be okay because we have survived every experience up till now. Perhaps life isn’t so much about abandoning our fears but learning to embrace them in order to live boldly. It is like living with anxiety: one never completely overcomes it but learns to turn down the volume. So, if we consider what our fears are protecting us from, as Anthony de Mello’s tale suggests, we realise our thoughts are the cause of our problems, not the events themselves. And this is within our power to revoke.

# How Facebook Groups Can Help Marketers Thrive

## 

New changes to [Facebook’s News Feed](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/rip-facebook-news-feed-for-publishers.html) have made organic reach practically impossible. It’s a clear signal that many marketers need to change their approach once again. While paying for [Facebook ads](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-important-reasons-you-need-to-use-facebook-ads-right-now-first-90-days.html) is always an option (one that you should be using, I must add), it may be too expensive for companies struggling with a small budget. Luckily, there is a lower-cost, engagement-driving alternative: Facebook Groups.

Now, Facebook Groups are nothing new. But many marketers have yet to take full advantage of what this unicorn feature has to offer. It serves as an engagement loophole, making it incredibly valuable after the recent [Facebook News Feed Armageddon](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/facebook-news-feed-armageddon-survival-guide-6-loopholes-to-stay-alive.html). If you haven’t plunged into the world of Facebook Groups, here are five things you need to know.

## 1. A Focus on Collaboration

While a traditional Facebook page is predominately considered a one-way broadcasting platform where the primary goal is to send out information, Facebook Groups are more focused on open and equal discussion. The experience is meant to be collaborative, with participants having the ability to take part in the conversation.

I know what you’re thinking: “How are Facebook Groups valuable if they focus on collaboration?”

Initially, this may seem like a drawback from a marketing perspective, as Facebook groups are not ad-centric. However, it actually gives you a chance to engage with users in a meaningful and authentic way.

Group members have a definite interest in the topic covered by the members. This allows you to gather a range of information and talk directly with a targeted audience. That’s what makes Facebook Groups a unicorn for discovery and connection, particularly as [engagement levels fall](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/this-is-why-facebook-engagement-is-falling-for-bra.html) for brands and publishers.

## 2. You Can Create a New Group

If you need specific feedback or would like to have discussions in a particular niche, then you can create a group designed to do just that.

What sort of reasons would there be to start a group? Nearly anything.

A [product or service launch](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/the-ultimate-product-launch-checklist-infographic.html) is one excellent example, letting you drum up interest and learn the thoughts of potential customers. You could also create one to push an upcoming event, coordinating conversations with attendees.

Looking for feedback on an existing offering? Create a group and get the information you need. The possibilities are essentially endless.

**Facebook Group Settings**

When you create a group, you have the ability to set it to “public,” where anyone can see the posts; “closed,” where anyone can find the group but only members can view the posts; or “secret,” where members have to add a person directly for them to gain access. You can also control whether anyone can post to the group or if those rights should only be given to group admins.

Ultimately, which options are best depends on your goals, so consider what you want to accomplish before making a choice.

If you are looking to [drive engagement](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/what-most-shared-content-on-facebook-can-teach-you-about-engagement.html) in general, then a public group where everyone can participate is your best bet. For providing support to customers after the sale, a closed group where anyone can post could be a better choice. This approach provides members with some serious value without you having to risk a forceful takeover of the group’s purpose.

## 3. Or Join an Existing One

In some cases, a Facebook Group will already exist within your target market, such as a current events forum for your industry. In those cases, you can request to join it if you want to be part of the conversation.

Why would you want to join an existing group? For the built-in audience!

An established group already has members, so you’re tapping into a pre-existing resource. That means you get to reach out to potential customers without having to source them yourself. Now, doesn’t that sound like a unicorn of an opportunity?

## 4. Contributing to the Conversation

When you join or create a group, you may be tempted to get your sales pitch out there. After all, that’s what this is for, right?

Wrong! Just like you need to create [quality content](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/what-quality-content-really-looks-like-today.html) for your Facebook page, you shouldn’t blanket the group with blatant advertising.

Instead, engage with others, take part in discussions, answer questions, and establish your account as an authority. This creates a buzz surrounding your brand, drawing in Facebook users and separating yourself from the donkeys of the group.

## 5. Bypassing News Feed Armageddon

One distinct benefit of using Facebook Groups is that new posts appear in more areas than just the News Feed. Yes, the News Feed appearance is still there, but it’s easy for new information to get lost there.

Where else do they appear? In the user’s notifications.

That’s right, they get a separate notification when new information is added. No more getting buried in the News Feed!

Just be forewarned that a high level of activity (resulting in a plethora of notifications) may lead some users to disable the notification. And, since the posts can get lost in the News Feed, they may forget the group exists.

This means you want to be strategic about groups, especially the ones you start, to [keep engagement high](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/what-most-shared-content-on-facebook-can-teach-you-about-engagement.html). If you aren’t prepared to make sure the group provides value to others, then this isn’t the right option for you.

## Are Facebook Groups the Answer?

While getting involved in existing groups or creating new ones might not be one-stop shopping for all of your marketing needs, Facebook Groups can be incredibly powerful unicorns brimming with opportunity.

In the end, they are an excellent way to combat some of the losses everyone is going to experience after [Facebook’s News Feed changes](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/goodbye-facebook-news-feed-10-things-publishers-need-to-know-about-news-feed-armageddon.html). Adding them to your repertoire gives you a new way to engage with users in meaningful ways. In exchange, you’ll gain access to valuable feedback and be able to promote your company as an authority.

Since the feature is free to use (and isn’t a free feature a unicorn in its own right?), there really isn’t any risk to giving it a try. So, why wouldn’t you take advantage of Facebook Groups to help forward your marketing efforts?

It doesn’t take a lot of time to get started, so explore what’s out there or create your own. Any option that can increase engagement is worth exploring, including Facebook Groups.

# Tackle the Toughest Sales Challenges with SugarCRM

## Tackle Sales Challenges with SugarCRM

Selling has always been a struggle and this is truer than ever in today’s highly competitive business landscape. This coupled with the uncertainty, the pressure to meet deadlines and need to always be ‘on’ can take its toll on anyone. Luckily, SugarCRM has got you covered! It comes out-of-the-box with all the essentials salespersons need to take their productivity to the next level without overcomplicating the whole affair. Here are 5 ways in particular that SugarCRM is extremely useful for tackling the toughest sales challenges head-on.

## Sales Prospecting

If you find prospecting to be the most difficult part of your job, then you’re not alone. More than 40% of salespeople say prospecting is the most challenging part of the sales process (Hubspot). SugarCRM makes managing the whole affair significantly easier with a dedicated Targets module where you can easily keep track of all calls, meetings, emails, notes, and tasks against each record. Segregating prospects from the more sales-ready ‘leads’ also allows SugarCRM to function as an effective lead nurturing tool where the sales and marketing department can easily collaborate and play their roles in the overall sales process. Furthermore, with [**SugarCRM Hint](https://www.rolustech.com/blog/sugarcrm-hint),** you can cut down on call preparation and prospect research times. With just a name and an email, Sugar Hint provides you with relevant customer contact and social network information so you may engage your prospects in a more informed fashion. This, in turn, will yield more meaningful conversations and hence conversions.

## CRM User adoption

According to CSO Reps, less than 37% of sales reps actually use their company’s CRM system. Sales Reps are out on the road all day long, taking calls from leads and managing clients as they drive from one meeting to the next. Given these circumstances, It’s really not that hard to fathom why they might be reluctant to learn and adopt new technologies, especially one that aims to get even more work out of them. For your business to truly reap the benefits of a CRM, it’s important that your sales team actually gets around to using it. To get around this and put your user adoption worries to rest, SugarCRM comes with an award-winning and modern UX. It provides a clean, intuitive, and coherent experience that complements and augments the capabilities of its users instead of overwhelming them. This helps drive user adoption and increase productivity.

## Recurring Manual Processes

[**SugarCRM Advanced Workflow](https://www.rolustech.com/blog/top-6-sugarcrm-advanced-workflow-pitfalls-to-look-out-for)** is a robust enterprise-level business process management tool that allows anyone to design and deploy custom workflows in a matter of a few clicks. With its intuitive drag and drop canvas, sales reps can easily automate cumbersome routine processes which would otherwise need to be done manually. This not only ensures increased productivity but also allows them to focus on more important things such as providing value to and forging even stronger connections with their customers.

## Monitoring Progress and Performance

Sales managers often struggle with effectively gauging rep performance. However, the robust reporting features in SugarCRM make gaining a holistic view of their performance easier than ever by consolidating and summarizing data from various sources. This allows them to unearth critical business insights and trends and gain a deeper understanding of their team in real-time. This way they can quickly identify and target any weaknesses that might hinder progress towards their targets. Similarly, personalized dashboards make it easy for sales reps to track and monitor their activities and metrics against defined KPIs, and strive towards building better customer relationships.

## Sales Forecasting

Many find Sales forecasting to be a tedious task but with the statistical and graphical representations readily available in SugarCRM, you can do it all in the blink of an eye. SugarCRM’s intuitive pipeline management capabilities greatly simplify sales management and team collaboration using real-time sales analytics and insights for every deal and prospect. SugarCRM helps identify critical touchpoints and high-value targets allowing you and your team to focus your time and resources on sales initiatives accordingly. You can make data-driven decisions regarding even your most complex sales by [**customizing SugarCRM](https://www.rolustech.com/sugarcrm-customization)** for your unique products, services, and sales cycles.

## Mobile Insights

The importance of a [**mobile CRM for sales](https://www.rolustech.com/blog/boost-productivity-sales-team-mobile-crm)** cannot be overstated in this day and age. Your sales reps need to be in touch with the right lead at the right time with the right information. This brings about the need for them to have access to critical data at their fingertips at all times. Fortunately, SugarCRM provides a comprehensive mobile CRM solution that enables your sales reps to access, lookup and update customer data on the go, allowing them to stay on top of every deal and ensuring they never miss a moment to engage with the customers.

## The Bottom Line!

SugarCRM has everything you need to stay on top of your game and ahead of the competition. It’s perhaps the most complete and well-round CRM for sales that any rep would love to have in their arsenal. Its custom workflows, sales prospecting, and forecasting capabilities and the other features mentioned above are only the tip of the iceberg. With the right tweaks and customizations, our [**certified SugarCRM experts](https://www.rolustech.com/sugarcrm-certified-team)** can tailor this platform according to your unique needs and help you get even more out of it.

# What We’re Thinking When We’re Thinking About Work That Matters

## What We’re Thinking When We’re Thinking About Work That Matters
> # It was the height of American counterculture. With his young son, Bob set off on his trusty Honda Superhawk for the ride of a lifetime. The 17-day odyssey saw them crisscross the country from Minnesota to San Francisco drunk on the expansive view from the road.

Afterward, Bob returned to a humdrum job of writing computer manuals in Minneapolis. This special brew of mind numbing boredom was in sharp contrast to the visceral feelings he recently experienced riding. Yet he endured and became a connoisseur in the [*subtle art of not doing](http://slowdownnow.org/)*. In dry spells of his own writing endeavours, he lost himself in his job and welcomed the mind wandering. He found a rhythm that would generate acute focus and originality.

If you’re a philosophy fan, you’re well aware that this was Robert Pirsig’s bizarre reality. It was in this dualistic period of his bitter-sweet life, that he birthed *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance — t*he most read philosophy book of all time.

Pirsig became more himself through his writing. But like all silver linings, fulfilment in his work didn’t come without a hefty price tag. He endured tremendous heartache including getting committed to an asylum and undergoing comprehensive shock treatment. Through his experience and writing, we can learn so much about the inner working life. In particular, there are three interconnected themes that might help us navigate in the new world of work: boredom, thinking in action, and perspective-bending.

## The Knife’s Edge

Imagine you’re all alone deep in a remote forest. Bar your footsteps, it’s eerily silent. The odd bird tweets (not on its smartphone). The trail you’re meandering makes a sharp turn and your eyes meet a colossal tree trunk. You’re gobsmacked. Time is suspended in this ethereal space and you make no judgement. There is no thought of ‘wow, *this is one big ass Sequoia’ — *there is only the awe of it all.

![](1*ocNcO3Xxd0yvVFn8V1xc-Q.jpeg)

This might be what Pirsig saw as the knife’s edge* *of experience. He called it *Quality*. And his Metaphysics of Quality ([MoQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirsig%27s_metaphysics_of_Quality)) was a mash-up of East Asian and American philosophies which paved the way for both Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s notion of [*Flow](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow) *and the* *Gladwellian* *ideas that litter [Blink](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316010669). It’s one thing to experience *Quality* by loosing yourself in a Sequoia-filled forest — but how exactly does *Quality *translate to the workplace? Pirsig relays that it depends on whether or not you feel a connection to what you’re working on:
> # “When one isn’t dominated by feelings of separateness from what he’s working on, then one can be said to ‘care’ about what he’s doing. That is what caring really is, a feeling of identification with what one’s doing. When one has this feeling then he also sees the inverse side of caring, Quality itself.”

*Quality* in work does not require categorisation. If anything, it’s a feeling — a non-state where the distinction between work and life does not exist. Some callings might favour achieving this work/life blend more than others. Maybe from time to time you fantasise of being a food critic or nature photographer. I know I do. The point is not to have the dream job (although that probably can’t hurt), but possessing a feeling of connection. It can be had by anyone in nearly any vocation. Both the blacksmith that spends the day [making a sword](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/hollywood-blacksmith-tony-swatton) and the management consultant that rejigs a client’s business model can attain *Quality*. It’s what’s going on inside that counts; carrying that inner smirk that manifests as an outer beam.

## The Virtues of Boredom

In an intimate [1974 interview](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-motorcycle-is-yourself-revisiting-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-1.2914205) with Tim Wilson, Pirisg explained that:
> # “Boredom on the job was an incentive to creativity. I deliberately enter a period of boredom just prior to writing…because ultimately it brings me down to the centre of things from which all creativity comes.”

![](1*2Dzpw_jj8ZQXYVmK8i_-mw.jpeg)

While the [virtues of boredom](http://nautil.us/issue/46/balance/darwin-was-a-slacker-and-you-should-be-too?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits) are long-standing within the arts, they also bear relevance concerning today’s knowledge worker. A daily dance with a ceaseless stream of information is not only cognitively draining, it demands regular refuelling. And slacking off, as it turns out, is very good for the soul.

Some prefer long walks while others take shortish naps. I like sitting. Whatever floats your boat really — the point is to be intentional in doing nothing. What matters is that you avoid incessant hours of toil when embarking on creative pursuits. Alex Pang, author of [Rest](https://www.amazon.com/Rest-More-Done-When-Work/dp/0465074871) explains that, “Even in today’s 24/7, always-on world, we can blend work and rest together in ways that make us smarter, more creative, and happier.” Instead of reaching for that magical rectangle in your pocket, consider taking time out to master the skill of resting and draw in that blissful state of boredom.

## Thinking in Action

It may not always seem it, but we do get to choose our attitude towards work. The luxury that lies with the Western worker is having much more freedom in work than previous generations. Still, nearly 9 out of every 10 employees claim they are not engaged in work. Too many suffer over a days work when they could be surfing through it.

![](1*Ulj8iUe9i92QdnsCFr9QCw.png)

The strongest indicator of whether you are engaged at work is whether or not you believe you’re making progress towards meaningful work. Known as the [progress principle](http://progressprinciple.com/research), it means incremental advancement through [*small wins](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins).* With every baby step forward the progress principle is revealed. As Teresa Amabile explains:
> # “Of all events that occur at work, the event having the most prominent positive effect on emotions, perceptions, and motivation is simply making progress in meaningful work.”

In practice, you must appreciate what you contribute to work as well as recognise others. “A sense of appreciation is the single most sustainable motivator at work,” explains Wharton professor [Adam Grant](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/08/just-say-thank-you-to-the-people-you-work-with.html). Extrinsic measures (pay and status) only go so far in bringing a sense of fulfilment. It’s those intrinsic ones, your inner working life and how it becomes validated by your peers that really provides that sense of progress.

For others, making progress may involve turning the forsaken job they have into one they love. By reshaping work tasks, relationships with colleagues, and their own perception — [job crafting](http://faculty.som.yale.edu/amywrzesniewski/documents/Craftingajob_Revisioningemployees_000.pdf) becomes a powerful way to do just this. As more companies hire hunger over talent, the job crafting strategy will prove increasingly useful from an organisational standpoint. After all, businesses cannot innovate if everyone within them is uninspired.
> # We need to stretch our boundaries, both as individuals and as organisations, and reimagine the value work holds. It’s no longer a luxury to contemplate meaning in work — it’s a necessity.

And those around us can act as catalysts, nourishers, and enablers. This brand of motivation is infectious. It changes not just how we work together, it changes the world.

It’s evident when someone is engaged in their work. Instead of saying, “I have to go to work,” they say, “I get to go to work.” Our family, friends, and colleagues all take notice of the way we feel about what we do. When you operate from a genuine place of purpose and giving spirit, it has a positive cascading effect. Those you work with have a decision, and one they get to make every day. They can choose whether to inhibit or enable, deprive or nourish, challenge or support. When you operate from a genuine place of purpose and giving spirit, it has a positive cascading effect.

## Perspective Bending

For Prisig, his job not only facilitated, but fuelled his side hustle. Where his job was a means to an end, writing his book was an end in itself. His rigid program saw him asleep by 6:00 pm, rising at 2:00 am to write until he scooted off to work at 6:00 am. It was not uncommon for him to sneak cat naps at lunch before returning to draft computer manuals.

There are no more jobs. Work and opportunity have replaced it. Work itself is no longer classified as something you or some sort of profession you *become*. Rather, it’s a way of *being*. It’s precisely why a new workforce waves the ‘*we are what we repeatedly do’* flag so high. They yearn to bring their whole selves to work, to self-actualise, precisely because they now have the freedom to do so. But what if there is something else at play here?

![](1*zzvD_dcWCh2X9zHcBElJvw.jpeg)

We’re informed by the world we see around us, through social cues, by professional standards, a tireless media — but ultimately by how we feel about our work. Identifying with what you do at work is one path to deeper meaning. Yet the real challenge may not rest squarely in the work itself, but with the [175 cognitive biases ](https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18)at play on the psyche. The construct of your place at work (and work’s fit into your life for that matter) is warped by how you choose to see things.

It may be helpful to check your biases at the door through a dash of *choiceless awareness. *Conceived somewhere between philosophy and and psychology — having this acute awareness means you exist in the present without preference for a desired outcome. You have no compulsion either way so you don’t sweat the small (or big) stuff.

The concept came into popularity through the writings of mid-20th century philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti. “You can’t be totally aware if you are choosing” he wrote. The goal is to have your actions stem from awareness and not choice. Removing this need for decision-making can provide for greater clarity. Ironically then, as we seek to discover more freedom in our work, we do well to stay cognizant of containing — if not eliminating — the myriad of choices at bay. This meditative-like state of *non-choosing* is a blissful one but for many (myself included) it remains elusive.

The underlying point is not missed however— it is our conceptual selves that permit us *to be* our work. The stories we tell ourselves make up our reality. The lesson is this: *those that tend to derive the most meaning in work do so because of the intrinsic value that work brings, not just the instrumental rewards.*
> # Taking a wide-angle lens on work there are certainly lots of agents at play. In the end, crafting a meaningful working life is a *Quality* that only you control.

[Research coming out of Northwestern University](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/12/637886786/treating-teen-depression-might-improve-mental-health-of-parents-too) found when teenagers are treated for depression their parents experienced improved mental health, too. They don’t even need to step foot in a therapist’s office. And vicey-versey — a previous study showed when depressed moms get help, kids ride the happy wave.
> “We’re social creatures. We exist in families, we exist in social networks. And a lot of our well-being, a lot of our highs and lows might come from these relationships,” said Kelsey Howard, a graduate student at Northwestern University’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.

Housing properties have more than doubled over the past ten years and New Zealand’s Prime Minister is not happy about it. Uh-uh, not one bit.

Upping the drama factor, analysts say it’s unclear if this power move will make even a wee bit of difference.

### **Still to come: Three feet**

Fact: Silicon Valley thinks you should have three arms.

# 12 Trips That Are More Affordable Than You Think

## 

Travels and adventures provide mind-expanding experiences that accelerate learning and alter our lives forever.
> # “We are driven into wild rage by our luxurious lives, so that whatever does not answer our whims, arouses our anger.” –Seneca

At our roots we are nomadic. For however long humans have been around, we’ve been on the move: crossing land bridges, dodging global freezing and warming… so exploring somewhere new is really a call to get back to our evolutionary roots.

Unfortunately, traveling on a regular basis can be expensive, and for many of us, may feel financially infeasible. But travel is an important way to connect with the world and with yourself.

That’s why we’ve partnered with [Scott’s Cheap Flights](http://bit.ly/2xQmzkR) to bring you this list of the best vacations you can do without breaking the bank.

Let’s start off with four destinations that are typically expensive, but with these tips and flight deals, you can make work on any budget!

## **Incredible Flight Deals**

### **Hawaii**

![](0*zMIpZcLCy9-ktuvD)

Hawaii is an island paradise. The rolling green mountains, powerful volcanoes, and world-famous beaches give the impression that it’s an expensive vacation destination. However, the most popular adventures spread out among the eight islands are all *free*.

Enjoy natural wonders such as Wailua Waterfall, Kilauea Volcano, and the hidden Pa’ako Cove. The Dole Plantation on Oahu also offers train tours, a garden maze, and a look into the fascinating life of pineapple growing in Hawaii, starting at only $4.

Hawaii was one of the top five roundtrip fares on Scott’s Cheap Flights in the past six months, with nonstop fares as low as $177 roundtrip from West Coast cities.

### **New Zealand**

![](0*N8-YDZhkygNrSDQU)

One of the easiest ways to save money traveling is to go at the right time. For New Zealand, that would be April through July, the fall and early winter of the Southern Hemisphere.

Once there, check out the Queenstown Botanical Gardens, Auckland Art Gallery, and Rotorua Lakefront — all for free. Visiting places lesser known by tourists, such as Rotorua or Hastings, is also a great alternative! They are cheaper and give you a better chance to experience authentic New Zealand culture.

New Zealand was one of Scott’s top five flights from last year with fares at one point dropping to just $390 roundtrip from all over the U.S.

### **Paris**

![](0*H4jSTFEQOF6UjlSJ)

Paris is known for being one of the most elegant cities in the world. Although it has a reputation for being expensive, Paris can be done on a budget.

French bakeries are the best places to get cheap food. There are a seemingly endless amount of perfect croissants, quiches, sandwiches, and sweets that are a fraction of the price of a meal at a nice restaurant, but just as delicious.

You can enjoy spending your day visiting the Eiffel Tower, Sacré‑Cœur, the Museum of Modern Art, and many other world-famous sites, all with reasonable admission fees.

This year, Scott’s Cheap Flights has found non-stop flights to the City of Lights from NYC for only $306 roundtrip.

### **Iceland**

![](0*1OuDfDuMAW7THmGr)

Iceland is the ideal travel destination for people who enjoy an adventure!

The sun is out until midnight, the Aurora Borealis lights up the sky in such a way that it almost seems magical, and the geothermal baths will leave you more relaxed than you’ve ever been.

Camping is very popular and, at some places, can be done for as little as $14 a night. If you’re traveling with friends, you can all split the price of renting a car and road trip across the country, seeing national parks, glaciers, hidden caves, waterfalls, and the greenest mountains you’ll ever lay eyes on. Nature is always free!

Scott’s Cheap Flights gave people the opportunity to fly non-stop to Iceland, from all over the US, for just $191 roundtrip.

Often, the most expensive part of a trip is getting to the place itself. So here’s a list of exotic destinations that are cheap once you get there.

## **Affordable Destinations**

### **Bali**

![](0*DAn-_zal_cS-Infv)

Like many other countries in Southeast Asia, Bali has a very low cost of living. Most of your money will be spent on accommodation and food, but you can find a bargain for anything else.

Watching the sunset at Kuta Beach, catching waves at Uluwatu Beach, and visiting an ancient Buddhist temple could potentially be some of the best experiences of your life — and you still won’t spend a penny.

Even though Bali is incredibly affordable once you’re there, flights there are usually quite expensive. But in the past few months, Scott’s found roundtrip flights from LA and SF to Bali for just $479.

### **Mexico**

![](0*PCVKxie0ViCM1_G_)

Mexico is a vibrant country with much to offer.

All over, you will find amazing foods such as blue corn quesadillas, beef empanadas, and fresh fish tacos. The whole country, in general, is inexpensive, with an average daily budget of $20, compared to $50 in a city such as Berlin.

Everyone knows the major travel cities like Cancun and Cabo, but the best way to experience true Mexican culture is to get away from the tourist grid. Instead, visit cities such as Mexico City and Oaxaca. From there, you can enjoy some inexpensive day trips to the pyramids of Teotihuacan and the hot springs of Tolantongo.

### **Vietnam**

![](0*3Sv8pdcY0FE7WgWO)

Vietnam is known for having some of the best and freshest food in the world.

Even though you can find Vietnamese restaurants selling their classic noodles, phở, in any city in the US, it’s nothing like tasting the real thing. The streets are lined with stalls and carts of incredible food and you can have an entire meal for less than $3.

Motorcycles are the primary mode of transportation there, and anyone can rent them for as little as $4.5 a day. It’s an affordable way to see the *real* Vietnam.

### **Lithuania**

![](0*O1vPIHnfW0jO_HAi)

Lithuania is not a common travel destination, but it should be!

The country is influenced by Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance architecture, making everyday shops look like a fairytale. The country is deeply rooted in history, with the Lithuanian language being one of the oldest languages in use today.

What makes Lithuania so special is that it has a Western European vibe with Eastern European prices. Keep an eye out for the Devils’ Museum and the Hill of Crosses, whose admission is free… for those brave enough to enter.

### **Czech Republic**

![](0*i8Z1zcJDiln4UCKI)

The Czech Republic is known for its ornate castles and history, but also for being the number one beer drinking country in the world.

People flock to the country for the $1 beer, which literally flows out of taps in the wall, and they stay for the underrated meat-centric cuisine. Be sure to leave time for a trip to the beautiful countryside that is not too far from Prague.

### **Taiwan**

![](0*au0scl4hWgxWwE-0)

Taiwan has a vibrant nightlife, with people crowding the famous night markets like it’s their last day on Earth.

Besides the rich and delicious food that the country has to offer, Taiwan is home to some of the world’s best museums. More than 690,000 of mainland China’s historic treasures and artifacts are located in the National Palace Museum in Taipei.

For the adventurers and adrenaline junkies, riding motorbikes through Taroko Gorge, which is like a green Grand Canyon, is a must-do.

### **India**

![](0*nA5om5CaSFpSCarQ)

Flights to India are long and are often expensive, but they are worth every penny.

The country itself is incredibly cheap and there seems to be an unlimited amount to eat, do, and see. The cuisine is some of the best in the world and temples and holy sites are easy to find.

Flights used to average $1,400, but now we regularly see them down in the $500s and $600s. If you find yourself there in March, be sure to attend the Holi festival of color, a celebration of the arrival of spring.

### **Greek Islands**

![](0*jChF2Iid9mnWxeEg)

By far the biggest expense of this bucket-list destination is getting there, but this little hack can save you $1,000 on the flights.

Let’s say you live in NYC and want to go to Santorini. You pull up Kayak and find that fares for that route are $1,500. Yikes. Instead of giving up your Santorini dream, check flights to Athens, which we recently found nonstop from NYC for $439 roundtrip. Once you’re in Athens, flights to Santorini are about $60 roundtrip, bringing your total flight cost to $499 rather than the original $1,500. Plus you can spend some time in Athens as well before heading off to Santorini.

Travel is one of the most effective tools to accelerate your learning. If you make travel a priority, you’ll see drastic (positive) changes in how you think and perceive our world.

[Scott’s Cheap Flights](http://bit.ly/2xQmzkR) spends all day, every day, researching flights in order to give you the opportunity to travel the world on a budget. There’s so much of the world to explore and now, nothing is holding you back. Ready to book your next trip?

# Do I Really Want To Be In Tech?

## Do I Really Want To Be In Tech?

### A Healthy Look At Self-Doubt

Stop and take a look around.

Are you surprised with what you’re doing? I know I am.

One day, I was a ten-year-old excitedly pencil-sketching Superman a thousand times over, promising myself I would be one of the best comic book artists in the world and the next thing I know, I’m working in tech, among other things.

I didn’t exactly stick to the plan.

It all happened so fast.

I decided to go to college for design since I have always enjoyed combining pictures and words while drawing comics. I eventually picked up a business minor in order to start a freelance career. After a few years of traditional graphic design, I started working with tech entrepreneurs to design apps and websites. Not too long after, I decided to start working on my own app.

And there you have it. Most of us go through a similar process while growing up, albeit, probably towards a more traditional career.

This is completely natural. How many kids say they want to be an astronaut or a firefighter only to become lawyers and sales associates?

There is absolutely nothing wrong with compromising as long as you have stopped and asked yourself one important question:
> # “Is this what I really want to do?”

If you can honestly answer this question with a resounding “Yes!” then you are in the minority of people who are currently pursuing their calling.

For the rest of us who aren’t entirely sure, it is OK not to know.

Self-doubt is part of the human condition. Anyone who tells you otherwise is blowing smoke up your ass while trying to sell you something you don’t need.

One of the smartest things you can do is listen to this self-doubt.

Admittedly, this can take a little more practice than you think. It takes time to quiet everything else going on in your life and look inward.

This is where mediation, journaling, or some other form of introspection can be extremely useful.

Once you start listening, you’ll be surprised at what you hear.

For example, after several morning journal sessions, I finally started to hear the question in the title of this article. It was hard to acknowledge this realization, especially because this can be a lucrative industry.

Yes, being in the tech industry sounds sexy; there are countless stories of fame, fortune, and the future.

The thing is, I’ve never been motivated by any of these things, except for maybe the last one.

Instead, I care more about immediate impact. I want to help as many people as humanly possible right now instead of waiting until I have a fully-developed a platform for speaking.

The tricky thing? There are an infinite number of ways to accomplish this.

Ultimately, this is where my self-doubt comes into play. In any given moment, I wonder if this is the path that will allow me to impact the most people possible. I also wonder if I am using my gifts to the best of my ability.

In this case, design is something I would consider a gift, but it is also something I’ve worked extremely hard to hone. Because of this, it makes sense to work in a design-related field.

But what if I have started honing another skill that I potentially enjoy more?

To make things simple, let’s say this newfound skill is writing. While we’re going down this rabbit hole, let’s also say I write every day and have started enjoying it more than design.

Does this mean I should shift my focus and become a writer? After all, I can impact just as many people — possibly more — through the power of words.

I don’t believe life is this binary. I’m one of those people who believes in having your cake and eating it, too. In this case, that means finding a way to make design and writing work, together.

Initially, combining these two skills translates into a career in UX writing, content strategy, or something similar.

Unfortunately, none of these paths sound appealing; that is, unless I was working for a company I believe in.

Currently, these companies are few and far between, which is why I am attempting to create one from the ground up. I can’t help but feel this is what I’m meant to do…for now.

At any point in time, I have the right to question myself and my motivations. If these aren’t aligning with my purpose, than I have a responsibility to course correct.

The same goes for you.

If self-doubt is starting to creep in, it may be for a reason. Listen to it, explore it, and ultimately decide if you are on the right path.

If you don’t, you will wake up years from now full of something much worse:

### Regret.

# Advice for Young and Aspiring Artists

## Photo by Daniel Angele on Unsplash

[**Honor Your Commitments:](https://unmistakablecreative.com/the-power-of-honoring-your-commitments/)** Start by honoring the ones you’ve made to yourself. Then honor the ones you’ve made to others. You’ll gain trust, enhance your reputation, and increase your credibility. If you’re struggling to honor your commitments, make less of them.

**Make Something Every Day:** The more you make, the better you’ll get. The better you get, the more likely you are to be commercially successful. If you want to become a better writer, become a prolific one. That applies to every art form.

[**Always Carry a Notebook:](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-you-should-always-carry-a-notebook-5617803767e0)** Notebooks are the best distraction-free writing tools on the planet. They are also fertile soil for creative ideas. Every creative project I’ve shipped started in the pages of my notebooks.

**Focus on the Process:** There’s nothing that will do more for your career as an artist than to focus on the process. You’ll make visible progress, which will increase your motivation. You’ll build the skills you need when opportunity knocks. Your name in lights, the book deal with the publisher and the starring role are all byproducts. They are a result of the process.

**Stop waiting for Permission.** If you’re waiting for permission from a publisher to write your book, a record label to make your album or a venture capitalist to build your startup, you’ll be waiting for eternity. As Alexis Ohanian says, the future will be built without their permission.

**Spend your time and attention wisely:[**Attention is the currency of achievement.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/why-attention-is-the-currency-of-achievement-2/) You can spend it on accumulating likes, hearts, and other meaningless metrics. Or you can spend it on deep work, deliberate practice, and [mastering your craft](https://unmistakablecreative.com/test-template-2/). Successful artists spend their attention on the latter.

**Don’t Confuse an Artist’s Life with the Artist’s work:** My friend Travis jokes that I’m a combination of Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra, and Hank Moody. That sounds far more fun than the reality of my life. It’s just what Anne Lamott calls a fantasy of the uninitiated.

**Compare Less and Create More:** The less I know about what my peers are doing, the more prolific and productive I am. I read their books. I interview them on The Unmistakable Creative. But I avoid looking at best-seller lists, reviews rankings, and metrics I can’t control. The only way you move the needle on any of those metrics is to compare less and create more.

**Don’t Follow The Herd:** Imitation rarely leads to meaningful innovation. Mimicry usually results in obscurity. Art that resonates is infused with your signature, blood, sweat, and tears. When Mars Dorian’s work rolls through my newsfeed, I know he’s the only one who could have done it. Only is better than best.

[**Create for an Audience of One:](https://rebrand.ly/ac7b3)** I have one main criterion for how I chose podcast guests. Does this make ME curious? It’s selfish, and it’s selfless. It’s selfish because I’m putting my interest first. But it’s selfless because you can’t expect an audience to be excited about your work when you’re not.

**Draw a Line in the Sand:** We have a line in the sand. Our show is an hour. It doesn’t matter if your Oprah, Justin Bieber, or Beyonce. Our interviews are for one hour. If you don’t have an hour, we’ll have to pass.

I’ve cut interviews in the middle of them, said no to internet celebrity guests, and passed on people others might by dying to have. I’m here to make something unmistakable, so I could care less how famous you are, how many other media outlets you’ve been on, or how many impressive things are on your resume. I want to know how you’ll touch our audience’s heart, how you’ll leave them different for your having been here.

Every Artist needs a line in the Sand. Compromising your line in the sand is a slippery slope that can lead to mediocrity.

**Polarize to Resonate**: We’ve been conditioned our whole lives not to poke the box, question authority, or challenge the status quo. Poking sacred cows is frowned upon. But that’s how change happens.

As Justine Musk says “if you have a bold and compelling point of view, you’re going to piss some people off.” I do at least once a week. People have labeled my work everything from misogynist to leftist propaganda. Don’t chase people who are leaving when you could serve those who are waiting for you to make more art.

**Choose the Project That Makes Your Heart Sing:** Your natural temptation will be to write the book that sells the most copies, make the movie that is a box office smash, or record the song that you know will be a hit. But things that come out of the hit machine rarely become Perennial Sellers. When you choose the project that makes your heart sing, your audience will feel it. There’s no point in making your art if it doesn’t make them feel something or [give them hope.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/good-art/)

# Why You Should Join a High Growth Startup Like Lime

## 

During my last two years at Babson College and a year after graduation, I worked on building my own company called Shelfie Challenge. It started as something I could work on throughout courses at Babson and I became obsessed with building a product. I learned how to do market research correctly, build pro-forma financial statements, build and present clear pitch decks, forge partnerships with large organizations, and build out extensive business and marketing plans.

The company was beginning to gain some traction near the end of its lifecycle but my health was deteriorating and I needed to take a step back and focus on my health. Stress, 80–100 work weeks, little sleep, and stomach issues required I stop completely. I found out I had an airway obstruction issue that required surgery — septoplasty and turbinate reduction — but the earliest I could schedule the surgery was in August. I ended Shelfie in mid-April.

![](1*CBSs67OljZq4t0WAjw2ASw.jpeg)

In April I started spending more time with my friends and family, which was difficult since I was working all day, every day. In May I went home and visited my family and we spent a week in the Dominican Republic — we never take breaks or vacation. At the beginning of June, I started the job search in the Bay Area and targeted Series A+ startups. Companies that sent me offer letters had a little as 20 employees, with some having more than 800.

The biggest priorities for me in choosing a company had to meet the following criteria: incredible teammates, diversity across all spectrums, high growth, a bit of chaos so we can put systems in place, preferably in San Francisco, a challenging role, and the ability to wear multiple hats.

One of the companies I received an offer letter from was Lime. I did a lot of cool things before graduating from college: won 6 national eSports championships, helped my Dad’s company 20x revenue over 3 years, pitched Daymond John and in multiple countries, won the MIT Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp #5 as the youngest attendee, and was named a Top 100 Social Enabler globally. With that being said, fortunately, Lime didn’t view me as an entry level candidate.

All of my mistakes, successes, and learnings have prepared me to join Lime. I am the regional marketing manager for the northeast. I am from the northeast, lived and went to school there, and have an insanely large network spread out across the northeast. The role seemed perfect.

Now, I want to share with you a few thoughts on why joining a high growth startup is a great idea. It is not for everyone and even if it is not, you will learn more about yourself than you could have imagined.

## Learning How to Build a Sustainable Company

One of the biggest challenges of building a startup when you are young is that you most likely have not seen how a company scales to become sustainable and what systems were put in place to support company-wide growth.

![Before pitching in the Miller Lite Tap the Future Semi-finals](0*rCclpooJkjwF8_IF)*Before pitching in the Miller Lite Tap the Future Semi-finals*

If you are thinking about leaving a large company and joined once those systems were already developed and put in place, you are an incredible asset to a high growth startup. You can then come in and put systems in place to help scale growth at the company.

If you are looking to jump-start or transition your career a high growth startup is a dream. You will gain a lot of knowledge that will prove useful to any career you jump into.

If you join a high growth startup early you will be working long hours but learning extensively about building a company, still will have family and friend time, get paid for it if it is VC backed or funded, and you will soon have an executive position as you scale. If you join later, no worries. You can join the management team, become head or director of an apartment, and things move quickly so expect promotions.

**Overall tips:**

* Make sure you do not get lost in the chaos of high growth companies

* In modern day a lot of high growth companies are losing money but raised a lot of capital to support growth, therefore, understand they are playing the long game

## Career Growth

The tip that I always tell people when they join a high growth startup like Lime is that if they work hard, prove their value, and are ambitious towards a promotion, it will happen in a fairly short amount of time.

Large companies with structure have a typical path to promotion. If you join a sales team as a Sales Development Representative you can expect to be there for 9–12 months, then be advanced to a Junior Account Executive for 3–6 months, then a full-scale Account Executive. Then either transition to Account Management, or a director type role at the company.

**Overall Tips**

* Work hard and smart, be ambitious and you will move closer to a promotion

* Be prepared to help the company with whatever the most pressing needs are, even if it is outside of your direct role

## Wearing Multiple Hats

![At the North America Bike Share Assocation Conference in Portland, Oregon](0*IXmPHlXg5DFJHXfU)*At the North America Bike Share Assocation Conference in Portland, Oregon*

In a high growth startup — HGS for short— your role might say Northeast Marketing Manager, but, you might be in Portland, Oregon one week helping the team out at an event, or working on various national campaigns, or various organizational partnerships.

Even if your company has raised $467m you should expect to complete your roles needs + be willing to help step in and help the company and team where needed. It sounds like a lot of work but this type of collaboration and support goes a long way and truly makes your work more exciting.

Be prepared to rapidly advance your career. Startups are the greatest place for experiential learning on the job and propelling yourself forward.

**Overall Tips**

* Be ready to thrive in ambiguity and be a self-starter, while knowing your company has the resources to support you when needed

* Having multiple duties might seem stressful when in the process, but completion of a successful projection is one of the most fulfilling feelings you can experience in your career

## Stock Options

![](1*PnAIMm1ZNDVIv-7xID93UA.png)

Startups involve more risk than a traditional company since it is often new, requires systems for scalability, is bootstrapped for cash and resources, and there is still a lot of structure to figure out. Therefore, you are compensated with company stock — also referred to as equity — for your services.

When given stock options expect a 1-year cliff and 36 months of vesting. That means if you are given 10% stock you are granted 2.5% after year 1 and the remaining 7.5% is granted over 36 months on a monthly basis (.2083/month).

After year 1 you have actually accumulated stock. Ideally, you stay with the company for at least 4 years to have all of your stock vested, meaning, granted to you. As you gain promotions in the company you are typically granted more stock.

**Startups typically grant stock options for three reasons:**

1. Retain top talent and keep them at the company

1. Compensate for the extra work required, since an acquisition or IPO can give you a large paycheck

1. Give you ownership of the company so you are not limited to your hourly wage

**Overall Tips**

* As a company scales becomes more systematic and works towards a sustainable business model, the level of risk decreases. A Series F startup is a safer bet to last than a Series A

* Expect to be paid a little less than a similar role at a bigger company since the company has to be capital efficient and you are in turn compensated with stock

# Receive A Negative Public Review? Here’s The Best Way To React

## 

Reviews are important — both to authors and to everyone else outside of the publishing industry.

In 2016, the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/12/19/online-reviews/) found that 82 percent of American adults say they “sometimes or always” read online reviews for new purchases. And more than two-thirds of regular review readers believe that they’re “generally accurate.” Negative reviews, in particular, seem to dramatically influence our buying behaviors.

So reviews are important, right? Which means we creators should pay attention to them and use them as metrics for the quality of our art — right?
> # Well, not exactly.

Consider the online reviews available for The Great Wall of China. Perhaps the most recognizable symbol of China and its long and vivid history, the Great Wall was originally conceived by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the third century B.C. as a means of preventing incursions from barbarian nomads. To this end, it was effective. The online reviews would likely reflect that, right?

Again, not exactly.

Consider this one-star review from Great Wall patron Dirk Guthrie: “The wall is broken in lots of places, and it costed [sic] me all of my money to get there and i [sic] did not know what the natives were speaking.”

Adds[ Billy Bottoms](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110138593902772025206/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjA3enm8oTgAhVqmuAKHWYFA70QvvQBegQIARAf): “I don’t see the hype in this place it’s really run down and old… why wouldn’t you update something like this? No usb plug ins or outlets anywhere.”

## **Yes, negative reviews are a part of life. But often they’re grounded in dubious logic and should not be lent credence.**

My personal experience with bad reviews predates the internet. I was a sportswriter for a small-town daily newspaper in Roseburg, Oregon. When I’d report — accurately, I might say — that little Johnny fumbled in the big game, I’d get tons of letters criticizing me. This was decades before email, so it was envelope, paper, and angry red ink. Since the letters mentioned me, I had the duty of typing each complaint into the newspaper system myself.

This was my first job out of the sanctuary of college, and it was by far my first experience with this kind of critique. At first, it was devastating. How could so many people seem to not like me or my work?

Soon, though, I began to develop a thicker skin, mainly because I had to. There wasn’t a mechanism to respond to critics back in the day, so I had no choice but to put on a smile and keep reporting the facts.

I brushed them off, in other words.
> # That’s something all creators — whether of companies or of books — must know how to do.

The reason, again, is that most negative reviews don’t matter.

Some, however, very much do.

In those cases, you won’t be able to just brush off a negative review. Sometimes, it will be crucial that you respond and that you take the review seriously,* especially* if the review pertains to your company or a process you’re otherwise in charge of. In these scenarios, a response is necessary.

Here’s what to remember in those kinds of situations.

## **1) Never respond with emotion.**

Yes, it’s hard *not *to take negative reviews personally. But responding to a negative review — whether it be on social media, via email, or on your company website — with a defensive or angry outburst is guaranteed to makes things worse. Other customers will see your angry response and interpret it as proof that the negative review was, in fact, warranted.
> **Instead, take a deep breath and respond only when you are calm, collected, and possessing of perspective.**

If you can’t get to such a tranquil mental space, consider passing the task of responding off to someone on your staff who’s perhaps better at customer service and who’s less connected to the product, story, or feature in question.

## **2) Try and learn what you can from the review, and use it to get better.**

This is particularly important if the review in question focuses on things like:

* The treatment of a customer by your staff

* The experience of a customer or fan trying to navigate an overly complex site

* Claims of unprofessionalism

If you identify any evidence of wrongdoing on your part or on the part of people you’re responsible for, it behooves you to investigate that.

It’s a matter, in such cases, of being responsible.

Furthermore, negative reviews can often teach you a lot about your product or service. Oftentimes, they can shed light on areas where your business can improve. Smart executives use such reviews as an opportunity to make their business better.

## **3) Flag the review as inappropriate and take administrative action if necessary.**

Don’t be afraid to do this, either.

We all know the internet can be a sewer of profanity, xenophobia, etc. If you receive a negative review on your site which strikes you as “too-far” — indeed, if it violates the terms of whatever review site it’s on, including yours — the best thing to do is flag it or take it down and ban the user.

Sometimes, negative reviews are warranted. But there’s too much hate and filth in the world to encourage these kinds of negative reviews.

## **4) If you’ve done something wrong, respond quickly, and seek to make things right.**

At [BookBaby](https://www.bookbaby.com/), when we receive a public negative review or message that we think necessitates a response, here’s what we do: First, we respond quickly. That means within 24 hours — and ideally less. By responding quickly, you show that you’re in tune with customer feedback and that you’re an active participant in your business.

Next, we try and fix the problem. If this means offering a freebie, we do it. But I’ve found that much of the time, customer issues can be resolved by simply listening and communicating.

Finally, we strive to be authentic in our correspondence. Customers want to know it’s an actual human being responding to them — not a bot. So, keep your conversation genuine, and also, keep it polite — it’s important to take the high road.
> # At the end of the day, yes, negative reviews are a part of life, and often they’re not worth listening to.

Sometimes, though, they are.

And when they are, it’s critical you know what to do.

# 3 Ways To Develop A Powerful Presence With Others

## Photo by Ilya Pavlov on Unsplash

## How To Cultivate Presence
> # “Be here now.” ― Ram Dass

Pursuing your dreams with a powerful intention and sense of purpose, requires a call from within yourself to activate that desire. The power of presence ignites your capacity to create a remarkable future by transforming that intention into future action. So what is this elusive thing called presence which people desire? I am frequently asked in seminars how to cultivate more presence in their lives.

Firstly, let us define presence and examine why it is paramount for connecting with the authentic self. Consider the last time you attended a social gathering and met someone who exuded a mysterious quality. It may have been a distinctly attractive quality, perhaps a distinguished grace or a peaceful nature which drew you towards them. It may have been an elusive aspect which you were unable to quantify or it was merely they seemed comfortable in their own skin and aware of their surroundings. They might have moved about the room as if floating on thin air, while radiating an unmistakable allure.

People who have presence have an inner radiance, since they are comfortable and content within themselves. They seldom walk or move in haste. Their gestures are timed and controlled, as if rehearsed. They rarely seek approval from others, yet it is others who seek approval from them. I have met numerous people who have personified these characteristics. Upon reflection they were the most genuine and grounded people I met. Others may incorrectly assert that it is all an act, although I am loath to buy into that argument given the congruity of maintaining such an “act.” So how does one create presence? Why would you want presence anyway And how does it serve you?

## Creating Powerful Presence
> # “One of the best feeling in the world is knowing that your presence and absence both means something to someone.” — Anonymous

Maintaining presence is the outward reflection of our inner world. It is the frequency we transmit, while advising others of our inner contentment — that is we are in charge of our inner domain. We are the master and architect of our destiny. Human beings fall into one of two categories relating to their personal characteristics: leaders or followers. If you are a leader you are fortunate enough to inspire and lead others toward revealing their uniqueness. If you are a follower, you are fortunate to being the recipient of such leadership and acquiring a number of the leadership qualities bestowed by formidable leaders.

Let us make the distinction clear that being a follower does not imply being a sheep, devoid of thought to create one’s own circumstances. Over the years I have looked up to and modelled my life on a number of esteemed leaders. All of them possessed unique qualities which I sought to incorporate into my personality and become inspired by. Psychologists suggest when you recognise a quality in another person you admire, you already possess that quality within yourself. Therefore, presence is distinguished by an unknown quality within you which seeks outward expression.

The following points relate to creating powerful presence in your life. Allow me to render a caveat by stating that it takes time and patience to create sound presence. You cannot rush the process any more than nurturing a growing child. You cannot wake up one day and be blessed with more presence. Presence is acquired, much like water filling a bath tub– recall that water always finds its own level.

## 1. Know Thyself, Grow Thyself

As you discover the essence of your underlying nature, you simultaneously learn more about your capabilities. You reveal your hidden talents, as well as your imperfections; your genius and magnificence. For example, if you are inherently shy, cultivating presence may be slightly more challenging than being an extrovert. There are seldom great leaders who are shy. Granted they may possess introverted qualities at times, though their predominant qualities are extroverted in nature.

Identifying with your shyness might invoke a commitment to working on developing your inner leader by allowing your light to shine. I am certainly not advocating that shy people are less socially developed. I am suggesting that shyness and leadership may not be conducive qualities if you seek to cultivate presence. As someone who speaks before audiences, I experience shyness when I meet new people within a personal setting. I am far more relaxed these days and allow myself to feel at ease with the person I am communicating with. This has required a great deal of commitment from my part to step out of my comfort zone, since I have become accustomed to being in a quiet setting, spending my days writing.

## 2. Presence Occurs Within The Moment

Presence occurs as you are engaged within the present moment. You do not attend a social gathering and turn on presence — it cannot be manufactured or imposed on others. There are numerous actors, models and singers who have the ability to turn it on and off, given their years of training and experience. Once they are away from the spotlight, they quietly retreat into silence to recharge their batteries. You cannot be expected to be engaging all the time — those that are may feel depleted mentally, emotionally and physically once they retreat into a quieter setting.

You cannot erect a facade by staging presence. A useful analogy might suggest that a light house serves to guide ships into safe harbour by shining its light out on to the sea. Seek to become that beckon of light for others and naturally they will be drawn to the light of your presence. It follows as you are open and receptive to engaging in the present moment. The key to cultivating presence is to be awake to each moment. It requires that you become present in your body and not stuck in past thinking nor worrying about an anticipated future.

Gradually as you remove fear and anxiety from your life, this will enable you to see opportunities present themselves. If you are consumed or paralysed by fear, your mind is conditioned to seek it out and in doing so, this becomes your focal point. The true essence of living in the moment is that you are no longer a victim to your past or a slave to the future.

## 3. Harness Self-Awareness And Inner Wisdom

When I talk about harnessing self-awareness and inner wisdom I refer to accessing your inner guide or your inner teacher. Recall a situation where you intuitively identified with an inner voice communicating with you or recognised a feeling summoning you to take action. I am not suggesting hearing voices either, rather the quiet whisper echoing from within. It speaks so silently that it feels like a fleeting gust of wind. If you dismiss it by drowning it out with thought, it can disappear as quickly as it reveals itself.

You may have experienced moments of inspired action in the past without any prior knowledge of the situation — that is you acted intuitively. Perhaps you discovered yourself in a random place, meeting someone unknown and immediately connected with them. These are situations where you accessed your inner guide. It is your inner wisdom which knows no bounds and limitations; yet has the answers to all your questions. As you learn to work with your inner wisdom, you access presence and unite with spirit, which is waiting to be revealed through you. Try it out from time to time by invoking it on personal matters in your life.

In many ways like learning to ride a bike, you become a better cyclist by developing sound bike handling skills, which are attained through trial and error. In a similar way, the more you become adept at accessing your inner wisdom, the more others will see the beauty emanating from your soul. You become the lighthouse others are attracted to. Allow these words to penetrate your consciousness and incorporate them into your daily life. Learn and build on them through patience, trial and error. Do not be surprised if you make mistakes. Be kind to yourself since you are learning, growing and evolving. Remember, there is no such thing as failure in life; only the opportunity to merge into your authentic self.

# 4 Letters That Will Make You a Better Leader

## And Make Sure You’re Setting People Up for Success

![Photo by [Rémi Walle](https://unsplash.com/photos/UOwvwZ9Dy6w?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/collections/1151151/leadership?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](0*dYF_1bziwIvP81Gf.jpg)*Photo by [Rémi Walle](https://unsplash.com/photos/UOwvwZ9Dy6w?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/collections/1151151/leadership?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

*“A real leader,” *David Foster Wallace wrote of [his experience following McCain in the 2000 election](https://www.amazon.com/Consider-Lobster-David-Foster-Wallace-ebook/dp/B000S1LVHW/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=),* “can somehow get us to do certain things that deep down we think are good and want to be able to do but usually can’t get ourselves to do on our own.”*

Leadership is influence. Nothing more. Nothing less. It’s the ability to accomplish great things through others.

As leaders, our performance is measured — or at least *should* be measured — based on these results. No matter how inspiring or influential we believe ourselves to be, until it translates into actual results in the real world, it’s not leadership. Just good intentions.

Yet people aren’t always eager to play along. Whether it’s my employees, kids, players, coworkers, bosses, suppliers, or that guy driving slowly in front of me, the world is filled with people who are unwilling to turn my genius directions into action.

So what do you do when people just don’t do what they’re supposed to do?

### Seek First to Understand
> # “Leadership is practiced not so much in words as in attitude and in actions.”* — Harold S. Geneen*

It’s tempting to blame everyone else. After all, they’re the ones who can’t follow simple directions.

But when you recognize that the purpose of leadership is to influence people’s behavior, you realize that blaming people for poor performance is unproductive. They’re simply performing in accordance with the environment and expectations that are set for them.

The role of leaders is not to find fault or place blame, but to understand why people are performing as they are. And then modify their leadership practices accordingly.

So when people don’t follow my leadership, instead of basking in self-pity, I should be asking what I did that caused the situation. Then it’s actionable.

And throughout my years in management, I’ve found that (1) it’s usually my fault. And (2), it typically comes down to one of four areas: Direction, Competence, Opportunity, or Motivation. Or as I remember it — DCOM.

### D — Direction
> # “The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.”* — George Bernard Shaw*

How many times have you asked someone to do something, only for their final product to be wildly different than what you envisioned?

We like to believe that our instructions are clear and easy to follow, but in actuality, the message we think we convey, and the one we actually do, are often at odds. We explain things as they make sense to us. Without realizing the listener doesn’t have our full context and background.

As a result, poor performance can often be attributed to simple misunderstandings. People simply don’t understand the full scope of our expectations. Often because we failed to clarify them.

Instead of simply looking to make your point and move on, borrow Chris Voss’s suggestion for hostage negotiations and stop aiming for a simple agreement. As he wrote in [*Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended-ebook/dp/B014DUR7L2)*,
> # “In hostage negotiations, we never tried to get to ‘yes’ as an endpoint. We knew that ‘yes’ is nothing without ‘how.’ And when we applied hostage negotiating tactics to business, we saw how ‘that’s right’ often leads to the best outcomes.”

So slow down the conversation. Ask follow up questions on what next steps they’re considering. Have them give you a plan for how they’ll implement things going forward.

Mainly, share responsibility for the details with whoever who will be responsible to implement them. Make it a conversation instead of a lecture. Because returning to Chris Voss’s experience,
> # “People always make more effort to implement a solution when they think it’s theirs. That is simply human nature.”

### C — Competence
> # “Challenge is the pathway to engagement and progress in our lives. But not all challenges are created equal. Some challenges make us feel alive, engaged, connected, and fulfilled. Others simply overwhelm us. Knowing the difference as you set bigger and bolder challenges for yourself is critical to your sanity, success, and satisfaction.”* — Brendon Burchard*

Have you ever had the feeling that you were so far in over your head that you didn’t even know where to start? That you just didn’t know enough to come through with a successful outcome?

Stretch assignments and new challenges are good. But when we ask people to do things well outside their [circle of competence](https://fs.blog/2013/12/mental-model-circle-of-competence/), the result is demotivating for everyone involved. People just won’t be set up to succeed.

Taken literally, competence is knowing what has to be done, knowing the standards that define success, and having the skills to actually do the work. If we’re asking people to succeed despite not having these abilities, we’re setting them — and ourselves — up for disappointment.

[Peter Drucker wrote](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials-ebook/dp/B01F1WZGNC/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) that employees *“do not come in the proper size and shape for the tasks that have to be done in organization — and they cannot be machined down or recast for these tasks. People are always ‘almost fits’ at best.”*

It’s the job of the leader to balance the competencies available to them against the requirements of the job. And while asking too little of people breeds disengagement through complacency, asking too much breeds a similar apathy through resentment.

Instead, leaders need to understand the capabilities available to them. Not from the perspective of what they can do. But based on what they *should* be able to do. And then design the job to meet this expectation. As Drucker described,
> # “The effective executive therefore first makes sure that the job is well designed. And if experience tells him otherwise, he does not hunt for genius to do the impossible. He redesigns the job. He knows that the test of organization is not genius. It is its capacity to make common people achieve uncommon performance.”

Are your peoples’ jobs designed to fall within their competence? If not, who’s to blame if they don’t perform to your expectations?

### O — Opportunity
> # “Effective knowledge workers, in my observation, do not start with their tasks. They start with their time.” — *Peter Drucker, [*The Effective Executive](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials-ebook/dp/B01F1WZGNC/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

In addition to needing the competence to succeed, people also need the opportunity. Assigning a job without making sure people have sufficient time and resources to succeed is setting them — and ultimately us all — up for failure.

We’re all familiar with the frustration that comes from having too much to do in too little time. That feeling as though no matter how much we do, we’ll never get everything done. And with it comes the need to sacrifice something.

It’s a path that leads to frustration and ultimately disengagement. It’s the poor leader who continues to increase responsibility beyond someone’s limits, waiting for them to break. [As Ed Catmull realized](https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration-ebook/dp/B00FUZQYBO/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) after pushing his people too hard in the development of *Toy Story 2*,
> # “On any film, there are inevitable periods of extreme crunch and stress, some of which can be healthy if they don’t go on too long. But the ambitions of both managers and their teams can exacerbate each other and become unhealthy. It is a leader’s responsibility to see this, and guide it, not exploit it.”

It’s easy to continue to pile more work on people. Just as it’s easy to say that everything’s equally important. Any company that simultaneously advertises best quality, fastest delivery, and cheapest price shouldn’t be trusted in any of those areas.

Instead, good leaders help people set priorities. They understand the resources available and make sure people have access to the ones they need.

To ignore this constraint is to merely delay a much bigger issue.

### M — Motivation
> # “People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Well, neither does bathing — that’s why we recommend it daily.”* — Zig Ziglar*

One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned in management is that we can’t really motivate other people. Not really. True motivation needs to be intrinsic. It needs to come from within. The best we can do is create an environment where people are set up to motivate and empower themselves.

So what’s this environment look like? I don’t know. It’s different for everyone.

What motivates us doesn’t motivate everyone else. To assume there’s a one-size fits all solution is to say that everyone shares the same values and perspectives.

But just because motivation is individualized doesn’t make it mysterious. Talk with someone for fifteen minutes about their interests and you can see what drives them. Get to know people. Understand their values and priorities. Make that connection.

Most companies hold exit interviews when someone’s leaving. Why wait until then? Why not hold periodic “stay interviews” to better understand what people need out of their jobs. Whatever the format, make time to connect with people. After that, the environment that motivates them — the one that helps them find meaning in the work that they do — will become more evident. In the [words of psychologist Barry Schwartz](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Work-TED-Books-ebook/dp/B00NZWJE3O/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=),
> # “If we design workplaces that permit people to find meaning in their work, we will be designing a human nature that values work.”

### Bring Out the Best in Your People
> # “I don’t think I was a fine game coach. I’m trying to be honest. I think I was a good practice coach.” — John Wooden

John Wooden was a tremendous coach. In his forty years coaching, he had one losing season — his first. He led his UCLA teams to four undefeated seasons and ten NCAA championships. And his career offers no shortage of leadership lessons.

But my favorite is that he never scouted the opposition. Instead, he put all of his focus on getting his own players to reach their potential. He connected with all of his players. He understood what each player needed and focused on those areas in every practice and personal interaction.

John Wooden made sure that each person had everything they needed to perform at the top of their ability. He didn’t guarantee success. But he gave people the best opportunity for success. And his record speaks for itself.

The mark of any leader is in our ability to bring the best results out of the people around us. So next time someone fails to live up to your expectations, take a minute to see where you could have better set them up for success. Remember DCOM.
> # *Direction — Do people understand the expectations?*
> # *Competence — Do they have the skills and knowledge to perform?*
> # *Opportunity — Do they have the time and resources necessary to succeed?*
> # *Motivation — Have you created an environment that helps people find meaning in their work?*

Until we can reliably say that we’ve addressed each of these areas, we haven’t set people up to reach their potential. And if we’re not helping people reach their potential, they don’t have much reason to follow us.

As the old leadership proverb goes, *“He who thinks he leads, but has no followers, is only taking a walk.”*

*Thanks, as always, for reading. If you enjoyed this or have any suggestions, please let me know your thoughts. I’d love to hear from you. And if you found this helpful, I’d appreciate if you could clap it up*👏 *and help me share with more people. Cheers!*

# Want to Grow on Social Media? Then Stop Worrying About Which Platform You’re Growing On

## Want to Grow on Social Media? Then Stop Worrying About Which Platform You’re Growing On
> # With one simple mindset shift, you’ll set yourself up for social media and content marketing success no matter what the landscape throws at you.

As an entrepreneur, building up an audience on social media has a handful of great benefits. Between building brand awareness, gaining credibility as a thought leader, potential book deals, speaking engagements and consulting gigs alone are enough to justify the effort needed to create content online.

Because the benefits of becoming an influencer and thought leader are so profound, questions like “How do I gain a large Instagram following?” or “How do I get more reads on Medium?” both from my own clients and entrepreneurs across the web. Yet, when it comes to social media and content marketing, I believe this platform-specific are fundamentally flawed.

While there certainly *are *specific tactics you can apply to gain an audience on a particular platform, the real way to ensure you gain traction and stay relevant for years to come is by applying a simple mindset shift: focus on the craft, not the social media platform.
> # **Focus on the craft, not the platform.**

Instead of asking how to get big on YouTube, ask yourself how to become a more skilled video editor and more comfortable on camera. The reasoning here is simple: social media platforms come and go with no forewarning. Remember Myspace? How about Vine?

As useful and incredible these social media platforms have become in marketing, building a business entirely on their backs is a dangerous game. Investing your whole brand, pouring your entire professional identity into a single social media platform is like building your house on rented land.

This is exactly why I always tell clients, readers and anyone else who wants to listen to me rant for a minute or two that the best way to ensure you’ll gain an audience and be timeless across social media and the online landscape for years to come is developing a creative skill set that will not die like a platform can.
> # **Social media platforms should be the medium you use to express your creative skill, not your final product or offering.**

Want to gain a following on Instagram? Start by becoming a better photographer. Want to become a top writer on Medium? Start by sharpening your skills as a writer and storyteller. Want to gain a following on Facebook? Start by…well, no skill is really needed there, only money, but you get my point here.

Here’s how to get started.

## 1. Learn the skill.

![](1*5kdLDO0h5EQwSDqMhHXqwg.jpeg)

First things first, if you want to gain a social media following, you’ve got to create great content. To create great content, you have to have a skill. This could be writing, graphic design, video editing or something else. Once you have your skill figured out, use a platform like Lynda, Skillshare or Creative Live to take your know-how to the next level.


## 2. Look for opportunities to put that skill on full display.

Here’s where the strategy comes in. It’s not enough to be great at a creative skill set, you also have to be strategic as to which platforms you invest your time and energy into. By keeping a close eye on the social media landscape by reading blogs like *Social Media Examiner* and *Social Media Today*, you’ll be able to keep an eye out for opportunities in the marketplace.

For instance, when I started writing online, I began publishing my articles on LinkedIn. Even though I’d like to think the content was terrific, I got to the platform when it was already saturated, making it difficult to break through the noise. This is when I began searching around and stumbled across Medium, an up-and-coming blogging platform. I began publishing on it when it was still relatively new and grew an audience as a result.

This doesn’t mean growing an audience on a saturated platform is impossible, but it does mean it will take more work and time to do so. Look around for opportunities to get the maximum number of eyeballs on your creative skill. For photographers, platforms like Unsplash and Pexels present terrific opportunities to showcase your work and gain a large following. For writers, Steemit is an opportunity worth looking into. For video creators, LinkedIn video is just waiting hungrily for creative content to go viral.\

## 3. Build an email list.

As I mentioned, building your house on rented land by investing heavily into a specific platform is risky. To ensure you’ll survive no matter what happens to your favorite platform, always build up your email list by pointing your social media followers in its direction. Emails are a whole lot less likely to change than a person’s social media profile, so invest in constructing a healthy email newsletter.

Developing a creative skill, whether that’s photography or writing, is the surefire way to stay relevant for years to come no matter which social media platforms die or change their algorithms. By making this simple mindset shift, you’ll position yourself to reap all the benefits of social media and content marketing for years to come. Best of luck.

# 4 Psychology-Based Tips To Navigate Client Personalities, From Aggressive To Soft-Spoken

## 4 Psychology-Based Tips To Navigate Client Personalities, From Aggressive To Soft-Spoken

### All four have helped me through some tricky situations.

***By [Sami Rusani](https://twitter.com/SamRusani), CRO of ShipChain***

Managing client personalities is a case-by-case business.

If you work with people long enough, you’ll probably run into the aggressive, angry type who loves to yell and get under your skin. You’ll also probably find yourself in a room with someone who’s incredibly passive and [indecisive](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/decision-makers-hiring-an-agile-coach/). And you’ll definitely meet people who fall somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.

The truth is, there’s no silver bullet for handling any of these client personalities because everyone’s different.

Sometimes the person yelling just needs to vent — and you have to figure out the right things to say to help calm them down. Other times, you may need to be firm and simply tell them, “I’m not going to tolerate this. Unless we can speak like adults, I’m leaving.”

Luckily, you can follow basic psychology principles to help you understand who you’re dealing with and how to manage different situations. If you know the general rules and apply them to your interactions with clients, you’ll save yourself a ton of headaches.
> # These are the four tips that have helped me through numerous tricky situations:

## 1: Be a chameleon.

You probably already do this without even realizing it.

[The “chameleon effect”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10402679) is a well-documented behavior in which people unconsciously mimic the mannerisms, posture, or tone of the person they’re speaking to. We do it because when we mimic someone else, it actually makes our interactions smoother. The other person feels more comfortable with us without knowing exactly why.

You can also use this technique consciously. Since you never know what a person is going to be like when you first meet them, it’s important to understand how to adjust if he or she turns out to be more aggressive or passive than you were expecting.

Obviously, you can take this [too far](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/12/science/social-chameleon-may-pay-emotional-price.html). It’s not really about crossing your legs the moment you see them cross theirs. It’s about reading their personality and current mood — and then adjusting your own behavior to help the conversation flow.

## 2: Listen and wait.

You’re may be wondering how you’re supposed to know what adjustments to make in the first place. The answer is simple: [active listening](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10904018.2013.813234) and observation.

Most people will say, “Yeah, I’m a [good listener](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/how-to-become-a-better-listener-first-stop-doing-these-3-things/),” but there’s a very real difference between just hearing someone and actively listening to them. When you’re really keyed in on what they’re saying and *how* they’re saying it, you’ll know whether you need to change your own behavior in some way.

* Watch your client’s body language and facial expressions.

* Listen to their tonality. Are they stressed, calm, rushed?

* Take the clues they’re giving you and use them to navigate any potential hangups or opportunities in the conversation.

Management legend Peter Drucker summed it up nicely when he said, “The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn’t said.”

## 3: Make others feel comfortable.

People need to feel relaxed around you. You don’t hang out with [someone you’re not comfortable with](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/01/affective-presence-how-you-make-other-people-feel/579643/), and you definitely don’t do business with that person, either.

Think of your interaction with a client like you would any other relationship. You can’t build a good rapport until you’re both at ease. If someone’s tense and wary, the conversation will reflect that.

An easy, quick way to help people feel comfortable is simply by finding a connection — something you have in common. Ask them about themselves. Do they have a dog? What kind of music do they like? Yesterday was beautiful, did they get outside and do anything? Oh, they played 18? You golf, too. Talk about it a little.

Once you make that connection, slowly but surely you can [build trust](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/20-things-only-real-leaders-do-and-it-earns-them-trust/) and help them feel at ease around you.

## 4: Visualize situations ahead of time.

Among athletes, visualizing an action [or goal](https://medium.com/@SamRusani/why-goal-setting-is-the-difference-between-success-and-failure-in-life-and-business-fe4bd5b5c57c?source=---------10------------------) ahead of time is [a well-known technique](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14998709) for improving performance.

While you can use visualization in multiple areas of your life, it can actually be just as helpful when it comes to managing client personalities.

Over the years I’ve been in plenty of situations where someone has said or done something, and I’ve had no idea how to react. Maybe they were overly aggressive, or I wasn’t ready for them to poke me the way they did. Whatever the case, afterward, I knew I didn’t handle it well.

So, I started using [visualization](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/this-1-powerful-tool-improves-your-mental-game/). I’d sit down, imagine that situation happening again, and visualize myself handling it confidently. Now, when a tricky situation arises, it’s no problem because I’ve already been through it a thousand times in my head.

Navigating the nuances of client personalities doesn’t come with step-by-step directions. But if you visualize yourself listening, adjusting to the situation, and putting people at ease, I guarantee you’ll have an easier time handling all types of people when an interaction gets unsteady.

# Learn How the Best Pitches Are a Blend of Both Art and Science

## Learn How the Best Pitches Are a Blend of Both Art and Science

### These five tips will help move your audience.

Presenting is both art and a science. Discovering ways to communicate what is compelling about your or your business is something to experiment with, tirelessly practice, and continually refine. Your mission to move your audience is attained by engaging them, putting them at ease, and making them feel like partners.

With these five simple hacks, you’ll be well on your way to nailing that next presentation.

## Orientate

![](1*DG4Yrf2JKWQHfoYk9sFfQA.png)

What does your listener truly care about? If you don’t know this — you’re doomed. When pitching to a client, think about how they will benefit from working with you and then propose to give them what they really want. Get well crafty in researching your audience. Ideally, you want to know them better than they know themselves.

It’s also helpful to have your listeners synch to your tempo. Do this simply by telling them what you’re going to tell them — and after you do — hammer it home with a concise summary.

## Emotion

![](1*_K_HlvrH9WU-PX4EbPVIxQ.png)

Tell a story.** **Make it purposeful and make it personal. Consider structuring your presentation so that a story comes early on. It helps to grab the listener’s attention and allows you to display emotion to set the tone. Stories have souls too — they help bring your facts to life and help your audience empathise with you. Remember, curious people love to learn — you’ll have served them well by sharing a powerful narrative.

## Clarity

![](1*cNFW1LgjgdCMis4fykTq_g.png)

[Debbie Madden](https://www.inc.com/debbie-madden/2-easy-hacks-to-vastly-improve-your-presentations.html) makes the case for clarity crystal clear: ask your audience to read or listen — not both. “The human brain physically cannot read and listen at the same time. In fact, the brain is terrible at multitasking. We have to choose one activity to focus on,” she explains.
> # Do yourself and your audience a favour — don’t make them tap their head and rub their belly at the same time. Clarity always wins.

## Timing

It’s important to ask yourself if you’re timing is right. In other words, is it the most optimum time to be presenting? If it’s a set date for a conference you don’t have much choice in the matter. But if it’s a client pitch or one in which you have some control over the date and time, this is where science works in your favour.

![](1*uVqF2-BUsgyxhW7FR59Tnw.jpeg)

Research demonstrates that judges’ rulings are harsher when they’re hungrier. Accordingly, you’ll want to appear in front of your audience when they’re bellies are full from breakfast or lunch. They will be more open and gracious at these times. Considering that Mondays and Fridays are typically no-goes, there are a few optimum slots for you to strut your stuff.

## Practice

Don’t take my word for it.[ The most epic Ted Talks](http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight) see speakers practicing their presentations in excess of 200 times. The other benefit of practicing is that it’s one of the only proven methods of alleviating fear. Indeed, public speaking is rated as the thing [humans fear most in the world](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-real-story-risk/201211/the-thing-we-fear-more-death) — that’s more than spiders (3rd place) and even higher than death (7th place). In the end, practice really does make perfect.

Wrap up all of these hacks together with a compelling invitation and what do you get? A sure-fire way to stimulate and move your audience to join you on the journey.

# The Benefits of Unplugging. And Choosing to be Present.

## Lessons learned from two weeks without my phone.

![Photo by [Kalen Emsley](https://unsplash.com/photos/kGSapVfg8Kw?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/free?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](0*boRdm2exGZovI1EL.jpg)*Photo by [Kalen Emsley](https://unsplash.com/photos/kGSapVfg8Kw?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/free?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

*“We get such a kick out of looking forward to pleasures and rushing ahead to meet them that we can’t slow down enough to enjoy them when they come,”* Alan Watts wrote in his eye-opening 1970 anthology [*Does It Matter?](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042FZX4W/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)* He would go on to label us as* “a civilization which suffers from chronic disappointment — a formidable swarm of spoiled children smashing their toys.”*

This thinking recently led me to unplug for the past two weeks. No work emails, texts, or calls. I stopped writing articles, researching ideas, and filling Evernote with random thoughts. In short, I put away my phone and resolved to avoid all distractions for the duration of my family’s vacation.

I wish I could say this was part of a grand plan. That I had the foresight to recognize this benefit in advance. Yet — as is often the case in my life — my actions came about not through my own planning but through the wishes of my son and daughter. And their incredible ability to manipulate my behavior.

### Divided Attention Means No Attention

*“Dad…Dad…are you there Dad?”*

*“Did you see that Dad? Dad? Hello Dad?*

*“Dad, you’re not watching…You’re not listening…Are you too busy for us Dad?”*

It was the first day of our vacation. And it seemed as though I’d spent more time on my phone than with my family.

My wife was not pleased. My kids even less so. And I was left torn between wanting my family to be happy and wanting to keep things running smoothly at the office.

Which, in retrospect, isn’t much of a decision at all. Especially when you’re sequestered with three family members that are all very willing to let you know their thoughts on the topic.

So I called into work. Told them that I’d be unavailable for the next two weeks. I said I trusted their judgments and their abilities. And if anything came up, they should handle it as they saw fit.

And then I put my phone away, resolving to use it only for reading books (and some select Medium articles). One seemingly small decision that returned a whole host of unexpected benefits.

### Avoid a Lifetime of Regret
> # “To know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old age.”* — Robert Louis Stevenson*

After working for many years in palliative care, Hospice nurse Bronnie Ware documented some of the [main regrets of her dying patients](https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/). One common to every male patient was* “I wish I hadn’t worked so hard.” *In Ware’s words,
> # “They missed their children’s youth and their partner’s companionship…All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.”

With the benefit of hindsight, it becomes much easier to recognize whether our actions aligned with our priorities. And whether we spent our time doing things we truly value.

In another example of age-induced wisdom, Laura Carstensen investigated the relative happiness of different age groups. She found that on average, happiness tends to increase with age. As she tells us in [her TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/laura_carstensen_older_people_are_happier),
> # “When we recognize that we don’t have all the time in the world, we see our priorities most clearly; we take less notice of trivial matters; we savor our life; we’re more appreciative; we’re open to reconciliation; we invest in more emotionally important parts of life, and life gets better.”

With both Ware and Carstensen’s findings, more life experience helps us recognize and focus on the things that truly matter. Helping us to make the most of the positive experiences, while limiting the negative ones. Taking the time to limit my distractions and focus on the present pushed me into this mentality. It helped me to recognize the value of each moment and appreciate it, as opposed to constantly looking towards some future point.

Are you spending your time in a way that you won’t regret it later? It seems obvious as I write it. Yet if that’s true — why do we all insist on learning these lessons for ourselves?

### Demonstrate Leadership Value
> # “One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is terribly important.” *— Bertrand Russell*

One of the biggest barriers to disconnecting from work is in how we value our contribution. If we’re gone for a week and the team’s performance declines, we consider it a sign of our own importance. Not as a failure to effectively train backups.

We’re quick to praise someone for their necessity. We encourage people to develop specialized knowledge and become “indispensable” to the organization.

But this also encourages people to hoard their knowledge and inhibits collaboration. It rewards the individual at the expense of the organization. And reinforces the need for everyone to be constantly available.

Yes, we should reward specialization. But we should also recognize the efforts to share and spread that knowledge. Instead of individual heroics, we should recognize those that develop others and elevate the collective capacity of the organization. Because while the contributions of a top performer will always be important, it’s the employee that develops others who is truly indispensable.

As leaders, our success should be measured in how well others can succeed in our absence. In how well we’ve prepared others for their own success. Disconnecting helped show both sides of this equation. And highlighted further areas where I need to strengthen my team.

Have you trained your team well enough that they can succeed without you? Or do you need to stay involved because you haven’t effectively prepared them?

### Become (Even More) Brilliant
> # “Once you start daydreaming and allow your mind to really wander, you start thinking a little bit beyond the conscious, a little bit into the subconscious, which allows sort of different connections to take place.” *— Dr. Sandi Mann, Boredom Researcher*

Blaise Pascal blamed all of humanity’s problems on our* “inability to sit quietly in a room alone.”* And podcaster Manoush Zomorodi showed that this same practice is linked to our most creative ideas.

She launched an initiative called [*Bored and Brilliant](http://www.manoushz.com/book/)*, encouraging us all to put down our phones and let our minds wander, free from constant distractions.

For everyone else who finds themselves pulling out their phone when they have a free fifteen seconds, this was eye-opening. It seemed as if every free moment, I’d reach into my pocket looking for a convenient distraction. And sacrifice any opportunity for deep reflection. In the words of Dr. Daniel Levitin,
> # “Every time you shift your attention from one thing to another, the brain has to engage a neurochemical switch that uses up nutrients in the brain to accomplish that. So if you’re attempting to multitask, you know, doing four or five things at once,you’re not actually doing four or five things at once, because the brain doesn’t work that way. Instead, you’re rapidly shifting from one thing to the next, depleting neural resources as you go.”

By keeping my phone out of reach, it was like lifting a burden from my ability to think. No longer held captive by a screen, I was better able to be fully present both within my own mind and with the surrounding world. A key to developing new ideas and opening up to new experiences. As [Manoush told Guy Raz on the TED Radio Hour](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=614063234),
> # “We’ve lost the capacity in many ways, I think, for patience. If we want to have excellent ideas, the best ideas, we need to let them take the time to take root and then blossom, and that does not happen in a tap of an app.”

Whether you’re on a vacation or just have a few minutes to spare, try keeping your phone where it is and just being present within your own mind. Like [Galileo inventing modern timekeeping after watching a pendulum swing in a cathedral](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/20/how-we-got-to-know-steven-johnson-hummingbird-effect-time/), letting your mind wander beyond the conscious can open up all sorts of new ideas.

### Recognize Your Priorities
> # “When I am feeling unfocused, the first question I ask myself is, ‘Am I rehearsing my best self?’ And if the answer is no, I ask myself how I can reset.” — Adam Robinson, [Tribe of Mentors](https://www.amazon.com/Tribe-Mentors-Short-Advice-World-ebook/dp/B071KJ7PTB/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

Whether it’s a two week vacation, an afternoon at the park, or just a nightly dinner with those close to us, we deserve to be fully present in these moments.

It’s easy to make this decision once, but if we expect to sustain it over the long-term, we need to actively define our priorities.

Who — Who takes priority in your life? Your family, your friends, your coworkers? How are you giving each one the time that they deserve in your life?

When — What time boundaries do you want to set up to prevent one priority from creeping across the others?

What — Do you prioritize those areas where you’ll make a unique contribution? Or perform at the best version of yourself?

Taking the time to prioritize how we spend our attention gives a criteria for future decisions. Each potential distraction simplifies to the question — is this aligned with my priorities? After that, decisions on how we spend our time become much more clear.

### Choose Presence over Productivity
> # “You are 99 years old, you are on your deathbed, and you have a chance to come back to right now: what would you do?” — Jerome Jarre, [Tribe of Mentors](https://www.amazon.com/Tribe-Mentors-Short-Advice-World-ebook/dp/B071KJ7PTB/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

In a world that equates busy with important and considers leisure to be the realm of the self-indulgent slacker, it’s not surprising that people feel pushed into a never-ending workday. Or rationalize staying connected throughout a vacation and allowing our work to linger through all hours of the night.

Our ego’s there to tell us that we can balance everything. It’s ready to say that we can get all of the benefits with none of the trade-offs.

We all have different priorities. Just as we all have different aspirations and goals in life. So while there’s no one answer as to how you choose to spend your time, it’s important that you do choose it.

Recognize what’s important to you. Make the choice. Live your life. And be present in whatever you do.

After all, in the[ advice of Bertrand Russel](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/02/21/education-and-the-good-life-bertrand-russell/), *“What will be the good of the conquest of leisure and health, if no one remembers how to use them?”*

*Thanks, as always, for reading. If you enjoyed this or have any suggestions, please let me know your thoughts. I’d love to hear from you. And if you found this helpful, I’d appreciate if you could clap it up*👏 *and help me share with more people. Cheers!*

# 4 Lessons Founders Can Learn From Fantasy Authors

## 

I have, for some time now, been obsessed with the work of Patrick Rothfuss.

No, he’s not an entrepreneur, engineer, or venture capitalist versed in the language of the startup world.
> **He’s the *New York Times *bestselling author of the fantasy series, *The Kingkiller Chronicle.***

This might seem strange to some — fantasy authors and startup founders operate in different worlds — but I believe there is plenty founders can learn from the work of fiction writers. The skills, habits, and values that make fantasy authors successful translate directly to success in our field.

Here’s why.

## **Patience is a virtue.**

For most writers, conjuring, crafting, editing, and publishing a novel takes *years*. To complete *The Name of the Wind, [*it took Rothfuss 15](https://www.tor.com/2016/08/15/patrick-rothfuss-name-of-the-wind-writing-process/).

In an interview [penned by Wired](https://www.wired.com/2016/08/wired-book-club-patrick-rothfuss-interview/), Rothfuss explained why his writing journey was so arduous.

“Most of the time that a regular human being would spend watching television, I spent reading or writing. It would not be weird for me to spend 10 hours a day writing over the summer.”

He also described writing multiple drafts of his epic story, iterating and improving each one with painstaking deliberation and analysis.
> # All in all, his is a process that demands an almost superhuman amount of diligence and patience.

That might strike some as hyperbolic, but it’s what creating any kind of great book requires. While the seed of an idea might hit at once, slowly animating a new, cohesive world that stands up under scrutiny *and *entertains with a well-told story doesn’t happen overnight.

The same is true of building a successful, potentially timeless company.

Maybe the idea for your MVP bloomed in a matter of minutes, but as any founder knows, the journey from that moment to the ultimate actualization of a successful company — one that creates products which solve problems for a cadre of loyal customers — takes exponentially longer. The process, simply put, cannot be expedited.

## **Quality is paramount.**

Whether you’re writing a novel or building a company, the quality of that final product will depend on, yes, patience, but also on the creator’s commitment to producing something great.

In the case of the novelist, what matters is not how many books you’re able to write — nor how quickly you write them — but how impactful the ones you *do* write prove in the lives of your readers. How deeply your characters resonate, how stubbornly the scenes you paint linger in the mind. It’s that impact which builds communities of loyal fans who clamor for your next work. It’s also what helps your book stand up against the test of time.
> This is true of the products, updates, tools, and services you release as the leader of a startup, too.

What separates successful founders from those who fold is an undying commitment to creating genuinely valuable things. The money that follows — like the movie rights that Rothfuss [recently signed over to Lionsgate](https://deadline.com/2017/10/lin-manuel-miranda-executive-produce-the-kingkiller-chronicle-adaptation-showtime-lionsgate-1202195413/) — is a result of that commitment.

Greatness is a product of genuine ambition. Prestige cannot be the primary inspiration.

## **Quality requires a lot of lonely work behind the scenes.**

Here’s the kicker, though: whether you’re a novelist or a founder, you need an appreciation for patience and authentic ambition. But that doesn’t mean jack if you’re not willing to put in the grueling work writing books and building companies entails.

In fact, both endeavors require immense amounts of time spent sitting alone in silence, gnawing on your knuckles. Both processes amount to a kind of mental alchemy: you’re turning something incorporeal into something tangible. That requires, too, neglecting other important aspects of your life, and embracing more generally the loneliness of solitude.
> # If you’re not prepared to face all that, you won’t *ever *finish your novel or build your company — at least not well.

On the flip side, though, if you embrace solitude and commit to the isolated struggle, your work will flourish. In fact, you’ll succeed more generally: there’s a direct and proven correlation between the number of hours you spend working alone and [the amount of success you ultimately achieve](https://www.success.com/the-advantages-of-solitude/).

## **You need a set of core values to rely on and revert back to in times of doubt.**

Because writing novels and building companies is difficult, lonely work — and because patience is at times challenging to maintain — both writers and founders *must *have a set of core values they can lean on in times of struggle.

You also need a kind of foundational mission statement which you can refer to regularly. For Rothfuss, this means remembering what he’s trying to accomplish, which is creating a new world with his next novel — he has little value to gain from distracting himself by writing a cookbook.
> # For startup founders, this means establishing and remembering your core value proposition.

In the case of my company — [BAMF Media](https://bamf.media/), a growth marketing consulting agency — we work to ensure that every new service we provide is a natural extension of the value we provide at our core. It does us no good to get distracted building things that don’t further our essential mission.

In reality, this imperative doubles as our North Star — similar to how Rothfuss’s chief goals guided him through his long and challenging 15-year journey to his first publication.

## **Ultimately, founders and fantasy authors are not *entirely *the same.**

Founders, for example, can update their products, messaging, or services after they release them. Authors, on the other hand, can’t rewrite their books after they’re published.

But it remains true that the traits, values, habits, and appreciations which prove essential ingredients for writing a great book are *equally *essential for building a successful company.

In this sense, founders and fantasy authors really are playing the same game. The worlds we work in are, in fact, not that different.

We’re just creating different kinds of magic.

# Creating your own mastermind group? Nine thing to know before you start.

## Creating your own mastermind group? Nine thing to know before you start.

Want to start your own mastermind or accountability group? I’ve been a part of mastermind groups for years, and I’ve led them professionally for groups of like-minded leaders to help them level up in their leadership and work. Previously I wrote about what masterminds are and why they’re so important for taking your business to the next level. In this article, I want to dig into more detail around the nuts and bolts of creating your own mastermind group: how to start one, what to consider, and what traps to avoid.

Here are ten steps for creating and leading a mastermind, what to plan ahead for, and what to avoid.

## 1: First, decide how big you want your mastermind to be.

I host mini-masterminds with fellow entrepreneurs in groups of two, which I call “staff meetings” for young entrepreneurs. I’ve also hosted groups of 5 to 8 people in larger sessions following a more formal process. When it gets bigger than 8 people, I typically break us out into smaller sub-groups so that everyone has enough time to share their puzzles and journeys with the group. For the sake of this article, I’m going to focus on a group sweet size of 5–6 people, because it’s a size I highly recommend. More than 8 people, and scheduling becomes a nightmare; fewer than 4 people, and you don’t have enough people in the room to get at your puzzle or project with enough perspectives.

## 2: Create an intention and a goal.

The mastermind will serve a purpose; get clear on what it is. Is it to help grow, develop, and shape each other? To hold people accountable to hitting goals? To provide a space for smart feedback? For my masterminds, I often set a goal of honest, kind feedback for people to grow in community with each other. We meet for several months, at minimum, and we each do a deep dive into a puzzle or problem that we’re working on.

## 3: Invite the right people.

Make sure you have shared interests and you’re in a group of people at roughly the same growth area. It helps if you’re all looking at similar projects or businesses. For example, you might all be a product-based business, or perhaps you’re all leading companies. You might all be new parents or women in predominantly male-based fields. Decide on the criteria for the group and what you want the shared interests to be.

It’s important to develop a criteria for the group so that you’re able to speak at a higher level of expertise about a particular topic. You don’t want everyone to look absolutely identical, but generally speaking, having a shared baseline is important.

## 4: Write a call for requests.

Write out a description of the type of person you’re looking for. Also know what kind of people you don’t want in your group. For example, you might be a consultant who is regularly making low six-figure business income, and you want to scale up to high-six figures or hit the seven-figure mark. It might not make sense to invite someone who is a brand-new entrepreneur or works in a corporate job, for instance. Their expertise will be elsewhere.

It’s critical to get the right people in the room, because they’re going to be giving you feedback on your most important projects and ideas. This is a further reason to create a solid group of people whose feedback you seek out. In fact, unsolicited feedback at the wrong time can really sink a project or make you question something when it’s not the right time to be questioning. Call it a mastermind group, a personal advisory board, or a set of trusted friendships — developing a circle of thoughtful leaders around you is key to accelerating your personal and professional growth.

Write out a “job description” for the type of people you’re looking for, and circle it with the kind of people you’d like to join, and begin inviting folks to chat with you about what a mastermind could look like.

## 5: Set a start date and an end date.

Many peer-led groups fizzle out because there’s no clear end date. I find at least 6 months is good, and doing a series for 12 months (and then stopping) works well. Be clear about both the start date and the end date.

## 6: Commit to a regular, recurring frequency.

I find a lot of success with meeting every other week. Every week can be hard to schedule into an already-full calendar. Alternatively, once a month can be a good rhythm for longer-running masterminds. To save scheduling headache, try to pick a recurring time rather than a new time every month.

## 7: Decide on the technology and structure in advance.

How will you meet? Decide it it’s phone calls, video calls, or what, and stick to it. I have a Zoom account I use and I set up a recurring calendar invitation with a link to the room for everyone to join.

For the structure, we use “Rose, Bud, Thorn” and give everyone 15 minutes to chat about their progress or a specific puzzle they want to work through. A ‘rose’ is something that’s going really well, a ‘bud’ is something on the horizon, and a ‘thorn’ is something that’s not working well.

## 8: Require attendance at a high level.

Masterminds often fail when people don’t show up or repeatedly miss meetings. For this reason, many groups have an attendance policy: miss more than 2 meetings, or attend fewer than 80% of the meetings, and you’re automatically out. It’s strict, but worth it. It shows that you’re taking the work seriously, and you’re taking yourself seriously.

Organizing, managing, and leading a group is an investment — but it can payoff well. Know that the person organizing it is doing a lot of work — but it’s worth it. Facilitating and managing the organization of any group is a fair amount of work. Know that if you’re starting the group, you’ll probably put in a lot more energy and time corralling and organizing everyone (as well as the design of the process), and that the benefit will be worth it.

## 9: Allow it to iterate.

It might take a few rounds to really get into a rhythm. People may come and go — I’ve started with a group of four, built to six, and then had one person take leave for personal reasons. It can ebb and flow until the right mix comes along. You’ll know within a few months if it’s working, and if it’s not, scrap it and try again.

## And if it doesn’t work, consider a paid mastermind group.

Many people realize that paid masterminds offer value beyond what they can construct themselves. The network effect of tapping into a group that’s already well-connected can have a huge rate of return: what’s the value of joining a group that introduces you to your next agent, client, or partnership? Your time and energy might be better spent paying someone else to organize it rather than trying to bring everyone together, depending on where you are in your life and business.

Erin Kelly, co-founder of Member Vault (a company she started pregnant on the road in a trailer with her partner) said that masterminds have been instrumental in her business, especially because she spent so much time on the road. “The biggest thing for me was participating in a paid Mastermind full of women that stretched me — I stayed connected throughout the week with them through Slack, and we have biweekly calls and in-person retreats. The connections I’ve made there directly have been huge and they have then rippled into their own networks. Having a place to show up, and be accountable with people you respect is crucial to avoid the PJs covered in crumbs downfall of working from home!”

If the price of a paid program is beyond you, however, especially in the early days of your startup, then use the tools in this article to build your own group with your elbow grease, your current network and a bit of grit.

The structure is all here for you to steal (like an artist). It’ll be worth it.

# What’s The Best Time of Day to Learn and Create?

## Here’s what the science says.

![Credit: [Moose Photos](https://www.pexels.com/@moose-photos-170195)](1*rl9LmxtfV54rrbMJsq0nyg.jpeg)*Credit: [Moose Photos](https://www.pexels.com/@moose-photos-170195)*

Producing high-quality work day after day is no small feat.

When you use your brain on perpetual overdrive, you’re bound to hit productivity slumps where it feels like you’re fresh out of new ideas.

While there’s no shortage of tricks and tips to hack your way to more innovative thinking, timing is everything, says sleep doctor Dr. Micheal Breus, author of [*The Power of When](http://amzn.to/2gEAG51)*. He believes working in sync with our body’s natural clock is the key to unlocking success to produce our best, most creative work.

The science of “good timing” — called chronobiology — reveals peak performance is hardwired into our DNA. “An inner clock embedded inside your brain has been ticking away, keeping perfect time, since you were a baby,” [writes](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4202872/The-best-times-argue-sleep-sex-fall-love.html) Breus, “This precisely engineered timekeeper is called your circadian pacemaker, or biological clock.”

So, the next time you’re feeling mentally sluggish, try tapping into chronobiology to perform at your best in these areas:

## The Best Time to Learn Something New

Learning is most effective when the brain is in acquisition mode, generally between 10:00 am to 2:00 p.m. and then again from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

Night owls beware: think twice before pulling an [all-nighter](https://melodywilding.com/6-tips-for-great-sleep/). The lowest learning valley occurs between 4:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.

## The Best Time To Make a Decision

The phrase “sleep on it” has persisted for a reason: we make worst decisions late at night and first thing in the morning. Your [cognitive powers](https://melodywilding.com/schedule-mental-maintenance-peak-performance/) are strongest once your brain has a chance to shake off [sleep inertia](https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/napping/page/0/2).

Save [important decisions ](https://melodywilding.com/the-perfectionists-guide-to-making-decisions-the-art-of-satisficing/)for when you feel most alert, generally within one to three hours after waking up.

## The Best Time To Brainstorm

Ironically, research has found that people are at their least creative when it’s demanded the most: at the heart of the workday, between 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

Breus suggests leaning into “moments of groggy greatness” when we’re slightly tired and [easily distracted](https://melodywilding.com/6-signs-obsession-productivity-hurting/). During these times, right and left brain communicate, which can trigger new and novel connections — and spark [innovative ideas](https://melodywilding.com/5-books-guaranteed-to-unlock-your-creative-genius/).

## The Best Time to Ask for Money

Friday afternoon. While this is the least productive day of the week, people are generally in a good mood. A positive outlook bodes well for asking for a raise or making a sale. Avoid Monday mornings — when people are the most stressed and grumpy — at all costs.

As new discoveries in chronobiology are proving, timing may not be everything, but it is extremely important if you want to create and perform [at your best](https://melodywilding.com/14-powerful-questions-for-a-happy-life-workbook-free-printable/) on a consistent basis.

Have you found you feel sharper or do better work at some times or days of the week versus others? What changes have you made to account for these dips and spikes?

# 9 Must-Read Books For Any Public Speaker

## 9 Must-Read Books For Any Public Speaker

### Read these books to bring your public speaking from mediocre to masterful.

***By [Richard Newman](https://twitter.com/RNewmanSpeaks), author, keynote speaker, speechwriter***

When I began my career as a [professional speaker](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/take-your-presentation-from-good-to-impressive-in-4-steps-2/) I wanted to increase my skills quickly, but I had very little resources, so I started reading. Within a few years, I read more than 200 books in the area of communication.

I read as a way to expand my learning, see the world from a different perspective, and to confirm different strategies in my field. I knew that if I only learned one new strategy from a book then it would be worthwhile.

I quickly realized that many of them contradicted each other. Some were based on theories that didn’t lead to positive results when I tried them at work.

Thankfully I found a few books that I love to recommend, due to their in-depth analysis on key subjects. The 9 [books](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/an-entrepreneurs-favorite-business-books/) included in this list are essential to enabling [speakers](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/5-questions-every-public-speaker-needs-to-ask-themselves/) (aspiring or active) in the three biggest areas of style, story, and state.
> # **Style — increase your presence and connection with others**

## **1. Peoplewatching by Desmond Morris**

I’ve read lighter, funnier books on non-verbal communication, but for me, the depth of Morris’ work is crucial. This guy is serious about fully understanding how human beings interact with each other — from an evolutionary understanding of how tribes have communicated to how we communicate in the modern day-to-day. Morris took his original book on human behavior, *Manwatching* (1978), and updated it entirely in 2002. Now it’s called *Peoplewatching*. Before body language was a popular thing to talk about, Morris conducted his own research in the area in addition to collating what others had done. If you want a definitive resource on non-verbal communication and you’re willing to dedicate some time to read it (it’s pretty hefty!) this one is for you.

## **2. Presence by Patsy Rodenburg**

One of the most striking theories in Rodenburg’s work is her ‘three circles of concentration’. She refers to this usually when discussing the ways we connect with our audiences. For example, how is it possible for an actor to connect with their fellow person on stage, but also 3,000 people in the audience? And this skill doesn’t just apply on-stage, it can improve your impact in an interview, a small meeting room, or a major company presentation.

To accomplish this, Rodenburg talks about ‘2nd Circle’ in *Presence* — where you’re fully connected with yourself (mind, body, and emotions) as well as the people around you. It feels like an authentic way of getting to a state where you feel present and other people feel that you’re present with them.
> # **Story — use the power of storytelling to bring your words to life**

## **3. Storynomics by Robert McKee**

McKee has trained writers who’ve won 60 Academy Awards and 200 Emmys, so it’s safe to say he thoroughly understands the story. Most recently, he’s applied his knowledge to the world of business. He wants his readers to understand that business storytelling strengthens your ideas, gives context to your numbers, and leaves your audience with a takeaway they won’t forget. This is a really popular topic in the business world, and I’m personally asked about it frequently. Everyone wants to know how to take brilliant storytelling methodology that’s worked for years and apply it to the business world — which is exactly what McKee does in *Storynomics*.

## **4. The Writer’s Journey by Christopher Vogler**

Vogler, who was involved in movies like *The Lion King*, summarized what’s called “the hero’s journey,” which a lot of people have heard about in storytelling. He took Joseph Campbell’s work and put it into a memo that was then distributed around Hollywood. In *The Writer’s Journey*, he expands on that memo to help people understand how storytelling really works. What are the principles around it and how could you use it yourself? It’s incredibly helpful for anyone who wants to tell a solid, engaging story.
> # **State — perform at your best with a peak mindset and deepen your understanding of the brain**

## **5. Brain Rules by Dr. John Medina**

If you need to convince your boss you should stop putting text on slides, and you want to understand how the brain reacts to a PowerPoint and to the environment around you, then you should check this out. It digs deeply into the science behind why we react far better to visual stimuli than text. Medina also has some really engaging videos online that bring his research to life.

## **6. The Chimp Paradox by Professor Steve Peters**

Peters coached the British cycling team for the 2012 Olympics when they won multiple gold medals. If you’re looking to better understand the things that stand in your way, cause you anxiety or stress, then *The Chimp Paradox*is a good choice. Peters explains how he helped the winning team get into a mindset to perform at their best under intense pressure and get the results they deserved.

## **7. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman**

The author of this one is a Nobel Prize winner in economics and he gives a deep insight into behavior and brain function so you can understand what’s happening to you in different situations. For people who liked *Predictably Irrational* or *Freakonomics*, *Thinking, Fast and Slow* will be a new favorite. It digs into the different tracks of thought when we make decisions and helps the reader to better understand what instincts they can or cannot trust.

## **8. It’s Not How Good You Are, It’s How Good You Want to Be by Paul Arden**

This recommendation is short — maybe 70 pages. You can read it quickly and it’s a great motivation or inspiration to keep in your pocket. I’ve found that I carry it around with me for months and dip into it to see one of the quotes to get me into a better mindset.

## **9. Daring Greatly by Brené Brown**

I love Brown’s work on vulnerability. She’s given Ted Talks that have gone viral and had several bestselling books. The main goal of *Daring Greatly* is to help you embrace your own vulnerability. If you’re struggling to drop your armor and be your true self, Brown’s work can definitely help. For me, this book has been really key in my own journey to connect more genuinely with my audience by lowering my own armor.

# All Eyes On You&#58; How To Grab And Hold An Audience’s Attention

## Photo by Kane Reinholdtsen on Unsplash

A few years back, I was giving a sales pitch to a group of potential clients when I noticed one guy doodling while I was talking.

So I grabbed the paper from him and started joking around, “Hey, looks like we have a Picasso over here! This is actually pretty good. Where are you taking classes?”

Now, that move was a bit of a gamble. If the guy had a big ego, or I had misread the room, it would have been the end of my pitch. But it worked out well. People started laughing and joking about it, and he was a good sport. He knew he should have been paying attention.

Whether you’re giving a pitch, a presentation, or a commencement speech, attention is everything. Unfortunately, it’s tough to get and easy to lose.

Here’s how to capture someone’s attention — and keep it until you’ve made your point:

## **Start with something that throws your audience off course.**

Sometimes you have to surprise people to get their attention.

If they’re expecting you to immediately start droning on about who you are and what you’re selling, then you have to do something to wake them up. Think about using an interesting statistic, a random fact, a joke. Ask a question they have to ponder for a moment.

Just remember, you don’t have all day to tell them that funny anecdote about your grandma.

Spend 10–15 seconds getting your audience interested before taking that momentum and building on it.

You want their attention so that they’ll [listen](https://medium.com/@SamRusani/advice-for-entrepreneurs-how-to-find-a-mentor-worth-listening-to-eabd35f3f509?source=---------2------------------) to what you have to say next, which should be the most important part of your presentation — what you’re there to talk about.

## **Read the room and adjust.**

When I grabbed that potential client’s doodles, I didn’t do it in a room full of sour-faced old men with their arms crossed.

I did it in a room full of people I’d already joked with and charmed. I could tell it was a cheerful group, and that’s what gave me the confidence to take a risk and grab his paper. If the group had been completely serious up until that point, I would have just let the guy draw.

The best salespeople and presenters change their approach based on what they see happening in the room. Some clients are going to love a pitch with a lot of personality, others are going to want to get to the point sooner rather than later.

That’s actually why I like to lead with a joke. It lets me test the temperature of the room. If I crack a joke and no one laughs, that’s a pretty good sign I should hop right into telling them why I’m here and why they should care.

Be observant. People are often telling you a lot more than you’re hearing.

## **Use body language to gauge interest as you go.**

I use body psychology a lot when giving pitches by reading people’s body language and making adjustments as needed.

The woman looking at you and leaning her head forward while you’re talking? She’s probably engaged with what you’re saying. The guy sitting back in his chair with his hands across his chest? There’s a good chance he’s not picking up what you’re putting down. If you notice a lot of closed off body language like that, it’s a sign you should cut the extraneous information and get right to the point.

Another way to gauge interest is to watch for people who are mirroring you. If you look across the table and see they’re sitting in the same position as you, it usually means they subconsciously like you to some degree — or at least don’t see you as a threat.

Keep in mind that while body language is the best non-verbal indicator of how people are reacting to you, none of this is hard and fast. True, someone may have their arms crossed because they’re not receptive to what you’re saying. But it also may be because the AC is set too low.

## **Be in control at all times.**

One of the first things I did when I came to LA was to take an improv class.

I wasn’t trying to get into acting — I was just aiming to sharpen my mind. I wanted to get better at thinking on my feet and reacting to people.

Engaging an audience takes back and forth, almost like improv. The key is to always be in control. Great speakers maintain control by asking yes or no questions to lead the conversation in the direction they want it to go. You’ll notice they’re also in control of their bodies.

One way to assess your own control is to tape yourself giving a presentation and watch how you move and sound. Where are your hands? Are they in your pockets? Does your voice sound melodious or monotonous? There are a million little tricks you can learn over time to keep your audience’s attention, but focusing on your body language and tonality are a good place to start.

Every time you [walk into a room](https://medium.com/@SamRusani/the-1-thing-all-great-salespeople-do-the-moment-they-walk-in-the-door-825dbccbc1b3), remember that attention is a commodity. That’s why they say you have to “grab” it — no one is going to hand it over if you aren’t interesting and engaging.

# 5 Scientific Tricks to Fall Asleep Fast When You Can’t Sleep, According to a Neuroscientist.

## 

Nearly two-thirds of adults in developed nations fail to meet the nightly eight hours of sleep recommended by the World Health Organisation.

According to Matthew Walker, sleep expert, professor at the University of California, Berkeley and neuroscientist, driving while drowsy is more dangerous than drunk driving. [1]

Sleep deprivation may also affect male and female fertility. Walker notes that men who sleep five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep eight hours or more. And, they tend to have levels of testosterone similar to a man ten years older. [2]

Sleep deprivation also increases the risk of cancer, memory loss, depression, anxiety, obesity, cancer, heart failure, Alzheimer’s disease and early death.

In his New York Times bestselling book, [Why We Sleep](http://geni.us/whywesleepbook) [(Audiobook)](http://geni.us/whywesleepaudiobook), Walker notes that:
> *“After being awake for nineteen hours, people who were sleep-deprived were as cognitively impaired as those who were legally drunk… After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail. Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance. After ten days of just seven hours of sleep, the brain is as dysfunctional as it would be after going without sleep for twenty-four hours.”*

An extra hour or two of sleep could also be the difference between being good versus great with your work, health, family, relationships and finances.

Here are five scientific tricks to help you fall asleep fast and regain these extra hours of sleep.

**1. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule**

Sleep expert, Walker, notes that one of the best ways to train your body to fall asleep quicker is to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even if you don’t have a good night of sleep.

Walker recommends that you set a bedtime reminder on your phone an hour before you plan to fall asleep.

Another effective trick is to develop a pre-sleep routine that will help you to [**build the habit](https://mayooshin.com/habits/)** of falling asleep quicker.

For example, during my pre-sleep routine, I spend five minutes stretching and practicing breathing exercises. Then I read a book in bed and usually fall asleep within 10 minutes of reading.

Experiment with different pre-sleep routines to find what works best for you.

**2. Create a dark sleep environment**

We live in a dark-deprived society, but we require darkness in the evenings to aid the release of a melatonin, a hormone that determines the healthy timing of our sleep.

The blue lights that emit from your electronic devices could fool your brain to think it’s still day time, even though it’s nighttime and you’re trying to sleep.

According to Walker:
> *“Even a hint of dim light — 8 to 10 lux — has been shown to delay the release of nighttime melatonin in humans…A subtly lit living room, where most people reside in the hours before bed, will hum at around 200 lux. Despite being just 1 to 2 percent of the strength of daylight, this ambient level of incandescent home lighting can have 50 percent of the melatonin-suppressing influence within the brain.” (Source: [Why We Sleep](http://geni.us/whywesleepbook))*

Walker’s advice is to dim down half the lights in your home and shut down all electronics about an hour before you go to bed. This way you can [**design your environment](https://mayooshin.com/environment-shapes-life/)** to make it easier to fall asleep fast.

**3. Keep your body cool**

According to Walker, our bodies require a drop in temperature — which affects our melatonin levels — to fall asleep quicker.

If you’ve ever woken up, only to find your arms and legs sticking out of your covers, it’s a sign that your body attempted to reduce its core temperature low enough for you to fall asleep.

The ideal bedroom temperature lies between 65 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit, assuming standard bedding and clothing.

Another trick to reduce your core temperature and fall asleep quicker is to take a hot bath before bed.

Walker suggests that:
> *“When you get out of the bath, those dilated blood vessels on the surface quickly help radiate out inner heat, and your core body temperature plummets. Consequently, you fall asleep more quickly because your core is colder. Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.”*

**4. Avoid caffeine and alcohol after 2 p.m**

When we wake up in the morning, a chemical, adenosine, builds up in our brain to create sleep pressure and make us feel sleepier the longer we stay awake.

After about 16 hours of staying awake, the sleep pressure created by adenosine causes us to feel tired enough to fall asleep. But, caffeine creates the opposite effect.

After a dose of caffeine, say from a cup of coffee, caffeine latches onto one of the adenosine receptors in the brain and masks the receptor.

And so, after about 16 hours of staying awake, your brain is fooled into thinking that it hasn’t been awake for 16 hours, despite how sleepy and tired you feel. This is because caffeine is blocking the brain signals of adenosine, as well as the sleep pressure instructions to the brain.

The longer caffeine blocks adenosine, the sleepiness chemical, the greater the quantity of adenosine build up in your system. When your body rids itself of the caffeine from its system, not only do you revert back to the same level of sleepiness prior to consuming the caffeine, you’re also hit with an additional dose of sleepiness from the adenosine build up. This is the ‘caffeine crash’ you may have experienced before.

And just like any [**bad habit](https://mayooshin.com/how-to-break-a-bad-habit/)**, you’ll crave another dose of caffeine to boost your energy, reinforcing the vicious cycle. [3]

The average half-life of caffeine is approximately five to seven hours. That’s why Walker recommends that we avoid caffeine consumption after 2 p.m.

In [**Why We Sleep](http://geni.us/whywesleepbook)**, Walker also suggests that consuming alcohol, even wine or whiskey in the evenings, is detrimental for quality sleep:
> *“…those who had their sleep laced with alcohol on the first night after learning suffered what can conservatively be described as partial amnesia seven days later, forgetting more than 50 percent of all that original knowledge.”*

Alcohol causes multiple sleep interruptions in the middle of the night, most of which we won’t remember. Plus, it blocks our REM and dream sleep, which is critical for mental health. [4]

**5. Don’t stay in bed after you wake up**

Here’s a common scenario.

You suddenly wake up an hour or two before the alarm to wake up rings. The clock is ticking. You know that time is running out and if you don’t fall asleep now, you’d miss out on the extra sleep.

But for some reason, you’re filled with anxiety because you can’t sleep and you’re not sure whether to stay in bed or get up and start your day.

Our brains are extremely adaptive, so if we spend enough mornings in bed after we wake up, the brain would learn to associate the bed with staying awake, instead of falling asleep.

Walker suggests that the best way to avoid this problem is to go to another dim lighted room and read a book until you’re about to fall asleep, then return back to bed.

If you still can’t fall asleep, that’s okay. By restricting time spent in bed, you can build up sleep pressure to fall asleep faster overtime:
> *“One of the more paradoxical CBT-I methods used to help insomniacs sleep is to restrict their time spent in bed, perhaps even to just six hours of sleep or less to begin with. By keeping patients awake for longer, we build up a strong sleep pressure — a greater abundance of adenosine. Under this heavier weight of sleep pressure, patients fall asleep faster, and achieve a more stable, solid form of sleep across the night. In this way, a patient can regain their psychological confidence in being able to self-generate and sustain healthy, rapid, and sound sleep, night after night: something that has eluded them for months if not years. Upon reestablishing a patient’s confidence in this regard, time in bed is gradually increased.”*

Walker also suggests meditation as a solution to fall asleep faster, especially after a long flight and build up of jet lag. In particular, [**breathing exercises](https://mayooshin.com/478breathing/)** quiet the mind and weaken the fight-or-flight branch of the nervous system, a key feature of insomnia.

## Master the Art of Falling Asleep
> *“Sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleeve of care, The death of each day’s life, sore labour’s bath, Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course, Chief nourisher in life’s feast.”*
> *-William Shakespeare, Macbeth*

Falling asleep is as much an art as it is a science. Whilst these scientific tricks can help you fall asleep faster, they aren’t rules set in stone.

As with everything, you can always experiment and find what works best for you based on your lifestyle and circumstances.

The main takeaway is that sleep is crucial for a healthy, productive and fulfilling life.

Make sleep a priority in your life today.

# Why I Pray Other People Steal my Startup Ideas

## 

Any founder worth their salt — who has grown their company to any significant scale and experienced any semblance of success — will tell you that one of the leading indicators that their startup has got any chance of success was the day they realized they had copycats.

Welcome them like a sibling replicating your style. They might resemble you but they will never be you.

Enjoy the flattery then continue revolutionizing. Copying a product is the biggest compliment another founder can give you. It’s a veiled confession of superiority which acknowledges their own inability to innovate.

The platitude that everything is in the implementation has never been more true.
> **But there is a key element of that which people never realize of misunderstanding: as critical to the development of any product is the learning that went into its development. The failures you overcame, the reasons for the specific choices that were made that led to the product or service you offer today.**

It’s the equivalent of getting marks for your working in a Mathematics examinations.

While you have the working and the answer, the startup ripping your idea off only has the answer and understands nothing about the question or the struggle to get there.

Where you have iteratively developed your startup over time, internalizing the lessons of what has worked and what hasn’t, NewCo hasn’t and will often be sentenced to explore and repeat the same mistakes you did. During this process, they are unlikely to persist as their passion is misplaced.
> # You must relentlessly stick to your mission and not be distracted.

Even if you both start out from the same place, the likelihood of you reaching the same end point or progressing in the same direction is unlikely.

**But make no mistake about it, competition is an existential threat.**

Competition is war, but it provides validity to your argument. Competitors bring validation of ideas and increase focus on unloved spaces.

When you have those replicating your efforts you know what you are producing is resonating with a wider audience.
> # Double down and get back to it.

Focus on your key advantages, batter down the hatches and blow them away.

If you have existing users/customers renew every focus on over-delivering at every opportunity. Your customers are the lifeblood of your future success and a resource that should be exploited for learning and teaching at every opportunity.

Start talking to them more; you should have more users to interview if you are the incumbent which is a massive advantage. Understand your advantages and start putting them to use.

Do you have more users, a wider customer base, more financial resources? Whatever it is work to your strengths, understand your weaknesses and exploit theirs.

Get dirty and renew your love for the problem you are solving. Competition should sharpen your mind not dissuade you from participating.
> # Remember though competitors can win.

Everyone assumed there was no room for another search engine while Yahoo ruled the surf of the interweb, before Google dropped in and Yahoo sank in their wake.

**Competitors should eradicate any and all complacency.**

You won’t be the only fish in the pond any longer.

But the pond will be expanded.

As your market gets more public acclaim those other fishes are understandably trying to steal your lunch.

You may start out as the big fish in an increasingly large pond, but to stay at the top of the food chain, you need to continue to offer the best service/product.

The old adage of a new company having to be 10x better in order to encourage customers might be true when a company is an established brand, but at the early stages, it is an empty moat you can’t hide behind.

The ease in which users can download an app and delete it should frighten us all, but it is also our greatest strength. Continue to wow your customers and they will remain.

Remain abreast of your competitors' developments and continue to produce. Make sure they always remain the one’s who are striving to keep up.
> # It would be a mistake to panic and over commit resources to watch them.

It would be equally as large a mistake to ignore them completely.
> *“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” ― [**Sun Tzu](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1771.Sun_Tzu)**, [**The Art of War](http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3200649)***

## That is the nature of entrepreneurship.

Continuous existential threats that must be navigated with grace while continuing to offer an increasingly superior service, both to what you offered previously and what your competitors seek to replicate.

So embrace those who copy your work. Thank them for the motivation and put it to work. You now know your business has merit. Now it’s your responsibility to respond to the challenge and excel.

If you can’t handle the fight don’t put on the gloves.

If you are it’s time to start swinging.

# My Accidental Digital Detox

## I didn’t check my phone for 10 hours and it felt so good that now I’m worried

![“Person taking an Instagram photo on an iPhone of their food” by [Igor Miske](https://unsplash.com/@igormiske?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*YslrvWqs5tZAidkV)*“Person taking an Instagram photo on an iPhone of their food” by [Igor Miske](https://unsplash.com/@igormiske?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

This past Saturday, my best friend and I went and played golf — for real, in the outdoors — for roughly 10 hours. I am a god-awful golfer (the main reason it took us 10 hours to play 27 holes, at two separate courses), but it was a beautiful day, and honestly, I would’ve been happy just riding around in the cart, admiring the carefully groomed fairways, greens, and approaches mingling with the intentionally unkempt wildness that surrounded the course.

During that time, I didn’t check my phone once. I took it out of my pocket, left it in the cart, put it in the console of my car on the drives between courses, and, other than texting my wife the occasional update on when we would get home, I left. it. alone.

That’s when I was reminded again of just how much time I spend mindlessly scrolling through carefully curated BS on social media. I was reminded of how much time I devote to updating Instagram, to reading the latest Medium content, to playing games, checking email, and all the other assorted crap that we all do all day long on our phones.

I was reminded of how much I love/hate my phone, and all that it represents.

I still remember not having a phone. I’m old enough to remember when the phone was something that hung on the wall in your kitchen, not something that lived in your pocket. I remember when there was literally no way of getting in touch with somebody if they were away from their house.

What I didn’t remember, until Saturday, was how much calmer, and more relaxed I feel when I’m not buried in my phone. What I didn’t remember is how much better I can concentrate, and focus on things like the wind through the grass, the feel of a golf-club in my hand, and the conversation that I’m sharing with my friend, all without a phone in my hand, vibrating away.

In short, I’m only reminded of how truly addicted I can be to my phone, and social media, and all the rest of the Information Age, when I step away from it.

That’s brilliant design on the part of the creators of Facebook, Instagram, and all the other attention-grabbers that we complain about but can’t seem to quit. *We don’t realize how much time we waste on our phones until we put our phones down.* Brilliant, but frightening. I’m not going to be one of those people who gives you a list of 10 things you need to do to detox from social media right now. I’m not even going to say that cell phones are inherently dangerous and need to be tightly controlled. That’s your life, and your decision. All I’m saying is that I didn’t realize how much I preferred spending my time without a phone dinging away in my pocket constantly. How much more I preferred creating memories in my mind rather than in my Instagram feed. Engaging in real conversation rather than Internet yelling.

I’m not going to delete the Facebook app off my phone, or set myself a time-limit on checking email, or anything that formal (at least not yet). But what I am going to do is remember how much better I felt this past Saturday, when I went out and did something, instead of playing around on my phone. I’m going to remember that feeling, and try to recreate that same feeling more often. In short, I’m going to stop scrolling and live my life more often.

# How to Crack Brand DNA and Tell it’s Story.

## 

Trust is paramount in business. Whether you’re speaking to a stranger at a dinner party, pitching in a meeting or designing your brand collateral, if you can’t inspire your audience to believe in you, your business will never grow wings and fly.

However, many of us struggle to know exactly* how *to create the required level of quality connection. Whilst we may know the value our business brings, (and if we don’t, we have bigger problems than we think!) we often can’t articulate our mission in a way that attracts and inspires.

What we need is weapons grade communication skills to bring our business ideas to life, draw people to our brand and create the loyalty necessary to fuel its success.

### **Enter The Power of Your Brand Story….**

Humans hunger for belonging and a sense of shared purpose. And the best way to meet this universal need is not through dry logic alone: we must start telling inspiring stories. Whether on a website, through social media interactions or face to face, it is your story that creates a sense of commonality and purpose.

Brand story explains how Starbucks won the attention of the masses and elevated itself over its competitors, some of whom may well make superior coffee. Starbucks is founded on far more than the simple specifications of their product. In fact, the stories they tell barely mention their products at all, and instead focus on reaffirming people’s faith in humanity, and by doing so, build a stronger, more emotional connection with their customers. For example, Starbucks recently created a selection of stories that featured ordinary people doing extraordinary things in order to create positive change in their communities. These were powerful stories in which employees were respected, customers were valued and bean farmers in developing countries were paid fairly. By coupling these human stories that engender brand loyalty with a fantastic ability to execute on rigorous strategy, Starbucks has positioned itself for massive success.

Storytelling is a skill, and like any other, can be learned. And with a few simple tools under your belt, you too can create a great story and begin to build a picture of your brand that your audience will love.

## **7 Practical Tools to Telling a Compelling Brand Story:**

### **1. Define your Target Market.**

Before you do anything, you must define your audience. Without knowing exactly who you want to reach, you cannot clearly tell a story that will resonate. So, discover as much detail about your audience as you can. Ask yourself: *What do they want? What do they need? What are their struggles and pain points? Why is it important to find a solution to make a particular aspect of their lives easier?* Keep asking yourself questions about your ideal end-user and be as specific as you can about their cares and concerns. Because, once you know the answers, you will intimately understand your target audience and can position your brand as the best solution to their troubles.

### **2.** **Position your Brand.**

Once you’ve defined your ideal customer, you need to accurately describe your brand with a clear positioning statement. This is a short, sharp statement that captures who you are, what you do and the value of your business. Your positioning statement is an attention-grabbing opener you can use in all online channels as well as face to face, and forms the very heart of your brand story.

To help you craft a positioning statement, define the following as briefly as you can:

1. What you do? (the solution)

2. Who is it for? (target audience)

3. Why do you do it? (the need)

4. The amazing outcome as a result of your solution

5. Your key differentiation that sets you apart.

As you practice and re-iterate, you’ll eventually come up with a brand message of just a few sentences that will help to articulate your value proposition both online and in person — and in any situation.

### **3.** **Develop your Narrative.**

Once you’ve nailed your positioning statement, expand on your story to give your chosen audience a more detailed picture of who you are, what you do and why you do it. This will become your signature brand narrative that could either be a stand-alone story or multiple stories that form part of a broader narrative. For instance, you could expand on your customer story and explain how a customer solved their problem using your product. Or, you could talk about your origin story and explain what inspired you to start this business, why you committed to it and how you eventually overcame stacked odds. You could even tell the story of the amazing milestones you’ve reached and why these have been important to you and your customers. Simply tell the stories that are emotive and bring the most hope to your audience.

### 4. **Keep it Simple.**

Keep your brand story simple, eliminate complex jargon and tell it in a relatable manner, because nobody wants to listen to a technocrat droning on. You need to capture the imagination of your audience, and you do this by replacing jargon with simple, vivid and visual language to paint a colourful picture of your business. Metaphors, similes and analogies can simplify the complex and help your audience understand the solution you are presenting. They also create powerful visual images and evoke such powerful sentiment that your audience can’t help but become immersed in your story. And greater audience engagement means greater loyalty. Consider the iconic brand *Amazon*, named after the river in South America. The idea was that their selection of books would be vast and wide, just like the largest river in the world. And this promise reinforces the metaphor as “a place where people can come to discover anything they might want to buy online.” What a brilliant way to clearly show what Amazon stands for!

### **5.** **Stay Human.**

Focus on how your products or services touch the lives of real people. This means that your stories should include actual people, real situations and genuine emotions. So, explain — in terms people can relate to — how your company adds value to the lives of your customers, clients and stakeholders. Do you provide a quicker service? Is your product of greater utility to the consumer? Do you make complex products easier to use? Show precisely how you make life better for people. And always own your mistakes without ever over-apologising. Simply take responsibility for whatever went wrong and immediately point towards a solution. When Steve Jobs faced the PR fiasco surrounding a fault in the iPhone 4, instead of repeatedly denying his mistake, or grovelling for forgiveness, Jobs instead went for the honest approach. He said, *“ We’re not perfect. Phones are not perfect. We all know that. But we want to make our users happy”*. He was truthful, and in a later press conference, offered clear fixes. It’s a strong move and we relate because no one can be perfect all the time. By making truth the cornerstone of everything you write, speak and create, you’ll become trustworthy and be the type of respected brand people want to associate with.

### **6.** **Design it to be Shared.**

There’s no point having a great story if it exists in a vacuum. It needs to be shared. But how do we design content that people love and want to send to others, when people only share on social what shows them in the best light? You must cater to that need and design your content accordingly — and all without losing your unique personality. However, this is NOT about selling out on your core values. Instead, it’s about discovering what people care about, helping them meet their needs and finding points of mutual interest to create a shared vision. So, look at your past creative messaging and see what resonates best with your audience. Notice how consumers engage with your brand and whether certain messaging leads to an uptick in sharing. Because, when you know what inspires, you can formulate stories your customers will want to spread.

### **7.** **Speak Your Story.**

*“I love networking events”*….said hardly anyone! An opportunity to exchange stories and make meaningful business connections often turns into an awkward cringe-fest with most people longing for the exit. However, powerful online branding must be translated in-person to reap the most benefits, and for this we need to network with purpose! But how? Simple. By being genuine. Rather than parroting an elevator pitch to all and sundry, forget pitching full stop. Instead, start a human conversation with someone. And be generous by focusing on the other person, asking open-ended questions and gently finding out about them. Do this, and you’ll soon discover whether they’re worth talking to! And, importantly, most people will appreciate your genuine interest. Once you’ve built trust, your business stories will naturally start to flow. So, always value connection over pitching, because when you do, you’ll reap the reward!

The thread woven through all these tools is *connection.* The most valuable global brands such as Apple, Nike and Coca-Cola have long recognised the power of creating meaningful connection and have nurtured stories that have become legendary in status. Ultimately, we trust them.

So, whether you’re tweeting, emailing, writing a blog post or simply talking to a customer, create a brand story we all relate to, understand and like. You need to be truthful, real, and prioritise connection above all else. And when you do that, the rest will follow.

# 453 Words That Explain Why Humans Create

## 

When I turned 25, everyone started dying.

Dead great-grandmother. Dead great uncle. Dead cousins. Dead sister.

Murdered child in our town. Murdered member of our graduating class. Murdered friend on the internet. Murdered Sheriff’s Deputy in our city.

“Murdered Sheriff’s Deputy in our city” — The officer pulled over a meth addict who stole a car. Panic caused the driver to shoot Sgt. Baker in the chest. Something worse caused him to fire three more times and attempt to burn the police car with the body still inside.

Nowhere, Tennessee exploded with grief and fear. Blue ribbons unfurled on every street lamp, blue tape splashed on every window of every business. Buildings locked down. Schools too. My wife, who works on a 60-acre farm with no security, jumped into a building with her boss and 32 camp counselors and 240 children. They hoped the murderer headed west instead of east. Nobody wants a cop killer to stumble upon the dream hostage situation.

[Suicide, too](https://www.toddbrison.com/why-do-creative-people-die-early/)! You heard about Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain last week. Which means there were probably 21,998 other self-executions you didn’t hear about.

Unless it was your brother.

Death, death, death. It was always this way, of course. Life claims daily victims while the rest of us miraculously continue to suck wind through our all-too-fragile throats into our all-too-flimsy [lung sacs](https://medium.com/tell-me-your-story-and-experience/nothing-extraordinary-happened-today-76bed4ef1944).

If we are honest, it is not death which stuns us. It is unmet potential. The deceased was too young, too talented, too smart, too beautiful, too loved. And now what?

Now, she feeds worms.

This all sounds terribly depressing. Forgive me. It’s the only way I process.

It is also how I have reached the following conclusion.
> # **Despite the tragedy: We write. We love. We sing.**
> # **We make stuff.**

Actually, let me try that again.
> # **BECAUSE OF the tragedy: We write. We love. We sing.**
> # **We make stuff.**

My joy is this — We paint on walls because we know even though we are consigned to oblivion, maybe the next generation will see our brief dance with the muse, a spark of inspiration. Maybe they will be motivated to leave their own mark.

My frustration is this — in 2018, these very works are often no longer an expression of humanity, but rather a necessary checklist item for success. Efficiency doesn’t sell any more, but guess what? Beauty sells. Funny sells. Emotion sells. Music sells.

My agony is this — Art sells. But if we called it “art,” it wouldn’t sell.

Write your memoir. Not for the masses. For your mother.

Play your chords. Not for a crowd. For your child.

Give advice. Not for your brand. For your being.

Do this before it’s too late.

Much love as always,

[— Todd B](http://toddbrison.com)

# How To Come Up With Good Business Ideas

## How To Come Up With Good Business Ideas

Many people would love to start their own business but are held back by the belief that they’re not creative enough to come up with a good idea. Those that do launch a project often go with the first idea they have, only later realising they should have taken more time to find the right opportunity.

If you want to build a successful business, this article will give you a better chance of finding that killer idea. First, I’ll outline techniques for generating ideas, then I’ll explain what exactly you should be looking for.

**“Notice”, don’t “think up”**

The typical advice you’ll see for finding business ideas is to write down your strengths and your interests, then come up with ideas that merge the two. This approach might work for some, but it’s flawed. It doesn’t focus your mind on finding real problems; it limits your thinking to things that interest you; and it demands that you come up with ideas on the spot without inspiration from the outside world.

According to Paul Graham, Co-Founder of the influential startup accelerator, Y Combinator, the verb you want to be using with respect to business ideas is not “think up”, but “notice”. He’s found that the most successful startups almost always come from the founders observing something in their daily life.

A good place to start is trying to notice problems at the company you work for. Could the internal processes be improved? Are customers dissatisfied with something?

Another approach worth testing is to think about products and services that you use. You might be unhappy with a company and be able to compete with them by addressing their shortcomings. The idea for the [language tutoring platform](https://lingoci.com) I founded in 2017 came to me whilst I was taking lessons online.

As well as utilising your personal experiences, listen to your friends and family. You won’t need to quiz them on their problems as people like to moan and complain about the negatives in their life.

Alternatively, you could take a more structured approach to coming up with business ideas. Alex Hillman & Amy Hoy teach an [entrepreneurship course](https://30x500.com/academy/) called 30 x 500, where they recommend the following approach: pick a specific group that uses the internet a lot, for example digital nomads. Then find where they hang out online, observe their discussions, and research the themes they discuss in order to uncover their problems.

**Seek new experiences & be patient**

To increase your chances of noticing things, actively seek out new experiences and environments. Moving to another country is one way to stimulate ideas. When I moved to Paris a few years ago, I noticed that tea had become big business as brands had turned the drink into something fun, luxurious and fashionable. I considered launching something similar in the UK, where the trend has since caught on.

Whilst changing your environment can help, the only thing you really need to change to start spotting opportunities is your mindset. If you focus on noticing problems and pondering whether they could be solved, ideas should surface. This will not happen immediately, so be patient and allow yourself time to come across situations where opportunities exist.

Before you start searching, you should understand what makes a good business idea. You’ll see that it’s not black and white — much can depend on personal factors.

**Solve a problem that actually exists**

This sounds obvious, but entrepreneurs repeatedly build things that no one wants. This happens because they begin by looking for solutions, rather than problems. Paul Graham highlights that these ideas often sound plausible. He gives a social network for pet owners as an example — people don’t want to use it themselves, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Entrepreneurs should not interpret such feedback as evidence that there is demand for their idea.

**Find a group that cares enough about the problem**

Even if you’ve found a problem, it may seem insignificant to others. You need to discover whether the problem is sufficiently **important** and **urgent **to enough people. This will determine whether they have the required motivation to purchase and use your solution. If you can find a group of people who urgently want your product even when it’s still a work in progress, you’re probably on the right track.

To give you an example, a friend of mine recently launched a software tool that pauses your Google advertising automatically if your website goes down. The problem was obvious to him — business owners can waste a lot of money on advertising when their site is down. But whilst they recognised that the problem existed, it wasn’t urgent or important to them. They felt that downtime was so rare that it wasn’t worth worrying about.

**Leverage your personal experience**

According to serial entrepreneur, James Altucher, you should:
> “Only build something you really want to use yourself. There’s got to be one thing you are completely desperate for and no matter where you look you can’t find it. Nobody has invented it yet. So, there you go — you invent it”.

This advice — to focus on problems you personally have — can be seen all over the internet. It makes some sense as it reduces the risk of creating a solution for a problem that doesn’t exist. It also helps you understand your customers, which is important when designing and selling your product. If you’re a 50-year-old accountant thinking about launching a mobile app for teenagers, you’d better do some serious research to make sure that you’re addressing a real need.

Whilst personal problems are a good place to start, don’t limit yourself to them. Focusing only on personal problems needlessly eliminates things that matter to others. Plus, if you’re male and between 25 and 50 years old, the online entrepreneur community is dominated by folks like you with similar lifestyles, all trying to solve similar problems. Focus on other demographics such as the elderly and you’ll increase your chances of finding unresolved problems.

**Differentiate**

Business schools teach that to start a business, you need a USP (Unique Selling Proposition). This term tends to mislead people, causing them to attempt to think of something completely unique. This is no easy feat.

If your product is unique, it will attract attention and you may be able to acquire customers for free through word of mouth. But a product does not need to be unique to be successful. It simply needs to deliver enough value for people to be willing to buy it.

You’ll have a far better chance of making money if you focus on problems that companies are already addressing. This approach removes the risk of picking an insignificant problem.

Rather than look for something completely new, think about goods and services you use and consider subtle ways that you could do things differently. Here’s an example to illustrate this:

The market for email marketing software is extremely crowded. But it didn’t stop brothers Jonathan and Gareth Bull from creating a highly profitable product — [EmailOctopus](https://emailoctopus.com/). They integrated with Amazon Web Services in order to offer software that was significantly cheaper than the competition. And as they didn’t have investors, they were forced to create a simpler product. It turned out that this simplicity was just as important as price in attracting customers.

Whilst EmailOctopus’ points of differentiation were centred on the product, note that you can also differentiate in other areas. You could do better marketing than the competition, you could bring something you’ve seen in one country to another, or you could simply communicate better with customers.

**Personal fit**

Do you have the skills and resources to turn your idea into a profitable business? If you don’t have them, can you learn them or acquire them without too much difficulty?

When I was at university, I had the idea for a fridge gadget that would scan food for expiry dates and provide reminders, thereby reducing waste. Whilst the idea interested a supermarket, it was far too technically challenging for a Business student. Sometimes your ideas will be too ambitious, and you’ll need to be more realistic.

Business gurus often advise you to follow your passion. You might love tennis. But you love playing the game, not selling tennis products online. Most online businesses will involve similar work — marketing, finding suppliers, recruitment etc. Whether you enjoy running a business will depend on whether you suit being an entrepreneur, not whether it’s related to your interests.

Boring ideas attract less attention, so there will be a higher chance of finding gaps in the market if you stop limiting your thinking to things you’re passionate about.

What matters more than your passions is what lifestyle you want to have. If you want to get investors and make millions, be prepared to work long hours under intense pressure. If you want a lifestyle business, focus on an idea that you can execute on your own, then use technology to automate processes.

**Tight targeting makes things easier**

If you’re seeking investment for an idea, you’ll need to persuade investors that the market you’re targeting is big enough to generate a good ROI. The problem is that when you go for a big, broad market, it’s harder to break through the noise and reach potential buyers. A friend of mine co-founded a social network for finding suppliers and building business partnerships anywhere in the world. The targeting was so broad that the company struggled to acquire users.

Thanks to the internet and cloud computing, it’s now easier than ever to bootstrap an online business, i.e. start it with no outside investment. If you do this, you can own 100% of the shares and the market does not need to be particularly big for you to make a living. Targeting a niche will enable you to tailor your message to people with a specific need. This makes sense as Google allows people to search very specifically. Pat Flynn gives this example:
> “if you’re looking for the best dog food for your golden retriever, are you typing in “best pet food”? No, you’re typing in best dog food, and likely best dog food for your golden retriever of a specific age…The narrower you get the easier it is to connect with your audience, the easier it is to stand out.”

**How much risk are you comfortable with?**

Starting a business can be scary because of the risks involved. What if you lose all the money you invested and can’t find a new job? I wouldn’t advise anyone to quit their job unless they have the funds to cover them if the business doesn’t work out. If you pick an idea that can be brought to life with little time and money, you can start it as a side-project that you work on during your free time. This will also reduce stress as you won’t need to worry about the project failing. Whilst in general you’ll want to minimise risk, there’s a trade-off here as simple products can be copied more easily than those which require significant time and capital.

**Customer lifetime value vs customer acquisition costs**

You may have a phenomenal product. But it means nothing if you can’t gain customers at a cost that makes sense.

Entrepreneurs sometimes say it’s easier to start a business that sells to companies rather than consumers. The thinking is that it’s much easier to sell a $1000 product to a few business customers than it is to sell a $10 product to hundreds of consumers. Whilst this may be true, don’t let it restrict your thinking. There are millions of profitable businesses that make just a few dollars per sale.

Still, you should consider *customer lifetime value* — how much profit do you expect to generate from each customer during their lifetime? If the figure is high, you’ll have a greater ability to invest in customer acquisition and be left with a decent profit. Software businesses are favourable because they typically generate recurring revenue — customers pay every month or year. If your idea instead fits a one-off purchase, you may still be able to increase lifetime value by maintaining a relationship with your audience and selling related products to them.

If you’ve previously struggled to come up with good business ideas, I hope that this guide has shown you that you don’t need to be a creative genius. You simply need to be curious and observe when problems crop up. When you do find an idea, make sure it solves a pressing problem and think carefully about whether it’s a good fit for you.

My next piece will explain how you can validate your idea to make sure there’s a market for it. I’m considering creating some further content to help entrepreneurs, so if you found this guide useful, please let me know by clicking the 👏 button and following me. Thanks for reading!

# 3 Ways to Be Happy, Make Money and Help Others&#58; You Know What to Do, Now Do It

## Authors Richie and Natalie Norton in Portugal (Summer 2018)

## Gavin’s Law: Live to start. Start to live.

Since my son Gavin graduated from this life to the next, I’ve preached these words to tens of thousands of people around the world. And guess what? It never gets old. The idea is simple, yet true. Live to start those ideas that keep pressing on your mind and start living the life of your dreams.

I can’t count how many people have told me how these words have inspired them. Changed them. I love it. It makes me feel like a little piece of Gavin still lives on in this insane world and his influence is still felt for good. Thank you to all of you who have embraced Gavin’s Law and are living a little better because of it. It seriously means the world to me.

He lived 76 days. I’ve since learned that I can do anything in 76 days. That’s a little less than three months. A little less than a quarter of the year. A little less than a full season. A little time period in the average person’s life. But with a little effort, this short time period can dramatically change your life forever.

That’s why I’d like to challenge you to do something great over the next 76 days in Gavin’s honor. Do something. Anything. This is a real challenge. A challenge to make the most of one of your greatest gifts: TIME (Today Is My Everything). I call it [*The 76-Day Challenge](http://richienorton.com/76daychallenge/).*

## DEFINING THE PROBLEM

What do you do when you feel like making a personal change is *necessary* to your overall happiness and well-being but there is no *real pressure* or urgency pressing you to make said change?

This is a a conundrum we all wrestle with. We feel the undeniable need and/or desire to be doing *something different* in/with our lives, but simultaneously, we can’t bring ourselves to make the change (in many cases read: “sacrifice”) necessary to do it.

* We may feel the need to change employment, but we don’t.

* We may feel the need to start a specific project, but we don’t.

* We may feel the need to pursue higher education, but we don’t

* We may feel the need to heal a broken relationship, but we don’t.

* We may feel the need to work to improve our spiritual lives, but we don’t.

* We may feel the need to take steps toward a healthier physical or emotional life for ourselves and/or our family, but again, we don’t.
(This list could likely go on for eternity.)

**It’s important to note that I’m not talking about mere whims and lusts. I’m talking about deep, honorable desires for the betterment of ourselves and/or the overall quality and satisfaction of our lives.**

## THE PROBLEM: WE DON’T HAVE TO CHANGE A THING

The desire for progression is *innate*, but the problem we face is that the actual act of progression is also* a choice*.

Without embracing our inherent need for progress, for positive growth and/or change, we’ll still go on living. Yes.
> # **But at what cost?**

***There is a very real danger present when we suppress our feelings to act on inspiration in exchange for the “safety” of the status quo.***

We risk sacrificing the opportunity to live a more fulfilling and purpose driven life. We risk sacrificing the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others. We risk sacrificing the beautiful blessing of finding a greater sense of meaning in our own lives.

**In short, we run the very real risk living a life of regret.**

### 3 WAYS TO MAKE CHANGE (ESPECIALLY WHEN IT’S “UNNECESSARY”)

## 1. Determine what will add value to your life.

![Photo: [Willian Justen de Vasconcellos](https://unsplash.com/photos/D8XCVSn5L1I?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)](1*Y_cAdmAW95cRxrM-v3Ao-g.jpeg)*Photo: [Willian Justen de Vasconcellos](https://unsplash.com/photos/D8XCVSn5L1I?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*

Think about it, what does a ship absolutely need to stay afloat? I’m not a mariner, so I can’t exactly say. . . but what I can tell you is that ships don’t absolutely *need* lighthouses — but they sure do help!

When it comes to acting on inspired ideas, it’s easy to trick ourselves into thinking we don’t really *need* to do them, but that’s like a ship ignoring the beacon of light on a rocky shore.

Just like a ship at sea, everything outside of our most basal human needs, isn’t a necessity to “keep us afloat.” Essentially, all we really *need* to sustain life is clean air to breathe, food to eat, water to drink and rest to sustain us. After the basics, everything else simply *adds or detracts value* to/from our lives.

***Which begs the question: How much value do you want to get out of life?***

You get out what you put in. Approach your life with intent, courage, faith and hard work, and you’ll reap the beautiful value those sacrifices provide. That’s the way our strange world works.

C.S. Lewis explained this principle beautifully when he said,
> # *“Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art…. It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.”*

## 2. Swing the bat.

![Babe Ruth](1*8RppHvWpkLWOHUcpXxmzEA.jpeg)*Babe Ruth*

Give your idea a chance. You’ll never hit a home run (or a base hit for that matter) if you don’t swing.

Take comfort in the words of Babe Ruth,
> # “Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.”

The thing about change is that, regardless of what we do (or don’t do, for that matter) the world is changing all around us. The good news is that as the world changes, new opportunities arise. In an ever changing world, opportunities come at you like balls from the pitcher’s mound — it might be a curve ball: **swing anyway.**

## 3. “The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.”

![](0*t4wi2GYvTbo9URnl.jpeg)

Confucius said that.

Smart man.

**Some “unnecessary” changes can feel like a looming mountain to climb.**

But remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day — and your beautiful life of intent won’t be either.
> # What is one small, “unnecessary,” thing can you do today?

Hint: As Confucius advised, simply start with that small stone that is right in front of you.

# You’re never alone

## You’re never alone

*“Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always*.”

It’s easy to think that everyone else got it “all figured out”.

In today’s hyper connected, filter friendly, and *only-posting-epic-moments *society — it’s easy to believe that everyone else are free of worry, anxiety and trauma. Especially when you go online, which has become, perhaps as real as, our actual world. It’s easy to zoom in on what is being captured during a micro moment. But, when going deeper it’s often a different story…

**Not bad. Not less. Only real and human.**

No matter how successful, wealthy or attractive someone is — there’s always a battle there. Someone might be considered a success, but is dealing with a loss. Someone might be married and have a family, but is struggling with forgiveness over something that happened years ago. Someone might be surrounded by friends, but also by insecurity, doubt, and low self-esteem.

As humans, we’re capable of experiencing fear, shame, and anxiety. But, we’re also capable of rising above and transforming that into growth, compassion and love.

**The question isn’t *if* you experience struggles, obstacles and difficulties — but what you choose to do with it.**

Find the blessing in disguise. Ask what this current situation is teaching you. Become an example for others. And remember: whatever you’re experiencing, you’re never alone. Someone might have a different story, but that doesn’t mean that the emotions and thoughts underneath aren’t similar.

So, be kind, and use your problems as stepping stones to rise to a higher standard in life.

# You Need To Do This To Hire A Great Employee

## To Hire is to take people Higher not Fire.

![](1*PJcqcBNeZBqR5t5Nq9u-tA.jpeg)
> # *Either you pay **peanuts** and get monkeys*
> # *Or*
> # *You pay donuts and hope for the best.*

**Either way, you are screwed.**

Some time back, I was hiring some senior developers for a project. I was given a free hand and money was not a constraint. The recruitment was a cakewalk. The team was completely on-boarded in less than a month.

…**And then I lost most of them within the next six months.**

Some left due to “**incompetence**” discovered during real-time work. A few left due to their inability to “**gel**” with other team members of the project. And others left due to “**mismatch**” between their own aspirations and organizational goals.

Needless to say, I was at my wit’s end. The existing team was under tremendous pressure to deliver the project and morale was at an all-time low. We were simply not getting the “**right**” people.

**That was when we brainstormed, took the HR and senior management in the loop and came up with a new 4-day hiring process simply named as HIRE.**

· **Day 1 — Humanize and Harmonize.**

· **Day 2 — Inquire and Investigate**

· **Day 3 — Read the fine print**

· **Day 4 — Extend the offer**

The big change was that, unlike the conventional interview process where a candidate will be selected based on his ‘**question-answering’** and “**remembering**” ability in multiple rounds,** we invited the potential candidate to spend 4 complete days with the actual project team, working as part of the team in the real sense.**

## Day 1 –Humanize and Harmonize

The HR takes the candidate around and introduces him to the various teams; the leadership team, the project teams, and the support functions. The project team assigns a “**buddy**” to him who gives him an overview on the kind of work being done and “**expected**” from him.

At the same time, at every level, the candidate is questioned informally on his skills and the expertise acquired in those skills. The findings are then “**humanized**”; by humanization, I mean mapping these skills to reality as much as feasible.

For example, if a candidate has worked on SAP Smart forms a long time back, it can be safely assumed that he “**knows**” what to do but will be “**rusty**” at work as of now and would need some time to come up to speed. That “**time**” needs to be factored in while evaluating him. Similarly, if a candidate claims to have executed a large project “**single-handedly**”, then that information should be considered pragmatically and discounted with a pinch of salt!

Once humanization is complete, “**harmonization**” involves aligning his skills with the right team so that his skills get the maximum exposure and utilization. This also helps the candidate to be comfortable as he is on a strong footing now. He is invited to various project meetings and discussions taking place.

**At this stage, the project team and the organization are in sync with the expected roles and responsibilities of the candidate. The candidate also now “knows” perfectly what he is entering into!**

## Day 2 — Inquire and Investigate

At this stage, we delve a bit deeper into the candidate. The candidate starts the day as any other normal working day with team meetings, discussions and requirement gatherings. At every opportunity, the candidate is encouraged to be an active participant in the discussions and come up with his own ideas and opinions for solving business problems.

By the end of the 2nd day, the “**right**” candidate would have given real-time demonstration of his skills and some brighter candidates would have even made an “**indelible**” mark on the project team**. Both can now gauge each other’s comfort level and “mismatches” become glaringly obvious.**

## Day 3 — Read the fine print

Day 3 continues like day 2 but now the project leadership and the organizational senior leadership teams enter the fray.

Informal luncheon discussions and chitchats happen at regular intervals to read the “**fine print**” of the candidate.

· Why is the candidate looking for a change?

· What does he want to do in life and is the organization the “**right**” vehicle for his aspirations?

· What is the candidate expecting from the organization?

The leadership team conveys the expectations, a candidate can have from the organization and gives him a bird’s eye view of his future career path. The candidate is encouraged to ask as many questions as he wants. Conversations are made transparent and meaningful.

**By the end of day 3, the team would have more or less decided on the candidate and the candidate, on the other hand, will have had all the information required to make a logical, informed decision about the organization.**

## Day 4 — Extend the Offer

The HR by this stage would have received all the necessary inputs from various teams and would be in a position to take a “**black ’n’ white**” decision on the candidate.

**The selected candidates would be extended the offer with the necessary terms and conditions. The rejected candidates would be thanked and paid for their services for the past 4 days. The candidature would be closed as appropriate.**

## Bringing it all together

**We succeeded beyond our wildest expectations using this new found approach.**

It has been 3 years since then and we are proud to have created a motivated, happy and self-organized team; a team that **WORKS** together**, PLAYS** together and **DELIVERS** together.

# Climb The Ladder to Success Escalator Style

## A Brief History of Rap

![](0*IBm0f0llXkGQJY_Z)
> “Softly, deftly, music shall caress you. Hear it, feel it, Secretly possess you.” ―Charles Hart

### **Food For Thought**

## **Climb The Ladder To Success Escalator Style**

*Throughout time, music has been used as a way to connect people, express feelings, and tell stories. This week’s newsletters will highlight some of the most well-known and little-known musicians, music facts, and genres. Today’s theme: Rap/Hip-Hop*

Today’s subject line is brought to you by The Notorious B.I.G. in the song “You’re Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You).”
> So don’t you get suspicious
I’m Big Dangerous you’re just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y’all breath, I told y’all — death
controls y’all, Big don’t fold y’all, uhh
I spit phrases that’ll thrill you
You’re nobody ’til somebody kills you

Today we are tackling a wide-reaching music genre with a broad history: Rap/Hip-Hop.

It’s impossible to cover the entire history of rap/hip-hop or touch on every interesting story the genre has to offer — we’re just one daily newsletter! Instead, here is a quick overview that will get you started on your journey into hip-hop history.

But first…

### **What’s The Difference Between Rap and Hip-hop?**

This is a hotly debated topic. What defines rap? What defines hip-hop? It’s commonly accepted (although not always agreed upon) that hip-hop is a culture and that rap music is an element of that culture.

In the words of KRS-One:
> # “Rap is something you do, but hip-hop is something you live.”

### **The Origins of Rap**

In West Africa, over a century before rap hit the music scene in the US, musicians told rhythmic stories over the beat of a drum. In the Caribbean Islands, folk artists also told stories in rhyme.

These poets laid the foundation of modern rap music.

### **Rap In The US**

Rap emerged as a genre in the 1970s when New York DJs mixed samples of funk, soul, and disco music to create a repetitive beat.

DJ Kool Herc, a Jamaican-American, is often credited with the birth of hip-hop. He realized that people always liked to dance at the “break” of the music (where the drumbeat or percussion comes in). He wanted to extend this part of the song by replaying the break on repeat.

To do this, he would use two turntables to play the same break over and over again. When one record would finish the section, he’d switch to the other — and back and forth for as long as he wanted. This is known as “looping” and became the basis of rap and hip-hop.

(Here’s [a fun* Drunk History *episode](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/0p91hq/drunk-history-the-birth-of-hip-hop) explaining DJ Kool’s influence.)

According to [*Four Over Four](http://www.fouroverfour.jukely.com/culture/history-of-rap-hip-hop/):*
> “From there, the Bronx sensation known as hip-hop was unstoppable. The 1970s allowed all the DJs to flourish, including other Bronx-based legends like Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash. And although throughout the ’70s, the DJ was the dominant force, the MC also rose to prominence. Kurtis Blow was the first rapper signed to Mercury Records in 1979. The Fatback Band and Sugar Hill Gang released mainstream records, hitting the Billboard Top 40 in the following year. These records were mostly MC-driven because the most famous DJs of the time were uninterested in recording their music, preferring to gain notoriety through their parties.”

### **Timeline: The 1980s-2000s**

1980s — DJ Grand Wizard Theodore invents the act of scratching and the “needle drop.” The needle drop is when the DJ would physically lift up and drop the needle where they wanted to cut into the song. Scratching is when the DJ moves the record back and forth to make a beat or rhythmic sounds.

![Grandmaster Flash](1*0LlHXUKSdtlbL6KJiBwZZg.png)*Grandmaster Flash*

1982 — MCs Melle Mel and Ed “Duke Bootee” Fletcher debut a song called “The Message.” This marks the end of the party-oriented DJ and the beginning of MC-driven rap.

1984 — This marks the start of “The Golden Era” of rap in New York. As rhymes get more complicated, beats faster, and technology improves, each song seems to be more innovative than the last.

Late 1980s — Rap expands from the East Coast the West Coast creating a rivalry.

1990s — The coastal rivalry grows, creating distinct groups, fans, and types of rap. This is also the time when women begin to step into the rap game.

2000s — Rap continues to grow in popularity. The storytelling and rhymes become more complex.

2003 — “Lose Yourself” by Eminem is the first hip-hop song to win an Academy Award.

### **Where We Are Today**

Technology has advanced expanding the possibilities of what artists can do. Rhymes have gotten more complicated, styles more distinct, and the beats more unpredictable.

Rap has a colorful history and has influenced American culture in many ways. And it’s not going away. Last year, [rap even overtook rock as the most popular music genre](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/01/03/rap-overtakes-rock-most-popular-genre-among-music-fans-heres-why/990873001/).

# There’s one simple thing great communicators do…prompt talking.

## There’s one simple thing great communicators do…prompt talking.

There’s one thing I’ve noticed that great communicators do. It keeps your eyes moving on the page, or it makes a circle form around them at a party.

It’s something I’ve observed, but that I’ve never heard talked about. I don’t know where these people learn it. I’ve learned it by watching.

I’m not yet sure what to call it. I call it “prompt talking.” You could also call it “onion talking,” but that conjures up images of halitosis. Maybe it already has a name, and I haven’t heard it.

When you prompt talk, you do something that few people intuitively do: You slowly reveal information. You “prompt” the listener to keep listening. Each statement you make gives out information, but at the same time leaves the listener begging for more information.

If someone catches their cat stealing cookies from the cookie jar, they’re likely to tell the story like this:

“I caught Max stealing cookies from the cookie jar today. It was so funny, blah, blah…”

You stop listening to this person immediately. It’s like getting a “spoiler” right before watching a thriller.

What they’re doing reveals the narcissism with which we all struggle. They’re living the story in their own head. They’re feeling their own reaction. They think that by telling you the event that finally gave them that reaction, you’ll feel the same way. They forget about all of the details leading up to the event, which gave that event significance.

A prompt talker does it differently. They tell the story like this:

“I came home yesterday. I was exhausted. I didn’t have the energy for what was about to happen. It was strangely quiet. I thought, ‘Oh, no, I must have left the back door open. Oh, no, Max ran away!…’”

It’s full of “prompts.” Each piece of information that is revealed leaves more information yet to be uncovered. What “was about to happen?” Why was it so quiet? Oh my god, is your cat missing!?

It’s important to make a distinction here. Prompt talking is a complement to other devices at work in this story. It’s impossible to extract these devices, because they’re so central to good storytelling.

The teller is revealing their own emotional state: “exhausted.” They’re subtly raising the stakes with this information. They’re also misdirecting you with their own worries about Max running away.

All of these serve to build up to a more interesting reveal—that Max was raiding the cookie jar. These devices are hard to separate from the device of prompt talking. They’re all intertwined.

Prompt talking is not necessarily adding emotional state, nor is it necessarily misdirection. It is simply revealing information, one bit at a time. This is why I’m also tempted to call it “onion talking.” You’re peeling off each layer of the onion.

It helps if, as you’re revealing one piece of information at a time, you’re also revealing the most question-provoking information each time.

Once you’re aware of prompt talking, you see it everywhere. [Seth Godin](https://twitter.com/ThisIsSethsBlog) is a master prompt talker. Here’s just one statement from when I interviewed [Seth on my podcast](http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/seth-godin-podcast/). (I cited this quote in my recent [self-publishing](https://writingcooperative.com/24-things-i-learned-publishing-3-books-in-only-6-months-1b8f743e9e86) article.)
> *“If you’re publishing yourself, you have the most committed publisher in the world…. You’re still going to be the head of marketing for your book. So how do you learn that? Well, you learn it by doing. And the easiest way to do it…is to come out with a book a week on the Kindle…. It costs nothing to do this. It costs less than it cost me to mail my proposals to book publishers. So what are you waiting for!?” — Seth Godin*

I was going to bold all of Seth’s prompts in this statement, but the entire statement is prompts. Some of it is withholding information, some of it is making bold statements that bring about questions, and some of it is presenting big ideas one piece at a time, so they can be digested.

“the most committed publisher in the world”? Really? Tell me more!

“how do you learn that?” (A very deliberately-posed prompt.)

“a book a week on the Kindle”? That’s nuts! I need a moment to process this.

Imagine if he instead said, “even if you have a traditional publisher, you have to market your book anyway, so you should publish lots of books because it’s free.”

Way less impact. There are too many big ideas at once. It just goes speeding by, like the last train of the night.

People hate to admit that they like prompt talking. They don’t need their information “dumbed down.” They may look at my bizarro-Seth-Godin statement above, and claim that they would prefer it. They’re plenty smart, and can understand compound sentences just fine, thank you.

Or consider one of the many criticisms of Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. People loved to share articles criticizing him for speaking at a fourth-grade level. Part of that is due to his prompt talking. Anyone who is successful in politics has mastered prompt talking. Just watch.

Maybe some people really prefer compound sentences, with many ideas at once, but it’s very few people. If you don’t prompt talk, the world punishes you. They don’t read your articles, they don’t share your book, and they look for someone else at the party to talk to. There are too many other articles and books to command their attention. They have a smartphone in their pocket—which is a portal to more interesting people.

Some may say that prompt talking is annoying. It feels repetitive. You feel manipulated when you’re being strung along. “Just give me the damn information!”

It’s true, when you lay on prompt talking too thickly, it sounds contrived. When you’re aware of prompt talking, it’s even more likely to sound contrived.

I can think of a couple of authors to whom I can’t stand to listen, all because they are such heavy prompt talkers. You know what, though? They also sell a ton of books.

If you prompt talk everything, something might happen. It might annoy a few people. It also might make your communication more successful with many more people. How do you know how much prompt talking to do? You try it. You try it as much as you can.

I bet there’s a balance in how much prompt talking you can do. If most of what you say is prompt talking, people will understand you. Your message will get across more easily. But—every once in awhile—for dramatic effect, and for the sake of tying together all of your prior concepts, throw in a nice compound sentence, with some en dashes or semicolons; your listener won’t feel so patronized, nor manipulated.

# The Effort is Always Within Your Control But the Results Are Not

## Photo by Patryk Grądys on Unsplash

We put a great deal of energy into things we don’t control. A couple of days before the launch of [my recent book](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733), I called my agent in a panic because our pre-order numbers were low.

After chatting with her, I realized that there were things I didn’t control:

* I couldn’t control how many people opened our emails or clicked on the links

* I couldn’t control how many people decided to buy the book after [hearing about it on our podcast](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/srini-rao-audience-one-reclaiming-creativity-sake/)

After that, I sat down and made a list of all the things I could control:

1. Writing articles like this one

1. Asking friends in my network for help

1. Promoting my appearances on other podcasts

1. Writing the book launch emails for our newsletter

1. Delivering the most valuable experience I could for the students in my creative live class about [designing systems that fuel creativity](https://www.creativelive.com/class/design-systems-that-fuel-your-creativity-srinivas-rao?via=autocomplete).

For the next 3 days, that’s precisely what I did. People in my network helped me promote the book via social media. Others offered to send emails to their lists. And the students in my creative live class were happy with the content of my course.
> # Shifting your focus from what you don’t control to what you do decreases your anxiety and increases your productivity

When we’re focused on what we don’t control, we’re paralyzed by thought. When we’re focused on what we do control action fuels us. When we focus on what we control, we act on what the authors of The 4 Disciplines of Execution call lead measures.

Say that you have a goal to increase the number of subscribers to your email list. 4 activities will eventually lead to that.

* Conversion rates on a landing page

* Traffic to a Website

* The popularity of an article

* The Number of Articles you publish

Out of these, the one that you have complete control over is the number of articles you publish. That’s your lead measure. By acting on the lead measure, you guarantee progress. You might even end up exceeding your goal. If you’re serious about accomplishing your goal, act on the lead measures.

The results are rarely in your control, and the effort is always within your control:

* You can control how many days you show up to work out if you want to lose weight.

* You can control how many sales calls you make if you want to earn a certain amount of money

* You can control how many words you write or how many hours per day you write if you want to write a book
> # Focusing on what you don’t control is a recipe for misery and disappointment.

You fall just short of your weight loss or income goal. Rather than being proud of the progress you’ve made, you view your entire effort as a failure. You create something your proud to put your signature on and overlook how much you’ve grown or evolved because the results didn’t meet your expectations.

The effort is how you [reach an audience of millions by creating for an audience of one.](https://medium.com/s/story/to-reach-an-audience-of-million-create-for-an-audience-of-one-4e873b4ac998)

# 7 Proven Strategies For Supercharging Your Productivity

## Photo by Clark Tibbs on Unsplash

When I was in my twenties, I used to lie awake at night thinking about my ever-growing To Do list. I wondered how I’d get through it all the next day without getting fired.

I’m far from alone.

According to the Health and Safety Executive in the UK, 526,000 UK workers reported they had experienced work-related stress, depression or anxiety in 2016–17.

In this article, I’ll give you seven proven productivity strategies that will help you take charge of your time and do more of what you want to do.

## 1. Start With The End In Mind

It’s easy to spend the day on busywork: long meetings, lengthy email chains, an endless stream of notifications and more.

Instead, clarify what you want to have accomplished by the end of each week. Then work toward that.

Depending on your priorities, these steps might include a set number of sales calls, a newly launched marketing campaign or a series of customer interviews.

Only then, make room for smaller activities that sap your time and energy.

As a writer, for example, my output includes one to three finished articles per week. I can make time for Twitter and Instagram after I’ve finished writing those articles.

## 2. Do It Right Away If It Takes Less Than Two Minutes

This productivity strategy comes from the author of *Getting Things Done* David Allen.

The psychological burden that comes with postponing tasks and writing them on your To Do list often [takes far more time](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2018/06/14/effective-time-management/#691bb78b1938) than if you’d attended to the item immediately.

You’ll be surprised by what you can accomplish in 120 seconds, but if the activity takes longer, write it on your To Do list.

In *Getting Things Done,* Allen wrote,
> “The rationale for the two-minute rule is that that’s more or less the point where it starts taking longer to store and track an item than to deal with it the first time it’s in your hands — in other words, it’s the efficiency cutoff.”

## 3. Own Your Calendar

![“An open calendar with short notes scribbled next to the dates” by [Eric Rothermel](https://unsplash.com/@erothermel?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*O7r-SOJAzoSPqOyM)*“An open calendar with short notes scribbled next to the dates” by [Eric Rothermel](https://unsplash.com/@erothermel?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

Your calendar is one of your most valuable assets; guard it wisely.

[Elon Musk](https://medium.com/@BryanJCollins/5-ways-elon-musk-accomplishes-the-impossible-c3894acbce51), for example, plans out every minute of his day including when he eats [and sleeps](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/).

That’s an extreme example.

Still, at the end of day, review your calendar to see who you met with and how you spent your time. Consider what meetings or activities energised you and which ones ran over.

If you’re on a key project, block book an hour or two in your calendar for working on this project before the demands of the day take over.

## 4. Prepare Your Work In Advance

Have you ever sat down at your desk first thing, read the news, checked your email and thought about doing everything but work?

Then when you finally feel guilty enough to start, you spend another thirty minutes opening up your work and looking for your notes and a place to begin.

Instead, prepare your work the night before. Arrange your tools and research in one place. Leave a note to yourself about exactly where to start.

You might, for example, record the phone number of a customer next to a list of questions to ask.

The trick is to make it as easy as possible to start work when you sit down the following day. You don’t want to have to spend any time looking for what you need.

## 5. Harness The Power Of Small Daily Wins

Isaac Newton’s first law of motion states:
> An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

This applies to accomplishing more each week too.

In other words, if you gain a little momentum on a project by working on it for just 30-minutes, you’re far more likely to sustain this momentum for the working week.

Alternatively, if you attempt to power through a project during a single three- or four-hour block of work, it will take a lot more of your energy and time.

## 6. Track Yourself Like A Boss

The old productivity maxim “What gets measured gets done” is attributed to Peter Drucker among others.

You can track yourself by recording how long you spend on tasks for a couple of days. You don’t need to do this in the long-term, but if you know how you’re spending your time, you can decide what activities to purge and do more.

An app like Harvest is useful for tracking how you’re spending your hours. Or you could simply record your working day for a week in a spreadsheet.

Then on Friday, you can see what’s taking longer or less time than you imagined. You can also see if you’re spending enough time on key projects and too much on less valuable activities. This knowledge will enable you to plan for the week ahead.

## 7. Hold A Weekly Review

![“A standing man writing on sheets of paper on a desk with a cup and pastries” by [rawpixel](https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*mXnx03IxPzpMtjbq)*“A standing man writing on sheets of paper on a desk with a cup and pastries” by [rawpixel](https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

The weekly review is an effective productivity strategy for the overwhelmed.

I also learned about the weekly review several years ago from Allen, and it’s helped me avoid feeling stressed over the weekend.

He wrote:
> “Most people feel best about their work the week before their vacation, but it’s not because of the vacation itself.”

What do you do the last week before you leave on a big trip?

You clean up, close up, clarify, and renegotiate all your agreements with yourself and others. I just suggest that you do this weekly instead of yearly.

Once a week, spend 30–60 minutes reviewing what you worked on, what lessons you learned and what you want to accomplish next week.

Remember, it’s natural to feel a little stressed while working on a big project, but lying awake at night feeling overwhelmed is a sign that you need to reprioritize.

# How To Stand Out From The Crowd

## “Confetti flying over the attendees of a concert at Dockville Festival” by Pablo Heimplatz on Unsplash
> **“You change the world by being yourself.”**
> **~Yoko Ono**

It seems everyone wants to stand out from the crowd these days. They want to have that viral article, they want one billion social media followers, they want to have an impact, they want to make a difference.

They run around copying each others YouTube Videos, Medium articles, social media posts, and even day to day conversations!

***One thing ***allows you to always stand out in all of this. There’s a reason some pieces of popcorn “pop” and but most don’t.

Know what it is?

It’s not making YouTube videos about Instagram tips & tricks.

It’s not writing Medium articles with traveling pictures.

It’s not posting inspirational quotes on Twitter.

It’s not about Snapchat Filters.

You know what really makes a person stand out?

One word.
> # HONESTY.

When you speak from your truth people show up at your door. When you really express who you are, what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and connect to all things human that are you, people get excited quickly.

All the other stuff. It’s fluff. It’s cute fluff. Some folks like cute fluff. It’s good short term. But the real, hardcore, truth about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it is what will make you not just achieve your goals, but be a leader among the masses (if you choose to be).

Be honest about your quirks, your flaws, your strengths, your weaknesses, and by all means give someone something they can relate to.

![Photo by [Nicholas Green](https://unsplash.com/@nickxshotz?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*gh2WdPXxexv_sl3M)*Photo by [Nicholas Green](https://unsplash.com/@nickxshotz?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

**People want to be inspired.**

Believe it or not, when you’re showing all your flaws and failures it in turn makes you look even cooler when you do deliver that slick Instagram photo or “on brand” looking YouTube Video. People want to take that journey with you.
> Show them truth in an often dishonest world.

All you have to do is sit back and start doing your reading, writing, and arithmetic from your inner truth. Do it with honesty. Make it real. Make people laugh. Make them cry. Make them dance. Then they’ll open their wallet. They’ll click “follow”. You’ll inspire because you made them feel something.

I come from an acting background. The most successful actors became movie stars for a reason. Know what that reason is?
> # Honesty.

When they took the stage or the camera lit up they would speak from their inner soul.

Wow could we ever use more of that these days.

There’s 15 million videos on YouTube about how to be a YouTube star. There’s 10 million articles on Medium about how to go viral. This is noise. Not truth.

Stop trying to look cool. Stop copying what others are doing and what all the brand experts are telling you. Just do you.

The more you do that, the more you’ll find what you’re looking for.

I promise.

See you soon.

# MilitaryByOwner.com — The Online Home For Relocating Military Families

## MilitaryByOwner.com — The Online Home For Relocating Military Families

A major, sudden move can be an incredibly jarring experience, but there are ways to ease the transition of your Permanent Change of Station (PCS). [MilitaryByOwner.com](https://www.militarybyowner.com/) is a veteran-owned business that seeks to alleviate your stress and make this move easier. Business owners and co-founders, Dave and Sharon Gran, have become the PCS gurus, a power couple seeking to make life better for relocating military families.

Through the years, the Grans had their share of PCS orders. They know firsthand that locating, leasing, buying and selling residences always present a challenge. But, it was Dave’s father who asked whether the military had a service to connect moving military families.

They researched and discovered many “for sale by owner” websites. Many of them were national, while others focused on a region. What they didn’t find was a page with the type of focus needed to support a military-needs niche. We talked with Dave and Sharon about their company and how it has effectively filled that void.


### **Their Life Of Service**

Dave and Sharon met at Southern Illinois University. Dave completed his aviation degree and enlisted in the Marine Corps. From there, they long-distance dated as he attended The Basic School (TBS) and then moved to the Field Artillery School (FAS). Immediately after he checked into his first unit, he asked for leave over Christmas, so he could wed Sharon. The happy couple have been married for 32 years and have four boys: Ryan, Kyle, Mark and Adam.

The Grans created MilitaryByOwner in 2000, a few years before Dave’s retirement. During those years, Sharon shouldered most of the weight of their new company. Currently, sons, Ryan and Adam, work alongside their parents as part of the MilitaryByOwner home office team.

Prior to her life as a military spouse, Sharon taught middle school math in Illinois and was a math/software consultant at a publishing company. After she married Dave, Sharon continued to teach math on base and at the local community college. She also stayed busy working to get her real estate license and carting the boys around to their hockey games.

Dave started his military career in artillery, but spent most of his 21 years of military service as an intelligence officer. The couple saw assignment to Camp Lejeune, Virginia Beach, Quantico and Camp Pendleton. Dave deployed to the Mediterranean with 24th MEU as BLT S-2. After a tour at the Atlantic Intelligence Command building contingency intel products for MEUs, Dave transferred to 15th MEU and did two Persian Gulf deployments. The next move took them to Marine Forces Europe as a G-2 followed by a tour at HQMC as Intel OccFld Sponsor and finally to the Marine Corps Systems Command before retiring.

### **Their Life In Business**

The Grans founded the company in 2000 after a PCS move home from Germany. Their experiences showed the need to connect military families that were selling or renting their homes related to inbound personnel PCS orders. It took a few years to gain acceptance, but eventually the business really took off.

They hired their first employee, a military spouse, in 2004. The Grans noted, “We were growing so fast that we almost went out of business prior to a major site rebuild launch that significantly improved our ability to handle the growth.”

The couple hired several more employees in 2005 and made the Inc5000 list of “America’s Fastest Growing Companies” in 2010 and 2011. To keep up with technology and the expectations of their marketing community, MilitaryByOwner.com has rebuilt their site from scratch four times since 2000 along with adding both iOS and Android apps. As Dave says, “We are currently in our fifth rebuild. It’s going to be an exciting launch for us, as we are adding many new capabilities to make home searching easier.”

Sharon and Dave look forward to the sponsorship opportunities that the Marine Corps Association & Foundation offers. They currently sponsor:

* [Sept 2018: MilSpouseFest (Norfolk)](https://militaryspouse.com/calendar/)

* [Sept 2018: Military Influencer Conference (Orlando)](https://militaryinfluencer.com/)

* [Dec 2018: MilSpouseFest (Camp Lejeune/Fort Bragg)](https://militaryspouse.com/calendar/)

* [Feb 2019: AFCEA/US Naval Institute WEST (San Diego)](http://www.westconference.org/west19/Public/enter.aspx)

MilitaryByOwner helps military families find, sell and rent homes near all the U.S. Military Bases. They also allow real estate agents and property managers to advertise homes to increase the choices around each base.

![](1*IV2CICil40cmE-yzrm7bsA.jpeg)

### **Their Debt To Military Service**

Dave’s 21 years in the Marines has clearly had the greatest impact on his life. As he remembers, “My experience was that you would always have responsibilities that were beyond what you were taught.” Responding to a PCS, he says, “you generally knew what to do from past assignments or training, but there were additional responsibilities that were new.”

As an entrepreneur, Dave values this experience in solving problems and learning new skills. He observes, “That is essentially what I did for 21 years in the Marines. From a leadership perspective, being a servant leader and taking care of your people remain a constant.”

The MilitaryByOwner vision is to be the first destination a military service member goes to place an advertisement online. The site leverages a powerful existing network that includes present and former military service members, along with their families and the communities that support them.

Optimizing the Internet links buyers and sellers of homes along with landlords and prospective tenants. The Grans promise to provide this service at a reasonable price with outstanding customer service. As they point out, “We are more than a website. We have built a world class customer service department staffed primarily from experienced military spouses with multiple PCS moves of their own.”

Dave and Sharon want to continue as the market leader in the military real estate niche. They see a market where, “When you PCS, MilitaryByOwner should be one of the first places to check when searching for your next home.”

MilitaryByOwner provides a comprehensive low cost means for military members and their families to advertise their homes for sale or rent. The service will be provided throughout the year and will include all locations where military members may be stationed including overseas assignments.

The company aggressively advertises across the web and other military publications, as well as leverages web-based search engine postings to attract to the site military personnel and the general public. Also helping to ease a PCS is that:

* Civilians and real estate professionals can advertise homes on MilitaryByOwner.com.

* The company offers extensive resource articles, blog posts and eBooks to start to bridge any information gaps.

As well, it’s worth noting that local and national businesses wanting access to the military market can find a good path through local business advertisements, national banner campaigns and a weekly newsletter with 490,000 current subscribers.

Picking up and starting over in a new place is often a daunting task. After all, you’re leaving a community and incredible memories. As a company co-founded by a Marine and his spouse, MilitaryByOwner.com has a very deep understanding of this. With that experience as their guide, they’ve stepped up and helped many military families to ensure there are some elements of a PCS that are easier and much less stressful than ever before.

# 4 Questions CEOs Should Ask Themselves Before Writing Their Own Book

## 

Writing and publishing a book is an important goal for many CEOs, and it’s no secret why.

Publishing a successful and well-written book can raise your visibility and garner you positive media coverage for your company, product, or service. It lends authority and credibility. And publishing a book can even tangibly help your business in that it can serve as a tool for both recruitment and sales. In this sense, a published book is like the ultimate business card.
> # But CEOs with literary aspirations would be wise to consider this fact: book writing isn’t for everyone.

In fact, if you’re thinking about writing and publishing a book, it’s important to ask yourself a few questions before you dive into the process, just to ensure you’re not setting yourself up for failure or disappointment. Here are some of the key ones to think about.

## **1: Why am I writing a book?**

If you answered, “To make lots of money,” then writing a book likely isn’t for you.

In short, the chances of you [getting rich](https://authorunlimited.com/book-sales-dont-make-you-money-client-business-model/) from publishing one book are extremely slim. A vast majority of writers who publish books through traditional means barely break even on their advance — which, most of the time, is a loan, not a payment — and the indie market is notoriously competitive. Only a handful of books, published either independently or traditionally, make meaningful amounts of money in any given year — a low number considering that *thousands *of books are published each year.
> It’s better, instead, if your aim is smaller and more measurable, like taking your business or life in a new direction, getting onto some podcasts to share your message, or attracting a handful of qualified clients.

That said, CEOs write for a variety of different reasons that aren’t monetary. Some write to advance a social cause. This is often the case with retired executives embracing an opportunity to focus their time on an issue that holds deep philanthropic resonance for them.

Others write purely to provide value for the reader. Jack Welch, who ran General Electric from 1981 to 2001, shared the history of his time at the helm in his book *Straight From The Gut*, offering remarkable insight in the process. Howard D. Schultz, chairman and CEO of Starbucks, designed his book, *Pour Your Heart Into It,* as something of a textbook for aspiring CEOs. It’s full of actionable lessons that business leaders can implement into their work right away, like the importance of prioritizing quality, instilling discovery in customers, and cultivating loyalty.

Ultimately, each of these CEOs had worked out exactly *why* they wanted to write a book before they started. This is key to success, as it allows you to purposefully identify what you’re working toward, and whether that goal is realistic or genuine.

## **2: Why are *you* the best person to write this book?**

This question is equally important as the preceding one. It amounts, essentially, to a marketing question: what about *you *makes you the most compelling and marketable author for this topic or idea?

Are you an expert in the topic? Have you conducted interesting and essential research on it? Are you telling a story that you’re intimately familiar with or overly passionate about? You’re more likely to write an engaging book that you can convincingly and effectively promote if you are.

Will you be totally unable to write an intriguing or compelling book if you’re *not* an expert on the subject, or if you’re not initially passionate about the topic? Not necessarily. But writing books is difficult, and this level of interest or insight will make the process easier. It will also increase your credibility with readers — and that, when it comes to selling your book, is critical.

## **3: Am I prepared for the writing process?**

Many CEOs, somewhat unfortunately, underestimate exactly how hard writing a book is. There are a variety of challenges, including:

* **Time.** Writing is a hard-won skill, accrued through daily practice and diligence. To write a book, you’ll need to write every day, multiple hours a day, for many months.

* **Humility. **Many CEOs fancy themselves better writers than they actually are. The truth is, most business leaders are great communicators, but giving a good speech or writing a great memo isn’t the same thing as writing a book.

* **Planning. **Whether you’re writing a novel or a work of nonfiction, the effectiveness of your book writing process — whether or not it takes you years or months to complete your book — hinges on planning. Many new authors just dive in, but this is a mistake. You need to outline, storyboard, and map out the logical trajection of the writing *before *you start writing — and this is hard. The first step is identifying your key ideas. When I wrote my book, *The End, Now What?, *I distilled the concept down to three key ideas that I wanted to flesh out succinctly. They guided me throughout the writing process:

1. Writing, publishing and selling a book is a personal and unique journey. Like snowflakes, no two projects are alike.

1. Self publishing is like being the CEO of your own personal publishing company: you have the responsibility and freedom to make every decision.

1. With every book there are six critical decision points that will determine its success.

## **4: How do you plan to publish this book?**

Of course, the publishing logistics are important to consider, too.

Namely, you need to decide if you’re going to publish through a traditional publishing house, or if you’re going to go the self-publishing route through a company like [BookBaby](https://www.bookbaby.com/). If you’re planning to seek out a traditional publisher, you’ll need to take time to find an agent and write a book proposal. And you’ll need to be prepared to send out query letters and attend meetings before you write more than the first chapter or two. Plus, you have to research *who* you’re going to approach — quite a project in itself.

If you decide to go the self-publishing route, then you can go ahead and write your book — but you’ll have more work to do at the back end. Make sure you’re familiar enough with [the pros and cons of traditional versus self-publishing](http://blog.bookbaby.com/2016/04/two-paths-of-book-publishing-infographic/) and that you’re prepared to be flexible — you may set out on one route and find the other is a better fit for you and your business.

At the end of the day, if you’re a CEO and you think you might want to write a book, before you dive into the process, ask yourself and seriously think about the questions above.

If after that critical self-reflection, you’ve determined that, yes, you *are *committed to writing a book, here are a few key pieces of advice to remember as you proceed through your journey:

* **Commit to it.** Writing a book is no different than preparing and executing on a product roadmap, except it’s your own personal product. Make this into a business goal.

* **Remove your ego.** Every book is going to receive some criticism. Enter into the process knowing that your writing will not please everyone.

* **Identify who your target audience is.** Simply saying that your potential readers are “everyone” is a recipe for disastrous results. Visualize the people who will most benefit from your thoughts, words, and ideas.

* **Don’t be afraid to get help.** Whether to write it, edit it, publish it, or promote it — there’s no shame in hiring experienced pros to produce a great book.

* **Don’t skimp on an editor.** It’s the same advice I give every single author. CEOs have a lot riding on the final product, and editing is an investment with the best possible ROI.

There’s more, of course, but this should give you a workable place to start. Now good luck!

# Do you suffer from Sunday Doom Syndrome?

## Do you suffer from Sunday Doom Syndrome?

Monday is not just any day of the week. It’s the chunky book cover that is peeled back to reveal the rest of your seven-day story. It kicks off the intentions you have for your time and energy, spring boarding you into the future. Monday is a cyclical, defining feature in the landscape of time that ticks and tocks, endlessly narrating a prologue of the working week.

Where do you find yourself on a Monday? Or, better question: how do you feel on Sunday night?

Most people respond with dread or indifference. Do you experience that nauseous, clawing, stressy feeling that approaches from 4pm onwards on Sunday afternoon, peaking just before bed? Do you experience a sense of desperation and wanting to claw back the clock when your alarm goes off Monday morning? Do you seriously consider calling in sick, making yourself sick or faking your own death to avoid Monday Morning?

If so, you might have Sunday Doom Syndrome (SDS).

SDS impacts 99% of humans on earth. It is an epidemic of boredom, desperation and stress that is brought on by proximity to a pointless job. The symptoms range in intensity and frequency depending on how stressful and crappy the job is. If, like I once did, you find yourself with SDS it is time to self-medicate and sort yourself out.

So let me tell you a story about Mondays and what the healing process of a recovering SDS sufferer might look like.

**The first Monday.**

My alarm goes off at 6 am. I shudder and pull the covers up around my head willing myself out of existence. The second alarm goes off and my stomach slowly creeps up my throat, where it will sit stewing and expanding for another three hours. The third alarm goes off and I now feel sick. SDS has kicked up a notch into full-blown Monday Mania. My feet hit the cold floor with the reluctance of an inmate, and I fumble in the dark for my work clothes (which is just like wearing an inmate’s uniform by the way, except that my cell is a cubicle). I exit the house, cursing all those still asleep inside and drag myself to the station. Suddenly, hundreds of feet stamp all over mine, bags push me in the face, my nose is dripping and I can’t even reach my tissues. Great. Like a helpless fish in a net I squeeze my way on and off two trains on my commute and grind my teeth through the whole experience. I check my watch, I’m early! This is good for two reasons, one I won’t get a public telling off from my manager and two I have time to swallow my stomach and shed a few tears in the bathroom before I go to my desk.

My manager sits opposite me and tirelessly berates my appearance, belittles my abilities and discounts my contribution. Sometimes I am not even allowed to **sit** down at my desk — I must stand up until I make a sale. If the light on the giant screen beside my name isn’t green it means I’m not on the phone, which is bad news. I find myself back in the bathroom. My manager also thinks I have a weak bladder and likes to tell everyone. But, it’s normally just to have another cry and makeup-applying session. Or, I am dodging an anxiety attack, scheming a broken leg with either a car accident or the stairs, or calling my twin sister to ask whether I could go to prison if I set off the fire alarm. I longingly check my watch again. 10.00 am. I hate being an adult.

**The Second Monday.**

My alarm goes off at 6.30. I pull back the covers and look out of my window in Central London to the sun creeping over the skyline. The room in my flat is small but it is mega cheap since I am a property guardian. I’ve yet to put up curtains and next-door had another party which meant I wasn’t asleep until 2 am. Highs and lows. I put on my shoes regardless and jog to the gym where I sweat it out for an hour, planning my day how I want. Home to shower, throw on whatever I feel comfortable in and blend a shake before grabbing my bike. Fumes, bustling city and traffic, but just one minute to my favourite coffee shop. I congratulate myself because the best table is free and the guy at the counter knows my order. I check my watch, I’m early! This is good for two reasons, one I can get a whole hour of work done before anyone from the team comes online (since I have about three people’s worth of work to do) and two, the whole team is finishing early because we’re having ‘team fun’ (aka cocktails and an escape room).

I log on to Slack and update my team — ‘WFC AM’ (work from coffee shop this morning). I’ve a big project on that makes my stomach crawl up into my throat and I don’t think I have the resources to complete it. However, the person who is supporting me is talented and cares. The people I am supporting are also talented and care. I am stretched and challenged, frustrated and afraid. But more alive and rewarded than I’ve felt in a while. I can do this. I check my watch again, wow midday already! Time to cycle 8 minutes into the office. This is more like it.

**The Third Monday.**

My alarm goes off at 7.30. This number changes depending on how I feel the night before. Nowadays, I’m not even sure whether it is Monday or some other day. This is because I no longer have a 9–5. In fact, I’m no longer even in the city where the 9–5's tend to converge. My feet hit the floor of a new (gorgeous) bedroom every few weeks and the novelty is thrilling. I pull on my gym kit and go to let out the animals I am looking after (generally dogs) into a huge garden and watch them race around. Love and cuddles quickly follow and I’ve not even had a cup of coffee yet. I pinch myself. I pull on my shoes and take the dog(s) for a walk in the countryside, savouring the fresh air and discussing with my partner what our priorities are for the day. This varies between going to the gym, exploring a nearby castle, starting a project, finishing a blog post, working with a coaching client or WFH (work from housesit) on a 2-day-a-week project I enjoy, with a brand I care about.

I make an effort to not always be online. To savour and protect my time. To say yes to the things that truly bring me joy and make space for learning and growth. To savour the outdoors. To feel gratitude for not having to ‘check in’ or be anywhere I don’t want to be. Each housesit is different and my partner and I make time to take trips, go for long hikes and spend time together in nature. I check my watch, not because I care what time it is but more because I am trying to get at least 15,000 steps a day (and my Fitbit is also my watch). This is good for two reasons:

1. My work and life are finally balanced (perhaps even tilted slightly more towards life).

1. I still love to work.

I am earning less than I have since I was 20, but I am saving more than I did on 40k in the City. I have no rent to pay and even have a car. I see more of my family than I ever have and am learning more about myself in the process. It is a new pace of life but no less ambitious. Instead of achieving one big goal for one company I am 100% invested in, I am achieving many goals, am invested in several projects, plus my own and they’re all self directed. I am still relying on my ability to ‘get shit done’, my work ethic and tenacity, just as I always did but this time on my own terms. I am trying something new; taking a risk on making something of myself, for myself. It sounds radical because it sits outside the norm. Outside the 9 to 5. But is a 9–5 even normal in the first place? Looking back at my days chained to a desk, worrying my Sundays away or burning out in a startup, and I am not so sure.

Don’t get me wrong, I am still working. In fact I am working even harder in some ways now because I don’t have a cushy pay-check at the end of every month. I don’t have a clear strategy, end-of-year goals or team supporting me. I don’t have a house to live in permanently and I am not even sure I’ll be in the UK at the end of next month. I constantly worry about whether I am good enough to make this work and imposter Mel shows up to waggle her finger around way more times than she ever did before.

So, is it worth it? YES. Oh my God, yes. SDS is a thing of the past, but I remember it vividly enough to know that it is real and debilitating and still affects so many people.

Six years ago, at the start of my career I was terrified of handing in my notice to a boss who’d called me an air-head bimbo and made me believe it. But, I was even more scared that ‘this was it’, that ‘this is was good as it was going to get’ and I was doomed for the next 50 years. I though part-time work was for losers, people who ‘couldn’t hack it’ in the real world and, worse still, that maybe I was one of those people who just couldn’t hack it. I was angry and heartbroken that I’d believed all the lies of becoming a working adult and was fearful of letting down my parents. The nice suits I got to wear were stifling and were made to please the men. The salary I earned was not worth the time I spent in the office and every second that drained from the clock felt like a betrayal. My own betrayal of my own dreams and my own potential.

But, I didn’t settle and neither should you. I am writing to you, from a sun-trap patio in the countryside, to tell you there IS so much more waiting for you and that you deserve better. My Monday might not be your ideal Monday but if you don’t make time to figure out what that is you’ll never wake up there. We’re halfway through 2018 now! You are the only thing keeping you in your stressful job and waking up in your shitty Monday, suffering through SDS and ignoring your symptoms. Neither your mortgage, or your partner, or your career path, nor your tenure or shares is the problem here, nope. It’s you.

The worst and best part? You’re the **only person** who is waking up in your Monday. It might suck now yes, but you’re also the only one with the power to change it. You have to start somewhere. So, why not start today? Then one day soon (sooner than if you started tomorrow) you’ll be living differently and you’ll thank yourself for it.

So pick paint a picture of your ideal Monday, then go work for it.

Thanks to the Summer Solstice for inspiring us to check back in on our lives. If you enjoyed it, please clap and share or send to a friend who has chronic SDS.

# Salesforce and Apple join forces&#58; Here’s What it Means!

## Salesforce and Apple join forces

Salesforce announced that it is teaming up with Apple to drive new mobile apps for its business. The news broke out mere hours before Salesforce’s tech conference “Dreamforce”. Dreamforce is one of the top 5 tech events in the world and all anyone could talk about was what Salesforce and Apple have in store for their customers. Details regarding this strategic partnership still have people on their toes but we can make a couple of guesses as to what this could mean, for both Apple and Salesforce.

## Salesforce Einstein + Siri?

[**Salesforce Einstein](https://www.rolustech.com/blog/asking-einstein-salesforce-conversational-queries)** is the resident AI for all Salesforce platforms. It leverages machine learning and deep learning analytics to provide sales and marketing teams with a comprehensive 360-degree view of customers. Salesforce Einstein is embedded in all [**Salesforce Cloud](https://www.rolustech.com/salesforce-cloud)** platforms and provides predictive analysis functionalities to maximize conversions from the sales cycle.

Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, while talking about the partnership with Apple, said that Siri is the frontend and Salesforce will be the backend. Benioff hinted that users will be able to ask Siri to do a range of new tasks i.e. control lights, temperature of a room with their voice. Salesforce Einstein will leverage the data by tweaking itself depending on customer interactions and will consequently provide Siri with accurate and smarter data. It seems Siri will also be incorporated into Salesforce (Siri with [**Salesforce Support](https://www.rolustech.com/salesforce-support)** sounds nice!). Perhaps if we’re lucky, Salesforce Developers might be able to We’ve got our fingers crossed on more details that are sure to come in the weeks ahead!

## New Salesforce App for iOS

The joint statement from the two companies stated that Salesforce will soon be redesigning their app for iOS platforms. This will provide a rich experience to customers exclusively on iOS. The app will be integrated with Siri, face ID, and business chat. Salesforce plans on taking its app to new heights by tailoring it for industries to serve their customer needs as well. The tech industry is quickly moving towards a voice-specific interactive medium, this strategic partnership between Salesforce and Apple only goes to show how they’re both looking ahead of the curve!

## Our Two Bits!

Knowing Salesforce and Apple, the sky is the limit in terms of what they can do with this partnership. The question, however, arises over how effectively this could transform both of their businesses. They’re off to a good start and the maiden collaboration over Siri seems to have quite a few practical benefits. Here’s hoping the rest of the road ahead is just as seamless!

# Going Through A Lull At Work? Here Are 5 Ways To Find Passion No Matter What You’re Doing

## 

We’ve all been there. After some amount of time at a new job, or in a new position — or after *years* in the same industry — the excitement we once harbored for our work wanes, and we start coasting or falling into what some call a “lull.”

There have been several times in my own career when I’ve felt myself hit a lull. Sometimes it’s been a result of disaffection with the work — the sense that the company I worked for wasn’t fully utilizing my skills — and sometimes it’s followed a period of personal frustration with my team. I still, from time to time, hit these lulls, like I’m not being as productive as I could be, or my team isn’t realizing their fullest potential.

This feeling of hitting a plateau is remarkably common. Some say it’s an all-out [American epidemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/85percent-of-us-workers-are-happy-with-their-jobs-national-survey-shows.html). It’s also, in a way, human nature. We’re creatures of habit. As people, we seek out reliable repetition, yet repetition itself can lead to stagnation.
> **Regardless of how common, however, the truth remains: a decline in commitment to your work, or in your excitement about your work, is innately damaging. It can lead to both a drop in your professional performance* and *in your personal happiness.**

Given that, professional apathy needs to be actively combated.

Here are a few different tactics I’ve adopted both as a leader and as an employee over my career to help pull myself out of a lull.

## **1) Try to promote and facilitate collaboration.**

The chief source of complacency I’ve seen in the folks who’ve worked for me over the years has stemmed from siloed work environments. When day after day you work alone at your desk, completing only the tasks you’re responsible for, you lose sight of the company mission which might have galvanized you initially. You begin to feel like you can’t accomplish as much as you might want. You feel limited and alone.
> It’s better, instead, to foster or encourage an environment that’s inherently more collaborative — one where your people are inspired to contribute and compelled to do so in creative, important ways.

This is something you can do as a manager or director by rearranging your teams, modeling the sort of collaboration you want to see more of, or otherwise adjusting key elements of your culture so that your people are more meaningfully incentivized to collaborate. You can work to build that into your foundation.

As an individual employee, meanwhile, you can seek out opportunities to go above and beyond, in this sense, and create value alongside your peers in a way that might open new doors for systemic collaboration in the future. The key is looking for and then summoning the energy required to capitalize on those opportunities.

## **2) Take a “field trip.”**

If there’s something specific you’re trying to accomplish at work but you either aren’t feeling motivated to do it or you don’t know exactly* how* to do it, go out and conduct some research.

Find someone you know or whom you know of who has the wisdom or intelligence you’re after. Then, go observe them in action. If you’re looking to restructure your organization, for example, pay a visit to a company who already has a similar structure in place.

Or, go to a place, event, or lecture that’s semi-relevant to the work you’re doing. This is something we’ve done as a team at World Changers by attending conferences together. Through those events and by engaging in team-building activities, we’ve left feeling energized and motivated to contribute more meaningfully to our work. You might be surprised how much it could fuel you and your team with the same inspiration.

And that’s the key: this is something you can do on your own* or* with your colleagues. You’ll be surprised by how breaking out of your routine and expanding your perspective even for just one day can open your eyes to new opportunities and means of reinvigorating your work.

## **3) Read!**

Similarly, our outputs, in general, are a direct product of our inputs. So, if you’re ever in a rut, go pick up a book and re-acquaint yourself with the experts and authors who themselves have spent lots of time thinking about the very things you’ve been struggling over.

Studying the solutions, ideas, and minds of others can prove a great source of inspiration. Light bulbs go off when you read. You either say to yourself, “Oh, I’ve never thought of X like that,” or you say, “Wow, *I *can do this!”
> # By reading about people or organizations who have been in similar situations, you can learn how to combat the specific lull you’re facing.

As a manager, it’s crucial you encourage your teams to invest in their inputs. For example, I recently had my team at [World Changers](https://www.worldchangers.org/) read *Necessary Endings* by Dr. Henry Cloud to help all of us spark new, more creative ideas for taking our work to the next level and getting even better as an organization. It worked so well, it’s now something I ask my people to do once every few years.

## **4) Ask for feedback.**

Asking your manager, director, or CEO for feedback on your performance can also be an excellent way to reset your perspective. Often, these constructive conversations will help you do things like set new milestones or establish new objectives to focus on.

As it turns out, that intentionality is crucial toward developing professionally. It’s a means of combating our natural human tendency to become complacent in our routines. And to this end, it’s on us to “own” our cognitive development. This is good in and of itself, but it’s also a great thing to do anytime you feel yourself becoming complacent.

Energy is useless if it’s not directed toward something tangible and specific.

## **5) Secure an outlet unrelated to your work to focus on in your down time.**

Finally, if all you have in your life to direct your energy towards is work — creative or otherwise — you’ll burn out or grow bored.

For me, finding a few other things I really cared about and that I could work to improve at made me happier in my personal life, as well as more focused when I was in the office. For me, this was interior design and travel. By focusing on getting better and more creative at the former, and allowing myself to reset and relax by way of the latter, I found I was able to return to the office each morning more fresh and ready to kill it.

## **Here’s the truth: at the end of the day, unless you challenge *yourself *to continue growing and developing, you’ll inevitably stagnate.**

In other words, this is on you.

All of us are in control over our own destinies and our own minds. All of us possess the power to combat professional stagnation. It’s a matter of being self-aware enough to realize when you or the team you’re in charge of need to make a change, refocus, or simply try harder.

It just so happens that doing this is essential not just to our satisfaction in our work and in our personal lives, but also in our continual development and growth as people and professionals.

# Why Visualizing Our Dreams Every Day Is Monumentally Important

## 
> My dream is to [travel the world](http://findingtom.com).

I want to wake up in another country on the other side of the world and go out to breakfast. Then I want to sit by the water and watch foreigners walk past me. I want to think about my home.
> # Then I’ll catch the scent of foreign food cooking nearby. I’ll see grandparents walking their grandchildren around and bikers whizzing by on their way back to work.

I’ll sit there feeling content and then I’ll probably pull out a book to write in. I’ll write about all the things I just said.
> And then whoever I’m traveling with will sit down next to me and I’ll pull my pen off the page like the needle on a record player.

Then I guess we’ll sit there and talk about what we’ve done, and how we can’t believe we’re here, and where we want to go and do after this.

## You Should Think Of The Future All The Time

What a nice picture. When I think of this particular scene, it gets me super excited. I’ve already sort-of accomplished it, but not all the way yet.

> I mean, there’s other things too. I want to surf in Hawaii and travel to Skellig Michael in Ireland. I want to see the Great Wall of China and ride a camel near the pyramids.

Most of all I want to scuba dive in the Great Barrier Reef. Yeah, that’s like the ultimate travel goal right there (behind eating In-N-Out again).
> # “A human being always acts and feels and performs in accordance with what he imagines to be true about himself and his environment…For imagination sets the goal ‘picture’ which our automatic mechanism works on.
> # We act, or fail to act, not because of ‘will,’ as is so commonly believed, but because of imagination.”
> # ― Maxwell Maltz

I write this because I have such a clear image of how I want my life to go. The next three or four years are written off to a life on the road. If I stay in America, and get a job in some corporate jail cell, I will consider my twenties a failure. I write about [that sort of thing](https://findingtom.com/want-happiness-graduation-10-things/) all the time. It’s just not in the cards.

![](1*cF4U8dh8_eFmyfGwApfgog.jpeg)

![A few mementos from my 2016 road trip](1*pdML2hPMn6j-mVtO5W8HhQ.jpeg)*A few mementos from my 2016 road trip*

A friend of mine just visited Antarctica and she was supposed to come back to New York City already.

She didn’t.

She decided to stay on the road for another week. I hope she never comes back. And it’s nothing against New York City — it could’ve been any city — it’s just that I hope she continues to do what she wants to do.
> We all have different dreams.

Others might write about how they dream to get a job in San Francisco.
> # They might talk about crossing the Bay Bridge for work every day, and spending weekends at Fisherman’s Wharf, and walking their dog over near Lands End with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. Doesn’t that sound like a beautiful life?

That’s because I dream of this scenario also — it’s just not one I’m pursuing at the moment.

## What’s Your Dream?
> “You cannot advance if you cannot visualize the end from the start.”
> ― **Nabil N. Jamal**

What’s your dream? What’s your perfect life? Think of the perfect day, and all the people you’d like to see, and all the places you’d like to go.
> Our dreams will likely change, though.

I guess our whole lives we’re just picking up different dreams. Based on the people we meet and the way our own journey winds along, we’re bound to change our mind a few times.

Sometimes a place or person just takes hold of us like the claw from Toy Story.
> # I think it’s important to outline our dream though. Think about every detail.

I’m a firm believer in the law of attraction. I believe it because we always end up where we’re aiming in the end — for the most part. It just depends on how much persistence someone has, I guess.

My dream is to [travel the world](https://youtu.be/rnVIQUNqW-8).
> Get lost in a culture. Eat something I don’t want to. Take selfies with the locals. Kayak in a lagoon. Climb a rock wall. See a polar bear. View the northern lights. Just, overall, have a badass life. Yeah, that’s what I want.

What about you?

Spend a few more minutes every day dreaming your heart out. Imagine every detail. There are no rules.

Let me know what your dream is below. :)

# Why Your Goals Might be Making You Miserable

## 

What if your goals are the source of your misery? It’s an odd question given that the internet is littered with success porn, self-help is a billion dollar industry, and we’re taught at every moment in our lives to be goal oriented. But in doing so, we fail to take into account the eternal gap between who we are and who we want to become.

## Hedonic Adaptation
> *We elevate those things we want, those things we would prefer to have, into things we believe we must have; we feel we must perform well in certain circumstances or other people must treat us well. Because we think these things must occur, it follows that it would be an absolute catastrophe if they did not. No wonder we get so anxious: we’ve decided that if we fail to meet our goal it wouldn’t be merely bad, but completely bad- absolutely terrible. — Oliver Burkeman*

One of our greatest delusions is that [accomplishing our goals will lead to everlasting happiness](https://unmistakablecreative.com/long-term-happiness/). Whether that’s making a certain amount of money, losing a specific amount of weight, or getting married, eventually what you once thought would bring you so much joy becomes normal because of hedonic adaptation. The pleasurable emotions you once derived from something you previously didn’t have will eventually decline.

There are times in all of our lives when we get something we wanted more than anything in the world. The buzz we get from it feels amazing, but it doesn’t permanently solve our problems or change the way we see ourselves.

There was a time when I thought getting a book deal with a publisher would make me feel like the king of the world, prove all my naysayers wrong, and make me feel like I had finally arrived. But it was a false horizon that made me realize there’s no such thing as an “I’ve made it” moment. That’s when the work really begins.

Even if you succeed by selling thousands of copies or hitting a best-seller list, that doesn’t mean you’ve made it. As an editor told Ryan Holiday, “Success gives you the conditional opportunity to try again.” You get to spend another two years alone in a room, tapping away at a keyboard, out of the spotlight, where nobody is paying any attention to you.

Actors and musicians don’t suddenly have magical lives when they finally get cast in a leading role, win an Oscar, or their album sells a million copies. Some of them end up committing suicide while appearing on the surface to have everything.

Take hedonic adaptation into account when you’re setting goals. Even if you get what you want more than anything in the world, the career, the romantic partner, the Ferrari or the Mcmansion, eventually it will be your normal life.

## Did You Really Choose the Goal?
> *Our motivations are heavily informed by the media. Our social feeds are populated by endless images of wealth, travel, power, relaxation, beauty, pleasure and Hollywood love. This virtual runoff perpetually seeps into our consciousness, polluting our sense of reality and self worth every time we go online. We compare our lives to these largely artificial constructs and structure our plans accordingly, hoping to eventually afford a golden ticket to these misleading fantasies — Ryder Caroll*

In many cases, our goals are arbitrary. We want to become millionaires because books, blog posts, and other forms of success porn define this as financial success. We want “fuck you” money because TV shows like Billions show us it’s the key to a glamorous life. We want to build unicorns because it would turn us into Silicon Valley royalty.

But so often these aren’t goals you chose. They are handed to you from the world around you. You’re taught to choose from the options in front of you, while blinded to the possibilities that surround you.

Take something like the financial goal of becoming a millionaire. Most people set the goal, but if you ask them what they would do with a million dollars they list a few things, but don’t know much else. In our conversation on the Unmistakable Creative, Yanik Silver told me about a client who wanted to become a billionaire. When he made a list of what he wanted to do with his money, he realized that he didn’t need to become a billionaire for any of it. If he made less, he might not end up on the cover of a magazine, but at least he’ll have the life he wants.

## Are Your Goals Based on Lived Experience?

When I applied to business school in 2006, my dream was to work in the entertainment industry. I wanted to be the next Ari Gold or pick what went on the air. But in my first semester at Pepperdine, I got a rude awakening. MBA’s didn’t get hired for creative work and if you wanted to do creative work, you had to start at the very bottom.

Instead of getting a summer internship in the entertainment industry, I ended up as the social media intern at Turbotax. It wasn’t exciting, but paid extremely well. I started my first blog at that job, planting the seeds for my life as a writer, podcast host, and creator. If it hadn’t been for that job I might have never realized you could use the internet to express your creativity.

I thought I wanted to pick what went on the air and be in management in the entertainment industry. But deep down, what I wanted was to create what went on the air, and today I get to do that with multiple forms of media: books, podcasts, animation, etc.

Often our goals aren’t based on lived experience. People decide they’re passionate about becoming doctors when they’ve never taken a science class or set foot in a hospital. People say they want to be investment bankers without a clue about how much work actually goes into the job. If you want to base your goals on lived experience, don’t follow your passion. Pay attention to what you find engaging instead.

I’m not against having goals. At its core, The Unmistakable Creative is a personal development company. But, even a [Harvard Neuroscientist’s advice on goal setting i](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/srini-pillay-accomplish-personal-professional-goals-2018/)sn’t going to make a meaningful difference if you’re working on the wrong goals. Maybe your goals are the source of your misery. Try living without them for a while. You might accomplish more than you dreamed was possible and become a hell of a lot happier.

# Gold Medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings On How Winning Led To Obtaining A Wealth Of Life Advice

## 

What makes Kerri Walsh Jennings remarkable?

For starters, she’s the Muhammad Ali of beach volleyball — the undisputed greatest in the game. She owns three Olympic gold medals. 133 career victories. And she’s a two-time[ Sportswoman of the Year Award](https://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/programs/awards/sportswoman-of-the-year/) recipient.

I was pretty pumped to chat with Kerri about her career — and more specifically, her philosophy on drive and inspiration. On the podcast, she shared why being an inspired person and living an inspired life mean so much to her.

In this article, I list the most insightful takeaways from that incredible conversation. So get out your notepads, because this inspirational woman and athlete has a wealth of valuable life advice to share with you.

## Discipline liberates and the consistency feels great.

To Kerri, discipline is “a beautiful word.”

As former Navy SEAL and famed author Jocko Willink says, “Discipline equals freedom.” It’s also the title of his [best-selling book](https://www.amazon.com/Discipline-Equals-Freedom-Field-Manual/dp/1250156947) — and is a life philosophy Kerri fully subscribes to. Personally, she defines discipline as “showing up and doing what it takes on the daily.” She says having discipline in her life “allows me to breathe, it allows me to accomplish, and it allows me the space to maneuver in.”

To Kerri, discipline is mindfulness, awareness, and fortitude. Over the years, she has learned to deeply think about everything she consumes — from social media to books to food. She’s become more sensitive with age (a good thing) and recognizes that everything she interacts with affects her in some big or small way, both mentally and emotionally. She remembers a time in her life when she didn’t pay enough attention to her influences and is happy to have grown up in that sense: to have become more disciplined.

## As a gold medalist, Kerri believes love for winning always wins.

And for Kerri, that love is undying.

Most recently, she and Brooke Sweat [took home third place](https://www.teamusa.org/News/2019/March/09/Kerri-Walsh-Jennings-Brooke-Sweat-Grab-Third-Place-In-Sydney) at an FIVB World Tour 3-star tournament in Sydney, Australia. 10 years ago, she would have considered that a failure. But today, she puts the result in perspective by acknowledging and appreciating the wins it took to place at all.

Above all, Kerri attributes her success to her love and desire to win. She views winning as “amazing, beautiful fuel” that keeps her going. “Winning is a habit that gets into your psyche and drives you crazy,” she said. “I love winning more than I hate losing.”

And, above all, she attributes her ability to win to her mental strength — “to compete at the highest level, you have to have your brain trained,” she said. What separates elite athletes from great athletes is less about skill and more about mental fortitude during crunch time, according to Kerri.

Kerri liked to call crunch time “tight moments” — until recently. During a session with Michael Gervais, the host of “[Finding Mastery](https://findingmastery.net/about-finding-mastery/),” a podcast that “explores how the best in the world master their craft,” Kerri discovered a way to better frame those high-pressure situations.

When Gervais noticed Kerri reference a “tight moment,” he interrupted her and said, “Kerri, there are no tight moments. It’s just another moment. You’re making it tight. Let’s reframe it; let’s call it a competitive moment.” She liked the idea of “competitive moments” a lot better. Especially once she realized that “all I’m there to do is be competitive and show up.”

When Kerri shows up, she makes sure she’s done what it takes to feels right mentally, because she knows that’s the best way to execute during competitive moments — and because, more than anything else, she loves winning.

## How she came to feel right at home as an Olympic gold medalist.

On the biggest stage in the world, of all places, is where Kerri feels most at home.

“I’m just an athlete playing a game I’ve played since I was 10 years old. At the Olympics, it’s so fun.” Of course, the noise, media and sheer weight of the Olympics can certainly distract an athlete from truly enjoy themselves — but only if they allow it. Kerri makes sure she always has fun at the Olympics by “creating a bubble” around herself. This mental bubble blocks out noise and helps her feel safe, focused, and poised to compete well — and helps her have fun while competing.

## Why her company is “her baby.”

Kerri knows how good it feels to hang a gold model around her neck after a hard-fought win on the court. Now, she craves a similarly fulfilling feeling from entrepreneurial success.

“The business world is really exciting. I feel like I’m getting a master’s degree every single day, learning so much. It’s a hell of a world,” she said. Last year, she launched [p1440](https://p1440.com/), a technology and event platform aiming to “redefine and modernize beach volleyball.” The company’s four pillar offerings include competition, health and wellness, personal development, and entertainment.

Kerri frequents major events to market the company, where she enjoys speaking passionately about the bright future she envisions for the sport she loves. “I don’t want to be just a canvas, I want to be a mouthpiece,” she said.

A few things Kerri has learned as an entrepreneur:

* Get your hands in the mud, in the sand whenever possible.

* Don’t assume anything. Don’t presume to know what others are thinking.

* When working on projects, play it step-by-step.

* Like in sports, your team and attitude are everything.

* When facing issues, be nimble and ready to adjust.

* At any company, having open, honest communication and a culture that holds people accountable is imperative.

* Like with sports, there’s a lot out of your control in a business. That’s tough for Type A personalities like Kerri. All you can do is focus 100% on the things you *can* control.

* Different people have different visions. Not every potential partner will want to work with you.

On an endnote, Kerri shared that she believes strongly in the tie between inspiration and motivation, but also in the distinct differences between the two. “I’m motivated by the money, I’m motivated by the glory, I’m motivated by these things that will come to me as a result of this on the outside. But to be inspired to me is a touch of God. It’s something that fuels your heart and your purpose in life and that’s hard to F with.”

Most of us believe there’s a master plan: an invisible, mostly unintelligible thread that gives sense to the apparent randomness of our earthly lives.

We say things like:
> „Everything happens for a reason”* to accept a seemingly ‘negative’ experience.*
> “Nothing happens by chance” *to describe a surprising or unexpected event.*
> “Someday everything will make perfect sense”* to make peace with what doesn’t seem to have any positive side at this point, while we recognize that don’t know where these circumstances will eventually lead us.*

Interestingly enough, whether we are part of this group of believers or not, we all share the same tendency of wanting to have it all figured out, in our own terms, particularly when things go wrong. In simple words: we rationalize pretty much anything that has an emotional content or that we hold important.

But let’s focus for a moment on the tough times. Challenges, struggles, failures, deaths, heartbreaks. 
It’s hard to accept what hurts. Sometimes, it’s even harder when we cannot blame it on people: a debilitating disease, a natural disaster, a sudden death, you name it.

Is there a way to educate ourselves out of the continuous struggle to rationalize everything that happens to us? A conscious effort to dance with life even when it baffles our cognitive abilities?

What about this:
> # Embracing the Randomness of Life.

As illogical, inconsistent, unpredictable, volatile it is.

When I was struggling to recover from a relationship that fell from the stars to the abyss in a matter of a few weeks, I ended up heartbroken, angry, and disillusioned.

I remember spending an enormous amount of mental energy trying to explain the motives of my ex.
> She has lost her mind. She’s overwhelmed. This must have something to do with her past relationship with her father. Probably the recent stress brought to surface the pain from her teen times and suddenly, she saw an enemy in me instead of someone that wanted to help.

And the likes.

The stories I was telling myself were an attempt to give a relief to the part of me that wanted to know, understand, clarify.
A portion of my identity was severely wounded… and desperately wanted a stitch.

I’m not saying these thoughts didn’t help at all the recovery process, but in hindsight, I can say that rationalizing what happened didn’t soothe my pain, nor it softened my anger. *Acceptance *and* forgiveness* eventually did.

I see the same pattern all the time when people talk to me about the aftermaths of their relationships… particularly if they’ve been severely hurting.

This attitude, of course, applies to any aspect of life, when our expectations are not met.
> “The culture of that company would have never fit me”
> “We lost because we were too arrogant”
> “It wasn’t such a good deal after all”
> “If I had accepted that job offer, I wouldn’t be in this mess now. What was I thinking?”

Our culture has slowly but steadily put the analytical part of our brain on the steering wheel of our lives. The scientific revolution and the enlightenment brought plenty of valuable paradigms to humanity; however, they also contributed to the diffused underlying pattern of using analytical thinking as the primary coping mechanism to solve any problem or dilemma.

I find it interesting when people have a gut feeling or an intuition, and instead of listening to what they could catch at a subconscious level, they dismiss it in favor of more intellectual interpretations and potentially get side-tracked.

When we end up trapped in the excessive rationalization of past events or people’s behavior, we lose precious energies that we could otherwise use to act, create, transform.
> # Rationalization is the device the ego uses to keep up its perception of the world and all the identities and the judging patterns it has manufactured for us.

It’s hard to admit we’re poor at something when it matters to us: job, relationships, sports, you name it. It’s also extremely difficult to grasp the complexity of people’s inner state when they make a decision or when they act.

In both cases, our ego wants a story that it could live with. It may not like it, but at least it has the feeling that there’s an order it can comprehend. Yes, in several instances this is an effective strategy to find relief and move on or even to frame our lessons learned and grow from them. Great.

But the reality is that way too often these thoughts can cause unnecessary mental strain. Not to mention, the explanations that we eventually accept as valid may cause us further disappointment — if not pain — in the future.

We can consciously exercise our ability to change these mental patterns when we spot ourselves regularly lingering on any of these:

* Analyse the motives of others (“*he’s certainly doing this because…*”, “*she must have suffered some sort of trauma*”, etc.)

* Meticulous scenario planning around different outcomes of our life (I call it “playing a mental chess game” — i.e. *What am I gonna do next if…? And if…*? *Here’s what I’ll respond is she says thi*s, etc.)

* Replaying over and over scenes from the past, imagining different outcomes (“*If I had said/done that, here’s what would have happened/here’s where I would be now*”)

Catching these mental habits is key for us to be able to work on them effectively.
> # “We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves happy. The amount of work is the same” (Carlos Castaneda)

### Reconciling randomness with intelligence

For the most, we can easily recover from trivial, daily hiccups: the obnoxious neighbor, the micromanaging boss, the unkind waiter. You name it.

These, however, can hardly touch the way we experience life: we get over them relatively quickly and carry on with the same belief system, self-image and perception of the world.

And we can also cope for longer periods with sadness, frustration, tiredness, dissatisfaction — as long as they don’t become recurrent companions for months or years.

At the same time though, atrocities, fatal illnesses and natural calamities keep happening in our world. Non-stop.

When these extreme circumstances hit us directly, they can shake us. In fact, if we believe in any sort of “grand scheme of things”, they challenge us to the point that it’s hard to keep up the faith that everything has a sense and a purpose.

We see a world that looks entropic, unfair, messy.

Our mind gets trapped into trying to arrange our interpretation of the facts into the compartmentalized boxes and categories it is familiar with, but it’s often unable to catch the complexity and fluidity of reality.

Notice how less prone we are to explain positive outcomes or favorable circumstances: an unexpected promotion, the new neighbor is super nice, unsolicited acts of kindness, buying a house below market price, that “accidental” meeting that changes our life… and so on.

In these cases, we somehow seem to accept the randomness of life without thinking too much. Or we call these events “coincidences”. Or we get away with the underlying idea that “we deserved it”.

I believe that educating ourselves to avoid rationalizing smaller and trivial events can be a training ground to learn to let go and better recover from the extreme challenges that life will inevitably present us.

So, perhaps we should add an important disclaimer to the quote:
> Everything happens for a reason.
**Many times, things are not comprehensible to our mind.**

There’s an unintelligible intelligence behind the apparent randomness that oftentimes seems to govern the world. It’s the same intelligence that has run this universe for the 13.8 billion years of its existence.
We can tap into it through surrender and acceptance.

Sometimes in life, the most liberating inner narrative is:
> # I don’t know. I cannot possibly know. The logic is beyond the reach of my mind. The causes are unfathomable to me. Therefore, I accept “what is”.

There are seasons in which I may not like what’s going on in my life. Or in the world. There are days when I despise the current circumstances.

So, I mourn what needs to be mourned. I grief what calls for grievance. 
I cry. I melt in sadness. I find myself in the dark night of the soul.

I embrace my humanness and let my emotions flow.
Without judging myself for experiencing them.

When my mind perceives randomness, I know that within me, there’s a space. A land with no words. A place where I can intuitively trust the primordial intelligence of the universe.

I let go of my impulse to rationalize. And I’m free again.

# Startup Lesson #2&#58; The answer doesn’t have to be in your head

## By Richard Reis
> Recently, I started building an app, [Gurgeh](https://www.gurgeh.com/). **Every week I learn something new **(this is a common feeling among founders). So I decided to share my weekly lessons in the hopes that (1) I don’t forget them and (2) they help you on your own journey.

Most of your life is problem-solving:

* You go to school to solve the *“how do I get a degree?” *problem.

* You get a degree to solve the *“how do I get a job?” *problem.

* You get a job to solve the *“how do I pay for my life?” *problem.

Sure, seeing everything as a problem might sound stressful. But not if you see it as **one big game!**

In fact, I love problem-solving so much, I wrote [an entire post](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2) just about it.

And nothing — I repeat, nothing — has reminded me about the importance of problem-solving as much as starting a startup.

Whether it’s fixing a bug, getting the right domain, or finding users, startups are a **series of never-ending problems**.

Here’s the good news though: No matter what problem you have, someone has probably already solved it. Find that person/ solution.

Read that again. **This lesson has rescued me many, many times. And it will rescue you.**
> # “Remember that you’re looking for the best answer, not simply the best answer that you can come up with yourself. […] If you’re truly looking at things objectively, you must recognize that the probability of you always having the best answer is small.” — Ray Dalio

Here’s my example: When I launched [my app](https://www.gurgeh.com/) on May 24th, the #1 feedback I received was *“cool product, but I’m not sure I trust it enough to link my bank account.”*

This problem is a *tough* one to solve.

But I quickly remembered that **other apps have solved this same exact problem!** Mint, Venmo, Acorns, Coinbase, Robinhood, etc… They all faced the same challenge.

So instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, all I had to do was **find out how they solved it, and do the same thing**.

What I realized was **my onboarding sucked**. As soon as people signed up, I asked them to link their bank account (bad move).

![Cute… But not enough to build trust.](1*W7xWwE_NJ6P1jZHDRPVHyA.jpeg)*Cute… But not enough to build trust.*

So I looked at other apps’ onboarding, and what did I find? Most of them let the user see the app (with sample data) **before** asking them to link their bank account.

![How others solved my same problem.](1*KxeRRqT9vgoeqhHtfGdidA.jpeg)*How others solved my same problem.*

As soon as I realized this, I rolled up my sleeves, went back to the drawing board, and redesigned Gurgeh’s onboarding. The result is beautiful.

![Ahh… much better 🤗](1*iouKM-n-H75ITugKGZwE5Q.jpeg)*Ahh… much better 🤗*

Problem solved.

But that was just one problem. The only thing you can be certain of is that more problems will come. Many, many more.

The point though is I, and now you, have a powerful tool in our toolkit. We know that **no matter what problem we face, someone has probably already solved it!**

All we have to do is find them.
> # “At Uber I think of myself as the problem solver-in-chief. I want as many hard problems as I can get…You have to be the math professor that keeps looking for the next harder problem.” — Travis Kalanick

And that’s it for today!

See you next week.

Be well.

# The Secret to Developing Thick Skin

## How to put yourself out there and worry less about what people think

![](1*6RgkJQ9qKwvew__Qtft6Tg.jpeg)

If there’s a defining feature that sets apart smart creatives who are able to sustain themselves at a high level of performance, it’s thick skin. They’re persistent in their work and resilient to outside opinion and rejection. They’re able to put themselves out there, time and time again, and deliver. And while this might appear to be a natural talent, it’s far from it. It’s a skill that takes years to develop, and it begins with renegotiating expectations.

Many talented people struggle with this–entrepreneurs, artists, athletes, writers. While they might be brilliant in their work, when it comes to putting themselves out there, they end up demoralized or enraged by the slightest hint of criticism.

This becomes a downward spiral that throws off the entire creative process. Even if you are able to correct course, it’s an unnecessary distraction that disrupts your focus and pulls you away from more meaningful work.

### Internal vs. External Expectations

To offset this and develop the thick skin required to put yourself out there, you must first [differentiate between internal and external expectations](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-myth-of-losing-your-edge-8e053bc02785), assigning each their proper weight. Internal expectations–the expectations you hold for yourself and your creative process–should always take precedence.

How your work is interpreted, received, or recognized, is beyond your immediate influence. It’s not that this is completely irrelevant, but it should matter far less because it’s an unreliable metric against which to measure yourself. The greater the importance you assign to external expectations, the more dependencies you introduce, and the higher the likelihood that you’ll end up pissed off, burned out, or distracted from the work that matters most.

Self-sufficiency is the path towards effectively managing expectations. In the opposite direction are dependencies–evidence of placing a premium on things you can’t affect.

When you prioritize the internal expectations you hold for yourself, you naturally develop the thick skin required to put yourself out there and consistently produce at a high level. Instead of seeking value in the recognition, you begin seeking value in the creative process itself. And this is the only sustainable path forward.
> # “The tranquility that comes when you stop caring what they say. Or think, or do. Only what you do.” [Marcus Aurelius](https://www.alexjhughes.com/books/2017/4/5/meditations-marcus-aurelius)

Turn your attention back to what’s within your control. Put in the work. Focus on your craft. Create something that resonates with you. When you limit the external dependencies and surrounding noise, the more relaxed, concentrated, and effective you will be.

### Feedback vs. Criticism

This is not to say that you shouldn’t seek feedback–which is critical to further developing and growing your skills. But feedback is to criticism as internal expectations are to external expectations.

In other words, the source is fundamentally different. Feedback comes from fellow creatives with [skin in the game](https://amzn.to/2NLmcLp)–the doers–who are taking risks by putting themselves and their work out there. These are the people whose opinions and judgment you should respect most. Criticism comes from insecure bystanders, shouting from a distance, who are incapable of creating anything meaningful of their own.

The intention behind feedback is also different. Criticism is often shallow and malicious in nature–focused on breaking you down. True feedback, from an inner circle whom you respect, is diligent, constructive, and objective. Its purpose is to challenge you to improve yourself and your craft.

In short, it’s about growth–which is a painstaking process in its own right–not about praise, telling you what you want to hear, or making things easier. It’s up to you to draw the line and determine who has your best interest in mind.

### Create Your Own Momentum

When the inevitable criticism does come, use it as motivation and redirect that energy to create momentum of your own. With the right perspective, it becomes almost laughable.

Consider how much time and energy it took that person to criticize you–it consumed them. Nothing is a more sad, ineffective use of time–so let the childish tantrums end there. Refuse to allow yourself to be distracted by those without skin in the game. Their opinion holds no validity.
> # “An opportunist in life sees all hindrances as instruments for power. The reason is simple: negative energy that comes at you in some form is energy that can be turned around–to defeat an opponent and lift you up.” [Robert Greene](https://www.alexjhughes.com/books/2017/9/12/the-50th-law-robert-greene)

For most talented, hardworking people, it’s just a matter of time. Which means you need to find the energy to keep going–to continue creating. The more dialed into yourself that you are, the less outside opinion should matter, and the more resilient you’ll be in your creative process. If you rely on external validation to keep you going, you’re going to have a short career.

A meaningful, fulfilling creative life demands hard work and tough decisions. Those who aren’t cut out for it will lean towards the path of least resistance, as defined by [mindless consumption](https://www.alexjhughes.com/blog/2017/5/23/create-more-consume-less) or shallow criticism. It’s easy to live that life.

**If easy is what you want out of life, feel free to join the ranks of the unremarkable.**

But those who make a difference show up, bust their ass, and sustain themselves at that level by having their expectations in order. They’re able to differentiate between internal and external expectations, valuing self-sufficiency over dependencies and feedback over criticism.

If you take the time to develop these skills–resilience, persistence, and [mental toughness](https://dailystoic.com/stoic-secrets-for-mental-toughness/)–outside opinion will lose its grip and you’ll be able to better carry your own momentum forward.

# 4 Must-Haves For Making An Offshore Development Team Successful

## 

Having an offshore development team often sounds like an attractive option for many technology companies.

After all, the thinking goes, half your team will be working while you’re awake. As you’re settling in for a good night’s sleep, another [team of engineers](https://blog.chronicled.com/what-to-look-for-when-hiring-a-blockchain-engineer-fa59247d52e2) is preparing to start their day. You’re getting twice as much work done — sometimes for a fraction of the cost.

The reality, unfortunately, is often very different.

I’ve actually experienced the pros and cons of an offshore team from both sides. When I was in India after my undergrad, international companies were setting up offshore development centers to move projects to India because it was much cheaper. After I moved to the U.S., my company had an offshore team in India, so I was able to experience the interactions from the other side. Now, I’m in a startup environment where I’m experiencing a similar situation with our remote team.

From what I’ve seen, the productivity level doesn’t double. In fact, it actually goes down. You may think that’s impossible, but it’s actually a very common result.
> ***Poor communication, uncertain expectations, distant time zones, and even cultural differences can all conspire to undermine any benefits of a remote team.***

You have to build and manage the team properly, or you could very well end up worse off than you were with just your local team.

Here’s how to make it work:

## **1. Make the offshore team feel like part of the company.**

It’s essential for leaders to work to make sure their remote employees feel like part of the team — and are committed to working diligently for the company.

Typically, a company will bring a remote team to their main offices for a month or two in order to meet their coworkers and learn the ins and outs of the business. The visiting employees then go back home and start working on their own.

But that’s only the beginning.

Working from a laptop — without any direct contact with peers — can be isolating and even demoralizing if not handled correctly. Regular, thoughtful communication is the best way to keep people engaged. Even doing small things, like remembering birthdays or anniversaries, can make a world of difference.

Even the smallest efforts can help make your offshore workers feel like part of the team.

## **2. Give remote teams ownership and responsibility.**

If you’ve been spending time getting an offshore team up and running — creating documents, communicating, even flying them in to meet your local team — then the last thing you want is for people to begin leaving for other jobs.
> # Turnover can happen quite easily if you aren’t giving remote teams enough important work to do. It’s easy for them to find other jobs and opportunities.

Onshore teams have a tendency to keep the interesting work in the office, close to home. When it comes time to decide what to give to the offshore engineers, it’s very easy to delegate boring or menial tasks while keeping the best stuff for the people who you physically interact with every day.

That’s not a great idea if you want your offshore engineers to stick around for any extended period of time. It’s up to leaders to manage power dynamics and ensure that all the busy work isn’t being given to the people who aren’t in the room.

## **3. Try to minimize the wait time between teams.**

Initially, it may seem to make sense to have the remote engineers working together with your on-site team on one component of the project.

What you’ll find, however, is that this creates a lot of unnecessary back and forth between the teams. Questions inevitably arise and issues have to be resolved. Teams end up waiting on the other.

Let’s say your on-site team assigns the remote engineers something to work on. The remote team runs into a problem, but they can’t get a hold of anyone because it’s the dead of night across the world. The only time both parties can get together is during an odd, late afternoon or early morning time frame — which ends up destroying productivity for everyone.
> *Part of the solution is simply to make sure you’ve created a strong system of documentation that can direct remote workers when no one is awake to help out.*

However documentation can only go so far.

What you really want to do is give the remote team an independent project they can build from start to finish on their own. You’ll still need scheduled check-ins every so often, but it shouldn’t be a constant back and forth. When the remote team finishes the component, they can hand it off to the on-site team and receive something new to work on.

That way, not only does the remote team make significant contributions, but both sides don’t have to waste as much time attempting to communicate on every little issue. This also gives a sense of ownership to the remote team.

## **4. Keep cultural differences in mind.**

We often get so used to the way we interact with people in our own culture that we forget that’s not the way everyone communicates around the world.

In the United States, people are very direct. “This is what I want. This is what needs to be done. If you have any issues, just tell me.” And when we ask someone if they have a problem, we assume they’ll tell us if they do.

In other countries, that just isn’t the case. People tend to avoid direct communication. So a remote employee may have trouble committing to a deadline, or even expressing the fact that he or she needs help with something.

In some cultures, there’s a tendency to be wary of showing any weakness. Someone who needs help may not ask for it. And when that problem comes to the forefront toward the end of a project, it can seem baffling that it wasn’t communicated earlier.

If your teams come from two very different cultures, it’s important to have some sort of sensitivity training to ensure everyone knows how the company operates and how each culture generally behaves. You may have to compromise on certain cultural norms, but as long as everyone agrees to work on the same page, you’ll be just fine.

Remote development teams can work, but you can’t go into the situation unprepared. Take the necessary time beforehand to ensure you’ve prepped both teams enough to succeed in their roles.

# The Most Successful People I Know Are Voracious Readers. Here’s Why

## 

All successful people I know have one thing in common: they never stop learning.

That’s why so many [CEOs](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-3-books-that-have-made-me-a-better-ceo-971f88c9e4f4), thought leaders, and politicians read so frequently. There’s a limit to how much time, money, and effort people are able to dedicate to more formal education. Reading voraciously and as part of a dedicated personal routine is the keystone of lifelong personal development.

And a big part of that learning is about yourself. I’m a student of writing and of words. Personally, reading helps me understand who I am, how I should approach my writing, and what I want to focus my attention on outside of my literary ambitions.

But that, of course, is not reading’s only benefit.

## **Reading benefits the mind because it helps you stay balanced and sharp.**

The most successful people are both scientists and artists — they utilize both the left and right brain.

As such, they actively nurture both those sides, which they oftentimes do through reading.

One example is always reading both fiction and nonfiction. That’s advice I give regularly: immerse yourself in the worlds and adventures of James Clavell, but educate yourself with biographies and intelligent opinions — such as Dwight Eisenhower’s account of World War II, which is what I’m reading now.

This is something many, many successful business leaders do, as it supports a healthy, more holistically capable lifestyle.

## **Reading instills discipline and an appreciation for growth.**

Reading doesn’t just strengthen or nurture both parts of our brain, though — it strengthens more intangible skills, too.

Namely, reading regularly makes people more disciplined and engenders an appreciation for learning and growth.

Why, exactly? Well, people who make the decision to read every day are actively deciding to engage, improve, and sometimes challenge their brains instead of doing more passive activities, like playing video games or binge-watching Netflix.

That’s why some of our most effective presidents, for example, have made reading a personal priority. When President Obama was in office, he gave an interview in which he disclosed how books were a sustaining source of ideas and inspiration during his tenure. They helped focus him midst the maelstrom of 24-hour cable news cycles, constant social media flurries, and compromised attention spans that gripped the country at the time. They also gave him a renewed appreciation for the complexities and ambiguities of the human condition.

And that’s *exactly *what reading does. It’s why we see so many leaders in all the different verticals of human activity invest in their own reading.

## **Reading benefits your business.**

There’s one last benefit that most people don’t associate with reading, and that’s the manner in which it can actively benefit your professional life.

For one thing, reading encourages curiosity. And people who are curious are, more often than not, high achievers. Understanding this, you yourself can use reading to become more curious and acquire more knowledge.

But you can also use that awareness to hone your hiring practices. At [BookBaby](https://www.bookbaby.com/), when we’re hiring a potentially key individual, I’ll always ask candidates, “What are you reading right now?” or, “What have you read in the last six months?” The reason is, I know reading behavior to be an apt barometer in measuring a person’s level of curiosity, discipline, and zeal for learning — and curious, disciplined people who are hungry to learn are the sort I want in my company.

I don’t particularly care *what *candidates are reading. I just want to see that they are.
> # It’s also true, however, that reading helps people improve as communicators.

As a student of writing, I admire great communication, and as the CEO of a publishing company, I see it as something of a requirement. Writers who communicate effectively for his or her audience help readers do the same in their own life.

At the end of the day, reading bears a variety of tangible benefits — regarding both the mind and the soul — and simple awareness of this fact is the most obvious reason successful people prioritize it as a means of professional and personal development.

Put simply, reading — in addition to being plain fun — makes people better. And that’s why the best of us do it so often.

# What It’s Really Like to Be an Entrepreneur (Are You Sure You Want to Be One?)

## What It’s Really Like to Be an Entrepreneur (Are You Sure You Want to Be One?)

### These days, it seems everyone wants to be an entrepreneur. But are you really ready for what it’s going to take?

I’ve been running my own business for the past six years, and I often hear people talking negatively about their employers. And it occurs to me:

If you’ve never run a business, it’s easy to criticize the owner.

What’s a lot more difficult is actually *being* the owner.

So, I thought I’d share some stories that just might help you appreciate your job a little more and possibly make you rethink this decision to be an entrepreneur entirely.

### Fact: Most entrepreneurs are not rich

This month, my business will lose money, and I’ll be personally funding it to keep the lights on, pay our staff, and cover the operating expenses. Honestly, I’m okay with this. It’s part of the job.

In fact, this is not at all uncommon — for business owners to have a month, or even quarter, that loses money. Sometimes, it’s an entire year.

This is also not a complaint. Not at all. It’s just an insight into a world that many people seem fascinated with but may not completely understand.

These days, it’s common to criticize people at the top, whether that’s at the top of an organization, a company, or even society. And certainly, there is corruption among those with great power and wealth. But there is also virtue.

I believe being an entrepreneur is an honorable calling, one that requires great responsibility. So before you take that next time into trying to start a business, ask yourself if you’re ready for what it’s going to require of you.

In my mind, there are three job requirements of a great entrepreneur.

Let’s look at them together.

### Entrepreneurs take the risks no one else will take

When I think of the word “entrepreneur,” I think of my friend who instead of paying himself a five-figure bonus after a profitable quarter bought a car for one of his top employees.

He called everyone out of the office and into the parking lot where he turned the gift into a company-wide ceremony, announcing to the entire team what a good job this person had done.

I think of my dad who moved from Illinois to Alabama to start a restaurant and, because he had no place to stay, slept in a hole-in-the-wall, practically-condemned office space while he renovated it.

During the day, he would hammer and paint and lay brick in the summer heat; and at night, he’d blow up an inflatable mattress and fall asleep as the dust settled. The next day, he would get up and do it all over again. He was 48 years old.

I think of [Nathan Barry](http://nathanbarry.com) who walked away from a lucrative information marketing business (where he was making $350,000 a year) to go all in on a software company called [ConvertKit](http://convertkit.com). Not only did he take a massive pay cut. He put $50,000 of his own money into a company nobody believed in just so he had enough startup capital.

For years, Nathan tirelessly promoted and pitched and tried to grow his company, while working for very little on a project that was not guaranteed to succeed. He was okay with that. Nathan understood that part of the job of being an entrepreneur is believing in the vision before anyone else does.

**Lesson: The reward never comes without the risk.**

### Entrepreneurs pay the costs no one else will pay

I don’t say this to glorify entrepreneurship or to scare anyone. But sometimes, I see folks vilifying business owners, saying it’s a privileged position and it “must be nice.” Trust me. It’s not nice, not unless you have the stomach for it.

I cannot think of a single entrepreneur whose business hasn’t cost him something dear for the sake of a greater vision. This vision, by the way, almost always involves other people and providing a means for them to live while the business owner scrapes along and struggles to survive.

Like my friend who owes the IRS $300,000 in taxes he already paid (that’s another story) and is considering how much of a pay cut he should take before having to lay off a single employee. So far, he hasn’t let a single person go.

Or my friend who started a chain of restaurants and would regularly write checks for $14,000–17,000 to his company to cover that week’s payroll expenses. Then, the next week he would pay himself back if the weekend sales had been good enough.

I think of 2015 when in my own business we took some risks that didn’t pan out. At one point, I had $200,000 in bills to pay and only $30,000 in the bank account. Through some last-ditch efforts, I was able to cover my bills but ended up not paying myself for five months just to keep things going.

**Lesson: Pay the costs no one else will pay, and eventually get to do what no one else gets to do.**

### Entrepreneurs get the reward no one else will get

And if you take that risk and pay those costs — in terms of time and money and effort — you just might find yourself at the finish line. You just might win the race and collect the reward.

And it is this point when people may begin to use words like “luck” and “privilege.” And that’s fine. That may even been true. But it’s not the whole story. What got you here was your willingness to do what must be done when no one else would do it. And so, who better to receive the reward, than you?

When I think of that year 2015 when our business almost went under, I remember not paying myself for five months and worrying about whether we would be able to pay our taxes.

But I also remember that by the end of the year, we’d had our best year yet. The risk paid off. The costs were worth it.

Similarly, Nathan Barry’s company ConvertKit now brings in over a million dollars a month. He eventually paid himself back that $50,000 investment and then some. I’ve heard whisperings of him turning down huge offers to sell the company.

Now, everyone sees the vision. It’s easy to believe in something *after* it’s successful. The hard part was when Nathan saw it before anyone else.

My other friend who was writing personal checks to cover payroll is now earning an executive-level salary (as opposed to the $40,000 salary he was paying himself) and will likely sell his business for eight figures.

He’s also given his top managers equity in the company, because he values their risk and sacrifice in sticking with him over the years. They saw the vision and paid the costs. Big risk, big reward. That’s how it works.

**Lesson: You get the reward *because* you took the risk.**

### Note: This is not gambling

Now, don’t get me wrong. Don’t do anything stupid with your money. Entrepreneurship is not gambling, no matter how many click-bait articles you read that would tell you otherwise.

The most successful entrepreneurs are smart with their money and often fiscally conservative. They take risks but almost always risk they’re able to recover from.

Great entrepreneurs understand that reward does not come without risk. And they realize that reward does not come without rewarding others.

Every great business owner I’ve met was not only a risk-taker; they were a giver. As my friend [Ray Edwards](http://rayedwards.com) says, “You can’t get rich without making others rich in the process.”

So it’s not about gambling. It’s about generosity. It’s about being bold. You give, not take, your way to the top. And every smart entrepreneur I know understands this. You can, of course, be greedy and enjoy the short-term benefits of running a company, but that success will likely be short-lived.

The best way to succeed as an entrepreneur is to bring others on the journey with you.

### Big risk, big reward

So, that’s what it’s like to be an entrepreneur. Maybe there are smarter ways to do this. I don’t know.

This is just how I see most folks “in the ring” doing it. They’re trying to be wise and take care of their families while putting their butts on the line, because they believe in this thing, even when no one else does.

As for me and writing a check to cover the company’s expenses this month? I’m fine with it. My family is fine. My kids will still eat. The company will live to fight another day, and we’ll eventually earn that money back.

The bottom line: You don’t get the reward without the risk. And you don’t stick around in business without sacrificing short-term gain for long-term rewards. You pay the cost. You take the risk. You do what no one else will do and you get what no one else will get.

Why share this?

Because I want you to think about this the next time you complain about your job. Almost every entrepreneur I know has a story like the above. We all might be surprised by the risks our employers have had to take just to ensure we were able to take home a paycheck that week.

Yes, I know this isn’t every entrepreneur. But it just might be more than you think.

So, do you *still* want to be an entrepreneur?

Are you ready to take the risk, pay the cost, and give your way to the top so that you can get that reward?

If so, then I applaud you. The world is waiting to see your vision. Just don’t be surprised if they don’t see it until after you’ve succeeded.

### Ready to take the next step?

If you want to start a business, a great way to do that is by building a website and getting your name out there.

# How To Strike Gold By Implementing Legendary Marketing

## 

There’s no reason to be like everyone else when you have the chance [to be legendary](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/how-to-build-a-legendary-company-say-no-to-business-models-forecasting-projections-and-do-this-instead/).

I see this all the time in the marketing world. Everyone does the same things — they all have social media and they’re all sending you an email at 2:07 pm on a Tuesday. So why would you do the same thing as everyone else if you want your brand to stand out?

I always love to talk with my favorite, stand-out marketing masters when I host my podcast. Seeing people really be brave and dare to go against what everyone else around them is doing deeply inspires me — and my listeners too. It’s a relief to see how many people are “[Following Their Different](https://lochhead.com/episodes/)” these days — like Dave Gerhardt.

Gerhardt is the head of marketing for Drift, a conversational marketing platform. He joined me on the podcast after his fellow Drift rockstar, David Cancel. He and Cancel do one of my absolute favorite podcasts, called *Seeking Wisdom*, and they’re co-authors of the number one, brand new bestselling book called [*Conversational Marketing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119541832/): How The World’s Fastest Growing Companies Use Chat Bots to Generate Leads*.

Gerhardt talked with me about how he applied huge marketing strategies to the launch of their book. Tactics like the multiplier effect, making your brand undeniable, and, my personal favorite, legendary marketing — you know, the kind that makes your competitors have emergency board meetings.

If you’re looking for some serious gold, read on.

## **1. Sell high, sell low, sell everywhere to everyone — including at airport newsstands.**

Everything Cancel and Gerhardt do at Drift is about educating people on conversational marketing — what it is, what it does, why it matters.

“Hopefully,” says Gerhardt. “If we’re the ones teaching you about it, then when you’re ready to buy, you’re going to come to us.”

Part of their strategy in getting their “educational materials” out in the world is making them as accessible as possible. One of their biggest wins on that front has been their book *Conversational Marketing* — which really does seem to be everywhere [in the business world](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/calling-all-copycats-why-your-business-needs-competition-to-thrive/). Of course, they’ve promoted the hell out of it, offering it at a discount directly from their website, talking about it on podcasts, etc.

But they also took a surprising new angle in getting their ideas in front of people that matter.

“The book is gonna be at every airport newsstand in the world for three months, starting soon,” says Gerhardt. “I want the CEO getting off the plane to be like, ‘I’ve heard about conversational marketing. Oh shit, there’s a book on it at the airport? Okay, I better go check it out.’”

The idea then is the hypothetical CEO will read it, send it to the marketing team, and they’ll assign the topic to someone to become the expert.

And this strategy is working. The book is at #26 on Amazon’s business sales list, beating out thousands of other titles.

## **2. Nothing draws a crowd like a crowd.**

Of course, Gerhardt doesn’t just want to stop with marketing to CEOs.

“A huge part of our strategy for marketing this book is to get it in the hands of as many people as possible,” says Gerhardt. Which might sound like a “duh” moment, but hear him out. “We’ve done a lot of things to basically encourage people to tweet out and post pictures of the book because I want people to be like, ‘Goddamn it, all I do is see this freaking book. Okay, I gotta go buy it. Everybody’s reading it.’”

Gerhardt refers to this as tapping into the “Keeping up with the Joneses mindset.” People often see their competitors doing one thing and immediately think, “Okay, I have to do that now.” That’s exactly the action Gerhardt wants to inspire in people when it comes to *Conversational Marketing.*

And again, Gerhardt aimed at every possible set of ears and eyes he could find when promoting the book. He went on every single podcast he could wrangle during those busy few months.

“I don’t care whether somebody has an audience of 100 people or 100,000 people,” says Gerhardt. “Because if you have a podcast about marketing and 100 people listen to it, damn, those 100 people…love marketing. That’s a niche inside of a niche.”

## **3. When everyone is going left, go right.**

Remember: to stand out, you have to be willing to go against the crowd.

Just because all your fellow marketers are doing things one way, does not mean that’s the only way of working. One of the things Gerhardt makes sure to focus on is how to swim against the current or find the back doors of entry that no one else has thought to use. Remember the emails at 2:07 pm on a Tuesday?

“99% of marketers are going to send an email at that time,” says Gerhardt. “Whereas I want to be the guy that’s sending you an email Saturday night because nobody’s marketing team is working on a Saturday night.”

And that’s why I love talking with guys like Gerhardt and Cancel — they’re always thinking of ways to split the crowd.

Because marketing today is like war.

It’s a war for attention.

Which means you can’t be afraid to take chances and do things outside your comfort zone. You have to always be asking yourself, “What chance will I take next?” And yeah, you might fail. But that’s the risk you take.

In order to become a legend, you have to risk being a loser.

# Why you should stop looking for a mentor

## Why you should stop looking for a mentor

*Will you be my mentor?*

This question makes me cringe. It’s not that I don’t want to help. I do — I really do. It’s just that when someone asks me to be their mentor, I don’t know what I’m signing up for. The question feels like a marriage proposal from someone I’ve never met, an indefinite labor contract with unspecified terms of service, and a giant pile of responsibility on an already full plate.

But I understand where people are coming from. We’ve been spoon-fed the idea that finding a mentor is a prerequisite for success. Countless business books and self-help guides preach the importance of a good mentor. Under this image we have nurtured, a mentor takes a mentee under their wing, like Socrates and Plato, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, and Mr. Miyagi and Daniel. The relationship then blossoms, and the mentee achieves philosophical greatness, makes billions, or wins the All Valley Karate Championship.

I hate to be a buzzkill, but this isn’t how things work in real life. We wait for a good mentor to arrive like a prophet, whisk us from our canyon of despair, and push us up the ladder of success. But that mentor often doesn’t come, at least not in the form that we’re expecting. We then use the lack of a mentor as an excuse for not getting started.

The solution to this quandary appears in [a scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hbn9pJqQEE) in *Good Will Hunting*, one of my favorite movies. In the scene, Sean McGuire, the therapist played by Robin Williams, asks Matt Damon’s genius character, Will Hunting, if he has a soulmate — someone who challenges him.

After some meandering, Will replies: “I got plenty. Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost, O’Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke.” Sean mocks this answer: “That’s great. They’re all dead.” Undeterred, Will says: “Not to me, they’re not.”

Will is on to something. We assume our soulmates and sources of inspiration have to be real-life mentors who are a quick phone call or an email away. But that assumption is false. As Elizabeth Gilbert [writes](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Magic-Creative-Living-Beyond/dp/1594634726), mentors “live on the shelves of your library; they live on the walls of museums; they live in recordings made decades ago.”

No one has taught me more about democracy than the Czech writer and politician Vaclav Havel. He’s not alive. No one has taught me more about writing than Stephen King. I’ve never met him. No one has taught me more about humility than the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. He’s been fertilizing daffodils for nearly two thousand years. No one has inspired me more about leveraging failure for success than Sara Blakely. I saw her on the television show *Billions* once, but our paths have never crossed.

All I had to do to learn from these incredible people, and many others like them, was to study their lives. Take, for example, Stephen King. I treat his fiction like a textbook. I highlight, underline, circle, and review. I’ve learned more from studying his writing than I ever could from a formal “mentoring” session where I would ask him if he has any advice on writing (to which he would probably respond, “Go read my books.”).

You can channel the power of these teachers without holding a seance. Pick your favorite source of inspiration and ask yourself this question: What would they do if they were in my shoes? What would Elon Musk do when faced with this challenge? How would Elizabeth Gilbert tackle this creativity problem? How would Jane Austen develop the character in my novel? If you’ve done your homework, and studied their works, you’ll know what the answer is.

So, to those of you looking for real-life mentors, I say, stop looking.

Your mentors are already all around you.

You just have to open your eyes to see them.

# 17 Belief-Shaking Remarks From a Ruthless Non Conformist

## 

It can be extremely hard to think for yourself and live the life you actually want to live.

With a family and other environmental factors around us — even harder. We have content around us that impacts how we act, think and then decide every moment of every day.

How do you live a life YOU actually want?

J. Krishnamurti (May 11, 1895-Feb 17, 1986) is one man who ruthlessly taught people the foundations to think for themselves and live the lives they want.

His writing profoundly shaped the way I think and make decisions.

I’ve yet to see a thinker who writes so deeply about human nature and how the constructs of our minds lead us into imitation and pointless ambition.

I’ve curated 17 points from a few of his books that shook my beliefs.

You may agree with some or many, and others you may resist. However it’s those that strike a nerve that I’d pay attention to because that’s when you know you’re being challenged. It’s either an opportunity to grow, or to insist that you already know better. In any case, ask yourself why to learn from it.

1. We must awaken the full capacity of the superficial mind that lives in everyday activity, and also understand the hidden. In understanding the hidden there is a total living in which self-contradiction, with it’s alternating sorrow and happiness, ceases.

![](1*i_Pg2lHfq1h6HGc4mXmK-A.png)

2. Peace can come only when there is love. If you have peace merely through security, financial or otherwise, or through certain dogmas, rituals, verbal repititions, there is no creativeness; there is no urgency to bring about a fundamental revolution in the world. Such peace only leads to contentment and resignation.

3. What is intelligence? If a man is frightened, anxious, envious, greedy; if his mind is copying, imitating, filled with other people’s experiences and knowledge; if his thinking is limited, shaped by society, by environment — is such a man intelligent? He is not, is he? And can a man who is frightened, unintelligent, have character — character being something original, not the mere repeating of traditional do’s and don’ts?

4. Ambitious men and women do not know what love is — and we are dominated by ambitious people. That is why there is no happiness in the world and why it’s very important you understand this and find out for yourself if it is possible to discover what love is. You may have a good position, a very fine house, a marvelous garden, you may become the prime minister; but without love, none of these things have any meaning.

5. When each individual is flowering to his fullest capacity, there is then no comparison of functions: there is only the expression of capacity as a teacher, or a prime minister, or a gardener, and so status loses it’s sting of envy.

![](1*yNXMRDM0F8HYD4fNKE_3dw.png)

6. There is no learning if thought originates from conclusions. Merely to acquire information or knowledge is not to learn. Learning implies the love of understanding and the love of doing a thing for itself.

![](1*ER1-v2TrE9o3rbqMxkb7Jg.png)

7. Last time we decided it’s kind of not feasible because unexpected things come up and as long as you got in the routine, we were fine. But I agree with you, nothing feels better than the alone time of the morning prepping for the day. So am pumped we’re back at it but it’s going to take some real commitments.

8. A disciplined mind is never a free mind; nor can a mind that has suppressed desire ever be free.

![](1*up0B4bnBb_BJ-Dy8DFlACQ.png)

9. Understanding the hidden forces of the total mind frees it from conflict, and only then is there intelligence.

10. Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it is right or wrong, but just to watch it and move with it. In that watching, you begin to understand the whole movement of thought and feeling. And out of this awareness comes silence.

11. Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay.

12.You see, most of us are idealists; and idealists are hypocrites, because they are always trying to become something which they are not. If I am stupid and I strive to become clever, everybody thinks it is a marvelous thing. But a stupid person, however well he may learn the tricks of cleverness, does not thereby become intelligent. Whereas, if I know that I am stupid then that very knowledge is the beginning of intelligence — which is better than merely being clever. Do you understand?

13. So the man who is accumulating, gathering, the man who is desiring more is never freshly experiencing life. It is only when the mind is not concerned with the “more”, with accumulating, that there is a possibility for that mind to be intelligent.

14.Most grown-up people think that some kind of discipline is necessary. Do you know what discipline is? It is a process of making you do something which you do not want to do. Where there is discipline, there is fear; so discipline is not the way of love. That is why discipline at all costs should be avoided.

![](1*O2Va8Zx84ax3VBDcSAX1sA.png)

15. Religion, the real thing, means a revolt in order to find God, which is to discover for oneself what is true. It is not a mere acceptance of the so-called sacred books, however ancient and venerated they may be.

16. All outward forms of change brought about by wars, revolutions, reformations, laws and ideologies have failed completely to change the basic nature of man and therefore of society.

17. But how can we be free to look and learn when our minds from the moment we are born to the moment we die are shaped by a particular culture in the narrow pattern of the ‘me’? For centuries we have been conditioned by nationality, caste, class, tradition, religion, language, education, literature, art, custom, convention, propaganda of all kinds, economic pressure, the food we eat, the climate we live in, our family, our friends, our experiences — every influence you can think of — and therefore our responses to every problem are conditioned.

# Life after leaving my job&#58; 3 years on

## Stories from the road to tuning back in

![Copyright Rachel Smith](1*8X1_N6gUaNZ_7PqauKaXXw.jpeg)*Copyright Rachel Smith*

When I was young, my teenage rebellion project never managed to pick up any real momentum.

I never cut my hair short (except the time when the hairdresser accidentally chopped it all off before the leavers ball) and I only once thought about dip dying the ends pink. It was just a thought and it was just the ends, hardly the height of teenage resistance. And when everyone was coughing and spluttering on their first pack of cigarettes, the idea of compressing flavoured smoke into my lungs seemed unnecessary.

Maybe rebellion just wasn’t my thing.

But by 19, I’d been around South America because there was a spare ticket and at 21, I’d bombed off to Australia because I’d met a guy. A year later I went to live in Denmark, all because my sister bet that I wouldn’t. It seemed a ridiculous enough reason to me, I hadn’t yet built the muscle memory of resistance.

The summer after, I was in an airport with my friend Steph, hundreds of tennis balls rolling across the terminal. We were on our way to Kenya with the grand plan to teach a town how to play tennis. It sort of worked.

I kept following these kind of signposts, mysteriously labelled ‘go on’, ‘bet you won’t’ and ‘wouldn’t it be nice’. They had no rationale, there only requirement was that I notice and then follow them. It was a simple enough formula and the more ridiculous the idea, the more certain I was of success.

I didn’t do anything quite as ridiculous until I left my job as an architect some eight years later. The first act of rebellion was to raid the stationary cupboard. Who knew how long I’d need to survive on my limited stock of 0.2mm nibbed pens.

Until this point, my career had formed in a linear way. I’d reluctantly uttered ‘ok’ to each stage of the training process. As it progressed, I found myself retreating to the shallow water. The experience of bombing in at the waterfalls roaring edge was largely forgotten.

The contrast between flow and resistance became more pronounced. On a building site I used to visit, the white haired site manager would roll his eyes when I’d turn up. Though he’d also call me the day before to check whether I’d prefer donuts or muffins (muffins if anyone’s asking). He was part adversary, part friend and he summoned this contrast daily.

“We call you ‘Valkyrie’ you know.” he exclaimed with a broad grin and the hint of a West Country accent.

He chose to reveal this on the day that I’d allowed him to tickle my nose with a long piece of grass, in front of a busy site of builders. Ten seconds in exchange for a fiver was the deal. It was a delightfully ridiculous vignette that had broken free from the earnest endeavour of bringing a physical structure in to the world.

I went along with it because I was honoured by the invitation. It felt like a playful reprieve from my duties as a nordic goddess of war.

I took the name he had for me to be shorthand for the courage I knew I had as I lumbered up to leaving my job, which…yes was seven years of training and no I won’t go back, thanks for asking. I emailed him to let him know and he replied with just a few elegantly put words:

*‘Go well Pilgrim, may your own particular deity accompany you and bring you back safely. Sine Timore’*

Sine Timore, go fearlessly.

I had no idea what shape my adventures or life would take from here, or what beliefs I’d need to let go of along the way. For some reason, I felt that I had more to lose than I really did. Being free from a structured job didn’t mean I was free from resistance, though it did loosen the reigns. Agonising over *the *right decision was a burden shared by my fellow travellers. We had no map for this place.

It was an unusual time. As the captain of my boat on the river, I took to the water each day irrespective of the conditions. There would be periods where I would bounce along powered by a tailwind. Other times the forces would be petulant and irrational. One angry minute I’d be thrown in to the water, the next there was no wind or momentum at all. My strong desire to keep moving kept me paddling. It’s unsurprising that I burned through my energy supplies regularly. Wading without a current can take a lot out of a person.

I figured that this is the way it should be. I was the chief operating officer of my affairs and I had the freedom to chase another setting sun. Part of the deal was that I’d need to roll up my sleeves and graciously receive the resistance. *Overcoming* was surely a necessary part of the territory.

But that’s not what I experienced when I was young and it’s not what I see now. I’ve come to notice that an effortless journey is one that is lined with deliberate intention. I’ve begun enjoying the return of the ridiculously signposted invitations that were readily available to me a decade ago. It feels like an apprenticeship that I will never be too old for.

My current field of work came about this way whilst waiting for my friend on her doorstep one late spring afternoon. It started to build momentum in the same anecdotal way as all the rest. I was in transition after returning from a month in the Philippines and was contemplating a move to Berlin. The city had come in to my field of vision more times than was normal.

Whilst curled up on the hard concrete ledge I began doodling and I watched as a lake scene unfolded from the end of my pen. It was a whimsical cartoon that featured me being tickled to the ground. It was silly and didn’t seem to relate in any way to thoughts of my next adventure.

![](1*QeELPRStD9whrHYnfyLbmA.png)

Months later, on a gloriously sunny day at one of Berlin’s suburban lakes, I gasped, rummaged around in my bag and reached for the Ipad. I brought the image up and shared it with the offending ‘tickler’, who I doubt has ever tickled since. I took it as evidence that I was in flow.

I carried on drawing, not because I was particularly good, but because it was a way of tuning in to things that I was otherwise being too rigid to hear. Until this point, I’d not found an adequate receptacle for my thoughts or ideas about the future. These things would never spill out of me in the perfectly ordered and patient way that I imagined was happening to others. So when I offered up the blank page without judgement, unconscious territories began to form. I was drawing maps.

I did it for others. We were all surprised at my capacity to host a conversation through plotting it out right there in front of us. And it seems ridiculous that I also got round to teaching others how to do the same. I didn’t look around at what anyone else was doing and I often witnessed ideas spill out of me as if I didn’t really have a say at all. I just kept listening to how good it felt.

I wasn’t conscious of deliberate creation at the time. I was still tentatively waiting for the storms to roll in and ruin it all. And so this lightness sits in tension.

For as long as I can remember, I have been the host of an on going conversation about how to approach change. In particular, I trace the seriousness of the dialogue with the universe over the past three years. It’s a very serious conversation. It has been the earnest intensity of war that has coloured my passage through this time. I’ve held *growth* as an almost singular pursuit.

Considering the humour, lightness and creativity that brings me alive, I can’t help but feel there has been an unhelpful misalignment.

A new and daring horizon of thought is opening. What would it be like to put the child in charge in recognition of her receptive and creative abilities? I would tag along, not because of her gift for navigation but because it always feels really good to be by her side. What if it were that simple.

We cannot think our way in to the currents that were designed for and by us. They’ll be signposted in all sorts of playful ways, it was something I worked out and forgot a long time ago. Our best way is through the experience of surrender.

When you realise that you don’t need to control the circumstances around you to control how you feel, everything is a lot easier. Life is not an earnest endeavour, it is meant to be fun. If you find yourself in shallow waters, focusing on the sharpness of the stones beneath your feet and how numbingly cold it is, you might miss something. Not far away, there is the roaring momentum of the current waiting to catch you.

# What Ive Learned From Quitting Social Media for 30 Days

## Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash

At the start of the year, I decided to take a 30 day break from social media. I adopted a philosophy that Cal Newport refers to in his new book as “Digital Minimalism”.

* I didn’t upload a single picture to Instagram or write a single Facebook status update.

* I took an occasional peek at my tweetdeck, which lasted no more than a minute.

Through these 30 days, I’ve noticed some interesting changes in my life that have made me question the value of social media.

## Decreased Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety

A few days ago, thanks to an amazing app called Heal, I had a doctor’s visit in the comfort of my living room. The doctor asked how my symptoms of depression had been lately. Until she asked me, I hadn’t thought about it.

Over my 30 day social media hiatus, my symptoms of anxiety and depression had subsided. I’d stopped comparing myself to other people because I had no idea what was going on in their lives and felt less anxious because I wasn’t compulsively checking social media.

Given how much research I’d done on this subject in the process of writing an [*Audience of One](https://amzn.to/2KwnEPS)*, I already knew about [the opportunity costs of social media](https://unmistakablecreative.com/the-opportunity-costs-of-social-media/), the biggest of which is our mental health. But the result of quitting for 30 days was a dramatic decline in my symptoms of anxiety and depression.

## Progress on Meaningful Projects

[Attention is the currency of achievement](https://unmistakablecreative.com/why-attention-is-the-currency-of-achievement-2/), and you’ll be amazed at how much you achieve when you’re no longer spending any of that attention on Facebook. Quitting social media completely allowed me to spend ALL of my time and attention on things that mattered, and led to greater levels of clarity, and progress on several different projects.

I read multiple books, published a blog post every single day, and finished writing a new book called *The Scenic Route,* which I plan to self publish in the next few weeks.

After my second book came out in August, I started working on a book proposal based on my article about what we should have learned in school but never did. However, I had been stuck for the last 2 months. After quitting social media, I had a major breakthrough. It’s hard to hear the sound of your own creativity when it’s drowned out by the noise of excessive digital input.

## Deeper and More Meaningful Interactions

Having taken what would likely be our last trip as a family to India in December, and with my sister’s wedding on the horizon, I was starting to realize that there’s nothing more valuable in life than [the time we have left with people who matter most to us](https://unmistakablecreative.com/on-the-time-we-have-left-with-the-people-who-matter-most-to-us/). I made it one of my biggest priorities for the year to see my friends and family in person more often. Every interaction so far has been deeper and more meaningful. I’ve had long drawn out conversations with friends, family members, and first dates.

## Measuring my Life in a Different Way

[How you measure your life will have a profound impact on your happiness and well being.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/measure-life-will-profound-impact-happiness-well/) When I asked people in my audience about the metrics they use to measure their life, very few said they measured social media metrics. While that might be true, people don’t see that the features on most social media platforms cause us to unconsciously measure our lives with vanity metrics. You’re being programmed to measure your life with someone else’s yardstick. This kind of measurement inevitably leads to comparison, which is the thief of joy.

## 3 Incredibly Disturbing Consequences of Social Media

When [I interviewed Cal Newport](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/digital-minimalism-cal-newport/), I asked him what he thought the consequences were of the way we’re currently using social media:

## 1. Mental Health

There are really scary results when looking at how social media affects mental health, especially if you look at Generation Z. They were the first generation to actually have access to smartphones and social media in their preteen and early teenage years.

When those of us in my generation arrived at college, we didn’t have these things. We didn’t have them as teenagers. If you look at the statistics for my generation, there’s nothing all that alarming about self-harm or mental health statistics, and not much has changed recently regarding those.

But if you look at Generation Z, particularly young women, you see a massive spike in mental health issues. It’s one of the scariest graphs I’ve ever seen.

Looking at the state of anxiety and anxiety related disorders and looking at the number of hospitalizations as a result of self harm proves that there’s a mental health crisis going on. Depression, suicide attempts and self-harm stats have skyrocketed. There’s no better explanation that fits the timing of these stats other than social media and smartphones.

If you put these things in the hands of young people whose brains are still developing and who are still going through these hard middle school and high school periods, the result of social media use is causing physical harm and unprecedented levels of increase for self-harm and mental illness.

## 2. Anxiety

Let’s say that someone who’s my generation or maybe a little bit older got out of our vulnerable teenage years without actually being exposed to this. There are still some serious harms that social media use can cause in ages after teenage years.

The first is that it exploits time and attention. If you take your time and attention away from things that are more beautiful, these tools do significantly decrease the quality of your life. I think that there are a lot of people my generation and older that have this vague background hum of anxiety. There’s always some sort of chasm of existential despair that’s not far away from all of us, but just keeping it at bay by constantly looking at the growing rectangle of our online profiles is no way to live.

## 3. Warped Worldview

When you move your content consumption into the walled garden worlds of these social media conglomerates, you’re just consuming information from a stream that’s being driven by an algorithm whose whole point is to maximize engagement. This does really bad things to your view of the world, and how you think about other people. It pushes people to the far extremes, and takes them from unhappy to angry. It’s just not a healthy way to actually engage with the world.

## You are Addicted to Social Media Whether You Realize it Or not
> # We didn’t sign up for the digital lives we now lead. They were instead, to a large extent , crafted in boardrooms to serve the interests of a select group of technology investors. — Cal Newport

When I logged back into Facebook for the first time, there was a flood of notifications, none of which were particularly relevant, and most of which were inconsequential. I realized how compulsive my habit of “checking in” had become, and also realized that I hadn’t missed anything. When I logged into Instagram, things looked pretty much the same.

After this, I closed Instagram, I deleted it from my phone, logged off of Facebook, and began to wonder, “What exactly is the point of using social media?” With the clarity that came from the 30 days away, I concluded that it is for the most part pointless. I didn’t miss anything and it seemed pretty clear that nobody missed me either. Nobody seemed to give a shit that I hadn’t posted, and I realized that social media had given me an overinflated sense of self-importance and self-obsession.

The two most valuable things I do for my audience are writing and conducting interviews for the [Unmistakable Creative Podcast.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-unmistakable-creative-podcast/id352721366?mt=2) Neither require me to be on social media and writing and interviews are the only things my audience would probably miss if I stopped doing them.

What surprised me most about this experience was how much the desire to check social media dissipated. It was the clearest indicator that the way we use social media is not a conscious choice, but we have in fact been programmed to keep feeding the beast.

A while back when I wrote a piece about [quitting social media for 5 days](https://medium.com/the-mission/what-i-learned-from-quitting-social-media-for-5-days-797b0f18d995), somebody commented and said, “Don’t kid yourself, you’re addicted.” I was already writing a lot about deep work and I using tools like Rescuetime to block distractions, but, after 30 days away, it’s safe to say that he was right, and I had been addicted.

As a culture, we’re addicted to social media and validation from the strangers on the internet.

* Paris Hilton rolls out of bed every morning and checks every social network to “connect” with her 50 million followers. From watching one scene in the documentary *American Meme,* she doesn’t seem that happy. It’s likely that she’s setting herself up for a downward spiral.

* Internet celebrities live as if they are reality TV stars, even though they’re not. They measure the value of their lives in vanity metrics.

If you do a hard reboot as[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMotykw0SIk)[Chamath Palihapitiya](https://twitter.com/chamath)[ suggested in his talk with the students at Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMotykw0SIk), you will become hyper aware of just how much of an addiction social media has become. You will also start to see the the value of being active on social media is highly questionable and mostly bullshit. You don’t need to be on it to grow your business and nobody is going to wonder why you’re gone.

One of my best friends dropped his daughter off at school when I was visiting him a few weeks ago. Because she was looking at her phone, she ate shit on a pile of ice. The irony is that just a few nights before, I was trying to convince her that she and her friends should give up using social media for just a week, and institute a “no phones at lunch” policy.

There are have definitely been some benefits to my life from using social media. I’ve reconnected with a high school classmate who became one of my best friends. I’ve met amazing people from all over the world. But what made those relationships valuable was not the fact that we were “friends” on Facebook, but that we sat face to face, had long conversations and broke bread together.

We are slowly losing touch with the world around us. We’ve stopped looking up and looking around because we’re staring at our phones. For all you know, the person in front of you in line at the grocery store or coffeeshop could be the most important person you’ll ever meet: the love of your life, an investor in your startup, etc, etc. But if you lose touch with the physical world because you’re so absorbed in your virtual world, you’ll never meet them.

If the upside of 30 days away is progress on your most important goals, greater levels of happiness, and decreased levels of depression and anxiety, don’t you think that’s a worthwhile reason to embrace digital minimalism?

# Will The Stink of Failure Sink Me?

## Don’t Let Fear Stop You

![[Source](https://www.psylegal.com.au/Awur/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fear-and-phobies.jpg).](1*auIEko6fyZq-BfTQoCoYyA.jpeg)*[Source](https://www.psylegal.com.au/Awur/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fear-and-phobies.jpg).*

*Written by [Christopher Lochhead](https://twitter.com/lochhead), host of the [Legends and Losers Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/legends-losers/id1204044507?mt=2).*

Fear stops a lot of people.

And the biggest fear for many entrepreneurs is, “if my company fails will the stink of failure sink me?”

Many people worry:

1. Will anyone work with me again if I fail?

1. Will I ever be able to start another company?

1. Will I be unemployable if I need to get job?

Well, let me tell you.

I was unemployable *before* I became a failed entrepreneur!

At 18 I got thrown out of school for being stupid (I found out later that I am dyslexic).

With **few other options**, I started a company.

Three years later, I was 21 and my first company had failed. I was newly married and facing a ton of debt.

I was scared.

I looked hard for a job and was getting desperate.

Then I found out a business contact I had made was starting a new company. I offered to help.

He was fired up to hear from me — to my surprise. I got hired to become the company’s “founding” sales rep.

It was the first time in business someone hired me.

I work for others long enough to pay my debts, get back on my feet and then start my next company.

32 years later, the movie for me ended far beyond my wildest dreams.

Today I’m a podcaster, best-selling author, and CEO advisor. After having been a multi-time entrepreneur and three-time Silicon Valley public company CMO.

So what are the learnings?

## **1. After you fail, you’re not as unemployable as you think you are.**

When you lose, ask yourself, *“who in business thinks I’m any good?”*

Contact those people.

Tell them you’re looking. Open up some conversations.

Make shit happen.

## **2. Embrace the “losery”**

To be an entrepreneur or any kind of person who takes big risks in hopes of making big things happen, is to know that failure is a feature, not a bug.

T.S. Eliot famously said, **“Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.”**

To make losing sound more fun I invented a new word, *“losery”*.

Failing is part of the journey. Get ready for it ahead of time.

Make fun out of the losery.

Achieving anything of consequence comes with massive failure. Hall of fame baseball sluggers fail about 70% of the time.

Most importantly overcoming losery teaches us more than any success we ever have.

Jay-Z says, **“You learn more in failure than you ever do in success.”**

## **3. Make your own employment —** either inside of an existing company or start another one.

And remember the sage words of Robert Green Ingersoll, *“The greatest test of courage on earth is to bear defeat without losing heart.”*

## **Why Do Buildings Cost So Much?**

Hundreds of onlookers craned their necks to look up into the sky. They had never seen a building quite like it. It was not the first skyscraper, but it was the first one over 100 stories and it would stand as the tallest building in the world for nearly 40 years.

It rose over New York City like a beacon, urging viewers to reach higher and dream bigger.

The Empire State Building was a marvel of engineering and design. It was named one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the American Society of Civil Engineers.
It contained a beautiful Art Deco spire, a breath-taking observation deck, and over 37 million cubic feet of interior space.

And yet if you ask a modern architect or builder what the most remarkable thing about the Empire State Building is, they won’t mention any of this. They mention something that is much, much more surprising…

# The Remote Worker Craze Isn’t Best For Every Business. Here’s Why

## The Remote Worker Craze Isn’t Best For Every Business. Here’s Why

### Here’s why I thought twice before letting everyone work from their living rooms.

***By [Heidi Zak](https://twitter.com/heidizaks), co-founder and CEO of ThirdLove***

Skype calls, coworking spaces, [Slack](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/mel-burke/7-bad-slack-habits-that-make-your-coworkers-hate-you/), and continent-hopping employees are becoming more and more popular as technology allows us to communicate instantly across the world.

So it’s natural to ask, why does everyone need to be in the same building?

It’s tempting to get caught up in the siren song of the remote worker craze.

But it’s also important to understand why working remotely may not be right for your company.

I believe when people are present, they are more [effective and efficient](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/michael-de-la-maza/this-simple-mindset-shift-turns-unproductive-teams-into-highly-effective-organizations/). Take a startup, for example. These are small companies that move fast. The office is busy, sure, but that’s why you want everyone there.

It’s infinitely easier to walk up to someone’s desk and ask them a couple of questions than it is to spend 15 minutes drafting an email or waiting 10 minutes for a response to a chat message that is experiencing technical difficulties.

While every company has different needs, here’s why I thought twice before letting everyone work from their living rooms.

## Being in the office is energizing and makes people more effective.

There’s something to be said for being present in a room, speaking with people face-to-face and understanding who they really are.

The office isn’t just a place for people to work. Teams also build friendships and solve problems together.
> *Honestly, you can learn a lot by having a conversation in the kitchen during lunch.*

The office also gives people a certain energy level that’s hard for isolated individuals to create. Being in the mix, chatting with colleagues, and bonding socially just keeps energy levels higher.

I’ve always found people are less efficient collaborating when they’re not in the office. Whether they’re working from home or traveling, it’s always harder to connect with them. That’s not necessarily their fault, but it can be a disruptive force when it comes to your company’s ability to get things done and keep moving forward quickly.

## It’s easier to collaborate and do cross-functional work.

The choice to allow people to work remotely also depends on how collaborative your environment is and how often people work across teams.

For example, at [ThirdLove](https://www.thirdlove.com/pages/fit-finder/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1042134924%7C56668490128&utm_content=293928865655&utm_term=thirdlove%7Ckwd-496986537832%7Cc%7C%7CEAIaIQobChMIpMfX6oGy4QIVFVmGCh3LYQxoEAAYASABEgLlSvD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpMfX6oGy4QIVFVmGCh3LYQxoEAAYASABEgLlSvD_BwE) our marketing, design, planning, and data teams work together every day. They aren’t siloed in their own little groups. Rather they, collaborate, share feedback, and make decisions based on input from each other.
> *It’s much harder to work that way and move quickly when people have to set up times just to speak to one another.*

Emails, messages, phone calls, and other impersonal methods can muddle communication. Take video calls, for instance. Every video call involves people speaking over each other, saying “No, go ahead,” and repeating sentences that were lost when the connection dropped for a few seconds.

You might think those issues are small, but inefficiencies can pile up quickly. Nothing beats tapping someone on the shoulder to ask a question and getting an immediate answer.

## Culture is an important part of your growth.

Every strong company has to align its strategy with its culture. And honestly, it’s much more difficult to do that when people are constantly traveling or working from home.

It’s tough to [build a culture](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/staff/how-to-build-company-culture-trade-your-coffee-machine-for-these-15-unique-team-building-exercises/) that really represents your brand when people call in for an hour every few days and spend the rest of the week isolated from the team.

* How do you make sure they have a strong sense of the product, the customer, the brand, the service?

* How do you make sure the culture is really ingrained in your remote workers?

At ThirdLove, we aim to create an office environment people want to be a part of. We want our team to enjoy coming to work every day and seeing friends. We want them to feel excited and inspired by the presence of their colleagues and the energy of the office.

I’m not sure that would be the case if we allowed people to work from home all the time.

## It’s not about trust.

If you don’t trust your team to get their work done, then you’ve got bigger problems.

Making people come to the office to work isn’t about trust. It’s about collaboration, efficiency, and inspiration. It’s about creating an environment that really embodies your business.

I understand some companies may be able to work remotely. But for us, it just wouldn’t be right.

You have to be really thoughtful about your business needs and what you want to your company culture to look like.

Once you know what you want, then decide if remote workers will contribute to that or take away from it. I’m sure working from home is great for some companies.

But you should only take that step if it’s going to [help your company grow](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/steven-spatz/4-ways-to-help-your-employees-and-your-company-develop-a-growth-mindset/) and thrive — not because everyone else is doing it.

# 5 Habits of The Most Successful People

## 5 Habits of The Most Successful People

Habits of successful people provide a roadmap you can follow. If you begin following the habits of successful people, it’s inevitable that you will become a successful person yourself. **These five habits can change your life.**

## Habit #1 — Daily Rituals To Enter “State”

There are daily rituals that put you into what [Tony Robbins calls “*State*,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-dq6HCWAN0) and rituals that take you out of* *it. *State* is the emotional condition where you feel energized, and powerful, and connected.

Successful people intentionally create rituals to keep them in State. When they go out of State, they look to their daily rituals to recalibrate their life.
> # ***“Most people in life fail not because they don’t have the ability or the intelligence or the skill, but because they don’t have the emotional gas to get up the mountain of success.”***

![Tony Robbins](0*ALl6fxJrBhIYcP1h.jpg)*Tony Robbins*

## Habit #2 — Perpetual Positive Attitude

A positive outlook will allow you to see the advantage in situations that paralyze others. As the old Stoic maxim goes, “Cheerfulness in all situations, especially bad ones.”

Jeffrey Gitomer, sales trainer and best-selling author of *The Sales Bible*, [said in Success magazine](http://www.success.com/article/jeffrey-gitomer-the-ten-traits-of-high-sales-performers) that one of the top 10 traits of high sales performers was a positive mental attitude.
> # ***“Perpetual, consistent, positive attitude and enthusiasm is the first rule of facing the customer, facing the obstacles, facing the competition, facing the economy and facing yourself.”***

![Jeffrey Gitomer](0*65lPpqild47GAA6k.jpg)*Jeffrey Gitomer*

## Habit #3 — Eat the Biggest Frog First

Mark Twain said that if you have to eat a bucket of frogs, start with the biggest one first (and you should do it first thing in the morning). Otherwise, you will be dreading the difficulty all the livelong day, and the rest of your work and life will suffer.

This willingness to do the difficult first is an essential habit of success, [says Brian Tracy](http://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/), author of [*Eat That Frog](http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/Eat-That-Frog-Audiobook/B002V02HTE).*
> # ***“Successful, effective people are those who launch directly into their major tasks and then discipline themselves to work steadily and single-mindedly until those tasks are complete.”***

![Brian Tracy](0*vCEK9k5GOnhiojHj.png)*Brian Tracy*

## Habit #4 — Imagine What You Want

In an interview with Leo Babauta on Zen Habits, author of *7 Habits of Highly Effective People [*Stephen Covey said](http://zenhabits.net/exclusive-interview-stephen-covey-on-his-morning-routine-blogs-technology-gtd-and-the-secret/) during his morning routine, he visualized his entire day. Covey decided in advance how he wanted everything to go, how he wanted to feel, and the principles he wanted to live by. This is what Covey calls “the private victory.”
> # ***“We may be very busy, we may be very efficient, but we will also be truly effective only when we begin with the end in mind.”***

![Stephen Covey](0*lwZ575Wzz9yeE_Hn.jpg)*Stephen Covey*

## Habit #5 — Start Your Day In Intention

The worst thing you can do right after waking up, [high performance coach Brendon Burchard says](http://store.oprah.com/your-next-bold-move-with-brendon-burchard/detail.php?p=922623), is check your inbox.

# How AI Can Be Used to Increase Sales

## How AI Can Be Used to Increase Sales

When I first started out in sales, I felt uncreative, overburdened with numbers and information, disheartened that I wasn’t doing anything innovative. I wasted a lot of time on administrative work and chasing down the wrong deals. Through these experiences, I discovered what worked, what didn’t, and why I needed to do things differently. And that really continues throughout all of our sales careers — we never stop learning.

What I didn’t have then (and what would have made a huge difference) was a real helper to guide me through the challenges, give me good advice, drive agility and help me focus on what’s important — my customers and peers. There’s a changing reality for all sales teams: artificial intelligence (AI). With the tsunami of information and its ever-increasing pace, technology comes as a rescue to drive engagement and creativity.

Whether you’re new to sales or a seasoned veteran, let’s look at several ways AI can be that best friend, mentor, and helper to support you to learn more, sell more, and, most importantly, get paid more.

Sales teams love data, and AI is the perfect tool to help them to make sense of it. In fact, artificial intelligence is starting to be built straight into CRMs and marketing automation systems, and the funny thing is that people won’t necessarily need to know it uses AI to reap the rewards.

Making a sale is all about connecting with a customer on a personal level, and AI can help to power those personal connections by providing sales teams with the information they need to strike up a conversation. It can make predictions based on how similar leads have acted and by tapping into big data, and a lot of the power of machine learning comes from the fact that it gets better and better over time.

Recently I sat down with Anoop Bhatia, the Chief Executive Officer of [Nowigence](https://www.nowigence.com/lpsales/) who discussed the benefits of utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI).
> I started my career as a sales rep in the mid-80s. The pace of business was slower, and we didn’t have a plethora of digital tools like the web or team collaboration platforms like Slack or the ability to record and transcribe conversations and discussions. Now sales reps work in a digital era where more data is available than they can manage. Staying abreast of all internal and external intelligence to help them succeed is a task by itself. We utilize AI to fill the gap. Their market intelligence is enriched in real-time to help them achieve their goals by continuously grooming leads, strengthening their relations with clients and setting future targets with confidence.

Over the last two decades, we have developed digital platforms for sales reps that ask for information from them like in CRMs. However, these tools contain information already known to the sales reps. Or they receive contact details regarding new prospect from their Marketing department or from lead generating platforms like Marketo. They still need to dig for additional intelligence and spend time qualifying the leads before approaching prospects.

[Nowigence’s](https://www.nowigence.com/lpsales/) AI-driven sales intelligence (SI) platform [Pluaris](https://vimeo.com/340294354) integrates tools and their daily work processes automatically.
> Pluaris is like your personal notepad extracting relevant content from various sources used in your day-to-day work and organizing, storing, and delivering tailored intelligence as per your preferences in ready-to-use formats, added Mr. Bhatia.


A sales rep can only be as productive as the time spent selling. Does anyone want to be putting emails and communication notes into the CRM system when they could be on the phone or working on a high-level meeting? Of course not. This is where the helper part of AI in sales really shines. Let AI automate activity logging, identify high-priority emails, and create new contacts for you. Pass off that admin work and start spending your time in more productive ways.

When you sell into a company, you have to go back and read through all of the past deals that were lost or won — and there are typically a lot of them. AI helps you to have any or all of that information at your fingertips — and to analyze it. For instance, AI can automatically synchronize — and natural language processing can review — all of the calendar entries and emails as part of the millions of data points it uses to make potential recommendations. All those data points are what you use to find the right lead to call or to close a current deal. Imagine not having to do the dirty work because AI surfaces the predictions that you just can’t do yourself. Now that you’re armed with all this information, you can approach the deal differently and with greater likelihood or success.

Humans have always found innovative solutions. Calculators were invented when the accounting needs of growing businesses increased to the extent that speed in calculations became a necessity. Similarly, the emergence of digital media has resulted in an information explosion which is expanding at a rapid pace.
> “Without the power of machine comprehension to keep pace with information, a new era of the impoverishment of knowledge will set-in”, added Anoop.

Artificial Intelligence seems to be the need of the times. We are beginning to understand why there is so much hype about AI. [Nowigence’s](https://www.nowigence.com/lpsales/) platform [Pluaris](https://vimeo.com/340294354) serves to not only provide sales intelligence for businesses that want their sales reps to be more effective and not miss sales quotas, but it now frees up time for sales reps to focus on better tasks at hand.
> “It used to take me days to collect talking points and develop my communication strategy when meeting new clients. It now takes me a few seconds,” said Anoop.

**5 most valuable things you should know about artificial intelligence (AI):**

* (AI) is hyped. Large scalability AI solutions are rare. There is a huge market opportunity of over $7 Billion in B2B to organize textual and conversational data.

* The world of data science knows how to harness quantitative or numeric data but not textual or qualitative data. This data type is only exploding in the world. Twenty years ago, we did not have chat, the web was small, social media did not exist and audio recording was non-existent. Not anymore.

* Nearly, 90% of data is unstructured (textual and conversational). Organizing unstructured data is increasingly becoming a focus.

* Data science skills to deal with automated machine learning in real-time or to comprehend natural language queries are scarce.

* Training and inference are both important to advance artificial intelligence solutions. Training machines faster require large scale and automated data-handling capabilities. Only then can we detect data patterns and the ability to infer.

# Why Personal Development Can Make Us So Miserable

## Photo by Jeremy Perkins on Unsplash

*It started to dawn on me that I was actually really tired of trying to be better, that all the things I was doing weren’t necessarily making me stronger. There was a lot of dependency on external input, what I call the paraphernalia of the new age. And it wasn’t hard to see this. But it wasn’t just me that was feeling that way. It was really me and all my girlfriends. Every time I get off stage the women would come up to me and I’d hear the same things. Basically, we’re really tired. And this is not the point, further fatigue, berating yourself. I’m pretty sure that this is not the point of walking the spiritual path. — [Danielle LaPorte](https://medium.com/@DanielleLaPorte) on [The Unmistakable Creative.](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/danielle-laporte-white-hot-truth/)*

Throughout my life I’ve felt deficient in some way or another:   - While I was in college at Berkeley, it was because my grades were bad  - After I graduated, it was because I had a hard time finding a job and keeping one.  - For the rest of my 20’s it was because I didn’t have a girlfriend  - For most of my 30’s it was because I was living at home trying to start a career   Because of this sense of deficiency, I joined a cult that later became known as the seduction community. I’ve wrestled on and off with depression. I’ve read 100’s of self help books. I could probably open a therapy practice in my living room with the books on my shelf.

# Want to Be Instantly Happier Than 90% of Other People? Read This Immediately.

## Want to Be Instantly Happier Than 90% of Other People? Read This Immediately.

### This is why most people aren’t happy

Most people only ever give partial attention to the most important areas of their life.

This is why most people:

* [Will never have great relationships](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-most-people-will-never-have-great-relationships-bffc4152e978)

* [Will remain in mediocrity](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-most-people-will-remain-in-mediocrity-6c7e24c48d12)

* [Will never build true wealth](https://medium.com/the-mission/7-surefire-strategies-to-build-massive-wealth-according-to-the-top-7-finance-books-bdaa8f348aab)

* Will rarely experience true happiness

Happiness isn’t “success;” there are countless “successful” people who live terribly imbalanced and empty lives.

Happiness isn’t achievement, accomplishment, or a state of being you finally “arrive” at. You can never do enough, or the right thing, so that you finally feel like you’re complete.

**Happiness is a natural result of doing what you’re supposed to do.**

Happiness and fulfillment aren’t easy concepts, but they’re simple. Achieving happiness is a natural consequence of consistently applying the basic fundamentals of focus, generosity, and healthy boundaries — all of which you can start doing immediately.

Want to be instantly happier than 90% of people? Then keep reading.

## Happiness Always Starts With Focus
> “Network tools [social media, email, the Internet] are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.” -Cal Newport, [*Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455586692&linkCode=as2&tag=anthonymoore2-20&linkId=02362eb85ca559576a9275eec66f8676)*

I came across a phrase in the midst of my many years of counseling and therapy:
> # “I finally discovered something better than fantasy — reality!”

When I was growing up, I got pretty addicted to pornography. I was constantly living in fantasy, never really present with anyone or anything. Most of my time was spent living in video games and staring at the computer.

But after years of living in my head, where I would pretend life was different and better…I felt awful. It was like constantly eating candy every hour of every day. After a while, you just feel really sick.

I finally came around and started living in reality. Admittedly, it was rough at first — I had been pushing down a lot of unaddressed personal and family issues through mindless numbing that I now had to deal with.

**But let me be the first to tell you — reality is amazing.**

The feeling of intense focus on whatever you’re doing is incredible. Getting into flow states where time seems to stop while you move as fast as The Flash is truly one of life’s coolest feelings. And you can only achieve this through intense focus.

Here’s how it works. The more focused you are on whatever you’re doing, the better your result will be:

* When speaking with your partner

* When writing

* When spending time with family and friends

* When reading

* When exercising

* When solving a problem

The better your result, the better you’ll feel: more confidence, more satisfaction, and more energy.

The better you feel, the more productive, friendly, generous, and selfless you’ll be. All of which lead to more happiness.

**All this stemmed from how focused you were in the beginning**. If you’re not focused and only give partial attention to whatever you’re doing, the result will not be as good. You won’t feel “happy;” you’ll just feel busy. But the more present and focused you are, the better everything around you will be.

You may think there are times when you only need partial attention, but that’s not true. When paying for your purchase, when parking your car, brushing your teeth, even doing yard work, the more attuned you are to the task at hand and how you feel at that moment, the more happiness you’ll experience in the long run.

## You Cannot Be Happy and “Busy” at the Same Time
> “Busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness: Obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day.” -Tim Krieder

Whenever I talk to an old friend or colleague and ask them how they’ve been, the answer is usually some form of, “S*o busy. Really busy. Crazy-busy.”*

As Tim Krieder wrote in his essay “[*The Busy Trap](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/)*,” this common answer is pretty obviously a boast disguised as a complaint. Frankly, we like being busy. It makes us feel important and needed. We can’t have an empty life if we’re busy, right?

Wrong. Busyness is a powerful happiness-stealer. Busyness is the opposite of focus; essentially, busyness is a form of laziness that means you didn’t set good boundaries with your time.

The myth of multitasking is very prevalent in today’s world. Most people wear “busyness” as a badge of honor. In their eyes, the more they do, the better (even if their life is falling apart). How many “busy” people do you know that are living terribly imbalanced and empty lives? I know a few.
> # *Busyness is a disease. It distracts you from what’s really important and gives you an excuse to avoid the real work.*

When I’m “busy,” I find the days are shorter, yet I feel more tired. It feels like I have less time for what I really want to do. I might get some little bump of feel-good when I tell people how busy I am, but really, I’m just sad and frustrated.

You cannot be busy and happy at the same time. Busyness excludes true focus and fulfillment, shifting your focus to mundane and trivial chores. Of course, you can be busy and still accomplish a lot; just don’t confuse busyness and happiness. The happiest and most successful people in the world aren’t “busy,” they’re **focused**.

I am happiest when I am the most focused. That’s when I can give my fullest gift; my undivided time and attention to whomever I’m with and whatever I’m doing. I achieve the best results, feel the most effective, and create the deepest relationships this way.

If you find yourself “busy” all the time, it’s time to stop and reassess what’s really important, and what needs to be cut out.
> “I can’t help but wonder whether all this histrionic exhaustion isn’t a way of covering up the fact that most of what we do doesn’t matter.” -Tim Ferriss

## Spend 1 Hour Today Giving Your Fullest Gift
> “Spend at least an hour today giving your fullest gift, whatever that is for today, so that when you go to sleep at night you know you couldn’t have lived your day with more courage, creativity, and giving.” -David Deida

Your focus and attention are incredible gifts you can to people each day, but you have other incredible gifts, unique to you. The more you give these gifts, the more you attract happiness and joy.

I don’t know what your gift is — maybe you don’t know right now, either. That’s OK. You don’t need to know exactly what it is yet. But you can spend some time today learning more about what that is.

Most people never spend any energy figuring out what they’re good at and how to give that gift to others. In the words of Darren Hardy:
> # “Most people drift through life without devoting much conscious energy to figuring out specifically what they want and what they need to do to get themselves there.”

If you want more happiness than 90% of other people, spend conscious energy every day giving your unique gift to others. If you don’t know what that is yet, spend conscious energy on learning more about what it might be. ([Here’s a 20-minute journaling exercise](https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/this-20-minute-writing-exercise-will-provide-immediate-focus-and-clarity-on-your-life-goals-dbef4aa40d61) that will provide immediate focus and clarity on what your gift is).

The truth is, unless you know your core mission and align yourself to it, your core will feel empty and hollow. This happens when you:

* Choose money over what you actually enjoy

* Live your life the way others tell you to, not how you want to

* Make decisions based on fear and worry

* Look out for “Number 1” instead of helping others

The reason most people aren’t happy is because they’re overly focused on themselves and not on how they can help others. Once you start giving your gift freely and with focus, you open yourself up to receive happiness and joy.
> “The world gives to the givers and takes from the takers.” -Derek Sivers

## Why Most People Are Overworked, Empty, and Frustrated
> “What kills a soul? Exhaustion, secret-keeping, image management. And what brings a soul back from the dead? Honesty, connection, grace.” -Shauna Niequist

Most people’s reason for doing anything has to do with being happy, achieving their goals, and enjoying total freedom and love.

The problem is, most people get caught up in this search and start taking the wrong path. Uncertainty compels them to choose money over meaning; fear makes them chase superficial accomplishments instead of genuine achievement. This leads to feeling overworked, frustrated, and ultimately empty.

If that’s where you’ve found yourself, don’t worry. I’ve been there. Back in my old corporate job, I was so focused on pleasing my intimidating boss and being the top salesman of the month, I didn’t realize how miserable I was.

That’s when you need to move, lest you stay in an environment you’ve outgrown. That’s a guarantee for feeling frustrated and unhappy.
> # “Don’t stay at the job for safe salary increases over time. That will never get you where you want — freedom from financial worry.” -James Altucher

Setting boundaries is one of the most important actions you can take to produce more happiness and less frustration. Most of my anxiety came from the fear of saying “no.” In the midst of an intense workload, I’d say yes to things I really didn’t want to do.

That’s still my problem. I tend to prioritize not letting others down instead of asking myself, “What do **I** need right now?” Rest? A cold beer? An hour of Netflix? A date with my wife?

When I don’t listen to that red alert in my head, I always start to feel overworked, empty, and frustrated.
> “People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.” -William Irvine

## In Conclusion
> “When you know your direction and are living it fully, you core is alive and strong.” -David Deida

Most people never take the time to learn these behaviors. They take the easy way out — saying “yes” to everything to avoid letting others down. Staying in toxic environments when they need to leave. Taking the short-term wins at the expense of long-term legacy.

If you want to experience more happiness than 90% of other people, you need to figure out what you’re good at and start helping people with that gift.

When you start giving your fullest gift, you will experience consistent happiness and fulfillment.

Until you start giving your fullest gift, you’ll constantly feel empty and busy.

# What is Robotic Process Automation & how does it compare to Traditional Automation?

## 

We, as a generation and mankind recently outlined a critical milestone in our progress. Not too long ago, a [robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(robot)) was awarded the citizenship of a country. Bots and automation have broken the shackles of our imagination and have become a part of our reality. While we are still far away from realizing what we have managed to sell in science fiction movies, we are closer than ever. Robots and automation have, until now, allowed machines to act and work like humans. However, inching closer to the robots of tomorrow, we are enabling these inherently non-living beings to think like us.

Instead of imparting our actions to them along with our flaws and biases, we are giving robots the ability to think for themselves- just as we do, learn from their surroundings, and act on the basis of experience. It is getting hard to discriminate between a human and [intelligent bots](https://www.marutitech.com/make-intelligent-chatbot/) already!

Businesses of today want to leverage automation- whether in its most minimal form or in its entirety. For enterprises, automation means-

• Making processes efficient.
• Saving the workforce for decision making and other tasks still not in the ambit of robots.
• Reducing the costs of operation.
• Minimizing manual errors and faults.

By bundling automation in a software solution, we are enabling organizations to be empowered with this technology of tomorrow. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is that quiet murmur that has now become a scream.

According to [IoT Agenda](https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/robotic-process-automation), Robotic process automation (**RPA**) is the use of software with [artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)](https://www.marutitech.com/category/artificial-intelligence/) capabilities to handle high-volume, repetitive tasks that typically needed humans to perform.
> # With RPA, organizations can leverage quick-to-deploy, cost-efficient tools to infuse efficiency and intelligence to their processes- thereby significantly impacting their profits and revenue.

![](1*YZGHtBYMJpTMDFC4itGQtA.png)

**Robotic Process Automation as the Driver of Enterprise Transformation**

Enterprises all around the world have always dwelled on this - “There’s got to be a better way!”

In reality, only the enterprises who have continually put up this thought in their meetings, in front of their leaders have been able to gear themselves up for transforming their processes. To better their operational efficiencies, businesses look for newer ways to do the same thing ones that would save time and operational costs.

Robotic Process Automation is their answer. Across the manufacturing industry, for instance, there have been several examples of leveraging automation to replace manual labor, making processes swift and seamless.

Only now, all other industries are now looking to grab this technology and make the most of it. While using an ERP solution is the first step towards automating processes, many enterprises are left with “more to be done” to reach their optimum operational levels.

Business process automation allows these businesses to –

• Save on humongous transformation investments while still achieving efficiency
• Grow as an organization without having to spend proportionally
• Derive maximum value from partners and outsourced processes
• Support innovation without having to pay heavily for testing new ideas

These systems can mimic any human behavior and help organizations automate the monotonous and daily routines — thus, effectively freeing up their workforce for most critical tasks. These automated processes could be switching back and forth between applications, logging into software solutions, moving files and folders, copying and pasting data, extracting data from forms and documents and managing it, filling in forms, etc.
> Processes that have a traceable pattern and can be taught to a machine via a set of instructions are the typical processes to automate through RPA.

Enterprise-grade automation is where RPA systems are easily and quickly deployed, and with automation installed in an organization, businesses kick-in digital transformation and bring about significant changes in their efficiencies.

## [**Robotic Process Automation vs. Traditional Automation](https://www.marutitech.com/robotic-process-automation-vs-traditional-automation/)**

The difference between traditional automation and Robotic Process Automation is more than a hairline (contrary to what we imagined). With traditional automation, you could make a machine do any task, any step of the operational process.

RPA, on the other hand, is a form of automation that sticks to the front-end of your system and carries out tasks without having to move to the back-end for anything.

• RPA bots work at the level of the UI and interact with systems just as a human would
• RPA is system agnostic which means that they can work across application types
• Robotic Process Automation enables businesses to take action quickly as they mimic the role of an agent
• RPA is scalable and can be easily integrated with existing systems
• RPA can be implemented promptly as opposed to traditional automation systems

When it comes to deciding whether a traditional automation system or Robotic Process Automation would be the right choice for you, RPA, in most cases, is seen as a precursor to a full-fledged automation system.

RPA is when a more personalized experience is needed to automate a process that is complicated and requires access to a host of other applications. Scenario-based tasks are also preferably automated using RPA.

When asked if RPA could render traditional automation obsolete, [Parikshit Kalra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parikshitkalra/), SVP, Solutions and Capabilities at HGS, drew a comparison between a shovel and an excavator. When the task at hand can be handled with a shovel, you don’t need an excavator.

Traditional automation still has applications that are better off with the technology. Traditional automation systems are a huge benefit when, for instance, you want to move a large quantity of data between systems. RPA only works at the speed of the UI, but traditional automation systems can outsmart an RPA system in this regard.

Needless to say, traditional automation is here to stay.

**RPA Adoption — The HOW**

A lot of work can be automated using RPA in businesses spanning most industries. However, some chunk of these processes may need human intervention for decision making, reasoning, and/or judgment. The task of an RPA engineer, here, would be to assess the complete business process and draw the boundary of RPA, segregating it from the bits where a human would need to act.

Also, RPA cannot deal with exceptional scenarios in the working of a software system. This is another area where an RPA system would require human intervention. But, for everything else, Robotic Process Automation is the key to introducing efficiency into any enterprise.

As a matter of fact, an RPA engineer can look at all these exceptions, create rules within the RPA system and empowering it to handle more and more tasks. In an [interview for McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-value-of-robotic-process-automation), Leslie Willcocks, professor of work, technology, and globalization at the London School of Economics’ Department of Management, was asked about the several considerations businesses need to make to adopt Robotic Process Automation.

The RPA thought leader outlined the following –

• **Strategy** — While automation can be used for saving costs, when employed along with a plan, it can be better. At a broader strategic implementation, automation can yield more benefits.

• **Management** — To launch an RPA system, the C-suite executives must be involved, and the project should be handed over to a competent project manager.

• **Process** — Picking the right set of processes to automate is the key to enabling better productivity and operational efficiency. The processes selected must be stable, mature, optimized, repetitive, and rule-based process.

• **Change Management** — Another critical role of leaders in inculcating RPA within their existing systems is to propagate the change through the entire enterprise. Anything new attracts resistance from within an organization. It is, therefore, imperative to minimize that and make sure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to adopting the change.

• **Infrastructure** — Businesses often develop an entire infrastructure around RPA. What starts as a single process automation experiment turns into a center of excellence with qualified engineers and robot specialists who assess requirements and deploy RPA systems throughout the organization regularly.

With this, it is fair to conclude that Robotic Process Automation planning is a task in itself. But, **how do you differentiate whether an IT solution or a Robotic Process Automation system is the right choice for you?**

According to Leslie, it is essential to analyze the process and the need for automation. As companies begin to look carefully, they will find some processes are better implemented with a traditional IT solution, and some others would function better with an RPA solution.

When a quick and easily deployable system is the need of the hour, RPA is the choice to make. It is advisable and desirable to take the IT department onboard sooner rather than later, as they are often in denial of RPA and its benefits.

**Why Your Business Needs RPA**

Small and medium businesses, in particular, would benefit from the technology as in these businesses, a handful of people handle myriad of issues, including lowering operational costs, bringing new business, retaining existing business, improving workforce productivity, enhancing the quality of products and services, etc.

These businesses are in a better position to reap the following benefits from Robotic Process Automation-

• Improving workforce productivity and headcount flexibility
• Detecting revenue leakages from the organization
• Reducing service costs significantly
• Improving the accuracy of data and its processing speed with reduction in manual errors
• Employees are left with the time and energy to focus on activities around decision making, strategizing, etc.
• A laser-sharp focus on the front office as the back office gets automated
• Ease of documentation of the business processes
• Faster service with bots working at lightning speed

All businesses need an operational boost and want to optimize their processes. Back-end menial tasks hold a considerable chunk of your operational efficiency. Once these tasks are entirely or partly automated, your workforce can focus on the more essential ones, thus, skyrocketing your productivity as an organization.
> # As processes get streamlined and automated in any business landscape, customer service gets better, and customers feel it in their experience with a business. Robotic Process Automation, when applied strategically to any business, helps expand into higher avenues of efficiency!

According to a [report by Forrester](https://www.energiasmarketresearch.com/global-robotic-process-automation-market-outlook/), the Enterprise Robotic Process Automation market is expected to reach over **$2.9 billion by 2023**, while Statista believes the industry will be worth **$4.9 billion by just 2021**. This massive growth rate of RPA is due to its inexpensive implementation costs and massive ROIs. Consequently, the adoption of the technology will surge.

The potential savings for companies that deploy RPA stand between **$5 trillion to $7 trillion**, by 2025 (based on studies conducted at Hadoop). Hadoop also estimated that, by 2025, RPA softwares will be performing tasks with an output level that will be equivalent to **140 mn full time employees**.

At this rate, it is fairly evident that RPA adoption will be universal in no time. If you happen to be an enterprise looking to streamline and automate processes, the time to act is now.

# Sometime You Just Need To Take Action No Matter What The Conditions

## “man standing on sand while spreading arms beside calm body of water” by Kal Loftus on Unsplash

## Nothing is Permanent
> # “We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action.” — Frank Tibolt

If you’re reading this, chances are you are someone with goals worth striving for. Success requires setting goals and creating an action plan that propels you towards them. But when you are on your path to success and feel stagnant or stuck in the same spot — what do you do then? How do you navigate your way forward when nothing seems to go to plan? There’s an old song which echoes the lyrics: *I Never Promised You A Rose Garden*. When I hear it, I’m reminded of the sentiments in the song line that we are not promised optimal conditions throughout our lives. There is no Santa Claus handing out our desires on a silver platter. Life will never be as we expect and we must come to terms with that. Things we don’t plan for happen unexpectedly. Things don’t go as planned, and it’s important to know that despite this, we will be okay. Life is a wonderful journey despite the setbacks, failures, trials and temptations.

**Nothing is permanent expect our thoughts about a situation.** All things have a used by date. Even our struggles and pain have a finite life, unless we give them more energy than they deserve. I recall speaking with a respected child physician when my nephew was hospitalised for pneumonia some years ago. He observed that children have amazing healing abilities because they don’t add meaning and context to their illness, like adults. While they feel lousy one moment, they bounce back just as quick, since they don’t ruminate on their illness which slows the healing process. We should take a leaf out of their book and step back from the chaos of our lives, so we too can also recover quickly from our setbacks.

I enjoy the statement: “Life isn’t about waiting for the storm to pass; it’s about learning to dance in the rain.” Learning to dance in the rain should be our objective because if happiness and inner peace is what we want, it is possible despite outward circumstances. In the statement, the rain symbolises trials, setbacks and frustrations. Therefore, we mustn’t focus on what we cannot control, but lean towards joy instead. It is about persevering through unfortunate circumstances and choosing to enjoy the present moment. Life is what you make of it. I’m not announcing something new, but reminding you there are two ways of looking at your circumstance, yet we focus attention on what is wrong instead of what could be right. It is about optimal growth.

## Don’t Lose Heart
> # “The only man who never makes mistakes is the man who never does anything.” — Theodore Roosevelt

Life is full of twists and turns, some of them contain unexpected situations where we might struggle with: frustration, sadness, and hopelessness. We shouldn't be discouraged when they show up but learn to [Weather The Storm](http://www.tonyfahkry.com/sometimes-you-have-to-go-through-the-storm/). Things will not always go as we expect, but we ought to keep moving forward, anyway. There will always be something not right where we are in our life. If we focus on what is right or what we’ve accomplished, our attitude will be better. We will be grateful and content no matter what surrounds us or how long it takes to reach our goal. We will be happy instead of disheartened. It is for the reason we mustn’t lose heart.

Goals are inspiring. Every person should create short term and long term goals to work towards. Besides, it is important to create an inspired action plan that will help you attain those goals. By inspired I mean pursuing a cause that means something to us. We should find ways to take inspired action towards our goals so we create momentum and move towards them. As we take the smallest step forward, our energy propels us in that direction, and the momentum carries us over the bumps in the road. As we go to work, universal intelligence brings forth our desires and dreams. No matter the circumstances, inspired action should be taken so we are progressing. **The right conditions to thrive and prosper reside in our thoughts, not in outward circumstances. **If our attitude is in alignment with our goals, we’re well on our way to accomplishing them.

## Just Do It
> # “Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later.” — Og Mandino

Is it taking longer for you to accomplish your goals? Just keep taking the next step. Are you frustrated with obstacles and setbacks? Trust the process and the journey that is unfolding. It is leading you somewhere but not where you imagine. You won’t know until you get there, so for now release your worries, judgement and frustration and settle in for the ride. **Enjoy where you are, on the way to where you are going.** Take heart, knowing you will accomplish your goals in due time. Think of a garden. It’s important to have good soil to produce fruit, but the soil need not be perfect to bring forth a harvest. The same goes for you.

Your life doesn’t have to be perfect or problem free to reach your goals, or enjoy happiness now. Authors Todd Kashdan and Robert Biswas-Diener remind us of this truth in *The Upside of Your Dark Side*: “Unfortunately, avoiding problems also means avoiding finding the solutions to those problems.” Focus on what is good and what is going right and continue to take inspired action towards your goals. After all, just do it no matter what the conditions and you will achieve something meaningful owing to your commitment and perseverance.

# Sleeping eight hours a night helps you learn and protects your body

## If you sleep for six hours a night instead of eight you’re causing damage to your body and reducing your brain’s ability to learn and perform.

![](1*sbLvR9SHhOG_rgZT86T9kQ.jpeg)

Let’s split your life into two potentials:

### Life A

- You’re half the size you should be

- Your heart beats irregularly

- You’re obese

- You have no skills

- And you’re going to crash your car

### Life B

- You’re fully grown

- Your heart beats as a heart should

- You’re well proportioned

- You can play an instrument, you can dance, you can kill a bear with a toothpick

- And you won’t crash your car unless someone cuts your brakes

If you haven’t guessed it yet, ‘Life A’ is your six hours a night life and ‘Life B’ is your eight.

Sleep is important and if you’re anything like me — a busy bipedal ape — you’re only sleeping six hours a night and it’s deteriorating your body in a number of ways.

Matt Walker — a Professor of Neuroscience at UC Berkeley and author of *Why We Sleep — *went on the Joe Rogan podcast a few weeks ago and explained all the reasons why sleep is important and made me feel like a right fool for neglecting it so much in my life.

After listening to the podcast, I decided to look into all the problems a lack of sleep can cause in a serious attempt to scare myself into sleeping more.

I then decided it was my duty, as a proud member of our society who knew nothing of the destructive ways of sleeplessness, to share what I found and scare all of you into sleeping more as well.

## **What is sleep?**

Before I get into the problems of losing sleep, I thought I’d explain what sleep is. Not in a condescending “it’s what happens when you close your eyes at night and open them again in the morning” sort of way, but in a scientific way.

So Matt Walker — the professor that upset me — said sleep is divided into two types, REM sleep (rapid-eye movement sleep) and NREM sleep (non-rapid eye movement sleep).

The former is known as dream sleep and the rapid eye movements that take place are thought to occur because the eyes are tracking mental images as the person dreams.

Walker says that whilst dreaming we all become flagrantly psychotic.

- You see things which aren’t there — you hallucinate

- You believe things that couldn’t possibly be true — you become delusional

- You are confused about time, place or person — you’re disorientated

- You have wildly fluctuating emotions — you’re effectively labile

- And you often wake up and forget the whole experience — you have a sudden bout of amnesia

His explanation for this lies in the parts of the brain that become more or less active during REM sleep.

The visual parts of the brain increase as do your motor, emotional, and memory centres. However, the pre-frontal cortex — which controls your rational and logical thinking — gets shut off and in Walker’s words: “it’s as though the prison guards are gone, and everyone runs amok”.

NREM sleep is the opposite of this as it’s completely dreamless. This sleep is split into three stages:

**- Stage 1** — is the stage between wakefulness and sleep, also known as drowsy sleep.

**- Stage 2** — is where your muscle activity starts to decrease and your conscious awareness of the outside world begins to dissolve entirely.

**- Stage 3** — also known as deep sleep, is where the sleeper is cut off from the outside world altogether, responsive neither to sound or other stimuli.

After reading those explanations some of you might be thinking “I get the point of NREM sleep because it probably relaxes the body and recovers much needed energy for the day ahead, but what benefit does dreaming have on the body?”

The reasons aren’t completely clear, however, Walker does a good job of explaining why he believes dream sleep is so important:

“It’s metabolically demanding to have dreams in addition to this thing called REM sleep and whenever mother nature burns calories it’s usually for a reason, because they’re so precious. What we’ve learned over the past 30 or 40 years is that all stages of sleep are important…

“When you think about sleep as a state it makes no sense.

“Firstly you’re vulnerable to predation, you’re not finding food, you’re not finding a mate, you’re not reproducing, and you’re not caring for your young, on any one of those grounds sleep should’ve been strongly selected against.

“If sleep does not serve an absolutely vital function it is the biggest mistake that the evolutionary process ever made.”

With that in mind, let’s have a look at the problems you face when you don’t get enough sleep.

## **1.** **Stunts your growth**

We all know the platitudes our parents repeated to us as children “eat your greens or you won’t grow” and “eat your crusts or your hair will grow curly” as though that were a bad thing. But one thing they never warned you against was the effect a lack of sleep has on your growth.

[Human Growth Hormone](https://www.tuck.com/sleep-hgh/) (HGH) is part of the body’s endocrine system which is highly active in growing children.

You produce a steady flow of HGH during the day but when you hit stage 3 of NREM sleep (deep sleep) your body produces a large amount of it.

You also receive an increase in HGH when you exercise but experts estimate that 75% of all of your HGH production happens during sleep.

Not only that, deep sleep makes up a quarter of your overall sleep so if you are sleeping two hours less than you should be every night you’re missing out on a lot of HGH and effectively stunting your potential growth.

If you have children and you’re letting them stay up late to watch TV or play video games, tear their precious electronics out of the wall so they don’t sneak off and enjoy them in the night like I used to.

## **2.** **Causes heart problems**

Recently I had a week where I only allowed myself to sleep for four or five hours. On the last night before I went to bed I chugged a pint of water and, to my surprise, my heart went into overdrive.

All night and the day that followed my heart was beating completely randomly, I was short of breath and had to frequently sit down because it was making my head spin.

After a few nights of proper sleep my heartbeat regulated itself and I felt like I’d dodged a huge bullet.

I did a bit of reading around and it seemed like the irregular heartbeats were a case of atrial fibrillation (AF) caused by a lack of sleep.

A group of researchers at the [University of California](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161114143833.htm) examined three sources of data to determine a connection between a lack of sleep and AF.

People who woke up frequently at night had a 26% higher risk of developing AF than those who didn’t and people diagnosed with insomnia had a 29% increased risk than those without insomnia.

In this instance insomnia was classified as having trouble falling asleep, not having enough sleep or having poor quality of sleep.

As scary as having AF was for me, googling the heart conditions caused by AF scared me the most. For that reason, I won’t tell you what they are here but if you’re curious — and not a part-time hypochondriac like me — have a search for yourself.

## **3.** **Makes you fat**

Animals sleep less when food is scarce and sleep more when food is ample.

The reduction in sleep not only gives the animal more time to hunt for food, it releases hormones to make it hungrier and increase its chances of survival.

This theory was tested in a [study](https://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/502825) where people slept four hours a night for six nights to see if there would be an increase in their appetite.

The study found that when you are restricted to four hours sleep the level of leptin — a hormone which suppresses appetite — decreases significantly and signals to the body that it’s in a state of famine.

Conversely, the level of ghrelin — a hormone which stimulates appetite — increases and the person develops an appetite for high-carb foods.

The combination of the decrease in leptin and the increase in ghrelin levels can make people overeat and become obese.

I’m aware that this article is starting to get a little depressing, so from this point on I’m going to frame these facts as **benefits of a proper night’s sleep** as opposed to problems with a lack of sleep.

## **1.** **Learn skills quickly**

An increase in sleep helps you develop new motor skills.

On Rogan’s podcast Matt Walker said that if you put electrodes on a rat’s brain and read the pattern as it completes a maze, you see the same pattern being repeated as it sleeps except at a rate which is 20 times faster.

Say you’re learning a martial arts technique and you practice it during the day, when you go to sleep your brain will play the sequence of that move over and over and when you wake up you will be 20 to 30 times better at performing it.

On this phenomenon, Walker said: “sleep is the greatest legal performance enhancing drug that most people are probably neglecting in sport”.

And it doesn’t just help with sport, if you’re learning a piano piece or you’re trying to solve a complicated problem, sleeping on it will increase your ability to exercise the skill exponentially.

When your brain tries to learn something complicated, it breaks the sequence into chunks to make it easier to understand. When you go to sleep your brain then sets itself the task of binding those chunks together to create automaticity.

The sleeping brain isn’t stupid either, it knows where the gaps in your skill learning lie and focuses on them.

According to Walker, the term “sleep on it” or “sleep on your problems” exists in almost all cultures except in places like France where the phrase is “sleep with your problems”.

## **2.** **Make less mistakes**

Not only will you be better able to perform the skills you’re learning, you’ll also avoid making as many mistakes.

When a school kid is low on sleep they make mistakes, are less productive, take longer to finish tasks and have a slower reaction time.

This problem extends to adults too. Studies have shown that sleepy workers are 70 percent more likely to be involved in accidents than non-sleepy workers.

In one Swedish study of around 50,000 people, those with sleep problems were nearly twice as likely to die in a work-related accident than those without.

This brings us onto driving drowsy. According to research from [the AAA foundation for Traffic Safety](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sleep-deprivation-doubles-car-crash-risk-aaa/), missing just two hours of sleep a night nearly doubles your risk of getting into a car crash.

In a statement the executive director of the AAA foundation said: “Our new research shows that a driver who has slept for less than five hours has a crash risk comparable to someone driving drunk.”

You might as well down a bottle of whisky before you drive if you’re willing to do it on low sleep, you’ll be just as likely to crash but at least it’ll be less painful.

## **Conclusion**

Well there you have it, I hope I’ve convinced some of you that having a good night’s sleep can significantly improve your mind and body.

Every time you deny yourself the chance to have a good night’s sleep because you want to watch one more episode of a show on Netflix just be aware of the risks.

There are lots of other problems caused by a lack of sleep that I haven’t mentioned here and I’m sure more will be discovered as research into sleep continues.

Sleep well, learn well, live well and drive safe.

I want to thank Professor Matt Walker for shedding a light on the adverse effects of sleep deprivation and for scaring me into investigating the consequences.

I will be sleeping longer and sounder thanks to you.

# Stop Making Fun Of Meditation And Yoga

## Photo by Marion Michele on Unsplash

***“The thing about meditation is: You become more and more you.”***

***~David Lynch***

There’s a significant amount of our population who seem to think meditation and yoga are some type of voodoo.

Don’t believe me?

It’s true.

And this is highly unsettling to me. Why would people make fun of or deny these highly beneficial activities?

## One word: Fear.

People don’t want to step out of their comfort zones. They tend to think it’s some west coast cult of Zen.

My reaction?


This article is not for the people who already are doing these highly rewarding Summer hobbies. Though you’re welcome to read because you might learn something new! It’s for the people that aren’t quite sure about them or flat out opposed to them. So if you are totally sure (or on the fence) that you’d never try that crazy west coast meditation or yoga stuff, keep reading.

Here are 6 benefits of doing Meditation and Yoga that you might not have heard of and why you should give them a try if you’re strongly opposed:

## **Meditation:**

## 1. Kindness

![Photo by [Sandrachile .](https://unsplash.com/@sandrachile?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*aERPuQiWUZTdRfiY)*Photo by [Sandrachile .](https://unsplash.com/@sandrachile?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

In this 2018 chaotic world of people screaming at each other over politics we could use some more kindness. It turns out one of meditation’s prime benefits is how much it generates love for oneself and others. When one practices self-love, they are in turn more prone to be kind to those around them.

In [“12 Science-Based Benefits Of Meditation”](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation) Matthew Thorpe of Healthline writes:
> Metta, a type of meditation also known as loving-kindness meditation, begins with developing kind thoughts and feelings toward yourself.
> Through practice, people learn to extend this kindness and forgiveness externally, first to friends, then acquaintances and ultimately enemies.
> Twenty-two studies of this form of meditation have demonstrated its ability to increase peoples’ compassion toward themselves and others ([30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979314)).
> One study of 100 adults randomly assigned to a program that included loving-kindness meditation found that these benefits were dose-dependent.
> In other words, the more effort people put into Metta meditation, the more positive feelings they experienced ([31](http://ccare.stanford.edu/article/enhancing-compassion-a-randomized-controlled-trial-of-a-compassion-cultivation-training/)).

If you’re feeling angry, upset or frustrated these days I can think of nothing more beneficial than meditation. Try being kinder to yourself and others. Meditation can help with that.

## 2. Personal Transformation

![“A hand with rings on it reaching out towards the trees” by [Aarón Blanco Tejedor](https://unsplash.com/@blancotejedor?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*ixVXrtGLygQQsoWE)*“A hand with rings on it reaching out towards the trees” by [Aarón Blanco Tejedor](https://unsplash.com/@blancotejedor?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

Upon taking up meditation many people start noticing things about themselves they hadn’t before. They particularly notice changes in the way they think about themselves and the world. This is because we tend to be slaves to our own minds. We believe that all thoughts we think are true.

Here’s a piece of advice. Don’t believe everything you think. It’s not all true. Meditation will help you learn more about the toxic things you are telling yourself so that you can transform into a more positive version of you.

The [Art Of Living](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/meditation/meditation-for-you/benefits-of-meditation) Blog writes:
> Meditation can bring about a true personal transformation from the inside out. As you experience your inner storehouse of peace and security, you will naturally begin to discover aspects of yourself that were previously hidden due to stress.

When this starts to happen, it’s a sublime feeling. You start to realize why you thought the way you did about something and start gaining a higher level of awareness. Higher levels of awareness bring clarity to oneself and their outside world. In turn personal transformation occurs.

## 3. Improves Relationships

![Photo by [Pablo Heimplatz](https://unsplash.com/@pabloheimplatz?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*LAWz3ScvOoZMv-_u)*Photo by [Pablo Heimplatz](https://unsplash.com/@pabloheimplatz?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

Did you know that most relationships struggle because we humans like to believe we are mind readers? Our thoughts dictate our beliefs. When you’re dating that guy and he doesn’t text you back right away you start to think it’s because he isn’t into you. That’s certainly possible. But it’s also possible he could be in a meeting. When one realizes that everything they think isn’t necessarily true, their relationships in turn improve.

It’s also been proven that when meditating people start seeing positive changes in themselves as well as in those in their relationships with the people in their life.

[Sahaja Online](https://sahajaonline.com/6-amazing-meditation-benefits-you-may-have-never-heard-of/) writes:
> One particularly striking instance was that of a practitioner who was able to reunite with his family after many decades — he found and rediscovered his mother and sister and that made him a consistent and deep meditator. As we’ve mentioned before, meditation heals us holistically and repairs aspects within us that are supposed to working well and what we were born with. Relationships, collectivity and effective communication are all part of one energy center — [the 5th center](https://sahajaonline.com/energy-system/chakras/vishuddhi/). When we meditate regularly the innate healing that happens helps rectify relationship issues with everyone around.

By becoming a witness to our thoughts we start to see that they are merely thoughts. Some of them may be true and some not at all. By becoming more aware of the thoughts we have about ourselves, our perceptions of others in turn change.

## Yoga:

## 1. Weight Loss

![Photo by [alan KO](https://unsplash.com/@iyunmai?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*wRTWclPMK4_4mVzE)*Photo by [alan KO](https://unsplash.com/@iyunmai?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

Yoga has some surprising benefits you may not have heard of. One of them is weight loss. There seems to often be more focus on the mental benefits of yoga. People think if they aren’t doing heavy physical activity like cardio or lifting weights that they aren’t in turn losing weight. This couldn’t be further from the truth. In addition to mental benefits and improved flexibility, there’s proof yoga helps one lose weight.

Evie Harrison writes in her [Book Yoga Retreats](https://www.bookyogaretreats.com/news/surprising-benefits-of-yoga-you-havent-heard-of) column:
> A research by the American Dietetic Association showed that your yoga practice can help you [lose weight.](http://wellness.buddhasherbs.com/burn-belly-fat-with-these-5-hacks/) Yoga is a physical exercise, and any physical activity burns calories. But there’s more to it than that. Improving your mind-body connection promotes healthier lifestyle choices, including your diet. As you become more aware of what you feed your body, you intentionally control your eating habits: eating less junk food, watching your diet and becoming a healthier you.

It’s not just the physical benefits that burn calories during a yoga session, but also the mindfulness it provides within causes one to be more conscious about their lifestyle choices. Awareness brings self discipline. Upon taking up yoga one often finds they choose to eat healthier and in turn live a happier life.

## 2. Anti-Aging Benefits

It’s been proven that yoga keeps you young. The irony of thinking that yoga is a waste of time is that it can turn you into a younger version of yourself. This is because rather than just a traditional workout, it focuses significantly on mind-body connection.

Nicky Sehra writes in her [Yogi Approved](https://www.yogiapproved.com/yoga/the-10-most-underrated-benefits-of-yoga/) blog:
> Is yoga really anti-aging? Yes! A consistent yoga practice keeps the circulatory, endocrine, digestive and lymphatic systems healthy and functioning properly. Just a few minutes of yoga a day will enhance your overall wellness. You will attain a natural glow on the outside and see your body transform on the inside.
> Another anti-aging benefit of yoga is stress reduction. Stress can cause an influx of harmful symptoms to our body and emotional health. Yoga helps to restore the parasympathetic system when the body goes into stress mode by slowing down our heart rate.

Take up yoga to not only look younger, but literally feel yourself getting younger inside. Improved wellness and reduced stress lead to a younger version of the self you’ve always wanted to be.

## 3. Stimulates Creativity

![“Iowa man sits at a messy table while holding paint covered pencil and brush” by [Alice Achterhof](https://unsplash.com/@alicegrace?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*fCjUqh4ME65jOXIF)*“Iowa man sits at a messy table while holding paint covered pencil and brush” by [Alice Achterhof](https://unsplash.com/@alicegrace?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

What could yoga possibly have to do with creativity?

A lot.

There’s been proven benefits to one’s creativity by practicing yoga daily. An Asana is a posture used during yoga. Certain asana that activate specific regions in the spine have been proven to stimulate creativity.

Anna Coventry writes in her [Do You Yoga](https://www.doyouyoga.com/8-surprising-benefits-of-yoga-you-may-not-know/) blog:
> The sacral chakra (Swadisthana) is the centre of creativity within the subtle body. It is located in the region of the tailbone/sacrum so asanas that activate this area will also ignite your creative flow. Remember creativity is not just painting a picture, it also relates to the way we think and solve problems which are beneficial whether you are artistic or not! Try adding *Paschimottanasana* (Seated Forward Bend), *Bhujangasana*(Cobra) and *Janu Sirsasana* (Head to Knee) pose to your practice and let your creative juices flow.

By taking up yoga and trying out certain positions one will start to notice they are more creative in their day to day life. Most people would never think that yoga improves one in such a variety of ways. By being open to yoga one will find not only heightened levels of creativity, but also many mental, physical, and spiritual benefits.

## **News That Matters**

### **One blood test to rule them all…**

New studies suggest that a [$50 blood test could spot killer diseases](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6055641/New-genetic-test-detect-risk-five-deadly-diseases-DECADES-symptoms-arise.html). Eventually, this test could be done at birth so that parents know from day one whether their children are at risk of developing five deadly diseases: coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer. Other illnesses and diseases could be added to the list in due time.
> “We’ve known for long time that there are people out there at high risk for disease based just on their overall genetic variation,” lead author Sekar Kathiresan, a professor of medicine at Harvard, said. “Now we’re able to measure that risk using genomic data in a meaningful way. From a public health perspective, we need to identify these higher-risk segments of the population so we can provide appropriate care.”

### **A simple way to build wealth**

So you like no-commission trading in an app, eh? Well, thanks to Wealthsimple Inc., Canadians are getting just that thanks to their [new app which was released in beta last week.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-16/wealthsimple-launches-no-fee-trading-service-in-canada) So you can be the wolf of Toronto’s version of Wall Street.

Although currently only offered in Canada, Wealthsimple hopes to expand to the U.S. and U.K. soon. The app launched by offering the ability to buy/sell more than 8,000 Canadian and American stocks, with more on the way. The app is expected to build up Wealthsimple’s customer base, which already accounts for 100,000 customers and $2 billion, and it will likely compete with Robinhood in the U.S.

### **Level Up Your Friend Game**

Have some free time? If you have about 200 free hours, you could find yourself with a new close friend!

Going off of what we said in [yesterday’s newsletter](https://medium.com/the-mission/nows-the-time-to-text-your-best-friend-5f0fa1190dae) — and as we’ve discussed many times on [*The Mission Daily](http://bit.ly/2jWLdGQ)* — the bonds of friendship are important. Relationships bring greater meaning to your life, so we are always interested in learning more about how those close bonds form. 🤗

According to [new research](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/how-to-make-friends/565742/), it takes about 50 hours of socializing to move from the acquaintance to the friend level. And if you want to level up again from friend to “real friend” it’ll take another 40 hours. But that close friendship mountaintop — that’s 200 hours of bonding. It might seem like a massive time commitment, but good friends are definitely worth it. 😏

### **May the Schwartz be with you…**

Where do astronauts sleep? Lockheed Martin has the answer.

The company recently gave the public [an inside look at what astronauts’ sleeping quarters would look like](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-lockheed-space-habitat-20180815-story.html) for deep treks into the land of R2-D2 and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Actually, based on the “Space RV” description given by the program manager, maybe *Spaceballs* would be a better reference…
> “At about 15 feet wide and nearly 22 feet long, the cylindrical capsule is roughly the size of a small bus…The capsule is designed to house racks for science, life support systems, sleep stations, exercise machines and robotic work stations.”

The reusable capsule will ultimately be part of planned missions to the moon and Mars. It will also be attached to Deep Space Gateway, a spaceport that will orbit the moon and act as a jumping-off point for deep space exploration missions.

### **Say ‘Hi’ to Frank 👋**

Amazon plans to add to the Fire TV streaming boxes so that the online retailer can further dominate the home entertainment market. Like most DVRs, the device will have internal storage and be able to record live TV.

### **Have an idea? See a problem in society?**

Of course you do. 😏

But what are you going to do about it? Luckily, the answer to that is getting easier thanks to higher education programs that focus entirely on fostering creative solutions to problems and encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation.

# Being a Bore May Not Be Your Wish but Being Bored Should Be

## Why Being Bored May Be Your Best Bet In the Attention Economy.
> # We often view boredom with a critical eye. We glorify “busy,” and those with excessive time on their hands must not have enough to do.

But allowing yourself to be bored every so often may be just exactly what you need in today’s knowledge-driven economy. The virtues of boredom include fuelling your creativity. From Darwin to Dickens, many famed creatives were keenly aware of the benefits of navel-gazing.

We’ve become so enamoured with productivity, that we have forgotten how to slow down. We make busyness a bragging right — and boredom, well, that’s just for loafers. Yet is filling every lull with another dopamine hit from our smartphones wise?

We might consider slowing down in order to boost our creativity. Because if problem-solving is the [**skill of the future](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-10-skills-you-need-to-thrive-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/)** — idleness may be our only saving grace.

## Steal Back Those Stolen Moments

Downtime can be rewarding in and of itself. There is no need for guilt in failing to optimize productivity. It may run antithesis to the ‘time is money injunction’ but it’s here — in being idle — that philosopher and writer Bertrand Russell says we can find virtue.

![Graham Wallas [Art of Thought](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/28/the-art-of-thought-graham-wallas-stages/)](1*RzY7dTbg1kQN9KPSOMJsIQ.jpeg)*Graham Wallas [Art of Thought](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/28/the-art-of-thought-graham-wallas-stages/)*

Creativity is a messy affair that often demands heaps of hard work as well as time and space for not working at all. It does not live on tap and is precisely why Russell advocated for working a four hour day. He knew that our creative bandwidth has limits. We need ample to time to prep, ponder, illuminate, and validate.

Today we have room for much more leisure yet often fail to unplug out of nasty habits. The first step to reclaiming stolen moments (by your smartphone or some other stimuli) is identifying opportunities for staring into the abyss. When you’re in a cashier line — refrain from reaching for your phone. When you’re driving — drive. When you’re walking — enjoy your surroundings. When you’re early for a meeting — just sit there and enjoy the view. These are quick ways to let a little nothingness seep into your life.

## Channel Your Subliminal Self

One day Henri Poincaré, the 19th-century French mathematician, was stepping onto a bus and like a lightning bolt, he was struck with a discovery (the [**Theta-Fuchsian functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuchsian_group)** in case you’re curious).

To advance your thinking you need to let go of the problems you’re focussing on. Creative breakthroughs come easier when you scramble and re-scramble seemingly divergent ideas.

![Henri Poincaré](1*Q45AFDKdy8UJ36Li2eLWCg.jpeg)*Henri Poincaré*

Poincaré was interested in how he came to his epiphanies. He postulated that it was his ‘subliminal self’ — he looked at a very large set of problems and let the interesting ones enter his consciousness. The subliminal self then selects the solutions on the bases of beauty (mathematical or otherwise).

Isaac Newton was presumably *bored out of his skull* sitting there under that tree. When he did see the apple fall, in a flash of insight he discovered that all things fall at exactly the same speed. In this most famous of Eureka moments! we witness[ **spontaneous and cognitive](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2011/12/what-are-the-four-types-of-creativity/) **creativity at play.

## Prime for a Shorter Workday

Poincaré worked from a 2 hour morning shift and a second two hour evening one. It was just enough time to wrap his head around a problem and then let his subconscious take over and go to work during the other time.

![The Origins of the [8-hour Workday](https://blog.bufferapp.com/optimal-work-time-how-long-should-we-work-every-day-the-science-of-mental-strength)](1*pXp-DmB2dcUwxlxql-6iiA.jpeg)*The Origins of the [8-hour Workday](https://blog.bufferapp.com/optimal-work-time-how-long-should-we-work-every-day-the-science-of-mental-strength)*

Social media management company Buffer understands Poincaré’s strategy. Staff divide their days into a string of 60 or 90 minute distraction-free chunks in order to get their top priorities done and dusted. They know that there is a limit to the amount of creative work that one can accomplish in a day. Buffer’s unofficial motto is [‘**working more is never the answer**’](https://blog.bufferapp.com/10-of-the-most-controversial-productivity-tips-you-will-read-today) — the aim is to manage your energy, not time.

Working 60-hour plus weeks is rarely the answer to increasing our productivity. And staring at screens all day is not just[ **bad for our brains](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mental-wealth/201402/gray-matters-too-much-screen-time-damages-the-brain)**, it’s detrimental to our creativity. “It takes a lot of time to be a genius, you have to sit around so much doing nothing, really doing nothing,” confessed novelist Gertrude Stein. Don’t confuse[ **shallow work](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/11/21/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/)** with meaningful work. Deliberate deep work, for most, is capped at four hours a day.

![](1*kIpJty-j1LZiBJnQWIIbDw.jpeg)

Schedule in safeguarded time every day (or if it suits better, unplugging a day a week) to meet with yourself. This 100% safeguarded time allows your subconscious to really go to town, wind down new avenues, restore your mind, and connect ideas. Take a long walk or sit on a park bench. Remember that busyness is not something to boast about, it’s often an obstacle to get on with what matters.

The more grandiose excuses for[ **mind-wandering](https://convene.com/catalyst/daydreaming-work/)** could admittedly be classified as activities since they involve moving meditations. “Meditation is by far the most straightforward way to improve your concentration: a few minutes a day with your eyes closes, paying attention to sensations of the breath in the nostrils is the attentional equivalent of a decent workout at the gym” explains time[** management myth-buster](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/why-time-management-is-ruining-our-lives)** Oliver Burkeman.

The perks of popular mind-numbing activities: running, dozing, bathing, meandering, and generally mucking about — are now well known. Walking, the ultimate activity for divergent thinking and creative[** jumpstarts](https://news.stanford.edu/2014/04/24/walking-vs-sitting-042414/)**, was championed by Aristotle, Beethoven, and Hemingway.

## Do Less, Only Better

Boredom is bad we say. With bottomless internet[ rabbit holes](https://www.inc.com/jonas-altman/3-simple-ways-to-optimize-yourself-for-maximum-productivity.html?cid=search) and Netflix marathons to tempt you — it’s easy to fend off idleness. Finding space and time to do absolutely nothing has, rather ironically, become a seriously difficult business.

![](1*_UGgeh6BScG-7eEzhmwpYg.png)

You ought not to be ashamed of being bored. What you ought to be ashamed of is being boring,” declared British politician Lord Hailsham. When we‘re trying to optimise our creativity we need to avoid incessant hours of toil instead of burning the midnight oil. Consider bathing in boredom as an alternative.

# How to Get Whatever You Want the Cleopatra Way | Sex, Story, and Snakes

## How to Get Whatever You Want the Cleopatra Way | Sex, Story, and Snakes

Caesar was staying in Alexandra to collect additional funds for his army when a rug was brought into his bedroom chambers.

The servant unraveled the rug and out flowed the notorious Cleopatra.

![Ohh, well hell there ;)](1*TEwBwUZuF3TE7aQJIWwPZw.jpeg)*Ohh, well hell there ;)*

Startled, Caesar asked, *“What’s the meaning of this?”*

Cleopatra regained her footing and complained to Caesar how her lying scheming siblings exiled her from the city so they could keep all the power for themselves!

She begged Caesar to restore her to the Egyptian throne. She would do anything he commanded!

![](1*nx2GKDfVGdX8REhZChJKCA.jpeg)

Caesar was intrigued.

The servant was asked to leave and the door was shut.

To the shock of her siblings, the following morning Cleopatra emerged from Caesar’s bedroom chambers and was pronounced the new Pharaoh!

Well, actually co-pharaoh. In a disturbing turn-of-events, Caesar forced Cleopatra to to marry her younger brother in the name of reestablishing family unity.

I’m sure many parents have yelled at their bickering children, *“You two are like an old married couple so if you keep it up I’ll have you married!”… *okay maybe not… but historically it was an Egyptian custom for the royal family to intermarry to keep power in the bloodline.

9 months later, Cleopatra had Caesar’s son who she named co-pharaoh after the “unexpected” death of her husband-brother *(she likely poisoned him)*.

![](1*IgzQSCQXxYJf_wxl6ar8Ew.jpeg)

A few years later Cleopatra came to visit Caesar in Rome with baby in hand. Many Romans were stunned when he erected a gilded statue of her in the temple of love. Keep in mind, he was a married man.

Then one morning in Rome, Cleopatra was awakened to learn her beloved had just been stabbed to death in the senate.

![](1*adMP8WSA4a5KvAY5cFyPKQ.jpeg)

She immediately fled the city as a roman civil war broke out.

Antony’s faction needed assistance to win the war so he summoned Cleopatra to gauge her level of loyalty to his cause.

With a continued flare for the dramatic, she entered the city by sailing up the Cydnus River in a golden boat, with purple sails, rowed by oars made of silver. She dressed in the robes of the Greek goddess Aphrodite and sat beneath a gilded canopy while attendants dressed as cupids fanned her and burned sweet-smelling incense. Antony, who equated himself with the Greek god of wine, was instantly aroused.

![Don’t mind me. Just passing thru.](1*HSfnCPbKKTCbhqHDiqQemw.jpeg)*Don’t mind me. Just passing thru.*

9 months later, she gave birth to Antony’s twins.

After years of civil war, Antony and Cleopatra were surrounded by their enemy. And in honorable Roman tradition, Antony fell on his sword, supposedly dying in Cleopatra’s arms.

But Cleopatra, not one to follow tradition, tried to negotiate a surrender. Her main condition was that they let her son Caesarian live, but Octavian responded, *“Two Caesars are one too many” *and* *ordered the child’s death.

Upon learning of the news, Cleopatra walked into her bedroom chambers and shut the door.

The following morning she was found dead having had committed suicide by either poison or snake bite.

![](1*-1JL2vFE-XVT_mKQG1uuOw.jpeg)

Octavian admired Antony and Cleopatra’s courage and so despite their bloody feud he ordered a public funeral to honor them.

Their death marks the beginning of Pax Romana *(Roman Peace) *where then* *Octavian was crowned by the senate to be the first Roman Emperor.

Cleopatra had lived during frightful times.

People had to constantly look over their shoulders as not to be killed by a beggar, solider, slave, noble, or one of the many angry vengeful gods.

But in a world driven by such fear, Cleopatra was driven by absolute passion.

She wanted what she wanted and WOULD DO ANYTHING TO GET IT.

This Machiavellian notion should rightly make us shift in our seats based upon our modern sensibilities, but for Cleopatra she was willing to use theatrics, murder, and sex to get what she wanted.

Cleopatra’s boldness and out-of-the-rug thinking is why she has one of the most recognizable names today despite dying over 2000 years ago.

## How Can We Embrace Our Inner-Cleopatra (without getting ourselves killed or surrounded by an army of murderous Romans)

* She unapologetically wanted to be Pharaoh. **What is it that you want? **Don’t be afraid to admit to yourself what you deeply desire.

* She knew who she needed to persuade to get what she wanted. **Who do you need to persuade? Who is your audience?**

* Humans think in terms of stories *{watch my [Great Life Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRLLs01u4Pmz9szX0n-vWem0zF8iKo5Xn)}*. She packaged her introductions in such a way that would make for a powerful story for these powerful men to then brag to themselves and their powerful friends. **How can you use a bit of theatrics to gain an edge?**

* Cleopatra is not known for her compassion, but she did exhibit a high degree of empathy. Persuasion is about understanding the wants/desires/values/fears of your audience. **How can you help people get what they want so you can get what you want?**

* Cleopatra spoke 6 languages and was educated in mathematics, philosophy, oratory, and astronomy. Egyptian sources later described her as a ruler *“who elevated the ranks of scholars and enjoyed their company.”* **How can you become more scholarly? **Knowledge is power.** **And powerful people like interesting people, but to be interesting, one must first be interested.

If after reading this you come away with a little more historical knowledge and personal empowerment then I would have succeeded in my desire… and go figure… I didn’t even get a chance yet to pull up my carpet to roll myself into it.

# What Can This Five-Century-Old Drawing Teach You? Everything That Matters.

## What Can This Five-Century-Old Drawing Teach You? Everything That Matters.

Let us imagine that it is the late 17th century. A young French nobleman walks down the stairs from his bedroom in a castle in Loire Valley. As he gets to the landing, he pauses, first to look out through the window at his sprawling estate below. This is wealth embodied, he can see the towering fortified walls and vast gardens. Then, he turns slightly from the window and looks directly at a small engraving which is framed on the wall, exactly at eye level.

This engraving is macabre to say the least. At the forefront is [a standing, smiling skeleton](https://dailystoic.com/Skeleton), aiming a loaded crossbow. An hourglass rests by his back foot. A broken arrow sits beside it and there is another one in the quiver.

In very old French, the inscription reads:
> **“Ma flesche (asseure toy) n’espargnera personne**
> **Vous danserez trestout ce balet, que je sonnne**
> **My arrow (I promise you) spares no one**
> **You will all dance the ballet of which I sing”**

This would have been part of the owner’s [*memento mori](https://dailystoic.com/memento-mori/),* part of a daily ritual many people practice to remind themselves of their mortality, of the urgency of life and the fragility of existence. Where this engraving comes from, we don’t know. Who created it is unknown as well. For how long it hung on someone’s wall we don’t know either.

All we know is that eventually, as the years passed, as empires rose and fell, as wars began and ended, and as the inscription’s prophecy proved true for successive generations of owners, this engraving made its way to the collection of the Blanton Art Museum, where you too can stand in front of it, as it hangs at eye level, and stare down the wrong end of that crossbow. If it’s quiet enough, and you concentrate, you can almost hear the skeleton sing his haunting song.

***Life is short. You are mortal. You will die.***

There is a line in the movie *Gladiator* — now improperly attributed to the real life [Marcus Aurelius](http://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius) in countless memes — “Death smiles at every man, and all a man can do is smile back.”

This is the most interesting part of this infamous engraving. *The skeleton is grinning*, a big shit eating grin in fact. The symbolism is dark, but it’s also absurd.

The truth is that death is absurd. For all of the incredible odds that brought life to this planet, everything that is born…is born to die. While we are alive, what keeps us breathing, what keeps our blood pumping is death — what we eat comes from death, our spot in the ecosystem exists because of the species we have killed and the environments we have taken from other species. Who lives and who dies seems almost random and actively contemptuous of our plans. The lives of health food inventors and [people who strive to live forever, are cut short ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/opinion/sunday/longevity-pritikin-atkins.html)almost ironically early. Meanwhile, [a guy who smokes cigars and drinks whiskey every day](http://observer.com/2017/02/what-i-learned-sitting-on-a-porch-with-americas-oldest-living-veteran/) is alive and kicking at 112. Death can come and take us at any time, for the most ridiculous of reasons. Chrysippus, [the famous Stoic](https://dailystoic.com/the-stoic-philosophers/), died *because he laughed too hard at a donkey eating figs in his front yard.*

Perhaps this is too painful to think about for most people. So we deceive ourselves. “I’m going to live forever,” we think. Or, if not forever, for longer than everyone else. That’s what J. I. Rodale thought, the founder of Rodale Publishing, which now owns *Men’s Health*, as he confidently told comedian Dick Cavett he would live to be one hundred years old. Scarcely were the words out of his mouth [when his heart stopped](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/when-that-guy-died-on-my-show/). He died right there on the couch of Dick’s talk show. He was 72 years old.

That’s life. That’s death. The arrow spares no one. The dance includes everyone. All we can do is smile back, move to the rhythm when it calls us, and not be an arrogant idiot while we’re here.

It seems that previous generations were smarter than us, or at least more humble. They commissioned so much art, like this engraving, that it created its own genre *Vanitas.* But even within that genre, the subgenre “The Dance of Death” (*Danse macabre*) is immense. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of murals, engravings, woodcuts, stained glass windows, statues, paintings and sketches.

More than “art,” this was a *practice.* “*Danse macabre* wasn’t just a generalized response to mortality,” [says Elizabeth Welch, a curator at the Blanton Museum](https://hyperallergic.com/406388/dance-of-death-at-blanton-museum-of-art/), “but instead specifically a performative social leveling that could be used by Late Medieval Christians to think about mortality and the inevitability of physical decay.”

The first *Danse Macabre* dates back to the 15th century in a large mural created for the Holy Innocents’ Cemetery in Paris. Another, [*Totentanz](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Totentanz_L%C3%BCbeckR.jpg)*, painted by Bernt Notke in Germany in 1463 depicts a number of figures from all walks of life — a pope, a peasant, an emperor, an infant, a doctor, a knight, a priest — interlocking arms and dancing with dark skeletons in one long chain. One skeleton plays the flute, providing the music for the scene which reminds them all that they will die, no matter who they are, or how powerful their position. And both pieces of art are themselves meta-reminders that everything passes and nothing lasts forever. The first *Danse Macabre* was destroyed in 1669 to make room for a road. The second survived for 479 years until Allied bombers brought about its ruin when attacking Nazi targets in the city of Lübeck on March 28th, 1942.

It is fitting that these powerful pieces of art which have served as reminders for so many people for so long would themselves meet their end in immolation, dancing their own dance of death.

Yet even now, as reproductions or simply as descriptions, the message stands. And having stood in front of that unnamed engraving at the Blanton Art Museum, I wanted one of my own. Working with an artist, I had the drawing recreated and reproduced via letter press, and now it hangs on my wall, in the stairwell ([you can get one for yourself here](https://prints.dailystoic.com/products/arrow)). I pass it after I look through the window which overlooks the lake by my house. When I pass it, when I see that crossbow aimed between my eyes, I think of the lyrics from the dance,
> **[Death to Emperor:] Emperor, your sword won’t help you out**
> **Sceptre and crown are worthless here**
> **I’ve taken you by the hand**
> **For you must come to my dance**
> **[…]**
> **[The peasant to Death:] I had to work very much and very hard**
> **The sweat was running down my skin**
> **I’d like to escape death nonetheless**
> **But here I won’t have any luck**
> **[…]**
> **Who was the fool, who the wise man,**
> **who the beggar or the Emperor?**
> **Whether rich or poor, [all are] equal in death**

And then I go to face my day with a smile and a sense of urgency.

Because what else can you do?

# A Map To Your Inner World

## A Spotlight on Carl Jung

![](0*wUPDuTu4XHv6AVbc)
> # “Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.” –Carl Jung

### **Food For Thought**

## **Spotlight: Carl Jung**

Carl Jung (1875–1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology.

His work is deep, and a careful expedition into his writings quickly leads you to a dark sea where you may stumble onto a startling truth that you contain multitudes.

Exploring his work will help you internalize the idea that YOU matter, and that there is a hidden purpose and reason for who you are and where you’re at in life. With hard work, you can find it.

You, your inner world, and perhaps the collective unconscious, are all far more interesting than any garbage currently circulating on the news or masquerading as entertainment. Your thoughts will become filled with meaning the moment you think they are.

To get you started down the rabbit hole that is Jung’s works, here are some of our favorite quotes:
> The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.
> A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them. As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being. Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.
> We cannot change anything until we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses.
> I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.
> The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.
> Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darknesses of other people.
> There is no coming to consciousness without pain.
> In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.

# The City of Tomorrow

## Disney’s “Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow”

![](0*Sw2IFzfp_8KeedcO)
> # “You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality.” -Walt Disney

### **Food For Thought**

## **The City Of Tomorrow**

In the early 1960s, Walt Disney began to worry about the future of the world. By this time, Disney himself was in his 60s and had many grandchildren. He worried that modern cities were no place for them to grow up, believing that they “were hectic, disorganized, dirty, and crime-ridden.”

Enter: The Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT)

EPCOT was a city concept formulated by Disney that was to be, “a real city that would never cease to be the blueprint of the future.”

Designed to be a company town that would be at the forefront of city innovation, Disney wanted EPCOT to act as a space for testing and stimulating new ideas for urban living.

According to Marty Sklar who was part of Disney’s marketing team in the 50’s:
> “Walt Disney had one foot in the past, because he loved nostalgia, and one foot in the future, because he loved new technology.”

Disney traveled the world searching for the most cutting edge tech. He read futurist books and worked closely with tech companies with radical ideas. He wanted all of these influences to come together into one city: EPCOT.

Unfortunately, EPCOT never became a reality. After Disney’s death in 1966, the land became the Walt Disney World Resort.

![](0*PFWBYwkIbLh-DaBL)

Today, we are still working to create this perfect “city of tomorrow.” Architects and city planners around the world work day in and day out to design transportation, buildings, and systems that will define the cities of the future.

The key is finding a perfect balance between incorporating cutting edge tech of the future while still drawing from the familiar designs we love from the past.

This weekend, March 15 and 16, New York City is hosting the [City of Tomorrow: Real Estate, Architecture & Design Summit](https://www.92y.org/real-estate-summit). Here are just a few of the topics covered:

* Designing for Resiliency and the Transcendent in a Mega-Urban World

* Technology: Changing the Way We Procure, Purchase, and Live in Our Homes

* How Do You Build a Better City? Urban Planners, Architects & Innovators Debate

No one knows exactly what the future holds, but symposiums like this connect you with the brilliant minds who are helping build it.

Want to learn more about where our cities are heading? Check out the Future of Cities podcast. ⤵️

### **Future Of Cities**

## **A Better Future Won’t Happen Unless We Build It…**

In 2007, for the first time in human history, more people lived in cities than outside of them.

Cities shape how we live and they are only becoming more important. But an urban future isn’t necessarily a better one.

In the Future of Cities podcast, we deep dive into topics and technology that are vital to creating a better world. We share stories from history and look to science fiction for clues of what lies ahead. Each episode features interviews with industry leading experts — including city planners, technology innovators, government officials, architects, builders, and more.

Between the urban and suburban would lie the greenbelt, dotted with parks, golf courses, and anything else paradise had to offer. A web of electric monorails and car-sized movers would act as the spokes, zipping residents to and fro. No more grueling commute. No more noisy streets. No more of life’s little frustrations.”

# Why nothing fails like success

## 

Where were you on January 28, 1986?

If you’re American, and you were older than six at the time, the chances are that you know the answer to that question.

On that morning, the space shuttle Challenger exploded over the Atlantic Ocean, killing all seven members of its crew.

A special commission appointed by President Ronald Reagan determined that the explosion resulted from a catastrophic flaw in what are called the “O-rings.” These rings are like rubber bands that seal the joints of the solid rocket boosters that launch the shuttle and prevent hot gases from entering into it.

The problem with the O-rings wasn’t new. NASA had been flying its shuttles with damaged O-rings as far back as 1981. Engineering documents described the O-ring erosion as an “acceptable risk,” the standard way of doing business. As one flight after another was completed successfully despite dangerous levels of erosion, NASA began to develop institutional tunnel vision.

The anomaly eventually became the norm.

Seventeen years later, it happened again.

On February 1, 2003, the space shuttle Columbia blew up, killing all seven astronauts onboard. This time around, the culprit was a large piece of foam that had separated from the shuttle’s external fuel tank during its lift-off and struck its left wing, leaving a gaping hole in the thermal insulation.

The foam debris had struck and damaged the shuttle in the past numerous times. These launches were all characterized as successes since the damage from the foam didn’t compromise mission safety. As a result, “foam shedding,” as it was internally called at NASA, became an acceptable way of doing business, despite the serious risks it presented.

NASA was able to successfully launch numerous shuttle missions, despite the erosion of the O-rings before Challenger and despite the foam shedding before Columbia.

In each case, success created complacency with the status quo. Success boosted egos. Success put blinders on the most capable engineers and managers working at NASA.

When we succeed, we assume that everything went according to plan. When we’re too busy lighting cigars, we fail to see that we succeeded *despite* making a mistake or *despite* taking a serious risk. We ignore the warning signs, the near-misses, and the necessity for change. We chalk up our successes to our skills and genius even where blind luck deserves the credit.

Just because you’re on a hot streak doesn’t mean you’ll beat the house.

The moment we think we’ve made it is the moment we stop learning and growing. When we’re in the lead, we assume we know the answers, so we don’t listen. When we think we’re destined for greatness, we start blaming others if things don’t go as planned. When we declare ourselves to be an expert on something, we begin asserting confident conclusions without bothering to gather all of the facts. We launch shuttle missions despite glaring problems with the spacecraft.

The author Elizabeth Gilbert sums up the same sentiment in her brilliant [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius?language=en): “Creativity,” she says “must survive its own success.”

*You* must survive your own success.

The next time you’re tempted to start popping champagne corks following a victory, stop and pause for a moment. Ask yourself, *What went wrong with this success? What role did luck, opportunity, and privilege play? What can I learn from it?*

And the next time you’re tempted to fear failure, keep in mind the words of English author Dean Inge: Nothing fails like success.

# Here’s How to Get What You (Actually) Want

## Here’s How to Get What You (Actually) Want

### Sex? Money? Fame? Wrong.

Most people who say, “*I want a million dollars*” don’t realize what they *actually* want — the life the money will *give* them. Money is always just a means, never the end.

The same goes for nearly every other stereotypical goal involved in “success”:

* You don’t want **fame;** you want **impact.**

* You don’t want **endless sex;** you want **unconditional love.**

* You don’t want **drugs;** you want **to feel truly happy and at-peace.**

* You don’t want **6-pack abs;** you want **a body you’re proud of.**

* You don’t want **success;** you want to **achieve mastery in something you love.**

* You don’t want **fans;** you want **true and loyal friends.**

* You don’t want to **be a “CEO”; **you want to do work that matters with people you love.

Sadly, many people spend the better part of their lives chasing the wrong goal, the wrong partner, and the [wrong money](https://medium.com/the-mission/becoming-incredibly-successful-means-saying-no-to-the-wrong-money-34fbfddc528b). Even worse, the few that finally reach their goal realize their success isn’t fulfilling. It’s not enough. It never was.

But I have good news for you — you don’t need a million dollars to have the life you want. You don’t need endless sex with a never-ending stream of partners. You don’t need fame, or any other type of stereotypical “success” the world encourages. You can have the life you want, and you don’t need a million bucks to do it.

Here’s how to stop wasting time chasing the wrong thing and achieve all the goals you *actually* want — very quickly.
> “The time that leads to mastery is dependent on the intensity of our focus.” -Robert Greene, Mastery

## If You Don’t Know Who You Are, You’ll End Up Moving in the Wrong Direction
> “Most people drift through life without devoting much conscious energy to figuring out specifically what they want and what they need to do to get themselves there.” -Darren Hardy

When he was 23, Bryan Cranston (Walter White from the world-renowned *Breaking Bad*) found himself at a wedding alter with no idea how he got there. His soon-to-be wife had wanted marriage, but Cranston, having no idea what he wanted, was swept up in the process and said, “sure.”

Years later, he finally got clarity on what he wanted, and confessed his true goals to his wife. The marriage ended in divorce. “*The vows I spoke weren’t empty. I cared about her. I even loved her. But in the end, I wasn’t ready,*” he said.

This lack of focus and decisiveness isn’t uncommon, and it often leads to the wrong destination. Most people are drifting through life towards what they *think* they want without ever having asked, “why?” Often, they find themselves in a scenario wondering how in the world they got there.

Many key decisions — where to work, who to date, where to move, what to say — are made out of fear or desire to fit in. As Robert Kiyosaki wrote in *Rich Dad Poor Dad*:
> # “Most people live their lives chasing paychecks, pay raises, and job security because of the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning where these emotions-driven thoughts are taking them.”

![[Ryan Christodoulou](https://unsplash.com/@misterdoulou?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*aNMy1LcENa16XXl2)*[Ryan Christodoulou](https://unsplash.com/@misterdoulou?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

**This is not the path you want to find yourself on.**

So how do you start going in the *right* direction? How do you make an actual, concrete step towards what you *truly* want?

**By first finding out who you are.**

* What do you want?

* What is a “successful” life to you?

* What does “success” in family mean?

* In your career?

* In your health?

* In your relationships?

* In your relationship with **yourself?**

I don’t talk about the importance of journaling enough. I should. I’ve recently started journaling consistently again, and I can feel the difference. After just a few minutes, I have sudden spurts of creative energy and [crystal clarity](https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/this-20-minute-writing-exercise-will-provide-immediate-focus-and-clarity-on-your-life-goals-dbef4aa40d61) about the next step for an absurdly ambitious goal. I know what I need to do. And I do it without question.

The truth is, a 4-year college degree isn’t the right fit for many people. Neither is working a desk job, working a 9–5 schedule, or even getting married.

So why do so many people continue to try and squeeze themselves into a clearly-bad fit? Why are so many of us still a round peg in a square hole?

Because most people haven’t taken the time to figure out who they are, what they want, and how to get there.

A quote by Tim Grover, personal trainer of Michael Jordan, comes to mind:
> # “People are always asking me about the secrets and tricks I use to get results. Sorry if this disappoints you: there are no secrets. There are no tricks. It’s simple: ask yourself where you are now, and where you want to be instead.”

If you want to achieve real, true success, the answer is simple:

**Figure out who you are first.**

Don’t get swept up by what your family wants, or what you think your partner wants, of what you think the world wants. None of that matters. What matters is getting clarity on your identity, dreams, and desires. These behaviors are what attracts success to you.
> “We cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change.” -Sheryl Sandberg

## You Can’t Control the Outcome. But You Can Control the Process.
> “People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.” -William Irvine

A while back, I launched my first really big online course. It was called Wealthy Writers, and it was all about earning income as a writer.

I had *huge* expectations for it. It was priced at hundreds of dollars. I remember bragging to my younger brother about how much I’d make. “*At least $10,000 on launch date, but I’d be really happy with $20,000,*” I said smugly.

The launch date came. I had told all my subscribers all about it. I was so excited, I couldn’t sleep the night before.

The day came. I even gave a webinar about it.

…Nobody bought it.

On launch day, not even 1 person bought the course.

Thinking back, I can’t help but laugh. I was *devastated. *I was crushed. I was banking so much on the outcome, practically guaranteeing myself it would work. Of course, I had no control over the outcome, I was a fool to think so. My expectations set me up for a huge failure, followed by weeks of self-doubt and insecurity.

When I finally licked my wounds and thought long and hard about it, I realized: **it wasn’t about the outcome**. It wasn’t about the money, the prestige, or being able to say, “*I just made such-and-such money today*.”

What really mattered was **the process**; becoming a more genuine, more helpful, and more valuable resource to my fans. In the words of best-selling author Hal Elrod:
> # “Your level of success will rarely exceed your level of personal development, because success is something you attract by the person you become.”

![[Geert Pieters](https://unsplash.com/@shotsbywolf?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*gCaMeqzOEzE-sZqw)*[Geert Pieters](https://unsplash.com/@shotsbywolf?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

Of course, I need money to pay the bills and put food on the table. But I can’t control the outcome; I can only control the process — my attitude, work ethic, discipline, and continued growth. It is in the process where you can start to [automatically attract success](https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/9-key-habits-that-will-make-you-automatically-attract-enormous-success-ad8af090cefd) — by learning, growing, and evolving as much as you want. This is how you become a better version of yourself; this is how you attract success.

Most people are focused on the outcome, somehow willing fate to work in their favor. But much like watching a sports game on TV, you don’t have any control. All that tension and stress from “willing” your team to win doesn’t actually help (trust me!).

Don’t worry about the outcome. Focus on the process. Do the best you can. This is the difference between calm, serene, at-peace people and those who have extreme stress, anxiety, fear, and insecurity.
> “Ignore what other people are doing. Ignore what’s going on around you. There is no competition. There is no objective benchmark to hit. There is simply the best you can do — that’s all that matters.” -Ryan Holiday

## In Conclusion
> “Those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.” -Steven Pressfield

Ordinary people focus on the outcome. They think they can control it, and build enormous amounts of stress and anxiety from the pressure of trying to “make it happen.”

The truth is, you don’t control the outcome. You can only control the process: working on yourself to become smarter, better, and more intuitive.

As long as you’re focusing on the outcome, you’re attracting stress and fear.

But as long as you’re focusing on the process, you’re attracting success, learning, and growth.

Figure out where you’re heading, or you’ll end up drifting in the wrong direction with the wrong people.

# Going Through A Lull At Work? Here Are 5 Ways To Find Passion No Matter What You’re Doing

## Going Through A Lull At Work? Here Are 5 Ways To Find Passion No Matter What You’re Doing

### Here are a few different tactics I’ve learned both as a leader and as an employee to help myself out of a lull.

***By [Taffi Dollar](https://medium.com/@taffidollar), CEO of Arrow Global Entertainment***

This feeling of hitting a plateau is remarkably common. Some say it’s an all-out [American epidemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/85percent-of-us-workers-are-happy-with-their-jobs-national-survey-shows.html). It’s also, in a way, human nature.

We’ve all been there. After some amount of time at a new job, or in a new position — or after *years* in the same industry — the excitement we once harbored for our work wanes, and we start coasting or falling into what some call a “lull.”

There have been several times in my own career when I’ve felt myself hit a lull. Sometimes it’s been a result of disaffection with the work — the sense that the company I worked for wasn’t fully utilizing my skills — and sometimes it’s followed a period of [personal frustration](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/3-ways-to-soothe-your-monkey-mind-and-achieve-inner-peace/) with my team. I still, from time to time, hit these lulls, like I’m not being as productive as I could be, or my team isn’t realizing their fullest potential.

This feeling of hitting a plateau is remarkably common. Some say it’s an all-out [American epidemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/85percent-of-us-workers-are-happy-with-their-jobs-national-survey-shows.html). It’s also, in a way, human nature. We’re creatures of habit. As people, we seek out reliable repetition, yet repetition itself can lead to stagnation.
> **Regardless of how common, however, the truth remains: a decline in commitment to your work, or in your excitement about your work, is innately damaging. It can lead to both a drop in your professional performance and in your [personal happiness](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/heres-how-to-actually-achieve-work-life-balance-as-an-entrepreneur-from-a-fellow-founder/).**

Given that, professional apathy needs to be actively combated.

Here are a few different tactics I’ve adopted both as a leader and as an employee over my career to help pull myself out of a lull.

## 1) Try to promote and facilitate collaboration.

The chief source of complacency I’ve seen in the folks who’ve worked for me over the years has stemmed from siloed work environments. When day after day you work alone at your desk, completing only the tasks you’re responsible for, you lose sight of the company mission which might have galvanized you initially. You begin to feel like you can’t accomplish as much as you might want. You feel limited and alone.
> *It’s better, instead, to foster or encourage an environment that’s inherently more collaborative — one where your people are inspired to contribute and compelled to do so in creative, important ways.*

This is something you can do as a manager or director by rearranging your teams, modeling the sort of collaboration you want to see more of, or otherwise adjusting key elements of your culture so that your people are more meaningfully incentivized to collaborate. You can work to build that into your foundation.

As an individual employee, meanwhile, you can seek out opportunities to go above and beyond, in this sense, and create value alongside your peers in a way that might open new doors for systemic collaboration in the future. The key is looking for and then summoning the energy required to capitalize on those opportunities.

## 2) Take a “field trip.”

If there’s something specific you’re trying to accomplish at work but you either aren’t feeling motivated to do it or you don’t know exactly* how* to do it, go out and conduct some research.

Find someone you know or whom you know of who has the wisdom or intelligence you’re after. Then, go observe them in action. If you’re looking to restructure your organization, for example, pay a visit to a company who already has a similar structure in place.

Or, go to a place, event, or lecture that’s semi-relevant to the work you’re doing. This is something we’ve done as a team at World Changers by attending conferences together. Through those events and by engaging in team-building activities, we’ve left feeling energized and motivated to contribute more meaningfully to our work. You might be surprised how much it could fuel you and your team with the same inspiration.

And that’s the key: this is something you can do on your own* or* with your colleagues. You’ll be surprised by how breaking out of your routine and expanding your perspective even for just one day can open your eyes to new opportunities and means of reinvigorating your work.

## 3) Read!

Similarly, our outputs, in general, are a direct product of our inputs. So, if you’re ever in a rut, go pick up a book and re-acquaint yourself with the experts and authors who themselves have spent lots of time thinking about the very things you’ve been struggling over.

Studying the solutions, ideas, and minds of others can prove a great source of inspiration. Light bulbs go off when you read. You either say to yourself, “Oh, I’ve never thought of X like that,” or you say, “Wow, *I *can do this!”
> *By reading about people or organizations who have been in similar situations, you can learn how to combat the specific lull you’re facing.*

As a manager, it’s crucial you encourage your teams to invest in their inputs. For example, I recently had my team at [World Changers](https://www.worldchangers.org/) read *Necessary Endings* by Dr. Henry Cloud to help all of us spark new, more creative ideas for taking our work to the next level and getting even better as an organization. It worked so well, it’s now something I ask my people to do once every few years.

## 4) Ask for feedback.

Asking your manager, director, or CEO for feedback on your performance can also be an excellent way to reset your perspective. Often, these constructive conversations will help you do things like set new milestones or establish new objectives to focus on.

As it turns out, that intentionality is crucial toward developing professionally. It’s a means of combating our natural human tendency to become complacent in our routines. And to this end, it’s on us to “own” our cognitive development. This is good in and of itself, but it’s also a great thing to do anytime you feel yourself becoming complacent.

Energy is useless if it’s not directed toward something tangible and specific.

## 5) Secure an outlet unrelated to your work to focus on in your downtime.

Finally, if all you have in your life to direct your energy towards is work — creative or otherwise — you’ll burn out or grow bored.

For me, finding a few other things I really cared about and that I could work to improve at made me happier in my personal life, as well as more focused when I was in the office. For me, this was interior design and travel. By focusing on getting better and more creative at the former, and allowing myself to reset and relax by way of the latter, I found I was able to return to the office each morning more fresh and ready to kill it.
> # Here’s the truth: at the end of the day, unless you challenge yourself to continue growing and developing, you’ll inevitably stagnate.

In other words, this is on you.

All of us are in control over our own destinies and our own minds. All of us possess the power to combat professional stagnation. It’s a matter of being self-aware enough to realize when you or the team you’re in charge of need to make a change, refocus, or simply try harder.

It just so happens that doing this is essential not just to our satisfaction in our work and in our personal lives, but also in our continual development and growth as people and professionals.

# 5 Steps To Craft A Memorable, Attention-Grabbing Sales Pitch

## 5 Steps To Craft A Memorable, Attention-Grabbing Sales Pitch

### Here’s how to leave a strong impression.

***By [Sami Rusani](https://twitter.com/SamRusani), CRO at ShipChain***

We’re all being bombarded with a constant stream of information. Every single minute, we have some news article, video, email, text message, tweet, or photo competing for our attention.

When you give a sales pitch, you’re battling that information overload for your [audience’s attention](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/sami-rusani/how-to-grab-an-audiences-attention/).

You’re trying to get the people in the room to focus on you-not their phone, not their email, not their dinner plans. You need their attention to be on your offering, right up until the moment they sign on the dotted line.

Here’s how you craft a pitch that will grab attention and leave a strong impression:

## 1. Prepare several days to weeks ahead of time.

Almost every bad sales pitch I’ve ever given was a result of not doing my research ahead of time.

Failing to do the proper research isn’t just dumb, it’s also disrespectful to the people you’re pitching. It’s a waste of time. Everyone assumes that if you’re standing in front of them, you’re a professional who knows what you’re doing.

If my team and I at [ShipChain](https://shipchain.io/) have an important call with a massive corporate client, we prepare for days-potentially even weeks ahead of time. We create custom decks. We extensively research the company we’re pitching. We research the *individuals* we’re pitching.
> When you stand in that room, your presentation has to feel like it’s tailored to that specific group of people. You’re strumming the guitar, looking into their eyes and saying, “This song is for you.”

But the only way to play the right tune is by researching. Find something unique about the company. Figure out what the person you’re presenting to is interested in and casually incorporate it into your sales pitch.

In my experience, everyone enjoys working with like-minded people. And they definitely prefer knowing the person [selling a product](https://medium.com/@SamRusani/how-to-sell-a-technical-product-without-drowning-people-in-jargon-c1505d1d3cb) to them did their homework before walking in the door.

## 2. Only present to the decision maker.

I can’t stress this enough: If you aren’t presenting to the decision maker, it doesn’t matter how much work you’ve done ahead of time.

If the decision-maker isn’t present, someone else is listening to what you have to say. And tomorrow afternoon, they’re going to walk into their boss’s office and pitch your company for you.

It won’t be anywhere near the quality of your actual [presentation](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/richardnewman/the-power-of-the-pause-the-secret-to-making-your-presentations-more-impactful/).

Never let anyone else pitch your company. If the decision maker isn’t available, change the meeting to a different time. Do whatever you can to get in front of the person in charge. That way, you only have to present once, and everyone only has to hear it once.

## 3. Pique their interest by showing what’s in it for them within the first 30 seconds.

When you’re pitching, you’re essentially on a stage. And like any good entertainment, you have to make it exciting.

A good tip is to start with something that gets their attention and keeps it. It could be a surprising fact not many people know. It could be an extremely relevant math problem. It could be a joke. It just has to be interesting.

Remember though, you don’t have [an unlimited amount of time](https://medium.com/@SamRusani/4-time-management-skills-i-use-to-boost-productivity-363c1a739e27) to spend on a convoluted joke about fictional characters walking into a bar. People need to know up front what’s in it for them.

**If there’s one thing I’ve learned, the higher up the exec, the lower their tolerance for people wasting their time.**

You’ll run into people who will wait two minutes and then tell you, “Alright, that’s enough. I’m not interested.” When you don’t know how much time people are prepared to give you, you have to articulate your value quickly and get everyone’s attention right off the bat.

## 4. Be able to wing it when necessary.

If you’re invited to pitch, and you have time to prepare, then you should be prepared. No exceptions.

But there will be times when you have to give an impromptu sales pitch at a conference or a meetup. In these situations, you want to be able to adapt it and give it flawlessly. You have to know your pitch so well that you can change it in an instant to make it one-third shorter or twice as long.

That comes down to preparation, though. You have to be able to recite your sales pitch perfectly if someone shakes you awake at 3 a.m. and asks why they should buy from you. That only comes from practice.

## 5. Remember to close with an ask.

Let’s say you just wowed the room with your sales pitch. People are on board, you can just feel it. So, what next?

Your goal should always be some sort of close. That could mean they sign a contract right then and there, or it could mean you’re taking it to the next step. But you have to know what that next step is.

Maybe it’s a due diligence process. Maybe it’s a discovery process to sign a letter of intent. Whatever the case, you have to understand how to move forward and be prepared to make it happen.

The excitement you’ve created during your pitch will evaporate if you don’t have a close.

Not every presentation is going to [lead to a sale](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/stephanie-danielsson/4-ways-social-selling-can-help-you-build-better-customer-relationships-and-boost-sales-revenue/). Some people won’t be interested, even if you nail it. But give yourself a fighting chance by doing your homework, making it interesting, and practicing it religiously—that’s the formula for closing.

# There’s An Elephant In Your Brain

## Why We Do What We Do

![](1*3W3LluXXjsejCE7ferQ0bw.jpeg)
> # “Change the way you look at things and the things you look at change.” ― Wayne W. Dyer

### **Food For Thought**

## **Why We Do What We Do**

Do you *REALLY *know why you do what you do?

We are constantly telling ourselves stories about who we are and what we do. On the surface, these stories check out, but if you dig a little deeper, they may not hold as much truth as we like to pretend they do.

One common example of this is in people’s explanations for why they go to college:

You are going to college to learn, right? 🤔

Yet you are happy when classes are canceled, and 99 times out of 100, you wouldn’t go to college if there was no official credential given at the end.

So are you really there to learn… or just there to get the degree?

These type of false stories we wear as truths are what Robin Hanson and Kevin Simler call “the elephants in the brain.” They are the hidden motivations that exist behind everything we do in life but that we hardly ever address.

Why are we modest? Why do we refrain from expressing unconventional views? Why do we talk about this thing or that thing in this way or that way when we think something else entirely?

According to Robin Hanson, who joined us on Mission Daily:
> “This the nature of human hypocrisy. We are all supposed to say certain kinds of things in certain contexts, and we all know [they’re] not true, but we don’t want to be caught on record denying the things we are supposed to say.”

In fact, not only is the explanation we give others not often our true motivation, but there’s never just *one* motivation anyway. Every decision we make operates under a mix of motivations pushing and pulling us in different directions. There is never a single reason for an action, but several reasons that we assess and assign weight to.

So why does any of this matter?

For a couple reasons:

* Being aware of what’s really motivating you can help you make better decisions about what you should do and how you should delegate your time, money, and energy.

* Understanding what is really motivating you can help you see past the mask that others wear and understand their true motivations.

* And finally, the sooner we all start to recognize one another’s false stories, the sooner we can start to shed these stories and replace them with the uncensored truths.

## **There’s An Elephant In Your Brain**

Why did you choose to listen to this episode? Why are you listening to it in one app versus another? Why are we asking you all these questions? Robin Hanson, our guest today, is here to shed some light on these questions and more.

As the author of *The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life*, Robin has turned his focus on what makes humans tick and what motivates us to act and behave as we do. In this interview, Robin and Chad discuss behavior patterns, the mixed motivations that influence people, and how we can become more aware of these “elephants” in our brains.

## **The Elephant In The Brain**
> “Human beings are primates, and primates are political animals. Our brains, therefore, are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better — and thus we don’t like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is ‘the elephant in the brain.’”

# How to Avoid Building Up Bodily Tension and Consistently Feel Relaxed

## How to Avoid Building Up Bodily Tension and Consistently Feel Relaxed

### You’ll Never Win the Comparison Game. Do This Instead.
> “The stiffest tree is readiest for the ax.” -Bruce Lee

A few years ago, I was working as a telemarketer. I’d make around 250 calls a day to angry, volatile strangers who would consistently yell at me, cuss me out, and berate me for bothering them.

I was drinking 6–8 cups of coffee every workday (then slugging 2–3 drinks after work to calm down). I would wake up sweating in a panic in the middle of night. Every day at work felt like I was walking around with a gigantic black, nasty cannonball of stress in my gut.

I’d see my therapist, and he’d ask me how work was going. I’d say how hard it was to keep it all together. He would sometimes interrupt me and ask why my shoulders suddenly tensed, or why my hands were suddenly balled into fists. I’d look down in surprise and tell him I hadn’t even noticed.

Here’s an interesting fact about nature: if a gazelle successfully escapes from a hungry cheetah, it doesn’t just trot back to its normal life and pick up right where it left off. No, the gazelle will spend up to an hour after the chase in a trance-like state, swaying back and forth, eyes rolling, mouth open, their body releasing the explosion of sheer adrenaline from running for their lives.

After that, the gazelle is fine. **They rejoin the herd as if nothing happened.**

Humans respond very differently after incredibly stressful situations. What do you after a stern lecture from your boss about your mediocre performance? Or after a near car crash? What do you do after a public humiliation or an intimidating confrontation?

Most people just go back to what they were doing without releasing *any* of the tension. All that jaw-clenching fear, white-knuckle adrenaline, energy, and anxiety isn’t released; it stays in the body, and is always expressed in constant bodily tension.

Sadly, this is how many people live their lives. They experience constant extreme stress, but they hardly notice it. They rarely release it in productive ways (bingeing on TV and alcohol don’t count). They walk around with the world on their shoulders, pretending everything is fine.

I still find myself stressed out and anxious, sometimes incredibly so. I still walk around with tense shoulders and a flexed stomach without realizing it.

But through intensive therapy, I’ve learned how to calm down, and stay calm. I can relax more easily and fully. [Difficult conversations with intimidating people](https://medium.com/the-mission/heres-what-to-do-when-you-royally-mess-up-8706c8869c78) don’t leave me a frayed bundle of nerves (usually). I know how to release extreme stress and go back to my day — something I could never do before.

Here’s how to avoid building up bodily stress and consistently relax more.

## How to Avoid the #1 Body Stressor
> “The main way you generate bodily tension is by turning attention back on yourself in self-concern, curling yourself up so tightly that you feel all knotted up.” -David Deida

**A preoccupation with the self **is a guarantee to create bodily stress and anxiety.

I’m not talking about healthy self-care or introspective reflections on your life; I mean obsessive worrying and endless thinking on the problems in your life.

This bodily stressor is often caused by:

* Obsessing about your competition (instead of your own progress)

* Focusing on avoiding worst-case scenarios (instead of seeking best-case ones)

* Making decisions based on fear (instead of on opportunity)

* Constant self-loathing (instead of self-love)

![Photo by [Joshua Rawson-Harris](https://unsplash.com/@joshrh19?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*JcG5WXT_fw9S4IR1)*Photo by [Joshua Rawson-Harris](https://unsplash.com/@joshrh19?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

I’ve done all these. I still do at times.

For instance: the other day, I went tuna fishing for the first time. I went out on a big boat with my father-in-law and his expert sportfishing friends.

We caught several big tuna, yellowfin, and rockfish. I’d been lake fishing before, catching little 3–5lb trout; these tuna were 80lbs. The rods were different and foreign to me. In the middle of waiting for a small rockfish to bite, I realized my knuckles were white from griping the rod so tightly.

I didn’t want to mess up — lose the fish, look stupid, or (god forbid) accidentally drop the expensive rod in the ocean! I was tense, nervous, and more focused on not messing up.

That scenario reflects how many people live their life — afraid, tense, and terrified of messing up. So they go through life often unaware of how tense and coiled-up they are.

During a counseling session with my therapist, he taught me a lesson I’d never forget. There’s fight and flight, but there’s also *freeze. *This is how someone reacts when they’re too scared to even move.

That described me for most of my life. I was terrified of fighting against my bullies and aggressors, and too afraid to even run. So I’d freeze. I’d constantly be flexing my abs, haunching my shoulders, and tensing my jaw. Constantly.

The ancient stoic philosopher Seneca once wrote:
> # “A man who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary.”

Your worrying is literally killing you. All this unreleased bodily stress negatively influences your relationships, quality of work, sleep, health, mood, and attitude.

The solution? Stop worrying about yourself and focus on helping others instead.

**What you focus on, magnifies. You attract what you are.**

## You’ll Never Win the Comparison Game. Do This Instead.
> “Most people think in terms of ‘I have to do what my colleague/neighbor/family member is doing’ instead of ‘I have to do what’s best for me.’” -Grant Cardone

Every moment you spend being jealous is a moment wasted.

We don’t have much time in this world. The most successful and renowned individuals have often commented later in life how surprisingly fast it all went.

**You don’t have time to be jealous.**

If you constantly look to the actions of others, you rarely act like *yourself. *Your values and behavior have a harder time aligning, making you unhappy and empty.

In the words of author Ryan Holiday:
> # “Ignore what other people are doing. Ignore what’s going on around you. There is no competition. There is no objective benchmark to hit. There is simply the best you can do — that’s all that matters.”

Instead of wasting away in mediocrity playing the comparison game, choose to spend that time working on yourself instead.

I once heard being jealous and resentful is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. I thought that was an eerily accurate description.

One of the best pieces of advice I’ve heard on this topic was four simple words:

*“Stay in your lane.”*

It doesn’t matter how much faster they’re going. It doesn’t matter how much faster *you’re* going. If you keep looking at other lanes, you’re going to crash.

Focus on you. Learn all you can. Experiment, fail, discover what works.

Soon, you’ll build momentum. And one day, you’ll look around you, and marvel at just how damn fast you’re going.

As long as you’re trying to be something for the sake of someone else, you’ll never be able to fully relax.

Cut out jealousy. Spend all your spare time learning and growing.
> “If your lifestyle does not add to your healing, it will subtract from it.” -Benjamin Foley

## Don’t Be So Emotionally Rigid. Be Flexible and Gracious With Yourself.
> “It would be a great violation of humanness to be rigidly perfect in conduct. The repressive vigilance such white-knuckling requires does not signify an achievement but a self-defacement.” -David Richo, How to Be an Adult

The world is not black-and-white. Neither are you. You are a complex being, existing with a full spectrum of simultaneous emotions and truths at every moment.

Most people think in terms of a single judgement:

* I am depressed

* I am a great father

* I’m an introvert

* I’m a piece of crap

But this emotional rigidity doesn’t integrate the full spectrum of who you are. These single judgements don’t allow the full truth. You are many things. Once you realize this, the constant stream of stress from attempting to sustain an unsustainable reality will dry up.

One of the most powerful truths I learned from my many years of counseling was that the world isn’t black-and-white, and neither am I. The world is full of gray areas that incorporate both.

Instead of single judgements, phrase your life like this:

* I am depressed, but I’m still a loving, caring friend working through a difficult emotional problem

* I am a great father in a lot of ways, but there are also times when I am controlling and selfish with my kids

* I am an introvert, but sometimes I’m a huge extrovert

* I feel like a piece of crap, but I’m also a reliable, trustworthy friend and colleague

You can be both. Emotional rigidity and the white-knuckling that comes from trying to be perfect isn’t an achievement, it’s a tragedy.

In a letter to his friend, Bruce Lee wrote:
> # “Alive, a man is supple, soft; in death, unbending rigor. All creatures, grass and trees, alive and plastic, are pliant, too, and in death all feeble and dry. Unbending rigor is the mate of death, and yielding softness, the company of life.”

Unbending rigor resembles death and stress; fluidity and flexibility resemble a healthy body. Embrace your flexibility and full spectrum of emotions, and you reduce stress mightily.

## In Conclusion
> “What kills a soul? Exhaustion, secret-keeping, image management. And what brings a soul back from the dead? Honesty, connection, grace.” -Shauna Niequist

You don’t need to work in telemarketing to build on extreme bodily tension. You don’t need to be a surgeon or stockbroker or police officer.

All you need to do is continue living the toxic way most people do — obsessing over image management, your self, and pleasing others instead of doing what you need to do for your own goals.

It’s deceptively easy to become a hypochondriac for your own emotional well-being. Most people are severely ill-equipped to deal with the extreme stress they constantly experience. It’s no wonder recreational drugs, alcohol abuse, TV bingeing, and other mind-numbing activities have become so prevalent recently.

Living a life where you constantly have to fight with yourself about your choices, actions, and behaviors is incredibly exhausting.

If you want to reduce extreme bodily stress and consistently feel relaxed, focus on doing what you need to do, not what others want. Embrace your imperfections and gray area. This way, you avoid falling in the endless rat-race of comparison and perfection most people are in.

# Teasing Makes Us Human

## In Defense Of Teasing

![](1*zpd4kL1cKafTeofrK1xQ4Q.jpeg)
> # “The most wasted of all days is one without laughter.” — E. E. cummings

### **Food For Thought**

## **Teasing Makes Us Human**

Human communication is built on a fusion of shared history and influence, cultural stereotypes, vocal inflection, and subtle physical and facial cues.

Impressively, our brain is able to soak in this complex mix of signals, interpret them, and respond at baffling speed. In less than a second, your brain is able to read a room, understand a stranger’s emotional state, or know exactly what your partner is thinking.

One of the more complex ways that humans communicate is through teasing.

Teasing has gained a bad rap lately because it is often used interchangeably with “bullying.” Teasing is not bullying. Rather, it’s a playful, healthy way that humans can grow closer and test boundaries.

As shared in the article, [*Why Affectionate Teasing is Kind and Necessary](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/why-affectionate-teasing-is-kind-and-necessary/)*:
> “When we enjoy being warmly teased, it’s because the teasing remark emerges from a genuine insight into who we are. This person has studied us and put their finger on a struggle that’s going on in us; they’ve taken the part of a nice — but currently under-supported — side of who we are. It’s pleasing because normally others don’t see much past the front we put on for the world. Typically, the world just thinks we are gloomy, or stern, or intellectual, or obsessed by fashion. The teaser does us the favour of recognising that the dominant front isn’t telling the whole story; they’re kind enough and perceptive enough to see past the surface.”

Teasing points out a trait about who you are that you may hide, be embarrassed of, or are even unaware of. To be teased in a constructive way, means that someone is paying more than surface-level attention to you.

According to Dr. Diana Fleischman, who joined us [on today’s Mission Daily episode](http://bit.ly/2IdmAnf), “humor allows you to tell people difficult truths.”

The joke may sting at first, but it can help you uncover truths about yourself and draw you closer to the teaser.

Here are a few benefits of teasing:

* Learning to respond positively to playful teasing can help you build resilience against true bullying.

* Teasing lets you test and create healthy boundaries between yourself and those you care about.

* Teasing allows you to put on a playful mask that helps you navigate tough or awkward social situations.

* Teasing is a way to flirt and build new relationships.

* When harsh criticisms have to be made or tough subjects discussed, teasing can lighten the mood or ease the blow.

* Perhaps most importantly, it deepens existing relationships and builds trust in new ones. In a world where people often feel isolated or divided, teasing creates a bridge between strangers.

There are many social benefits of healthy teasing, but as a culture, our overcorrection of bullying is slowly pushing teasing out of our interactions. There is a fine line between tasteful jokes and hurtful bullying, but just because the line is fine, doesn’t mean we should strive to completely eliminate teasing.

If we reject teasing altogether, we may lose a vital part of our identity as humans and a critical way that we build deep, meaningful connections.

### **Mission Daily**

## **Minimizing Your Suffering Footprint With Dr. Diana Fleischman**

Dr. Diana Fleischman has been obsessed with evolution since she was a little girl. Today, she is a leading researcher in the field of evolutionary psychology, a soon-to-be author, and a force in the effective altruism movement.

In addition to discussing the social value of teasing, Chad and Dr. Fleischman also talk about her research, how the EA movement is redefining animal suffering, and how you can minimize your suffering footprint.

[**🎧 Listen to the Episode. 🎧](http://bit.ly/2IdmAnf)**

### Deep Dive

## In Defense of Teasing
> “The reason teasing is viewed as inherently damaging is that it is too often confused with bullying. But bullying is something different; it’s aggression, pure and simple. Bullies steal, punch, kick, harass and humiliate. Sexual harassers grope, leer and make crude, often threatening passes. They’re pretty ineffectual flirts. By contrast, teasing is a mode of play, no doubt with a sharp edge, in which we provoke to negotiate life’s ambiguities and conflicts. And it is essential to making us fully human.”

### **Further Reading**

## **How The Mind Works**
> “Some people think that evolutionary psychology claims to have discovered that human nature is selfish and wicked. But they are flattering the researchers and anyone who would claim to have discovered the opposite. No one needs a scientist to measure whether humans are prone to knavery. The question has been answered in the history books, the newspapers, the ethnographic record, and the letters to Ann Landers. But people treat it like an open question, as if someday science might discover that it’s all a bad dream and we will wake up to find that it is human nature to love one another.” ― Steven Pinker

# People Problems

## Who’s Fault Is It Anyway?

![](1*nyv5b1tOPYg8htSte3i23A.jpeg)

I’ve got a client (we’ll call her Jenny) who’s got some real people problems. She believes her boss is threatened by her and most of her direct reports want her job. Based on what she’s told me, she has reason to believe that these people would all love to see her fail.

But Jenny had another problem, and it was the one I could help her with most. You see, neither Jenny or I can change what other people think. We can only work on how *she behaved* when she was with them, to give them a reason to see her differently.

Jenny didn’t like this idea.

“*Why is this my fault*?” She asked me. “*Why do I have to be the one to change*?”

This was a reasonable question from a woman who had earned her stripes. She’d gotten kudos for years and overcome obstacles to deliver stellar results. Obviously whatever she’d been doing until now was working to produce results. Why *should she* be the one to change?

Well of course she didn’t need to change. She could choose to leave if her situation was too unbearable. I asked her if she wanted to move to another group or company, and that wasn’t really appealing to her. I asked her if she’d ever encountered these issues in previous jobs. That’s when we hit the jackpot.

“*Of course I have. You don’t get ahead in my field if you don’t threaten people and people don’t want your job. We’re a competitive industry*.” She paused. “*I don’t want to leave, I want them to change*.”
> Anything but a win-win is a no-win scenario between people.* — [Click To Tweet](https://ctt.ac/9J1cM)*

## It’s Not Your Fault, But It Is Your Problem

![](0*o_9O5EepR2R26yrJ.jpg)

Jenny’s first challenge in finding a way out of this dynamic that has obviously plagued her entire career was in learning to see it in terms other than fault, blame and win/lose. Jenny (and perhaps her colleagues, too) had created a situation where for Jenny to win, they had to lose. Thus in her mind if she “changed” how she dealt with them, she was admitting defeat.

I worked with Jenny for a while to review her past experiences through this lens.

* **Had she really “won”?** Not really. She’d gotten ahead but some of the burned bridges came back to collapse at uncomfortable times

* **Did the need to “win” stress her out?** All the time.

* **Did she know other people in her field who got ahead without having to make others “lose”?** Yes.

* **Was her “win-lose” approach working in her current situation?** Nope.

With these truths staring her in the face, Jenny opened herself to growing into the opportunity to change herself in ways that were authentic, [lower stress](http://supportfiles.scribeseo.com/post-internal-links.aspx?kwds=Lower%20Stress&url=http%3A%2F%2Finpowercoaching.com%2Fdont-cope-with-stress-neutralize-it%2F) and effective for dealing with the people giving her headaches.

## You’re Not Changing, You’re Growing

When Jenny saw her opportunity to change as *growth*, she shifted her belief that change meant admitting defeat. She realized she was doing this work proactively–for herself! Because she wanted to. In the end her desire to change had nothing to do with the other people. It had everything to do with her.

And this was the moment she gained control over the resources within herself to grow into the change that made all the difference.

# The Day When All Your Problems Become Too Much — A Simple Solution.

## Image Credit: TONY KELLY

That’s the day I’m having today. I couldn’t get to sleep last night from all the stress.

Eight months of trying to find the right career; a sudden move of house with only three weeks to find a place and move; an overseas holiday that I’m not ready for.

On some days, your problems will become too much.

### Here’s how to deal with the situation:

## Cutoff meetings.

That’s right; you’re already overwhelmed. Let’s not make it worse with meetings.

Meetings only give you a bigger to-do list which creates more stress. Stop, breathe and say no to meetings no matter how urgent the meeting may seem — it never is.

## Use the “Off The Grid” line.

I’ve told everyone I’m off the grid for the next six weeks while I deal with this shit storm of challenges.

Can you come to my event?
Can you look at my pitch deck? 
Can you promote my blog post?

*“Thanks for thinking of me. I’m off the grid until X date but let’s connect when I’m back again.”*

Off the grid is a way to say you’re metaphorically not responding to anything online.

When all your problems become too much, you need to be a bit selfish. You’re no good to anybody when you’re stressed and overwhelmed.

Telling people you’re off the grid until a particular date is an easy way to win back some time without feeling guilty.

We all have our bad days and people will understand if you use this line.

## Turn off instant messenger.

“X opportunity changed my life and it was all thanks to Facebook Messenger/Slack” says nobody ever.
> # Messenger creates more real-time challenges, questions and decisions that you don’t need when you’re problem pile is taller than an Egyptian Pyramid.

One of the best things to do is not respond to instant messages. Why?

* Responses create more conversation

* No one has the right to interrupt you unless you say yes to it

* Instant messages often come from people who are bored. Using up your time stops them from focusing on what they should be doing.

I’m known to be slow at responding to messages and I do it on purpose. The more accessible people think you are, the more inbound traffic you’ll get. This is the last thing you need when you’re experiencing an overwhelming number of challenges.

## Blank space is what you need.

A long list of challenges can be solved. You’ll need time to think about each problem.

Without time to think you won’t be able to solve each issue and that will only compound the problem further. During times of ridiculous problem overload, blank space looks like this:

* 30 minute walks around the neighborhood

* Sitting in the sun

* A date with a spa bath

* Meditation

* Journaling/blogging

## Write like the wind.

Writing down how you’re feeling and all the issues/potential solutions is a game changer.
> # “Having thoughts float around in your head does you no good. You need to sit down and think about each challenge and write these thoughts down”

Somewhere in these written sentences will be the answers you need to break through all the overwhelm and stress.

## You’ll come out the other end better for it.

Right now, with all the stress I’m dealing with, this one idea keeps me going.

At the end of all these challenges, I’m going to be stronger for it. I’ll have new coping mechanisms and I’ll have learned something about myself in the process.

You have the same opportunity. In the middle of a crisis, it often feels like nothing more than extreme stress — sort of like you have a gun to your head.
When you breakthrough and make it to the other side, you have experience and perspective.

# Still Lost on Purpose | 1 Year Later…

## A year after my first post on Medium went viral, I’m still “Lost” and that’s on purpose.

![](1*uqLPBsHTHTyBLqvJBasS8w.jpeg)
> Wisdom begins in wonder. — Socrates

Today is my 41st birthday. Last year, I wrote my first post, [Lost on Purpose](https://medium.com/the-mission/lost-on-purpose-57fe85481671), here on my 40th birthday. It instantly went viral. To date it remains my most read post. Despite being a super long 24 minute read, it’s been seen by over 25,000 people and counting.

Each week, I continue to get people writing me, telling me about the impact that story has had for them. The response from that story inspired me and has led to many of the initiatives I am currently involved in. In particular, it was a major catalyst in launching [1heart Journeys](http://1heartjourneys.com) with my best friend. With 1heart Journeys, we aim to help other leaders and entrepreneurs find more fulfilling and joy filled paths through transformational travel experiences.

While I’ve written other popular posts, nothing has touched the popularity of Lost on Purpose. I’ve learned it is hard to replicate the rawness of baring your soul for the first time. Lost on Purpose was a coming out of sorts for me. Prior to writing it, people knew me almost exclusively as a successful Type A startup entrepreneur who spent much of his adult life talking, walking and living fast in New York.

Writing Lost on Purpose allowed me to begin to speak about the man I felt I truly was. It allowed me to begin to communicate to those around me and to the world that I was on a spiritual journey. I was, and still am, actively exploring new modes of being that don’t look like the linear path that most I knew were on. To many, they might view my new path as being lost.

As a society, we’ve created generic templates that we can use to quickly measure someone’s life by. These templates allow us to make a quick judgement as to whether our life or someone else’s life is successful or not. It allows us to easily compare ourselves to others. It allows us to pick winners and losers. It allows us to define and value ourselves.

The problem is we rarely choose these templates willingly. Somewhere along the way one is chosen for us and we march along for decades trying to “succeed” by a definition we were never fully complicate in creating.

For me, it took nearly 40 years to wake up and really begin to question how I defined success. I had made millions, married a beautiful woman and lived in a beautiful apartment in New York City. But…

I looked around and failed to find the fulfillment I had hoped for.

I looked inward and couldn’t see the man I felt I was destined to become.

I was “Lost”. I knew that I had to throw away the template and rules I was playing by if I was going to find a new path.

I am still “Lost” and plan to remain that way.

I ended Lost on Purpose by stating:
> # I’m still here, in the exact place I am supposed to be. I am joyfully LOST in the vast greatness of the world, and plan to stay that way. I am at peace, connected to the source, with love in my heart. I surrender to all the beauty I am meant to discover and to the pain that will continue to teach me when I veer off my path. I now know my purpose and, for the first time, I understand success.

This past year has had so many beautiful moments. Some of my favorites include:

* Starting [1heart](http://1heart.com) as a collective of conscious companies with my best friend.

* Birthing our first three companies under 1heart, [Guided](http://getguided.co), [Superwell](http://besuperwell.com) and [1heart Journeys](http://1heartjourneys.com).

* Celebrating my parents 45th anniversary in Mexico with my family.

* Attending Love Burn (a regional Burning Man in Miami) and meeting my amazing and loving girlfriend Jeanette there.

* Hosting our first 1heart Journey in Costa Rica and witnessing 25 leaders transform their lives before our eyes.

It has also been one of the most challenging years of my life. There were tests at every corner and constantly I’ve had to remind myself of my commitments and intentions. Despite trying to flush the Type A out of me, I managed to take on more than I ever have. I struggle daily to maintain the balance I seek in all areas of my life.

When we awaken, we feel everything much more intensely, the good and the bad. We are no longer numb, we are no longer pretending. We see what’s at stake and know what’s possible.

I’ve learned a lot that has helped me navigate this new awareness. On my birthday this year I wanted to share the main lessons from a year of articles I’ve posted. Each of these are things that I’m constantly working on. I am writing them here, as much a reminder for myself, as advice to anyone reading it.
> Happiness is a butterfly, which, when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you sit down quietly, may alight upon you. — Nathaniel Hawthorne

**1 | Be the Source** — Looking back over the past year and forty years of life, I can clearly see how the results I’ve achieved directly map to where I’ve allocated my energy and attention. My life has been a direct reflection of my intentions and desires.

On a daily basis, it’s easy to feel powerless and a victim of our circumstances. When you take a broader perspective, the truth becomes far more clear. We are all the author of our own lives. I find myself constantly reminding myself of this daily whenever I find myself feeling overwhelmed and a slave to my circumstances. — [Lost on Purpose](https://medium.com/the-mission/lost-on-purpose-57fe85481671), August 1st, 2017

**2 |Surrender to Life, Don’t Conquer it** — As a “recovering Type A” this is something I constantly get to remind myself of. I write about surrender often as I truly believe it to be essential to living a fulfilled life. We must trust and let go in order to allow the Universe to show us all we are meant to experience.

For most, our nature is to try to control all areas of our lives. We spend most of our lives trying to get our lives to meet our expectations and goals vs. being present to all that currently is. Living in surrender is the only way to truly live in the present and the present is the only place where fulfillment (or anything) actually occurs. — [Why Being a Type A is a Surefire Way to Lose at Life](https://medium.com/the-mission/type-a-to-type-be-dcc65ff9264f), Aug 15, 2017

**3 | Fear is Unfortunately Our Most Dominant Emotion** — You don’t have to look far to see how powerful a role fear has in our lives. The media and our President use it constantly in an attempt to control us. I made the decision to stay in Miami during the hurricane this past year. I choose not to be ruled by fear. My intuition told me that I would be safe staying put and I trusted that.

Despite my increased awareness and intuition, I continually find fear attempting to motivate my decisions. The opposite of fear is love and when I shift the fears I feel to creating more love in the world, it naturally shifts. Most of the separation and sadness we feel is a result of our fears. Only by shifting our fears can we truly be free and connect to ourselves and others. — [No, I didn’t Evacuate, I wrote This Instead](https://medium.com/the-mission/irma-2e954a663044), Sep 11, 2017

**4 | Commit to Growth** — I’ve always been spiritually curious. Learning about personal growth and spirituality have continually peaked my curiosity. I read a lot, studied Kabbalah for five years and dabbled in various other modalities. But, growth doesn’t happen in our minds. It isn’t something we learn academically.

Growth happens when we commit to it. Earlier this year I got my first tattoo. It is of a spiritual symbol (The Divine Mind). I had a necklace with the same symbol on it and was wearing it during an ayahuasca ceremony. I suddenly saw it appear tattooed on my arm. I knew at that moment that I would my first tattoo. It perfectly represented the balance of mind and heart that I sought. By committing permanently to this symbol, I now have a constant reminder of the growth I seek. — [Why Getting a Tattoo at 40 Years Old Was a Good Idea](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-getting-my-1st-tattoo-at-40-years-old-was-a-good-idea-26cf5a8ecbc2), Dec 18, 2017

**5 | What You Put Out Amplifies** — The concept of karma is fairly well known. What often is not realized is that karma is not one to one. Doing one good thing does not trigger one good thing to happen. Our actions are multiplied many times over. Just think about your boss giving you a big compliment at work. That may cause you to compliment your Starbucks barista and maybe buy your wife flowers. Each of their days are then brightened and they pay it forward as well.

I’ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to impact a lot of people over the past year. I’ve also continued to see increased synchronicity everywhere I turn. These are not unrelated events. Rather, when we put out good energy and focus on giving, the Universe attempts to repay us several times over. — [Lessons That Ayahuasca Will Teach You That Harvard Business School Never Will](https://medium.com/the-mission/lessons-ayahuasca-will-teach-you-that-harvard-business-school-never-will-5b08f36ba1b1), Jan 4, 2018.

**6 | You Don’t Know Shit** — I learn and relearn this one the hard way nearly every day. And the more I learn, the more I ultimately realize how little I know. Still, I attempt to scheme, analyze and plan so many areas of my life as if I know what’s best for me.

The Universe has other ideas. My divorce which officially finalized this year is a good reminder of that. I spent nearly 25 years of adulthood trying to find the perfect partner that checked all the boxes. Despite such a deliberate approach, I found myself single once again. Control is an illusion. We aren’t supposed to know the result of every move we make all of the time. If we did, what would be the point of even playing the game? — [The 7 Spiritual Laws of Divorce](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-7-spiritual-laws-of-divorce-6b6e572c8115), Mar 9, 2018.
> Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated. — Confucius

It’s hard to attempt to sum up all the lessons I lived this year. The past year feels like a lifetime of its own. In just the past 365 days I’ve made friends who are among my very best friends in life. I’ve met an amazing woman who I’m honored to call my girlfriend. And, I’ve started several companies with people I truly love and respect.

There have been so many moments this year where I felt extreme gratitude. At so many moments I’ve felt like I was flying, truly living life at the highest level. At so many moments I felt happier than I’ve ever been.

Despite all of this, this year has also contained so many difficult challenges. I’ve felt completely overwhelmed, unable to depend on a clear linear plan. Even though these plans are ultimately illusions, they provided a day to day comfort and clarity that I no longer have.

I’ve had to consistently remember to surrender and trust that life will manifest in far better ways than I can even imagine. I’ve had to continually remember that my mind doesn’t have the answers and that the fear it concocts is not real. I’ve learned to trust my intuition, my heart and ultimately myself more.

It’s been quite a year and I’m proud to still be as Lost as ever. Only by being lost can we truly search and explore. There are many moments I’ve begged for a sherpa, map, or a tiny flashlight. Even in the darkest days, we have all that we need, we are walking the path we are meant to, we just need to keep on going. We are always exactly where we are supposed to be.

# The Six Most Important Business Lessons From All of History

## The Six Most Important Business Lessons From All of History

A few years ago, I decided to explore the outer limits of information overload. I decided to read the Encyclopedia Britannica from cover to cover.

There were several reasons for this: First, my dad read the encyclopedia when I was a kid. Second, I love the notion of climbing mountains, but hate cold weather and lack of oxygen, so I figured this could serve as my intellectual Mount Everest. And third, it was my job. I had landed a contract to write a book about my quest. (The book is called [The Know-It-All](http://www.amazon.com/Know-All-Humble-Smartest-ebook/dp/B000FC2LUA/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=)).

It was a strange and fascinating 18-month experience. Yes, painful at times, especially for those around me (my wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact). Yes, I’ve forgotten most of what I read.

But still, I loved my 33,000-page experiment in extreme learning. Here I present some of my favorite business lessons from all of history:

## **1) Engage in Strategic Chutzpah**

Barely any of the historical figures I read about got their big break while staying at home in their drawing rooms. They were bold. They got out. One of my favorite networking stories involves the poet Langston Hughes when he was a busboy at a hotel in Washington D.C. While in the dining room, he slipped three of his poems beside the dinner plate of established poet Vachel Lindsay. The next day, newspapers announced Lindsay had discovered a busboy poet. Hughes refused to let his dreams be deferred. In other words, he was ballsy. He engaged in strategic chutzpah (a phrase I will write about in more depth in a future column).

## **2) Take Ideas from Far Outside Your Field**

For much of his life, Isaac Newton was a respected scientist with the then-traditional mechanistic view: the universe worked much like billiard balls colliding.

But in the 1670s, he became obsessed with occult books about alchemy and magic. He read about substances having mysterious sympathies and antipathies towards one another, forces that could affect something even without touching it.

His fellow scientists were likely concerned about his sanity. But these occult books allowed Newton to take an intellectual leap. This was his real apple. The idea of magical forces inspired him to envision forces of attraction that worked at a distance. It was a breakthrough that led to his theory of universal gravity.

Bill Gates famously takes a reading vacation where he devours books on wildly different topics to see what ideas percolate. Be bold. Be like Gates and Newton: Read far outside your field.

## **3) Keep Presentations Short**

Consider the Gettysburg Address. Despite being president of the United States, Lincoln wasn’t the featured speaker that day. The big attraction was a two-hour speech by Edward Everett, a former Massachusetts congressman and president of Harvard, who was considered the greatest orator of his time.

Poor Everett. He probably spent weeks working on his speech, tweaking it, trying it out on his wife. On the big day, he went up to the podium, gesticulated and exhorted for two straight hours, mopping his brow, finishing with a big rhetorical flourish. Then Lincoln goes up to the podium. Two minutes later, Lincoln steps down and Everett is a historical footnote, some guy who yammered on before the Gettysburg Address.

Two hours versus two minutes.

I’m a huge fan of in-depth analysis, but I find it works better in books or conversations. For live presentations, I prefer the TED-approved 20 minutes or less.

## **4) Embrace Rejection**

Well, if not embrace it, at least expect it. History is overflowing with lifelong rejectees who persevered until they got that single yes. To give just one example: Chester Carlson, the inventor of the Xerox machine, was turned down by more than 20 companies before he finally sold his idea.

## **5) Being First Is Overrated**

This is a lesson I don’t like. I value originality, perhaps fetishize it. But the truth is, you don’t always have to be first. You just have to be better.

Perhaps you think, as I did, that Hydrox was a lame ripoff of Oreos. Actually, Hydrox debuted in 1908 (it’s named for Hydrogen and Oxygen). In 1912, the National Biscuit Company tried their own version. It was sweeter (never underestimate Americans love of sugar). As you know, Hydrox became the MySpace and Oreo turned into the Facebook.

## **6) Adapt or Die**

The word “pivot” may be trendy, but companies have been pivoting for centuries. Thomas Welch was a 19th-century minister who avidly opposed alcohol. In the 1860s, he created a pasteurized grape juice and called it “Dr. Welch’s Unfermented Wine.” He wanted churches to use it in communion. It flopped.

A few years later, Welch’s son took over and abandoned the fake wine idea. He instead marketed the juice as, well, juice. A tasty and refreshing treat. And that is why, today, my sons love their juice boxes, despite their father’s insistence that it’s basically tooth-rotting sugar water.

The Britannica itself has had to adapt. In 2012, they stopped printing those lovely leatherish volumes and went fully online. They’ve been eclipsed by Wikipedia in terms of page views. But I hope they’ll have the tenacity of Chester Carlson and hang in there.

# 5 Myths About Exposure I Learned By Writing 400+ Columns For Inc. Magazine

## Nicolas Cole Instagram

I have written over 400 columns for *Inc Magazine*.

Before I landed my own column, [I was a Top Writer on Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nicolas-Cole-1) with several million views on my work (this was back in 2015). My “claim to fame” was the fact that I had reached Top Writer status in less than 9 months of writing on the platform, had over a dozen of my articles go viral (100,000 to 1,000,000+ views each), and had been republished by just about every major publication on the Internet: *TIME, Forbes, Fortune, Business Insider, Slate, Observer, Thought Catalog, Hacker Noon, Medical Daily, The Chicago Tribune*, and *Inc Magazine* — to name a few.

During the second half of 2015, there was a 6-month period during wherein *Inc Magazine* was republishing one of my Quora answers **every single week**.

I had found my stride as a writer focused on personal development — and *Inc*took notice.

## When I was offered my own column with Inc. Magazine, I turned the afterburners on and doubled my output.

I was already writing an Answer per day on Quora (which I deliberately structured as a full article). But instead of replacing Quora with *Inc*, I worked the night shift writing a column per day there as well.

1 month later, I was one of *Inc Magazine*’s most popular writers (and one of their only paid writers). And in 2017, I was named one of their Top 30 columnists for the entire publication.

## There are very few columnists that write as much as I do.

Most people don’t believe me when I say I [write close to 10,000 words per day](https://artplusmarketing.com/how-i-write-10-000-words-per-day-every-day-818421c980f0)([while running a company](https://www.digitalpress.com/)).

To me, writing is a sport as much as it is a form of art. I view the craft the same way I viewed hockey as a teenager, eagerly chasing the dream of one day making it to the NHL. I do not subscribe to the mantra that *one writes when one is inspired*. I think that’s a cop out. If one is truly a writer, they write regardless of whether they feel like writing or not — because writing, just like everything else in life, requires practice in order to master.

### When I became a columnist for Inc Magazine, I saw it as a venue for me to express my thoughts and opinions with the world.

What I found instead was a world of press pitches and marketers that wanted what I had — a column.

Within days of my being listed on the site, my inbox started to flood with pitches from PR companies. And aside from the fact that half of them couldn’t even spell my name correctly (there is no “h” in Nicolas), I had no interest in writing about the “revolutionary [technology](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/technology)” some up-and-coming company claimed they had.

## What separates me from a lot of other people in the business world is that I am not a marketer.

I am a writer.

I know what people want to read because I *write*. I know what works because I publish and iterate, publish and iterate. I know what resonates because I work hard to share who I am as a person, human to human, through my writing.And I know how to get exposure because I take the time to learn what it is people want to read — and why.

So, as someone who has written thousands of articles on the Internet, I want to pull back the curtain and debunk some myths about getting exposure onto your written content.

## 1. Writing for (or being featured in) a major publication does not mean “millions of views.”

Not a single day goes by where I don’t hear someone make the Hail Mary statement that if only their company could be mentioned by a major publication — then they’d get the exposure they’re looking for.

People love data, so let me give you some data.

### Of the 409 columns I’ve written for Inc Magazine, only 44 of them exceeded 10,000 views in 2017.

* 28 of them were 10,000 to 19,000 views.

* 5 were 20,000 to 29,000 views.

* 4 were 30,000 to 39,000 views.

* 2 were 40,000 to 49,000 views.

* 2 were 50,000 to 59,000 views.

* 1 was 90,017 views.

* 1 was 128,041 views.

* And 1 was 133,000 views.

Out of my top 10 performing columns, **9 had to do with personal development.**

The 1 that had to do with a company was about Facebook.

You’re not Facebook.

## 2. Social content is still king.

Side by side, my *Inc Magazine* column has **never once** out performed my viewership on Quora or Medium.

Big publications are idolized because people assume that “70 million unique monthly readers” means that every single piece of content receives 70 million views.
> # That’s like saying in a city of 70 million people, everybody knows everybody.

What most people don’t know is that while the entire site might yield tens of millions of views, the site is also publishing thousands of articles per month (hundreds every day).

On my best month writing for Inc Magazine, I cracked 300,000 views. I wrote 30 columns that month.

In comparison, 300,000 views is considered a weak month for me on Quora and Medium — where I consistently average closer to ~400,000+ views month over month. And when I was writing original content every single day on Quora, I averaged over a million views per month for a year straight.

If you’re publishing content on your company blog (or worse, a single byline in a major publication) and expecting millions of views to appear overnight, you’re in for a rude awakening.

The single best place to write on the Internet right now is Quora and Medium.

## 3. People do not read articles that pamper a company.

They just don’t.

Unless I was talking about Facebook or Amazon or Tesla in the news, all of my most popular articles have been devoid of a company mention.

All.

Reason being, nobody reads an entire piece talking about how great someone is, how “game-changing” their unique (*it’s not unique*) approach to their industry is and thinks, “Wow, I have to share this with all of my friends!”

I know what people want to read, and I know because I have written and tested and iterated and learned and refined and delivered. I know what it takes to write a viral article because **I frequently write viral articles**. 99.99999% of marketers and PR companies cannot say the same — and yet, every single day, another business gets sold on the pipe dream that *a single mention* from a columnist on a popular site will drive significant ROI for their business.

The average column on a major publication barely receives 1,000 views.

Let me say that again:
> # The average column on a major publication barely receives 1,000 views.

### The ones that “go viral” only fall into three categories:

* They mention an insanely successful company (Apple).

* They talk about a controversial and trending topic.

* They are focused around personal development/life advice.

And in the off-chance your company gets a soft mention in a viral articles (*“According to company, 49% of Millennials actually hate their jobs…”), *that’s the one part of the article nobody is paying any attention to.

## 4. Building consistent exposure online requires 2 things nobody wants to do.

* Be patient.

* Be consistent.

There is no other way around it.

You can’t buy a real audience. You can’t cheat a real audience. And you certainly shouldn’t expect a real audience after your company writes 3 blog posts.

It astounds me how many PR companies and [marketing](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/marketing) agencies promise eons of exposure, when they can’t even get exposure for themselves. I don’t know about you, but I would have a hard time getting my hair cut by a bald barber.

As someone who has racked up 50,000,000+ views on my written content, who has gone viral dozens of times, and who has had work published in just about every major publication on the Internet, ***I am telling you from first-hand experience that nobody wakes up to that overnight***.

The rewards I have seen for myself as a writer and for my business were not paid for (I’ve never spent a dollar on PR or advertising). They were *earned*.

And that’s not to say you can’t earn it too. Because you can.

Just don’t expect it to happen overnight.

## 5. If you truly want to be a thought leader, you have to be willing to say what nobody else wants to say.

Read enough leadership articles, and there is only 1 thing that separates the stuff worth reading from all the rest.

Vulnerability.

There are thousands upon thousands of companies in the world. Thousands upon thousands of founders and CEOs. Thousands of writers, thousands of “industry experts,” thousands of everybody, everywhere. So, what does the Internet sound like when they all say, at the exact same time, “Being an effective leader is all about open communication.”

Noisy. The Internet sounds very, very noisy.

A thought leader isn’t the person on the front of the magazine, or the lucky name drawn out of a hat and quoted in a column. A thought leader isn’t the person with the biggest ad spend, or necessarily even the one with the keynote speech.

Those are all just stages to stand upon.

### What makes someone a thought leader is what they say — not where they say it.

Again, speaking from my own experiences here, I would like to share a few of my most popular articles on the Internet:

**2M+ views:** [*7 crucial lessons people often learn too late in life.](http://www.businessinsider.com/7-crucial-lessons-people-often-learn-too-late-in-life-2017-5) (This piece has been reposted on Business Insider 3 times now. The first time it racked up 1.5M views. The second, 200,000+ views. And now ~100,000 for the 3rd time.)*

**1M+ views: [***Is it possible to change yourself so much that you no longer recognize yourself?](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-change-yourself-and-not-recognize-yourself-I-am-21-years-old-Everybody-tells-me-that-I-have-changed-so-much-My-friends-welcome-it-but-my-parents-do-not-agree-with-it-I-want-to-leave-college-and/answer/Nicolas-Cole-1)*

**412,000+ views: [***Why having everything you want won’t make you happy.](https://www.quora.com/I-have-everything-I-thought-I-wanted-and-Im-still-not-happy-Why/answer/Nicolas-Cole-1)*

There are lots more, but they all follow a similar theme.

### Every single one of my most popular articles plays at what I like to call “The Golden Intersection.”

* I am answering the reader’s question — providing them value.

* I am telling them a story, my unique and personal story, which helps them relate to me as the author.

That’s it.

What makes a great piece of written content online requires a conflict. The reader wants to know the journey you’re about to take them on. What was the challenge? What were you afraid of? What was holding you back? And how did you overcome that challenge and make your way safely to the other side?

Again, most people (in any industry) don’t want to do this. And the reason is because they think they can achieve the same result (“Look how impressive I am”) without having to reveal the vulnerable part.

But the irony is the more open and honest you are, the more people will relate to you, hear you, and ultimately share your message with others. But trying to prop yourself up behind this facade that you have it all together, you’ve *always*had it all together, and you’ve never once sat in front of an obstacle and thought, “Shit, I have no idea how I’m going to overcome this,” is a lie — to yourself, and to your readers.

Anyone can write something thoughtful, meaningful, and exposure-worthy on the Internet. Literally anyone.

In order to do that, however, you have to be willing to put your audience before yourself.

Some people call that “effective marketing.”

I call it Writing.

# Why The Greatest Mistake Is To Believe We Are Powerless And Without A Choice

## “man wearing green crew-neck t-shirt looking upwards” by Jakob Owens on Unsplash

## **Cultivate Our Power Through Informed Choices**
> # *“When you do nothing you feel overwhelmed and powerless. But when you get involved you feel the sense of hope and accomplishment that comes from knowing you are working to make things better.”* — Maya Angelou

Do you believe you have the power to influence your life? Or do you consider yourself dragged along by life’s forces? This is an important question because your beliefs will dictate how your life plays out. For instance, I was talking with a friend recently who mentioned how they’ve never made a conscious choice about the direction of their life. They were merely showing up every day hoping life plays out in their favour. What struck me about the conversation is that many people are convinced they are powerless to create their life circumstances, preferring to leave it to chance. That is, they have not learned how to consciously create ideal conditions for their life. Similarly, many consider life is separate to them and that irrespective of their choices, things don’t always work out as planned. I find this interesting because it highlights the power of our beliefs.

Our greatest mistake is to believe we are powerless and without choices. This may be attributed to the thought that life happens to us, instead of expressing itself through us. This is the message espoused by the transformational thinker and philosopher Alex Pattakos who writes in *Prisoners of Our Thoughts: Viktor Frankl’s Principles for Discovering Meaning in Life and Work*: “By viewing ourselves as relatively powerless and driven by instinct, the possibility that we can create, or at least co-create, our own reality becomes difficult to grasp. Instead, we often lock ourselves inside our own mental prisons. We lose sight of our own natural potential and that of others. In essence, we become prisoners of our thoughts.” Granted, in some respects we may be powerless and with little control over aspects of our lives such as our birth and death. Putting that aside, there’s a great deal we have control over and it is incumbent on us to cultivate this power through informed choices.

How do you feel about this? Do you believe your choices decide your future? Or are you inclined to believe that you never get what you wish for and there’s no use trying? Our beliefs create the canvas of our life because they influence our actions and whether we create life on our terms. Despite this, life is not a game of poker where we roll the dice and hope for the best. Sure, sometimes we have no control over our destiny such as the death of an individual through illness or tragic circumstances. For the large part and barring unforeseen events, we are never as powerless as we think. These are thoughts we have given life to and found evidence to support. But what if we challenge our beliefs and create new ways to perceive them? What if we upgraded our model of reality to coincide with the life we want to live?

## **Contemplate Our True Desires**
> # *“The deep root of failure in our lives is to think, ‘Oh how useless and powerless I am.’ It is essential to think strongly and forcefully, ‘I can do it,’ without boasting or fretting.”* — Dalai Lama

One of my favourite past times is engaging in daydreaming. I daydream often and conjure up the most elaborate circumstances related to areas of my life. The power of daydreaming allows us to test the waters of our thoughts before they become a reality. Daydreaming is a whiteboard for the mind where we get to create anything we want to before it comes to life. Is this something you’ve tried before? Using your mind’s faculty to shape your future is one way to reclaim your power because it allows you to fine tune the image in your mind before it shows up in your reality. It is the alternative medicine advocate Deepak Chopra who once said: “Daydream, imagine, and reflect. It’s the source of infinite creativity.” Daydreaming allows us to compose our future in innumerable dimensions. It is a wonderful process that engages our emotions and draws on physiological responses in the body to what is held in the mind. Therefore, our body gives us clues on the truthfulness of our daydreams and whether they are something worth pursuing.

Even if you don’t daydream, to believe you are powerless and without choices is an error in thinking and something that must be attended to. If we are not living the life we envisaged, it may be related to self-doubt which is within our power to change. Let’s be real, not all of our choices will work out as we plan and that’s okay. Failure and setbacks may be life’s way of giving us signs whether our endeavours are aligned with our greater good. If we want to make optimal choices, it pays that we spend time quietly to contemplate our true desires. Life passes us by at the drop of a hat and if we are constantly reacting to outside events, we miss out on the vital clues pointing us to the life we dare to live. So make it your obligation to devote time to yourself and get to know your true desires and why they are important to you. Only then will you create a life you are destined to live.

# The Ultimate Guide to Income Share Agreements

## 
> “ISAs assure a manageable payback amount, never more than the agreed portion of their incomes. Although every provider is different, terms tend to range from 5 percent to 10 percent of income for 10 to 15 years, or somewhat higher (10 percent to 15 percent for shorter contracts such as five to seven years). Best of all, they shift the risk of career shortcomings from student to investor: If the graduate earns less than expected, it is the investors who are disappointed; if the student decides to go off to find himself in Nepal instead of working, the loss is entirely on the funding providers, who will presumably price that risk accordingly when offering their terms. This is true ‘debt-free’ college.” –Mitch Daniels, President of Purdue University, commenting on implementing their ISA program

Welcome to… *The Ultimate Guide to Income Share Agreements*!

Here is what you’ll get in this exclusive 3-part guide:

1. A Lightning Quick Overview of What Income Share Agreements are and How they Work

1. The Present State of ISAs and How Innovative Universities are Using Them

3. The Future of Higher Education and ISAs

In this guide, we’ll show how we can use and improve income share agreements to reduce and help solve the student debt challenge. We’ll also show how ISAs can help universities create outcomes based accountability systems that align incentives between a school and a student.

The name might sound like a snooze, but income share agreements are actually a revolutionary type of financial arrangement that are altering the future of higher education.

## A Lightning Quick Overview of What Income Share Agreements are and How they Work

ISAs are helping universities save money, preparing their students for the future of work, and most importantly, helping their students avoid unnecessary debt burdens.

Here is how income share agreements currently work for universities and their students:

The university agrees to provide an upfront payment to cover a portion (or all!) of a student’s tuition.

In exchange, when the student graduates and is able to find a job past a certain minimum income threshold, the student begins making a certain number of payments until they are finished. These payments are a small fraction of their salary. Once the student has completed the payments, they keep 100% of their salary.

Income share agreements provided less risk of students defaulting on their loans because they aren’t forced to pay a certain dollar amount every month — the typical arrangement in a traditional loan.

ISAs can help increase economic opportunity and educational access for students who might lack a creditworthy co-signer, which all too often locks out individuals from our higher education system. In effect, ISAs help democratize access to education in a way that our current post-secondary education finance system doesn’t.

To bring you and your team this guide for free, The Mission team partnered with one of the most innovative education technology companies in the world, [Vemo Education](http://bit.ly/2qOi3gu).

![](0*1uua2O6SEXPJhfOl)

Please feel free to print this guide out, share, and re-distribute it however you’d like.

## The Present State of ISAs and How They Can Help Universities

![](0*RxvNZQ4Pr_jJm99C)

Currently, there are many experts who have been studying, implementing, and leveraging technology to create new kinds of ISA programs.

Here are five of the best recent takeaways from experts in the ISA field:

“We found that the demand for ISAs is out there… The demand for an alternative to loans exists, so it stands to reason that if colleges start implementing these types of programs, they will be utilized…” — Jason Delisle, Author of [*Student and Parent Perspectives on Higher Education Financing](http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Student-and-Parent-Perspectives-on-Higher-Education-Financing.pdf)*

“The Messiah College community is committed to preparing students for lives of service and leadership. Because income share agreements adjust the amount of payment depending on income, our new ISA program will increase access and affordability for both current and prospective students, and enable our graduates to pursue their chosen career path without the anxiety that so often accompanies student loan debt.” –Dr. Kim S. Phipps, Ph.D and President of Messiah College

“Our [ISA program] provides a financial and intellectual return. These students enrich classroom discussion…” –Anthony Collins, President of Clarkson University

“Income share agreements provide an opportunity to align our interests with those of our students, which fits perfectly with our mission to ease the burden of college costs.” –Mark Volk, President of Lackawanna College

“It is a very interesting alternative because it is predicated on expected future income of students and their success. It doesn’t look at the asset value, wealth, income level, or the student or his parents. It is truly based on expected outcomes.” –Tonio DeSorrento, CEO of Vemo Education

So what’s next?

## The Future of Higher Education and ISAs

![[Unsplash](http://unsplash.com)](0*P8xJNYOy91UcAmbR)*[Unsplash](http://unsplash.com)*
> “It’s inevitable at some point there will be a cap on student loan guarantees. And when that happens you’re going to see a repeat of what we saw in the housing market: when easy credit for buying or flipping a house disappeared we saw a collapse in the price housing, and we’re going to see that same collapse in the price of student tuition, and that’s going to lead to colleges going out of business.” –Mark Cuban

In America, there is currently a student debt load approaching $1.5 trillion, and college costs are only getting higher. Students frequently default on their student debt, which not only means that the students are left with poor credit and an iffy financial history at a young age, but lenders and taxpayers are left on the hook for the funds.

We need better solutions that leverage technologies, and ISAs are one way universities can create incentives that give students more options.

The good thing is, there are universities that are pioneering, and already implementing, the ISA model.

The even better thing is that entrepreneurs like the team at [Vemo Education ](http://bit.ly/2qOi3gu)have built a technology company that makes creating, implementing, and running ISA programs easy for universities.

A range of schools are utilizing Vemo Education and ISAs, from flagship public like Purdue to private nonprofit aligned with their regional labor market, like Lackawanna College in Scranton.

Other colleges and universities that are adopting Vemo Education’s new model for ISAs include Messiah College, Point Loma Nazarene University, and Clarkson University.

At The Mission, we believe that companies like Vemo Education, who are creating technology to perfect the ISA model, are critical to democratizing higher education and creating the right incentives for both universities and students to succeed.

ISAs don’t solve all the problems with student loan debt. But a $1.5 trillion debt load is an unsustainable number, and yet, somehow, the debt keeps growing.

Income Share Agreements aren’t a catch all, but they might be one important part of helping to ensure that higher education is attainable for anyone that has the heart and drive to pursue it.

# Your Big Break Is Never Coming (Do This Instead)

## Your Big Break Is Never Coming (Do This Instead)

Most of us are waiting for our [Big Break](https://medium.com/@jeffgoins/stop-waiting-for-your-big-break-6c66ef69bbd2). And that’s the worst way to succeed. Let’s look at one of [history’s most successful artists](https://goinswriter.com/die/) to see why — and what we should do instead.

When a young Michelangelo Buonarroti approached Domenico Ghirlandaio, the famous Florentine artist, he must have had a lump in his throat.

The boy was barely a teenager and about to ask one of Florence’s most fashionable painters to train him. What’s more, his father Lodavico was pressuring him into being the family’s sole breadwinner, which did not jibe with his own ambitions of becoming a sculptor.

In a monumental moment for both men, the aspiring artist met his elder with what must have been a combination of both fear and respect. Many young Florentines would have been honored to even meet the man, but the boy wanted more.

As the story goes, Michelangelo not only asked for an apprenticeship but had the audacity to request compensation.

This was outrageous. In the Renaissance, apprentices did not get paid. If anything, they *paid *their way through their education. Anyone in Ghirlandaio’s studio witnessing the event would have stared at the boy’s request with abject horror.

Whatever the master must have felt — at first outrage and maybe then amusement — he surprised everyone, maybe even Michelangelo, by accepting the offer. The boy got to work and quickly learned to paint under the tutelage of his new master.

It was about a year or two later that Michelangelo left the studio of Ghirlandaio to continue his apprenticeship in the Medici palace at the personal request of Lorenzo de Medici, one of the wealthiest art patrons at the time.

And thus, a star was born.

### **Don’t Wait for Your Big Break**

Stories like this often get dismissed as happy coincidences. Serendipity. We tend to think of what happened to Michelangelo as a “Big Break,” that wonderful moment when someone discovers your talent and makes all your dreams come true.

Many of us wait for such a moment, and when it doesn’t come we assume it was never meant to be. And everything about that assumption is wrong.

As Walter Matthau once said to a young actor who had recently moved to Hollywood and was waiting for his Big Break: “Kid, it’s not the one big break. It’s the fifty big breaks.”
> # It’s not the one big break that counts. It’s the fifty breaks.

As I wrote in [*Real Artists Don’t Starve](http://dontstarve.com)*, the Big Break is a myth. Something we tell themselves out of laziness and fear of the work ahead. If Big Breaks do happen, we’d be better off not counting on them and focusing on what we *can* control — the work.

So what should we do if not wait for our Big Break? We should do what Michelangelo did. We should practice, and we should prepare.

### **Practice When No One’s Watching**

Long before entering Ghirlandaio’s studio, Michelangelo was practicing. He was not waiting for his Big Break; he was doing the work. Before he was an actual apprentice, he was acting like an apprentice.

That meant learning from whomever he could from. He knew he wanted to be an artist and that he could not become great on his own, no matter how talented he might be. No amount of natural ability can compete with diligent practice. So the boy used the opportunities that were available to him.

Michelangelo had cousins who worked in a nearby quarry every day. In fact, he was raised by this family for a short time in his youth. This allowed him the chance to familiarize himself with stone, a skill that would be invaluable to him later in life as a sculptor.

He adopted the attitude of a student, learning from anyone who could teach him. So when an opportunity came, he would be ready.

That’s what being an apprentice is all about: not just making big asks but taking the work seriously from the beginning. What will make you stand out from the crowd is not just the audacity to ask but the humility to learn.
> # What will make you stand out from the crowd is not just the audacity to ask but the humility to learn.

All that practice paid off, because in no time, Michelangelo began to stand out amongst his peers. Soon, he was being recommended by Ghirlandaio to study under Bertoldo di Giovanni, an Italian sculptor who had studied under the great Donatello.

That simple move to the palace changed the young artist’s fate forever. But it never would have happened had he not been practicing the whole time.

If you wait for your Big Break, when it comes, you will squander it. We can’t control when or how these moments come; but we can be ready for them — first by practicing, then by making the most of them.

### **Prepare for Lucky Moments**

So if Big Breaks don’t exist, does this mean we should rule out the role of luck in success? Of course not.

We all get lucky at some point, sometimes without realizing it until after the fact. But luck is a fickle friend. As soon as you find her, Lady Luck will leave you when you need her the most.
> # Luck is a fickle friend and unfaithful mistress. As soon as you find her, Lady Luck will leave you when you need her the most.

You can’t count on luck. What you can do, however, is prepare for the likelihood that good fortune will visit you at some point.

In his book *Great by Choice*, author Jim Collins compares the performance of enduringly great companies to average companies. Collins demonstrates that the more successful companies had about the same amount of “luck” (defined as unlikely but fortunate events) as less successful companies.

What separated the successes from the failures was the fact that the successful companies got a “return on their luck” and the unsuccessful ones did not. In other words, they did something with the opportunity they had.

Opportunities come — either by putting ourselves in the right place at the right time or simply by sticking around long enough. But good opportunities lead to great work when we make the most of them.

When Lorenzo asked Ghirlandaio what two apprentices he should bring into the palace, the painter recommended two artists: Michelangelo and a friend. But history only remembers one — the one who used his opportunity and leveraged it for a lifetime of creative success.

In the palace, Michelangelo was educated alongside the Medici children who would eventually become popes and princes and wealth art patrons. He befriended them, and apparently the friendship paid off.

After leaving the palace, Michelangelo began earning ten times what other artists of his era were making. He would go on to become the wealthiest artist of his time, earning a fortune worth nearly $50 million today.

This doesn’t mean you can plan or orchestrate these moments. You can’t. But if you work hard and understand that luck comes to us all, you can be ready to get a return on your luck.

### **Lastly, Be Patient**

Few things in life come easy. And if they do, they rarely stay. So plan for the work, not the break. Because you can control that. Just be prepared to be invisible for a while.

Because nobody notices you when you’re getting up at five a.m. for an entire year to write on a blog no one reads.

Nobody cares about you when you’re doing free gigs in dive bars seven days a week just for the exposure.

And nobody sees you pulling all nighters just to get the website working.

Except of course, when they do. When the hard work pays off and people tell you how you just “came out of nowhere.” But by then, it’s too late. The myth is already born.

Now, you have thousands of fans, and people tell you that, kid, you’re a natural. And of course, you agree with them, because it feels good.
> # Be prepared to be invisible for a while.

But you did not come out of nowhere. You came from the same place they did. You just didn’t stay there. You didn’t take a leap. You built a bridge. You put yourself in the right place at the right time and did the work.

You didn’t wait for luck. You looked for it. You practiced and prepared for those opportunities. And when the time was right, you were ready to make the most of whatever chance you got.

Of course, that took time. Maybe it’s still taking time. For now, you are patient, focusing on what you can control. It’s a slog, but a beautiful one and in the end will be worth it.

### **Good Things Come to Those Who Work**

So now you know. There are no Big Breaks, only tiny drips of effort that lead to waves of momentum. The harder things are, the longer they last, and the more you appreciate them.

We can’t wait for luck. But we can prepare for it, understanding that there will be many lucky — and unlucky — breaks throughout our lives. But it’s not luck that leads to success. It’s perseverance.
> # It’s not luck that leads to success. It’s perseverance.

The choice, then, is up to you. Finding your fifty breaks will not be easy or quick, but if you persevere, it will happen.

Your job is to show up and do your work consistently and well enough that it’s worth noticing. Practice, prepare, and be patient.

Good things grow over time with care and intention. Don’t wait for your Big Break. Recognize the one you already have. And make the most of it.

The world is waiting (but you shouldn’t be).

# How To Dramatically Improve Your Life In 2 Years.

## Image Credit: T.I. (Clifford Joseph)

You’re unlikely to change your life dramatically in a short space of time. Two years is a good number. It allows you enough time to experiment, execute and see the results.

In the last two years I’ve gone from not being able to do the following: speak publicly in front of a live audience, gain proper control of my health, control my anger, forgive people who did the wrong thing, find work I love and meet a girl who I could fall in love with.

Two years on, I’ve crushed each of these life goals. I feel like I haven’t just improved my life but that I’ve transformed it.

### Here’s how you can do the same and improve your life:

## Do one crazy thing.

The crazy thing I did was write down my fears and commit to knocking off at least one of them. The first one I went for was public speaking.

I began practicing in front of small crowds. Last week I spoke in front of eighty of the most senior managers in the company I work for and crushed it.
> Tackling one fear became addictive and I ended up knocking over the whole list. The most difficult one was ending a more than ten-year family feud, so I could finally experience peace in my life again.

We all have one crazy thing that we’ve dreamed about and never taken action on. Dare to dream a little.

![Image Credit: [Telmo Miel](https://www.instagram.com/telmomiel/?hl=en)](1*Hl30GI9dEinbC21jMF-GgA.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Telmo Miel](https://www.instagram.com/telmomiel/?hl=en)*

Find that one crazy thing and take one action towards overcoming the barriers that have stopped you in the past. Don’t let those excuses stop you anymore.

You need one event to trigger that transformation and then for the next two years you’ll have the momentum to get started on the rest of the suggestions I’m going to make below.

## Prevent yourself from overthinking.

This guy sent me a note on LinkedIn. He had a dream of becoming a writer and he hadn’t executed for more than five years.

He sent me an article he wanted to post and asked if I could proofread it, provide feedback and then give him permission to publish it.

I was brutal with my response because I wanted him to win.

I told him *“Stop overthinking and forget about asking for my permission.”*

He ended up publishing his first article and not overthinking any longer. Before long, he’d published more articles in a few weeks, than he’d ever published in his entire life.

He’s well on his way to improving his life and doing what he loves because he stopped overthinking.

### Many of you reading this article have the same sort of goals and have also been held back because of the following reasons:

1. You’re waiting for permission
2. You’re seeking perfection
3. You’re waiting for the right moment
4. You’re too busy with planning instead of executing

Screw all these excuses and just hit publish. Or just go for your goal. Or just make the investment. Or just attend the event.

Whatever your goal is, don’t allow yourself to think about it any longer.

Improving your life starts with executing — not thinking for years about it.

## Look for quick wins.

The art of improving your life comes down a lot to how you feel. When you feel like your life is improving, you find this inner motivation that comes out of nowhere.

**The way to get this boost in energy and thinking is to find some quick wins.**

During my two-year journey, I threw out more than 50% of my belongings. It didn’t take me long to do, but it provided a tremendous quick win that I could build from.

Think carefully about one quick win you could execute on and then start taking one action daily towards achieving it. The smallest thing like making your bed every day will start you on a path of improving your life.

## Consume less. Invest in yourself.

I mentioned before about getting rid of half my possessions. What I didn’t tell you is that I collected more than $20k from the sale of these useless items.

I then invested that money back into improving my life. I attended a couple of seminars; I put some of the money into a European holiday; I used some of the money to help others.

Many of you are consuming and buying things you don’t need. This leaves very little resources left to invest in yourself and your ability to grow and evolve.
> # “Change your spending habits from consuming products and over to investing in the growth of your goals. For you to improve, you must invest”

## Find a way to share your thoughts.

Whatever your goal is in life, improving your life is best done by sharing your thoughts. I’ve chosen online channels to do this.

![](1*Sommd4q_HLwFSX0JqqB_6g.jpeg)

Over the last two years, I’ve shared my ideas and strategies with the world through Medium, Quora and LinkedIn.

By sharing my thoughts, people who think in a similar way have been attracted into my life. This has led me to consult for many companies that I previously could only have dreamt of working with.

Finding people like you who want the same things as you, and who you can collaborate with, first starts with sharing your thoughts.

The sharing of your thoughts is like a magnet that pulls in everything you’ve always needed and wanted in your life — the people, the ideas, the resources, the opportunities.

## Build a diversified foundation of income.

For me, that looks like paid blogging, affiliate income, paid speaking gigs, consulting, a broad range of investments that compound year on year and 1 on 1 coaching.

Money is not the key to everything like many people think, but it will make the dramatic improvement your seeking even bigger.

### Having diversified income means the following:

* The risk of you losing your full-time job is much less painful

* You’ll have money to invest in education and personal growth

* When the next recession comes, you’ll be prepared

* The ability for you to change directions in your career becomes easier

* Diversified income usually leads to passive income (making money while you sleep)

Passive income is my favorite. Going back a few years now, I invested heavily into reading more than twenty books on investing.

I implemented the strategies and now I make some of my income while I sleep. Passive income requires a bit of effort up front, but it’s worth the time.

## Read some life-changing books.

None of my two-year change would have been possible if I didn’t fill my big head with new ideas. My previous thinking about the concept of success was flawed.
> # “My previous vision for success focused heavily on taking from the world rather than giving back”

Below are four books I read that led to the dramatic change in my life:

## Become really good at saying no.

A dramatic change in your life requires empty space to think and reflect. You’ll never get this time unless you get really good at saying no.

The more success you have in life, the more inbound requests you’ll get for your time. People will often want you to support their goals rather than offering you opportunities to support your goals.
> **Normally the first feeling you have when someone asks for your time is the correct one. Learn how to say no and always do so respectfully.**

## Do the right thing no matter what.

Incredible honesty and transparency in everything I’ve done over the last two years has helped me build up a team of allies who’ve taken my life much further than I could have ever expected — especially in the space of two years.

Doing the right thing will often mean that you could lose out in the short-term. That’s perfectly okay.

I’m aiming to set you up for long-term success and that means that how you act needs to be ethical.
> # “Dishonest people are quickly forgotten when there’s an incredible opportunity that is available”

By being overly transparent in business, I was able to build a list of customers who provided me with all the referrals I ever needed to grow my business.

I didn’t have to spend money on paid ads, PR or lead generation. Doing the right thing is always the right thing.

## Stop saying yes to dumb stuff.

* Gambling with your money

* Get rich quick schemes

* Material possessions you don’t need

* Requests of your time that you regret shortly after

## Final thought.

Dramatically improving your life is possible when you commit to being disciplined, go outside of what feels comfortable and serve people other than yourself.

Personal transformation is how you build momentum for everything in your life. It’s the foundation for your own definition of success.

# Guide to Hiring and Retaining Technical Talent

## Insights from Neil Kumar, CTO of Karat

![](0*p0TqD4q0yfUditBs)
> # *“When you’re making a decision to join a company, the first impression is the interview process. So for companies that are really trying to attract the best talent, candidate experience is extremely important to get right.”*

Neil Kumar is the CTO at [Karat](https://twitter.com/karat), an organization that conducts first-round technical interviews on behalf of a number of top engineering companies. As one of the original team members, Neil’s passion for building and managing large engineering teams has been a guiding force behind the company.

Years of hands-on experience have helped him provide critical thought leadership for Karat’s clients. Neil was one of the first 12 employees at Yelp, where he grew the engineering team from a handful of employees to over 200 engineers.

In today’s tech driven world, finding and recruiting technical talent is a competitive business. Employers are constantly battling for the best and brightest, so even small delays in the hiring process can cost a company an engineer. Neil and his team at Karat have helped cut the time it takes to get new hires on board and have completed over 20,000 first-round interviews for their clients.

Neil recently joined us on [*IT Visionaries](https://apple.co/2L7kF0x)* to discuss how to attract and retain the best technical talent. Neil explains how to speed up the hiring process, eliminate bias, and improve the candidate experience.

## Remove Bias from the Hiring Process

“You really want to be conscious of removing the unconscious bias. That means having a very standardized interviewing process and being fair and respectful to all candidates.”

According to Neil, standardization is about more than one-on-one interviews, it extends to group meetings and the decision making process as well.

“Bias is not just what happens in the interview room but even how the decision is made. Teams are subject to groupthink and it’s hard to avoid that. But you can by building roundtable practices where people can see the outcomes from the interviews and the on-sites. Seeing that separately before they see each other […] helps a lot with bias.”

A lot of bias can be removed by being analytical about what you are trying to get out of a hire and being methodical about analyzing those competencies.

“Sit down and try to work backwards from the competencies that the job requires. Try to really figure out what it is that you’re trying to assess for, and come up with those questions beforehand. You’ll make better use of the interview time and you’ll collect better data that will help you make the right decision.”
> # **Key Takeaway: Be rigorous and methodical in order to remove bias from the interview process.**

## Improve the Diversity of Your Teams

“People want to join companies where they’re not just a token. Instead, they’re joining a group of people that’s welcoming them and their leadership by buying into it from day one.”

One way companies can ensure they have a diverse team is by making sure to bring in a diverse group to interview for every available position.

“Another technique is something that a lot of companies have borrowed from the NFL, the Rooney Rule. It basically states that for every hire that you make, you need to have some candidates on the on-site who are from a diverse background so that you’re not just interviewing one type of group.”

“If you combine that with standardized interviewing, you will find that there are a lot of candidates that maybe don’t look like the people you have today, but that have the skills that you’re looking for and really can help your company move to the future.”

“You also have to have a good culture. A culture that’s inviting and open to people from different backgrounds — and that doesn’t just mean gender or skin color, but also in different places in life. In modern times with remote work, we have much more flexibility for people with families and we can create environments that allow people to come back to work after they’ve been on maternity leave or changed careers. We no longer live in a 9 to 5 world. A lot of the work can be done remotely.”

“It took me a long time to realize that the things that I was doing were optimizing for finding candidates just like myself and that was very detrimental to building a diverse team. By the time I started to realize that, we already had 30 or 40 engineers on the team. To go back and rethink how you do diversity is much harder the longer you wait.”
> # **Key Takeaway: Companies can combine fair, standardized interview practices with flexible work conditions to create a diverse team.**

## Organizations Frequently Pass on Good Talent

Neil emphasized that companies should be as focused on not passing on good candidates as they are on accidentally hiring poor candidates.

“Everybody focuses on the false positive. For example, somebody’s resume says ‘I know Java’ but they don’t [really] know Java programming. But the false negatives are equally as important. A single interview can go in any direction. The candidate can have a bad day or maybe not hear the interviewer properly, and companies are losing out on great talent based on just a single data point.”

“One way we [overcome this is to] offer all candidates a redo. So within 24 hours of an interview, you could have a different set of questions or a different interviewer. It’s a second chance and we find that for a lot of candidates — both from our diversity cohort, but even our senior software engineers who just might be rustier at coding — this sort of opportunity gives them a second chance. For a lot of our clients, they’re making great hires out of this pool.”

“If you think about how much time and money goes into hiring the false positive… it’s pretty expensive. But the false negative, the hire that you could have made, is expensive as well in the opportunity cost.”
> # **Key Takeaway: Organizations should devote as much attention to false negatives as false positives when hiring.**

## To Remain Competitive, You Must Improve the Candidate Experience

Neil emphasized that the labor market is competitive. Employers need to compete for top talent. That means they need to have a smooth interview process with a strong candidate experience.

“When you’re making a decision to join a company, the first impression is the interview process. So for companies that are really trying to attract the best talent, candidate experience is extremely important to get right.”

A big part of candidate experience is basic humanity and respect.

“In my experience, it’s really about conducting interviews with humanity and fairness and being thoughtful and respectful. [Sometimes] it’s more like processing cattle than really building a [hiring process] that’s humanizing.”

One key to humanizing the process is to stay in contact and make sure the process moves along quickly.

“[We try to eliminate] what I call the recruiting black hole, which you’ll see with a lot of companies where you apply and you don’t hear back forever and ever.”

“One of the things that we do at Karat that I think is really interesting is we interview 24/7. We’re not just limited to Monday through Friday, 9 to 5. Being able to interview outside of the work day lets you move faster than other companies.”

“Having clear definitions of what signals you’re looking for and how you can collect those signals allows you to make a faster decision and be the first person giving that candidate an offer.”

“We’re not saying make rushed decisions, necessarily, but get to the point where you can make that hiring decision much faster.”
> # Key Takeaway: Executives need to focus on improving their candidate experience and making their hiring process more efficient

## **Final Thought**

Technical talent needs to be empowered with the right tools to make smart hiring decisions.

“We hired these software engineers because they like to write code, they like to build product, they like to solve problems, not because they necessarily had some innate ability to assess this talent in others.”

# Is It Time To Ditch Performance Improvement Plans?

## 

Performance Improvement Plans, or PIPs, are used all over the world — ostensibly to address and improve the work of underperforming or unhappy employees. Unfortunately, they are often remarkably unsuccessful at achieving that outcome.

In most cases, PIPs are really used just to buy time before making a personnel change; create a paper trail for legal purposes; or address minor, surface-level issues.

The truth is, PIPs don’t improve performance. They may even do more harm than good. Here’s why.

## **1) PIPs focus on symptoms, not root problems.**

The central problem with PIPs is that they fail to address the underlying causes of poor performance.

They’re basically the business equivalent of a doctor giving everyone with a headache an aspirin without bothering to find out *why* the patients have headaches. One person might be dehydrated, another might be suffering from a gluten allergy, and a third might have a brain tumor — problems that call for very different types of care, and not just aspirin.
> # Similarly, while a PIP might help some people with minor performance problems, in most cases more work is needed to diagnose and address the root issue.

Unfortunately, some root problems aren’t fixable (e.g., the person is in the wrong job or does not have the required skills) — and some perhaps*shouldn’t* be fixed (e.g., the employee disagrees with a core element of the culture that is not going to change). Whatever the cause of the performance headaches, it’s important for company leaders to have honest conversations about the real underlying issue(s) and what solutions might be possible.

Keep in mind that if someone isn’t a good fit for your company or its core values, no PIP is ever going to fix that.

## **2) PIPs tend to improve performance — but only in the short term.**

Since PIPs only treat symptoms — and are typically executed only *after *problems have become really entrenched — their positive results are often temporary. The potential loss of a job can be quite motivating in the near term, but long-term patterns almost inevitably resurface.
> So, while you might get a team member to improve over the course of a 60- or 90-day PIP, most employees will return to form unless the root problem has been addressed.

Note, however, that a PIP can actually be a good choice if a performance decline is due to factors outside of work or something temporary — such as a recent bout of depression, money troubles or illness in the family. In these cases, a PIP can help someone focus on getting back on track. Just be sure the employee is engaged in the process, understands why and where he needs to improve and is ready to make the investment of time and effort necessary to stay with the company.

## **3) PIPs do not provide legal protection.**

The real reason many companies use PIPs is not because leaders think they will resolve problems, but because they think documenting the employee’s failures will protect them from a lawsuit. Employees aren’t really expected to succeed, and thus the whole process does nothing more than generate additional distrust and anger.

What’s more, a PIP isn’t really going to do much to protect your company, since most lawsuits emanate from feelings of distrust and disrespect. I recently spoke with a company leader who used to use PIPs to protect her from lawsuits but still found herself being sued. She then shifted to a policy of having open and honest conversations with employees. She said treating people with respect from the outset has proved to be a much more successful strategy for preventing lawsuits than PIPs.

## **4) Honest dialogue is the best approach to performance concerns.**

The truth is, if you’re already giving an employee regular feedback — which you should be — PIPs should not be necessary. You should be able to ask any employee: “Is this job what you want to be doing”; “Are you happy?”; or “Is there something else you would rather be doing — here or elsewhere?”
> No one wants to do a bad job. So, when someone isn’t performing well, it’s only fair to give that person an opportunity to consider if she is in the wrong role or company. Then, you can have a productive discussion about next steps.

Patti McCord, who is famous for helping to create the much-heralded culture deck at Netflix, once said that she discusses performance with employees in terms of what the company needs six months out. If she doesn’t expect the company to need a certain employee’s skill set, she gives him that news straight out, while also providing support for making the transition.

McCord has said she believes offering candid feedback, a reference and a generous severance package to help an employee move to a new job is better for both parties than dragging out a process that’s destined to fail. Her position is, “Be generous, but be honest.”

If you [show employees that you care about them — but you aren’t willing to compromise your performance standards or the needs of your business](https://www.robertglazer.com/mindful-transition/) — you will succeed in establishing standards that everyone at your workplace can respect.

This strategy is guaranteed to lead to better outcomes than any PIP.

# Start Your Side Hustle — The Life-Changing Magic of “Eating What You Kill”

## Start Your Side Hustle — The Life-Changing Magic of “Eating What You Kill”

A few weeks ago, a jaguar escaped its cage at a New Orleans zoo and killed six other animals.

Rightly, no one blamed the jaguar *for being a jaguar.*

For years, its trainers fed it chunks of meat — pre-cut and requiring no effort to procure. The jaguar accepted those meals day in and day out because he had no choice.

It’s not such a bad life, right? He doesn’t have to deal with the harshness of the wild, wonder when his next meal is going to come, or risk getting injured during a hunt. But the second he got the chance to do what his instincts told him to do, he just couldn’t help himself.

We’re a lot like that jaguar, except we have the opportunity to hunt every day and some of us refuse to take it.

## Hunting, Gathering, and Making Our Own Living

People forget the current environment we live in is a blip on the radar compared to human history. Your ancestors didn’t have jobs — they hunted and gathered to ‘make a living.’

Even once we evolved and became more ‘civilized’ we didn’t all rush to a cubicle, an assembly line, or any other situation that involved “punching a clock.”

You didn’t ‘work at a shoe store.’ You *were the shoemaker*. Or you were the blacksmith, the fruit stand owner, the butcher.

People were artisans. Everyone had their own little niche and we traded goods with each other. There was nothing like a formal job until a very recent section of history.

In the past, you could also easily die from getting diarrhea and lots of people were poor farmers and indentured servants as well. I’m not saying those times were ideal.

What I am saying, though, is that it seems like there’s a lot of [monotony in our lives](http://ayotheauthor.com/3-little-life-changing-tricks-can-use-find-complaining-feeling-stuck/) because they’re too predictable. We’re the jaguar in the cage who secretly want to escape. Our circumstances and scenery have evolved, but mentally we still want to ‘hunt’ ‘trade’ and have our own little corner of the market to operate.

You don’t have to quit your job, but you can still recapture that feeling and way of living

## Why You Should Consider “Eating What You Kill”

There’s nothing wrong with having a job. I still have a job and I love it.

Jobs are stable. Jobs can be fun. You can reach all of your career goals through a job without ever starting a business.

Nothing is black and white. Everything has pros and cons.

While a steady income is great — a must even — there are some drawbacks:

* You have no control over *when* you get your money

* You can’t increase your output and *suddenly earn more money*

* Jobs have disincentives for your output, e.g., stretching a five hour day into eight because…who knows?

* Even in the best job, you have to wait for a handout — even if it’s one you’ve earned

Contrast that with ‘eating what you kill’:

* There are few better feelings than making money directly for something you made or provided

* You have more redundancy and safety. If you have a job and a little side hustle, you have ‘two lungs’ so to speak

* If you’re in a pinch, you know you can go get some money

* Accumulate enough money on your own, and you can tell people to fuck off

Now, before we dive into the ‘how’ portion of this, let’s get a few things straight.

## You Don’t Have to Be a Capital ‘E’ Entrepreneur

If you want to permanently remain at the side hustle level, you can.

If you want to lazily pursue your side hustle — without [waking up at 5 a.m](http://ayotheauthor.com/secret-behind-morning-routine-used-write-two-books-triple-income-skyrocket-productivity/)., grinding and ‘crushing it’ until you have a panic attack, or moving to Bali — you can.

You don’t have to put entrepreneur in your Twitter profile (actually, don’t do that).

You can slowly and patiently start to earn a little side hustle income and reap the benefits from it. Nothing extravagant.

Having a side hustle is less about the *money you make* and more about the *person you become* when you pursue one.

It’s also the perfect route to true entrepreneurship.

I’ve noticed a trend, all the real entrepreneurs give the *exact opposite advice* most entrepreneurship coaches and silicon valley gurus give:

* Don’t take risks — it’s called a *side* hustle for a reason.

* [Don’t quit your job](http://ayotheauthor.com/job-isnt-problem/) — build a bridge to a company if that’s what you want to do

* Be patient and don’t take yourself too seriously along the way

You can slowly creep into your side hustle until you can leap into something better.

Next, let’s look at some ways you can earn money.

## Great Side Hustles to Start

I’ll just be honest. They say you can start a side hustle in ‘anything’ but the truth — at least from my perspective — tells me certain types of side hustles are easier to start and gain traction.

## Freelance Writing, Design, Coding, and Marketing

Lot’s of people try to freelance but they go about it the wrong way.

First, they’re quickly disillusioned by the ‘race to the bottom’ mentality because they sign up for Upwork and find that competing with developers in Pakistan who will work for $3/hr doesn’t pave the road to financial freedom.

Pro tip — don’t go to a freelancer mill to start freelancing….

Want to know what works?

Good ol’ fashion outreach. Create a portfolio. Reach out to businesses (they have more money than individuals) and pitch them your stuff. Keep pitching until someone accepts and improve your skills in the process.

Send 100 emails to get 10 replies, 3 meetings, and one contract.

Voila. As with all keys to life — working hard and doing shit repeatedly while iterating along the way seems to work. *Who knew?*

Here are some great freelancing resources to get you started:

[Make a Living Writing](http://makealivingwriting.com/)

[Freelance to Win](https://freelancetowin.com/)

[Resource list — 72 Best Freelance Job Websites](https://www.ryrob.com/freelance-jobs/)

## E-Commerce Businesses

You can start e-commerce businesses with low overhead.

You don’t even have to carry the inventory.

I’m no expert on this subject, but given my knowledge of [marketing and SEO](https://www.mltgroup.com/blog/e-commerce-marketing/), I know you can have a successful business if you learn how to market it.

Again, I’m no expert, but I’ve seen e-commerce business make great side hustles for people.

Some useful guides here as well:

[How to Start an E — Commerce Business Without Spending Any Money](https://www.shopify.com/blog/10580693-how-to-start-an-ecommerce-business-without-spending-any-money)

## Lifestyle Businesses

A lot of people have muddied the lifestyle business niche.

This isn’t going to be a sales page or a Facebook ad about “making six-figures in six seconds.”

People do build lifestyle businesses. It’s just not as easy as some people make it seem.

The short version of the process — write/video/Instagram/whatever about stuff you’re interested in, build a following around it, find *something* to sell them that they actually want.

I won’t dive deep into the details.

Here are some articles that explain the process better than I ever could:

[How to Start a Lifestyle Business Step by Step](https://www.nateliason.com/lifestyle-business/)

[16 Painless Actions You Can Take in 20 Minutes or Less To Start Your Business](http://unsettle.org/start-business/)

It takes hard work, but it’s fun (see: why you should eat what you kill).

I’ve barely covered all the possibilities when it comes to starting your side hustle. Places like *Side Hustle Nation* go into much more depth than I can.

The point? There’s opportunity out there to make some extra change and build a more comfortable and exciting life for yourself.

So why don’t most people do it? Well, [you need skills](http://ayotheauthor.com/top-10-demand-skills-2018/) to pull off a side hustle. To get those skills, *you have to hustle.*

Not at a breakneck pace, but not at a snail’s pace either. The more skills you build on top of one another the more opportunities you have to create a custom-tailored career.

## Build Your Talent Stack

Do yourself a favor and read the book — [How to Fail at Almost Anything and Still Succeed.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847745/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591847745&linkCode=as2&tag=thedesfor-20&linkId=239e2a9d6ac66ce1aa69f788d2005548)

Scott Adams — the creator of the comic strip *Dilbert* — wrote the book. In it, he shares an interesting concept anyone can apply.

If you asked Scott, he’d tell you he’s an average drawer at best, funny but not hilarious, business savvy but no Buffet, and good with words but no Hemingway.

He’s pretty good at a handful of skills. On their own, they’re not worth much but combined, he suddenly becomes the best in the world as the combination.

When you stack talents your skills amplify each other until you have ‘career capital’ meaning you’re rare and indispensable.

If you’re rare and indispensable, you can charge more, have more autonomy, and have access to more opportunities; skills beget skills and [success begets more success.](http://ayotheauthor.com/subtle-secret-becoming-successful-without-trying-hard-whatsoever/)

### Here’s a pool of items that make great potential for a side hustler’s talent stack:

* [writing](http://www.ayothewriter.com/)

* marketing

* public speaking

* SEO, PPC, Ads

* second language

* coding

* design

* networking

* artistic talent, e.g., painting, sculpting

* organization

* people skills

Above the money, you should start a side hustle to try and get good at a valuable skill. Then, you can start more hustles and e[xperiment](http://ayotheauthor.com/stop-thinking-start/) until you have a skillset and portfolio unique to you.

## Break the Monotony

Imagine you own a little online jewelry shop. Nothing fancy. You went on Shopify and set it up in a few hours. You don’t carry any inventory and the products go straight to the customer. It’s just something you’re doing for fun — a hobby.

You make a few hundred extra bucks a month. When your car breaks down, you have the money to fix it. Or, you and your spouse randomly decide to take a weekend trip *because you can.*

Time goes on. You’re enjoying your hobby. Because you enjoy it, you start to get curious and read more about marketing the store. You implement the techniques. The store grows, and grows, and grows.

One day, the income you make from the store matches the income from your job.

You can keep your job and have the extra money or you can scale your business.

The moral of the story? *You have the option.*

Side hustling, trying creative experiments, and tinkering with your career provides optionality. That’s the biggest benefit.

I’m not here to tell you what to do or try to sell you an entrepreneurship course. I’m here to promote the idea of trying low-risk ventures to spice up your life and your bank account.

I know you want to do it too. I know you’re a little tired of the rat race and monotony.

Why not give it a try?

# The Best Way To Grow Your U.S. Startup Business In Asia

## 

If you’re building a business in the U.S., you’re likely familiar with the advice to “go east” — and for good reason. Given the sheer size of the market, as well as its acceptance and celebration of technological innovation, Asia bears exciting opportunities for growth and expansion that entrepreneurs in the West should at the very least consider. It is, in many ways, the next frontier.
> I know this from experience.

My team and I at [Skylum](https://skylum.com/) decided early on that we would expand our operations into Asian markets. We were inspired for a few reasons. First, we’re a photography technology company, and much of today’s best camera technology — along with the most dedicated photographers — is coming out of places like Japan. Photographers there take their art seriously, from older heads who work with more traditional technology, to younger generations whose work is holistically digital. The scene is diverse and vibrant.

But, secondly, after traveling within Asia to explore the different opportunities there, we discovered that a sizable portion of our users were in fact located in Asian countries. We recognized a certain untapped potential, in that regard — an untapped demand. This excited us, because wherever there is demand for your product or service, you owe it to your business to cultivate and nurture it.

All in all, we have been successful thus far in our expansion efforts. But in many ways, we’re just getting started, and in our short time there, we’ve become acquainted with challenges that are complex in nature and entirely unique to operating in this part of the world.

Here are a few of the most important.

## **The major challenge with taking your business to Asia is that each country is fundamentally different.**

This was the first thing my team and I learned as we really started exploring the idea of Asian expansion: each country — from Japan to Malaysia, and from India to Singapore — is unique in meaningful, fundamental ways.

Asia as a continent is home to hundreds of different languages, cultures, patterns of behavior, forms of art, and means of visual and nonverbal communication. This is true of the general population and of business cultures. In Japan, for example, business relationships are more important than money or revenue. Companies tend to build partnerships over years, and they remain loyal to them, even in the face of new, potentially more rewarding opportunities. In China, meanwhile, the opposite seems to be true: businesses pursue the most monetarily advantageous deal every time.
> # The populations of each different country, too, are unique. Each interacts with and appreciates different things about a company’s product and culture — and they’ll dislike different things, too.

Accordingly, nurturing demand for your product in these disparate places also necessitates a differentiated approach.

Of course, properly understanding each country and the markets that operate within them is challenging. To obtain that understanding, you have to spend time in each country, immersing yourself in the culture and seeking genuine understanding around what makes each place unique.

This, as it happens, is where most aspiring entrepreneurs fail. They think of Asia as a homogenous continent, rather than a collection of disparate countries with different identities, needs, and traits. A one-size-fits-all approach simply doesn’t work.

At Skylum, we’re approaching our expansion efforts knowing that it will take *years* to build up the sort of relationships and understanding required of genuinely impacting the markets. Before we start selling anything, and even before we start promoting our products, we’re investing time and money into building cultural awareness within each country we plan on working with.

## **Another mistake companies make expanding into Asia? They go for disingenuous reasons.**

Yes, the monetary rewards for tapping into the Asian markets are potentially lucrative. But if you think Asian expansion represents a chance for a quick cash grab, you’re mistaken.

The monetary rewards of Asian market expansion will only ever be realized if you approach your efforts with an understanding of how long and serious of an investment is required. In fact, if your efforts are inspired primarily by money, you’ll likely fail. You should be inspired, more so, especially early on, by a sincere desire to bring something new and valuable to new markets.
> # In the beginning, you should expect nothing in return — you should only seek to provide value.

For us at Skylum, we know that means understanding what photographers in these new markets want and need, and then doing our best to provide them with that.

How you ingratiate yourself in a country to obtain this critical understanding will depend on what you’re trying to do there, but it remains that you will need to invest time and effort. You’ll need to visit, learn about what technology the people are using — in China, for example, everyone does everything with WeChat; in Japan, the go-to communication app is LINE — and you’ll need to stay for awhile.

The sort of mindset that’s most conducive to that kind of patience? One founded upon a desire to provide value — not to quickly grab some cash.

## **Focus on one or two specific markets where you have some traction.**

Now, because of how vast and sprawling Asia is, and because of how different each country proudly remains, you will be best served by selecting one or two specific markets to focus on building partnerships with.

One way to determine which markets to focus on is by assessing which ones you already have traction inside of. Where are you seeing web traffic, users interacting with your product, users talking about your product on social media — anything? Identify those places, and immerse yourself inside them by doing things like meeting with users face to face — a great approach to really getting to know and understand your customers.

At Skylum, we’re focusing on the photography markets in Japan and China.

We chose those markets because we already had traction there, but also because they’re so compact, and that’s important for us. Tokyo, for instance, is home to 40 million people — many of whom own cameras. Hong Kong, similarly, houses more than 7 million people. And both populations are enthusiastic about photography. Word of our product and the value we provide is more likely to spread.

## **At the end of the day, to capitalize on this exciting opportunity, you have to be aware of the inherent challenges and make sure you’re investing your time for the right reasons.**

This amounts to approaching your expansion efforts intelligently and with an appreciation of how unique each different Asian country truly is.

One reason so few western businesses have gained footholds in Asia is they didn’t approach their expansion efforts with empathy or persistence.

Sure, ultimately, success will take a bit of luck. But more than that, going east necessitates humility and old-fashioned hard work. If you’re prepared for this, if you anticipate the challenges, and if you study the cultures, you just might make the sort of impact you desire.

# This conversation stopper should be a starter.

## 

## *Nobody does it that way.*

This line stops a conversation before it begins.

If no one does it that way, it means it can’t be done.

If no one does it that way, it means we’ll get ostracized or rejected.

If no one does it that way, it means we don’t know what results await us.

If no one does it that way, it means we’re not going to do it that way.

So we stick to what’s worked in the past. We launch the same marketing campaign and make the seventeenth sequel to the *Fast and Furious* series. We pay lip service to doing things differently, but our commitment to originality carries the same sincerity as a glib politician pledging campaign reform.

When push comes to shove, we conform, rather than flout.

Resisting conformity causes us emotional distress — literally. A [neurological study](http://www.ccnl.emory.edu/greg/Berns%20Conformity%20Biol%20Psych%20Final%20with%20Figs%20and%20Suppl%20Materials.pdf) showed that non-conformity activates the amygdala and produces what the authors describe as “a pain of independence.”

To avoid this pain, we become the by-products of other people’s behaviors. In our personal lives, everything from our clothes, favorite movies, religious beliefs, and the books we choose to read are influenced by others. Businesses chase the latest fad or trend and do things simply because their competitors are doing them.

In [one representative study](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6038/108), participants were quizzed about a documentary they watched: How many policemen were there when the woman got arrested? What was the color of her dress? A few days after they took the test, they returned to the lab to get re-tested. This time, they were shown the responses of other participants, some of which had been intentionally doctored to be false.

Roughly seventy percent of the time, the participants changed their answers and went along with the wrong answers given by the rest of the group. Even after the experimenters told the participants that the group answers were wrong, the fake social proof was so powerful that half of the participants stuck with the wrong answers when they were re-tested.

Imitation is easy. It provides the path of least resistance. It can even deliver some results in the short term. But it’s a recipe for long-term disaster. As Warren Buffett put it, “The five most dangerous words in business are ‘Everybody else is doing it.’” Over time, imitation makes a trend obsolete. This “monkey see, monkey do” approach creates a race to the center. The companies who prevail are those that decide to buck the trend and explore the edges.

Consider Patagonia’s 2011 advertising campaign.1The company asked, *Instead of doing what everyone does and asking people to buy from us, what if we asked them not to buy from us*? The result of this thought experiment was [a full-page ad in the *New York Times](https://www.patagonia.com/blog/2011/11/dont-buy-this-jacket-black-friday-and-the-new-york-times/)* that ran on Black Friday. The ad featured a Patagonia jacket with the headline, “Don’t buy this jacket.” With this ad, Patagonia became “the only retailer in the country asking people to buy less on Black Friday.” The ad worked in part because it supported Patagonia’s mission of reducing consumerism and lightening environmental impact. But it also ended up helping the company’s bottom line by attracting customers who shared the same mindset.

Dick Fosbury used the same method to revolutionize the Olympic high jump. When Fosbury was training to be a high jumper, athletes would use a technique called the straddle method, where they would jump face down over the bar. But Fosbury, a 21-year-old from the middle of nowhere in Oregon, prided himself on doing things differently. He asked himself, *What if I did the opposite of what everyone else is doing*? *Instead of jumping face down to the bar, what if I jumped backwards*?

His approach at first invited ridicule. A newspaper called him “The World’s Laziest High Jumper.” To his coaches, the Fosbury flop–as it came to be known–was an outrageous and dangerous departure from well-established norms. They tried to convince Fosbury to drop it.

Ignoring the naysayers, he kept gradually improving his technique and earned himself a spot on the 1968 Olympic team. The laughs eventually turned into cheers as Fosbury proved his critics wrong and took home the gold medal at the Olympics — by doing the exact opposite of the “best practice.”

Fosbury knew a secret missed by many others: The low-hanging fruit has already been picked. You can’t beat a stronger competitor by copying them. But you *can* beat them by doing what they’re not doing.

The next time you’re tempted to follow the herd, ask yourself, “What if I did what no one else is doing?” Even if you don’t follow through, the thought process involved in generating the answer will likely produce unexpected breakthroughs.

# 2 Experiences You Need For Getting To The Next Level

## 2 Experiences You Need For Getting To The Next Level

### If you’re struggling to be motivated, you need to have at least one of these two types of experiences.

In the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, *1776*, David McCullough tells the story of John Greenwood, a sixteen-year-old boy who in May of 1775 heard news of Lexington and Concord. The American Revolutionary War was underway, and Greenwood resolved to walk the 150 miles by himself to Boston with little more than the clothes on his back.

Stopping at wayside taverns, he’d play songs on his fife for soldiers who would ask him where he was going. He responded, “I told them I was going to fight for my country.”

Once he got to Cambridge, he learned of the battle raging at Bunker Hill. Immediately, he was seized-upon by a gruesome scene. While walking down the road leading to the fight, wagons passed him by carrying piles of dead bodies and severely wounded men.

Greenwood was terrified and wished he hadn’t enlisted. “I could positively feel my hair stand on end,” he said. But then something happened that forever changed him. He saw a lone soldier walking down the road. In his own words:
> “… a Negro man, wounded in the back of his neck, passed me and, his collar being open and he not having anything on except his shirt and trousers, I saw the wound quite plainly and the blood running down his back. I asked him if it hurt him much, and he did not seem to mind it. He said no that he was only to get a plaster put on it and meant to return. You cannot conceive what encouragement this immediately gave me. **I began to feel brave and like a soldier from that moment, and fear never troubled me afterward during the whole war.**”

## Experience #1: Seeing Someone Else Operate Without Fear

Greenwood was changed in an instant. He saw a man seemingly unaffected by what should have been an excruciatingly painful wound.

He saw a man who had passed a personal point of no return. A “lone soldier” who was so absorbed by a situation and a cause that he didn’t notice his own pain.

Greenwood realized at that moment his extreme self-consciousness, which was holding him back. In seeing someone else operate from a higher mental plane, Greenwood was immediately brought-up to that plane himself.

Courage, commitment, and confidence replaced fear. He stopped worrying about himself. He stopped noticing every sensation in his body. Instead, his mind was captured by the moment and importance of what was happening around him. In his own words, he never was troubled by fear again throughout the remainder of the war.

If you’re having a hard time being focused, or if you’re plagued by fear to do what you believe you should be doing, then you need exposure to “battle.” You need to see someone who has passed their point of no return. You need to look at someone who no longer cares about temporary discomfort.

How do you get such exposure?

You have a few options.

When it comes to Greenwood, he had to walk 150 miles on foot to get to the place of battle. You may need to walk the equivalent of 150 miles on foot to see what’s going on at the frontlines of whatever “battle” you’re attempting to fight.

Who is on the frontlines?

Who are the battle heroes in your field or cause?

How can you get closer exposure to these people?

How can you see them at work?

How can you tap into their mindset and mentality?

You may need to work or sacrifice for a few months or years to get such exposure. This preparation period will soften the soil of your heart and mind, allowing you to be completely open and receptive when the moment comes.

In the book, *The Compound Effect*, Darren Hardy describes having such an experience. He had invested in a mentorship with Paul J. Meyer, who was the founder of several companies and an innovator in the self-development space. In Hardy’s words:
> “Whenever I thought I was really doing things, really playing at a high level, I’d get around Paul — he was my reality check. What he did before lunch was mind-boggling to me… After spending a couple of hours with Paul, hearing about all his plans and ventures and activities, my head would spin. Just trying to make sense of all he had going on exhausted me. After time with Paul, I’d want to go take a nap! But my association with him raised my game. **His walking pace was my running pace. It expanded my ideas about how big I could play and how ambitious I could be. You have to get around people like that!**”

Once you’ve been adequately exposed to what’s possible, there’s no going back. As Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. has said, *“A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”*

You absolutely can create these transformational experiences. But you’ll need to put yourself in the heat of battle proactively. You can’t have such skills on the sidelines. You must make yourself vulnerable, even with doubts and fears streaming through your system.

## Experience #2: Have Someone You Love/Respect Tell It To You Straight

It’s nice for the ego to get constant praise and affirmation. However, having people around you who hold you to a continually elevated standard is more powerful for your long-term development.

Hal Eyring, a former business professor at Stanford and also a religious leader, tells the story of getting straight A’s one semester while in college. He was taking several challenging physics classes and was excited to share his success with his mother, yet was humbled by her response. “That’s what we expect of you,” she told him. Reflecting on that experience several decades later, Eyring stated, *“Sometimes the greatest kindness we could receive would be to have someone expect more from us than we do because they see more clearly our divine heritage.”*

According to loads of research in psychology, it’s critical to be surrounded by people and leaders who hold you to a high standard and expectation — a concept known as “The Pygmalion Effect.” Unquestionably, we as people rise or fall to the expectations of those around us.

Receiving praise and affirmation is indeed essential. But rarely will the affirmation trigger within you a powerful conviction that you can do better. Instead, what you need is someone to hold you to a higher standard than you carry yourself.

You need someone who you know loves you enough to tell you that you could do better. That’s one of the reasons I decided to marry my wife. Other girls would tell me how great I was, and that didn’t inspire me. For some reason, I never felt like I could impress my wife. I always felt like I had to earn her approval and respect. That created a challenge that led me to become more than I thought I was.

Even still, after nearly six years of being married, Lauren will make comments that light a fire under me. Despite being physically fit, she recently told me I was starting to get a “Dad-Bod.” Although I disagree, I now have even more of a reason to get into the best shape of my life. I want to prove to her that I can be more fit than I was when we were in our early 20’s.

Getting critical feedback and being around nay-sayers is two entirely different things. You need to know that the feedback you’re getting is honest. You need to know that the person who is talking to you cares about your best interest. Their feedback is coming from a positive, not a negative place. You need to know that they want you to be successful and expect more of you than you’re currently expecting of yourself.

Recently, I submitted two book proposals to my publisher for the next two books I’m going to write. I was humbled continuously as my agent would send back drafts and tell me, “What are you doing? You’re so much better than this.”

While writing *Willpower Doesn’t Work,* I had hired Ryan Holiday to help me develop the book. With each draft or conversation, he would continually say things similar. “You can do so much better than this.” Even after the book was published, Ryan told me, “You can write a better book than that.” I respect him enough to know he isn’t merely rude, but honest.

You need people around you who hold you to a higher standard.

You need people to tell you when you’re not performing at the level you could be.

You need hard feedback that will cause you to honestly reflect and dig deeper into yourself than you’ve been willing to dig in a long time.

You then need to go to a quiet place and ask yourself some hard questions. You probably need to meditate and or pray. You need to redevelop a sense of resolve and commitment to play at a higher level.

You then need to do the hard work of pushing past your emotional blocks. You need to rise above your current sense of who you believe you are. You need to exceed even the expectations of those who believe you can do better. You need to show up at a level no one else is willing to go.

This is how you get to the next level and the next.

You get humbled by people who know you could do better.

You then rise to their expectations and exceed them. Because ultimately, you need to hold yourself to higher standards than anyone else is willing to hold you. But to get to that level, you need to be told straight that you could do much better. You need to be humble and willing to receive that feedback. You then need to prove them wrong and show them that you’re so much more than even they think you can be.

I love that my wife recently called me out. I’m more committed than ever to get into the best shape of my life.

I love that my agent recently called me out. It led me to produce the best writing I’ve ever done in my life. I’m on the brink of writing two books that will fundamentally change the trajectory of my career. I couldn’t have done that if I had an agent who had low expectations for me and just wanted a quick-win. She reminded me of the vision I have for myself and told me to get up and play a bigger game.

## Conclusion

Who is holding you to a higher standard?

How often are you getting honest and real feedback?

Who are your mentors?

Who are your friends?

How regularly are you have these 2 types of triggering experiences?

# Simple Truths&#58; My Guiding Signals in a World of Noise

## 

One of the best lessons I’ve learned over the past few years is that — when faced with a difficult decision or challenging situation — rarely is more information the answer.

Instead, what I’ve found to be so incredibly helpful is this idea of “simple truths” (what some may call “first principles”): short snippets of wisdom that have been gathered, carefully curated, and repeatedly learned over years of life experience.

I originally learned of the concept from a French philosopher named [Alain de Botton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_de_Botton), who’s ideas on education reform are fascinating, and is often quoted as saying “we overeducate ourselves out of simple truths”.

As Alain explains, school teaches us that once we know something, that’s it; you know it, and it’s time to move onto the next chapter. But this is dangerous, because it leads us to believe we understand more than we actually do. That is, knowing something in your head is entirely different than feeling it in your bones.

To truly understand requires repetition; repeatedly learning the same lesson over and over again until it translates from conceptual understanding to daily practice. Understanding an idea is on a much lower dimension than acting on it. For example, knowing that daily exercise is good for you is much different than actually going to the gym everyday.

So every time I move into a new place (5 times and counting over the past 3 years), I start a new wall of simple truths. And then, over the course of my time there, I gather these ‘simple truths’ from all sources: conversations with friends & mentors, books I read, podcasts I listen to, or even just experiences I have. Then, every time I’m faced with a difficult decision or challenging situation, I return back to the wall as my source of guiding light.

Friends who know me well (and have received my countless text messages sharing new addition to the wall) often give me shit about my seeming obsession with “post-it note wisdom”. But in a way, this is my religion. The difference is, instead of becoming defensive or dogmatic about it, I start over more than once a year. I’m always beginning again, gathering new lessons and repeatedly learning them until I can’t *not* remember.

Truthfully, up until now I’ve been pretty insecure about sharing these simple truths outside a core group friends… mostly because I realize that 95% of them won’t resonate with others in the same way they make sense to me. But, as I take down my 5th wall in the past 3 years, I feel a need to be more vulnerable than I’m naturally willing, and share.

For the past 11 months, these 25 simple truths (below) have been my guiding signals in a world of noise. There’s nothing complex about them, but they’ve been so very helpful for me in what may have otherwise felt like hopeless situations.

My hope is that, even if 24/25 pass you by, just 1 (5%) sticks with you; enough that you’re able to feel it in your bones, and not just know it in your head whenever you need it most. After all, as Derek Sivers says, “if information was the answer, we’d all be billionaires with perfect abs”.

# From Two Computer Screens To One — Learning To Live With Less.

## Image Credit: Unsplash / PolaroMagnet

Sometimes you discover something incredible about life and it happens by accident. That’s what happened to me.

Four years ago I was working out of an old office building in the suburbs. It was my job to sell financial products door to door. On my first day, I noticed that all the desks only had one computer screen.

The office I’d come from before had two screens for each computer thus producing the dual screen norm that so many people are used to.
> # I tried to get a second screen and was told it wasn’t possible. That’s where the transformation began.

I was forced to go from the efficiency of two screens and being able to drag and drop files from one screen to the other, down to what I believed to be the inefficiency of one computer screen.

## You get used to it.

Fast forward twelve months and I was a single screen pro and happy about it.

I’d go into the office each day and plug my laptop into a single screen. I’d learned keyboard shortcuts to deal with the differences of working on one screen as opposed to two.

I was tested again when I went to update my home computer and decided not to buy another dual-screen Mac Pro, and instead, go for a much cheaper iMac. Running dual screen on an iMac was not easy and it was costly — plus, I didn’t have the desk space for two screens anymore.

Sure enough, the switch from two computer screens at home back to one screen became easy after a few months. Earlier this year I started a new job and the old *“One screen or two screens, sir”* question came up when I met the IT department for the first time.

![](1*DwoSx6ZB21qi65CFy46XaA.jpeg)

I said with a big, confident smile *“I’ll take one screen, mam.”*

My colleagues that were listening in on the conversation were confused.

## Why would you choose less?

That’s what my colleagues were thinking while they watched me give up what they perceived as a major privilege and insist on one computer screen.

Many of my colleagues had read my blogs and knew I was a productivity nut. They thought I was going against what I preach. I wasn’t.

The decision to choose less had another influence worth mentioning.

### The beans and rice movement.

Many of the podcasts I listened to and the books I was reading at the time were talking about a new trend of eating beans and rice for one week a month. This may sound absurd, but there’s a good reason behind it: it helps you learn to live with less.

![Image Credit: [Betty Crocker](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-black-beans-and-rice/fe8730af-a2e5-4fb6-b1b9-61f297aeb0bf)](1*QEolZCwOjiO6e-Crwz1SmA.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Betty Crocker](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-black-beans-and-rice/fe8730af-a2e5-4fb6-b1b9-61f297aeb0bf)*

Eating plain meals like beans and rice teaches you to go without the complexities of having to cook like the chefs on the Master Chef TV Show.

Eating plain meals teaches you that you don’t need condiments, sauces, wine, seasoning or anything else.
> The beans and rice movement was a vote for simplicity. It was a vote to abandon fancy for a life that didn’t require extras.

The reason I chose one computer screen is because it made me more versatile and I had to learn to do more with less. I wouldn’t always be working in an environment that had two screens I could plug into my laptop.

There isn’t two screens when you’re on holidays sitting on the beach.

If you go and work for an early stage startup, you probably won’t get two screens.
> **Having one screen taught me that things could go backwards. It taught me to prepare for the worst**

Maybe I’d lose my job. 
Maybe I’d start my own company again.
Maybe I’d work from home where there wasn’t two screens.

While people I worked with would go as far as to strike if they were denied the two screen privilege or not show up for work, I became more resilient.
> # I didn’t let a big piece of black plastic, like a computer screen, determine my happiness. I chose less.

## Having less makes you appreciate everything more.

Having one screen made me appreciate what I could do on that screen so much more. I no longer had a 1000 tabs open because I only had one screen to work on. When I wanted to write a blog post, there was only one window on my single screen, open.

The second screen was clutter and distraction while the one screen life was focusing on one thing. I appreciated every word on that single screen and my desk looked incredibly beautiful because there was only one thing on it.

**Appreciation for everything in life starts with the idea that you don’t need more; you need less.**

# What you Create for an Audience of One is Much More Likely to Reach An Audience of Millions

## “A child, wearing a colorful shirt, uses crayons to color a picture.” by Aaron Burden on Unsplash

One of the great paradoxes of creative work is that what we create for an audience of one is much more likely to reach an audience of millions. When we sanitize and optimize our work in the hopes of driving eyeballs and clicks, the work loses its authenticity and potential resonance. So why exactly is it so compelling to create for an audience of one?

## **Freedom From the Need for Validation**

*Maybe your parents will never be impressed. Maybe your girlfriend won’t care. Maybe the investor won’t see the numbers. Maybe the audience won’t clap. But we have to be able to push through. We can’t let that be what motivates us. — [Ryan Holiday](https://medium.com/@ryanholiday_44799)*

In 2013, something shifted in my writing. Up until that point, I had been writing to impress an audience. I held back, played it safe, and didn’t risk saying anything too provocative or crazy. That year, I took a different approach to my writing. Rather than write to impress an audience, I wrote to make myself happy.

What emerged was an unapologetic, no bullshit, full expression of my creativity. I self-published two books. The first one sold 1000 copies. The second became a Wall Street Journal bestseller and eventually led to a book deal and to rebranding our podcast as The Unmistakable Creative.

When we’re no longer trying to impress an audience, we’re liberated from the need for their validation.

I never choose podcast guests based on how famous someone is or how many downloads I think an episode will get. I always make my choice based on the stories I find interesting. That’s how you end up with a line up that includes bank robbers and billionaires.

When we create for an audience of one, our work is no longer dictated by the opinions of an audience. Instead, we’re driven by a love for the work itself. We create what we want to see exist in the world and make art that we’re proud to put our signature on. The work ignites our curiosity and amplifies our sense of adventure, and brings meaning to our life. It becomes a lifelong practice.

## **Presence**

If you’re thinking about how your audience will respond to what you’ve created, by definition you’re not present.

* If Tom Brady is thinking about his post-game interview in the first quarter, his performance will suffer.

* If a surfer is wondering about impressing some girl on shore when he goes for a wave, he’ll probably eat shit (true story)

Whether you’re writing a book, recording a podcast, producing a Broadway play, or directing a movie, when you’re focused on how the world will respond, you pull yourself out of the moment, and the quality of your work suffers. When you’re not present, it’s impossible to play at the top of your game.

## **It Allows You to Focus on the Process**

An artist has no control over how the audience responds to his or her work:

* An author can’t control what people say about his books on Amazon

* A musician can’t control what fans say about her latest album

* A Producer Can’t control how well a movie does at the box-office.

Creating for an audience of one allows us to focus on the process instead of the outcome, the craft instead of the prize. Focused on the process, we tap into an abundance of beautiful things.

We experience visible progress, which is one of our biggest motivators. We lose ourselves in the work and in the moment, experiencing deep states of flow, which are so blissful that we keep coming back to get a taste of that feeling.

## **No Matter How it Turns Out, At Least You’ll Have the Work**

**When we do something solely for an external result, whether that’s in the form of monetary compensation, traffic to a website, fame, or status, and we set ourselves up for a disappointment**. But when our motivation is intrinsic, when we do the work for its own sake, no matter what happens, at least we’ll have the work.

Throughout history, iconic creatives like David Bowie, Daft Punk, and Oprah have prioritized the soul of their work over the audience’s approval of it. As Bowie said reflecting on his career:
> # *“I didn’t strive for success. I tried to do something artistically important.”*

They created for An [Audience of One](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733) and reached an audience of millions. I hope my new book will inspire you to do the same. You can[ download a free chapter here. ](https://unmistakablecreative.com/audience-of-one/)

# Top Insights from Twilio CMO Sara Varni

## Five Tips on Marketing and Life

![[Source](https://www.uctoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/TwilioSaraVarni2.jpg)](1*BnOGc-sTgtmhs2YEe0PeUA.jpeg)*[Source](https://www.uctoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/TwilioSaraVarni2.jpg)*

When Sara Varni was a girl, she discovered something fascinating.

She found that words, slogans, and sentences could influence the world around her.

It all started when she and her sister were creating phrases to put on custom made t-shirts. From there, she started to see how she could use words to convey ideas and messages. After that, she became fascinated by using words (and all forms of media) to present and sell ideas.

Now Sara Varni has worked for more than a decade in marketing, and (among other accomplishments!) has risen to become the Chief Marketing Officer of a publicly traded company, Twilio.

“I think I was destined to get into this space,” Varni said.

Although she took an unusual path to her current role as Chief Marketing Officer at Twilio — she was an equities trader at NASDAQ for a number of years, and then worked in mobile strategy for E! Networks — she has always had a love for marketing. At first, she was skeptical going into the world of software marketing, but she’s found that it can be just as fulfilling, if not more, as any other type of brand.

“I think what makes a great role in marketing is always having something new to market,” she says. “And there’s no shortage of high tech and software, and I think that’s what’s kept my job really exciting.”

In a recent interview on [Marketing Trends](http://bit.ly/2DF9f55), Varni details some of the lessons she’s learned along the way and the methods she’s used to find success. [Listen to the full interview here](https://apple.co/2TLxD9T).

## Where people consume content is just as important as the content itself

Whether at the gym, in the car, on your couch, or in the beauty salon, you are constantly consuming content, and the right messaging takes all those factors into account. Creating a podcast is different than producing an enticing print ad, but both mediums present different ways to speak to the audience.

“People need to be thinking about how they’re going to get the right message to the right person at the right time and then how they’re going to be able to consume it,” Varni says. “To build the ultimate customer experience you have to think about all the different channels your customers are interacting on.”

For example, at Twilio, Varni says that her customers are much more willing to solve a problem over text than on the phone with someone, so catering to those needs and creating content based on that principle is going to get you farther than anything else.

## Create your own roadmap

People can become slaves to their inbox and they lose sight of what’s important to them. Priorities easily shift when you’re not in control.

“Sometimes people manage their day so much by their inbox,” Varni said. “If you let that happen, you’re really letting other people dictate what your day looks like and what you actually accomplish.”

Varni suggests having a list of what you personally need to get done, and then mark them by priority level. She also recommends looking at the impact of what it is you’re trying to accomplish. If you can drive a bigger impact from a smaller, seemingly less important task, make that one a priority.

“If you don’t build your own roadmap you’ll become part of someone else’s,” she says.

## Conferences should be about forming connections

![[Source.](https://payload379.cargocollective.com/1/0/2995/9894715/TWILIO_BEACON_04_1280.jpg)](1*Ds8mPXOCE0gar6PZKUHZ1A.jpeg)*[Source.](https://payload379.cargocollective.com/1/0/2995/9894715/TWILIO_BEACON_04_1280.jpg)*

Varni has attended and helped plan numerous conferences, including Dreamforce, from her early days at Salesforce. In her experience, conferences are all about fostering meaningful relationships.

“One of the best measures of success at conferences is getting customers to talk to other customers or prospects,” Varni said. “If you can build an experience where you can get people to connect with each other and with your product that they might not otherwise have access to, you’re going to have a successful event.”

Varni will also be at Twilio’s SIGNAL customer and developer conference this October! SIGNAL will be packed with product announcements, amazing performances, inspiring stories, and insights from industry-leading visionaries.

## Having long-term strategies allows you to stick around

So often content marketers will look for ways to affect the bottom line as quickly as possible. Sometimes that’s necessary, but more often than not, having a long-term strategy will yield more interest and dollars if you’re willing to be patient and invest in big ideas.

“If you’re not thinking about the long term strategy or vision, your going to be one of those people who doesn’t last,” Varni explains. “Sure you have to have some quick wins and show that you have your act together and know which way is up. But if you’re constantly chasing quick things here and there, you’re absolutely going to have nothing to show for it after 18 months.”

Varni explains that you can have a big bang theory and pitch something big, expensive, and risky and see if your company will go for it, but she suggests positioning ideas as pilots — content plans that you’re just going to try out, invest in strategically, and grow with patience.

This strategy can work for direct marketing, and it can work for demand generation, which she believes too many people look at through a short, immediate lens. Demand generation is metrics-driven, so analytics are important. But it’s crucial to not get bogged down in the numbers that will only allow you to see a short-term equation. Doing that often leads to an over-reliance on things you know work rather than risk-taking that could have a greater impact.

“Sometimes the most analytical people are not always the best people at seeing demand gen so broadly,” Varni says. “The best demand gen people are always tuned into their audience and think about how to create the best content or channels. That takes a mix of being analytical but also having the vision of seeing it might not pay off on the spreadsheet tomorrow, but in a year or a year and a half you’ll look up and say, ‘Wow.’”

## Plan, plan, plan

“People waste money when they don’t plan,” Varni says. “A failure to plan can create this death by 1,000 cuts scenario, where it might not feel that bad in the moment, but over the course of a campaign it can really add up and you see ways you could have been more efficient.”

When thinking about a campaign, it’s best to lay out every aspect of what you want to accomplish and formulate a plan to execute every detail.

But keep in mind that you don’t want to make things too formal or cookie-cutter. As much as possible, Varni says, customize your content to your customer. And be aware of the language you’re using. Write like you talk, she says. For example, if you’d never say “furthermore” (which, let’s be honest, no one says “furthermore”) why would you write that in any of your content marketing or say it during a presentation?

# This Is Why Cold Emails Are the Best Business Practice for Entrepreneurs

## 

Cold emailing has a bit of a bad rap, often due to the plethora of [poorly written marketing emails](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/your-marketing-emails-stink-but-these-10-tips-will-make-them-better-infographic.html) people receive. That leaves many reluctant to give it a try. But, it’s actually a powerful tool in any entrepreneur’s arsenal, as long as it’s used properly (and doesn’t amount to [begging](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-to-raise-money-without-begging-investors.html)). Personally, I’ve had a response rate of approximately 1 in 5 with cold emailing, which is higher than a typical opt-in email campaign.

To take advantage of what cold emailing has to offer, you have to [let go of your fear](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/7-deadly-fears-entrepreneurs-must-overcome-to-be-successful.html). Think about it, what’s the worst that can happen by sending a cold email? They don’t respond? In the grand scheme of things, that’s nothing, so don’t let that hold you back.

If you’re ready to take the leap, here’s what you need to know.

## Mastering the Cold Email

Ultimately, a stellar cold email is based on [creating a connection](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/what-startup-investors-look-for-before-investing.html), and that usually means that a hard sell approach isn’t the way to go. People get bombarded by sales emails, so being too blatant isn’t going to get their attention.

Instead, focus on what you can offer them, not what they can do for you. Ask them to contribute to a blog piece or a chance to be interviewed or focus on the opportunity to interview for a great job. Anything that shows them that they personally benefit from responding can do the trick, so keep that mindset when you write the email.

You also want to make your story compelling in its own right. Make sure to highlight your (or your company’s) reputation, add tidbits about your prior successes, anything to draw them in that demonstrates your value. Make an effort to avoid [phrases that can kill your credibility](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/15-credibility-killing-phrases-to-banish-from-your-vocabulary.html), such as “hopefully” or “if that makes sense,” so that you establish yourself as a confident authority on the matter.

It should also be customized to the recipient. People can spot a canned email from a mile away, and they suggest you didn’t bother to take the time to learn about the person, which will hurt your response rates.

And, for a cold email to work, it really should be an email and not contact through a web form or even their social media page.

I can hear you now: “How do I send them an email if their email address isn’t publicly available?”

Luckily, most professional emails are easy to guess, especially since businesses generally use the same format, often involving portions of the person’s first and last name. If you can find just one example of how the company formats their email addresses, you likely have the key to all of them.

Here are some situations where cold emailing can be the ideal approach

## Business Development

If you’re looking for an investor or partner for your business ventures, it’s incredibly unlikely they are going to reach out to you; you need to do the work to get their attention.

During the early stages of my start-up venture, when I was out chasing down the VC unicorns in the area, I pitched to over 100 firms and landed dozens of meetings. While my initial attempts at [attracting investments from VCs](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/the-best-amp-worst-ways-to-connect-with-vcs.html) weren’t successful, and I ended up with piles of rejection letters, they did lead to my success.

First, the rejection gave me incredible insights into what I was doing wrong, as well as how I could change my approach. I became smarter, not just about how to use these communications to reach my goals, but also how to take more informed chances.

Plus, these emails opened doors that wouldn’t have otherwise been available. Sure, they may have rejected my request, but they answered. That means I had a point-of-contact, allowing me to track my rejections, utilize the feedback, and keep those who expressed a genuine interest (and not necessarily the [non-believers](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/the-one-type-of-vc-you-dont-want-in-your-life.html)) posted on my forward progress.

I let them know every time I took a significant step forward, showing them that I could pull myself up by the proverbial bootstraps and keep pushing.

Ultimately, my [Series A fundraising efforts](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/4-things-learn-from-investor-rejection-letters.html) yielded $4 million in investments, largely because I embraced cold emailing and used every subsequent response to make me better.

## Recruiting

In the vast majority of cases, the most exceptional candidates aren’t going to apply to posts on job boards. Why? Because they already have jobs.

While it’s true that many job seekers are currently employed, the best and brightest unicorns in the bunch aren’t always actively on the hunt for new opportunities. But, that doesn’t mean they wouldn’t be interested in your vacant role, if they learn about it.

That means being proactive is a must. You have to go out of your way to reach out to these individuals, and that typically involves a cold email.

If you locate a great candidate, you need to reach out by email, even if you find them on LinkedIn or another social network, as this approach may have a better success rate.

## Networking

We all know that networking is a powerful tool; forging connections with like-minded individuals, professionals that you admire, and various [thought-leaders](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/20-digital-marketing-experts-to-follow-on-twitter.html) can give you access to insights that may not have otherwise come about, future business prospects, and even help when you face a challenge that leaves you stumped.

If there is another entrepreneur, professional, or another person that could provide value, don’t wait to reach out, hoping you’ll cross paths one day. Instead, initiate contact by sending an email.

A simple invitation to a business lunch, speaking engagement, or another meeting of the minds can be a gateway to a meaningful professional relationship; all you have to do is send it.

As mentioned above, make sure you focus on what they have to gain from saying “yes,” and not just what you want from them. A person is more likely to agree if they can see the value too, so figure out what could benefit their business or career, and find a suitable correlation between both of your goals before you present an option.

## Is Cold Emailing Everything?

Is cold emailing the answer to reaching all of your business goals? It’s hard to say. The point is, you shouldn’t ignore the option just because other technologies have taken the spotlight.

Cold emailing can be incredibly effective, so it should be considered a best business practice for entrepreneurs. Add it to your collection of tools by letting go of your fear of people saying “no” and give yourself a chance to experience how powerful cold email can be yourself. It may just surprise you.

# I Wrote 4 Blog Posts Every Week For A Year. Best Investment I’ve Ever Made.

## Image Credit: Unsplash

There are so many things you can do with your time. Many of you are probably thinking that any form of writing is the worst.

Writing is one of the lowest paid professions in existence. From the outside, you’d think nothing good could come from it.

Well, I thought that as well. That was until I ran a one year experiment. 
The objective was simple: Write 4 short blog posts a week for one year.

### Here’s why it’s the best investment I’ve ever made:

## You discover yourself in the process.

The one year process started out with me trying to win in the new ‘Attention Economy.’ I quickly realized this was an empty promise.

When you start anything with the goal of getting attention, you end up with none. *Why?* Because it becomes all about you and no one gives a damn about that.
> # “Through my one year experiment, I learned more about myself than the topics I chose to write about”

When I edited my own work, I saw pieces of myself scattered through the words.

Those pieces often never showed up in my own mind. I had to dig them out of my head like I was digging for treasure. This self-discovery process showed me who I was, and more importantly, who I could become.

One blog post at a time I discovered more about myself. I never expected this to come from writing 4 blog posts a week.

## You see yourself through a different lens.

When I’d think of who I was, in my own mind, I was bloody Rocky Balboa.

Through writing 4 blogs a week, I saw myself differently. That was because I had to extract ideas that would help others. Any idea that was selfishly about me or my ego would not suffice.

Having to give everything I had for someone else’s benefit was a strange reality. I saw a few things:

* I could be really selfish

* My beliefs about money were flawed

* I’d collected too many possessions over the years

* I’d hidden my true self away from many problems

## You can’t teach others unless you teach yourself first.

My goal online was to inspire the world through personal development and entrepreneurship.

The fucked thing was I couldn’t do that unless I learned first.

I couldn’t tell people to love themselves first if I didn’t.
I couldn’t tell people to be kind if I was being selfish. 
I couldn’t explain what it’s like to live a minimalist life if I didn’t myself. 
I couldn’t inspire people if I wasn’t inspired.

**Every lesson I wanted to teach required me to go first.** I had to be the leader and take the plunge. This meant doing some crazy sh*t.

* Overcoming a fear of flying and public speaking

* Forgiving family members who I hadn’t spoken with for years

* Volunteering at several homeless shelters

* Coming to grips with the startup failure I’d endured
> **The cool thing about teaching is that you get to go first. You get to practice what you preach.**

## You learn to collaborate.

The effectiveness of your writing is often lost if no one gets to read it. I had to learn to get others to share my four blog posts a week with their audience.

This meant learning how to pitch. 
This meant understanding the concept of mutual value.

What was even weirder is that these collaborations turned into friendships. People like [Anthony Moore](https://medium.com/@anthony_moore) became my friend and we helped each other. When he got fired, I reached out to him to offer assistance.

When I had an article written about me that was unfavourable, to say the least, he stepped in and gave me some practical solutions.

**Writing 4 times a week is not about being alone. What I learned is that it’s about the people you get to meet.**

## Random emails became normal.

I’m not talking about the spam ones either.

The cool thing about writing 4 blog posts a week was that people would email me and say hi (partly because I made my email address public).

Well, it wasn’t just hi. People would email me wanting advice or to share their story. Many of the stories people shared, I re-purposed into blog posts and LinkedIn updates.
> # “I became, in some ways, the voice of the unspoken”
> As humans, we crave connection and that’s what writing gave me. The chance to connect and get outside of my own little world which used to be startups, money and bullshit.

## You get the chance to help others.

Okay, this is not a hallelujah moment where we all clap our hands and talk about helping each other.

**I was the first to think that this corny idea was what fake people said so they could sign you up to their $9 a month program that will ‘Change your life!’**

Writing 4 blog posts a week made me see more than ever how similar our problems are. Many people that wrote to me had the same issues that I’d gone through and felt lost.

I remember feeling lost as well. That’s why, when I found a way to help others through sharing my own story, it changed my perspective on helping others.

Helping others is not about some unselfish goal that only those who had an immaculate conception get to do. Helping others is a by-product of a human existence. We’re all wired to help each other and we get off on it.
> # “Helping others through 4 blog posts a week was the right thing to do. It was a natural progression from the scared, little, selfish boy I used to be”

## You evolve through your own words.

Words shape our entire human experience. How we see the world is described through the words we consciously choose to share our thoughts.
> My words, in the beginning, were nothing short of boring. I was not one bit inspirational, emotional or interesting. I was mostly dry and lifeless in the words I used.

Through practice and the natural habit of reading that comes from wanting to write better, I found my voice. That voice was rough around the edges, conversational, afraid at times and authentically me.

![Image Credit: [OXME.info](http://oxme.info/cms/news/oxfordshire-county-council-takeover-day-2016)](1*x5bzFA29YzFwb42M8P759A.jpeg)*Image Credit: [OXME.info](http://oxme.info/cms/news/oxfordshire-county-council-takeover-day-2016)*

I evolved through my words by just being me. The focus on what other people thought of my sometimes controversial words didn’t matter to me. At the start it did. At the start, I was petrified of being publicly shamed.

Part of the evolution of my words was that I understood one simple truth:
If your aim is to inspire people, spread positivity and do what is good for other humans, then you’ll be fine.

## How attainable is this?

That’s what you’re probably thinking. Well if you turn off Netflix more often and spend 3 x 1-hour sessions a week writing on your laptop, I think it’s very achievable.

*Isn’t learning about who you could become more important than TV?*

You don’t have to reach millions of people to write 4 times a week or have an expensive website with lead boxes, email opt-in newsletters and the latest SEO tricks.

You just have to show the world who you are — without the mask.

# The 11 Questions That Will Help You Solve Any Problem

## 

When confronted with an unforeseen problem, many people’s first internal response is to think, “I don’t know what to do.”

But the truth is, we almost always know more about how to solve a problem than we initially admit.

I discovered this while coaching kids in robotics competitions, where I’m always trying to find new ways to help them develop reasoning abilities. When something goes wrong with one of the robots, and I ask what happened, the kids often tell me, “I don’t know.”

As an adult, the easiest way to handle this is simply to tell them the answer and move on.

That solution can certainly be tempting — especially after a long day of competition — but it doesn’t help the team improve their reasoning skills.

Instead, I ask the kids a set of questions I found in the book *Getting to Got It!* by Betty K. Garner.
> ***These questions act as focusing tools to help the team slow down, zone in on what they know, and think about the different aspects of the problem at hand.***

And here’s the thing — the questions can be useful for anyone. After asking kids these questions hundreds of times, they started becoming an ordinary part of my everyday reasoning ability.

I found that they work just as well in business situations or everyday life. I even noticed myself running through them the other day while working on a problem with my team.

Here are the questions and how to put them to use:

## **1. What sense do you make of this?**

If you notice a problem and ask the people involved, “What happened?” you’re often going to be told, “I don’t know.”

But asking “What sense do you make of this?” is a great way to get around that initial reaction. It forces everyone to think about the problem and the potential paths forward.

I’ve found this one works especially well with kids. Something about the wording makes them pause and start [thinking more acutely](https://theascent.pub/the-real-reason-why-people-cant-concentrate-and-what-to-do-about-it-5976c40a81db?source=user_profile---------22------------------) about the situation.

## **2. What questions can you think of?**

When we’re faced with a difficult problem, it can be tempting to write the whole thing off as one big, unsolvable question.

Instead, it’s better to spend time thinking about some of the smaller aspects of the larger problem. Try to answer the specific questions you have regarding what’s happened so far.

As you start answering smaller questions, the larger problem often comes into focus.

## **3. What part do you know for sure?**

This is the most important question of the bunch because it gets you from the “I don’t know” response to a more nuanced, “Okay, I do know some things.”

I’ve found this question to be very helpful when working with teams. You can actually see people’s “aha” moment when they realize they do know at least something about what went wrong.

And once they’re focused on what they *do* know, they can begin to build a strategy for dealing with the unknowns.

## **4. What part do you understand?**

This question moves you beyond what you’ve just established you know for certain. It prompts you to consider what areas of the problem you understand, and those you’re still unsure about.
> It’s a question that can lead you to some unexpected ideas.

For instance, an aspect you don’t understand may turn out to be surprisingly interesting. And you may end up learning much more than you anticipated as you begin exploring the issue.

## **5. What do you notice?**

This can help you figure out why something didn’t work the way it was supposed to.

At the robotics competition, it works well when the kids have to debug an issue. These aren’t industrial grade robots, so there’s plenty of room for error to occur. For example, one of the competitions was based around using the robots to deliver food to miniature models of people. The primary problem was navigating the obstacles in the robot’s path — using light sensors, gyro sensors, or another method.
> # When something does goes wrong, asking people what they notice is another great way to get them around the “I don’t know” trap.

They always notice something. Even if it’s a simple observation, it gives them a starting point to work from. And the same goes for any other challenge.

You may not know exactly how to start solving a problem, but you can get the gears turning by identifying what you initially see.

## **6. What kind of pattern do you notice?**

When you’re working towards a solution, sometimes there will be obstacles that require multiple attempts to overcome. When things don’t work the first time, you have to iterate and figure out what to try next.

Identifying patterns in your attempts to problem-solve is a good way to figure out what’s working and what may be holding you back.

## **7. What do you wish was easier?**

Here’s a question that also works [to focus your mind](https://medium.com/the-mission/what-to-focus-on-when-executing-a-business-deal-even-if-it-seems-counter-intuitive-980ecadbb055) on individual portions of the problem and potential solutions.

With it, you’re identifying pain points and setting yourself on a course to solve them.

In the robotics competitions, this is a good way to help point the kids towards a solution without simply telling them where to look. There are always things they wish were easier and would like to solve for.

## **8. Why?**

The follow up is a very basic question, “Why do wish it was easier?”

This question helps you clarify your thought process and relate your earlier desire to something more concrete. Think about why it would be better if this aspect of the problem was easier.

## **9. What did you understand the question to be?**

Sometimes, roadblocks to problem solving are caused by misinterpreting the mission or the goal.
> Thinking back to what you originally saw as the question to be answered can help you identify whether or not you’ve been moving down the right path.

If you realize you fundamentally misunderstood [the goal of a project](https://artplusmarketing.com/how-to-accomplish-goals-when-you-have-no-idea-where-to-start-cffcf2040467?source=user_profile---------21------------------), you can still go back to square one and begin again with your new perspective.

## **10. If you were going to explain this to someone in your own words, how would you say it?**

It’s helpful to think about how you would explain the problem to someone with no knowledge of the situation.

Talking about the problem in your own voice is a good way to clarify your thoughts, and it can potentially lead you to new ways of examining the situation. You might be surprised at how many new ideas and interesting thoughts you come up with as you explain a problem to someone else.

## **11. If you did know, what would you say?**

I ask the kids I coach this question when they respond to a question by telling me, “I don’t know.”

It may not work every time, but it’s another way of getting around that initial shrug. Sometimes you can put yourself on the right track to finding a solution by acting as if you already know it.

Often, the standard response of, “I don’t know,” comes from a lack of confidence in our own skills or ability to reason through an issue.

When faced with a tough problem, working through some — or all — of these questions can help guide you toward a solution and build confidence in your problem-solving skills.

# A Seven-Time CIO’s Advice for First Time CIOs

## 

The world of business is moving faster than ever. With the growing demand of technology to help do more with less, IT departments are feeling increased pressure to build digital networks able to meet aggressive business goals. Most, if not all, of the responsibility falls on the CIO, and at times, it can be challenging to navigate the day-to-day operations of an IT department.

Mark Settle is a seven-time CIO with broad business experience in information services, enterprise software, consumer products, high tech distribution, financial services, and oil & gas. He has received multiple industry awards and is a three-time CIO 100 Honoree. Mark is the author of [*Truth from the Trenches: A Practical Guide to the Art of IT Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0BJ4GF/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), *a CIO.com contributor, and currently CIO of [Okta](https://twitter.com/okta).

We had a chance to sit down with Mark on [an episode of *IT Visionaries](https://itvisionaries.co/Mark-Settles-Playbook-for-New-CIOs/)* where he shared his playbook on how to be an effective CIO. Here are some key points from our conversation.

## **What’s the Cash Flow?**

Mark’s first rule for any CIO involves money — and not just dollars and cents. You have to know how it’s flowing.
> # **“As a CIO, you have to understand where the money is going in your company. A lot of your credibility with your peers is based on this.”**

## **The Comfort Zone Limits Innovation**

Mark’s second rule for any CIO involves the importance of encouraging your team to step outside their comfort zone to drive innovation and push the limits.
> # **“You need to get your team out of their comfort zone. If you don’t start giving people special assignments outside of their role, they won’t grow.”**

## **It’s Okay To Be Quiet**

As the CIO, you have streams of information at your fingertips. It’s your job to understand all that information, and oftentimes, you may feel compelled to tell everyone what you know. Mark warns against this.
> # ***“If you’re a first time CIO, you sometimes feel like you have to prove you are the smartest person in the room. That’s not going to lead to much insight from other folks in the room. You have to be disciplined not always to have the first word or control the last topic on any debate.”***

## **Innovate Together**

Another thing Mark emphasizes is the importance of innovation as a team. Innovation and brainstorming have to involve everyone, including management. As a CIO, you need to understand where your product or service is heading so that you can provide your team with what’s required to move forward.
> # ***“Innovation should be a team sport; the whole management team should know what all the balls are that we’re juggling that are moving from stage-to-stage.”***

## **His Final Point**

For any first time CIO’s reading this, here is Mark’s one piece of advice that has helped him thrive in IT:
> # ***“Be decisive. Don’t wait too long to make changes.”***

Mark’s book, [*Truth from the Trenches: A Practical Guide to the Art of IT Management](https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Trenches-Practical-Guide-Management/dp/1629561932)*, is a tried and true guide for anyone working in IT. The pace of technological innovation is only increasing, and the IT department is expected to move just as quickly. But with smaller budgets and limited support from the business, it’s becoming more difficult for CIOs, CTO, and managers to meet that expectation.

You can [check out Mark’s book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Trenches-Practical-Guide-Management/dp/1629561932) and listen to the full interview on [*IT Visionaries](https://itvisionaries.co/Mark-Settles-Playbook-for-New-CIOs/)*.

# 7 PROFOUND TAKEAWAYS for Life & Business from "The Alchemist"

## The Pursuit of Your Personal Treasure

![](0*h4KqduxatJyGAAlU)
> # A man sets out on a journey, dreaming of a beautiful or magical place, in pursuit of some unknown treasure. At the end of the journey, the man realizes the treasure was with him the entire time.

![](0*z88r9AUNux5zmXdW.jpg)

### **A Note from “The Alchemist” author, Paulo Coelho, to the Reader:**

*All I knew was that I wanted to write about my soul. I wanted to write about my quest to find my treasure.*

![Paulo Coelho is one of the bestselling & most influential authors in the world. He was born in Brazil, 1947.](0*j6KcqiyZpwAtXB-R.jpg)*Paulo Coelho is one of the bestselling & most influential authors in the world. He was born in Brazil, 1947.*

## 7 PROFOUND TAKEAWAYS for Life & Business

*From “The Alchemist”*

### 1) Recognize the Good

*“When each day is the same as the next, it’s because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.”*

### 2) To Each Their Own

*“Everyone has his or her way of learning things. His way isn’t the same as mine, nor mine as his, but we’re both in search of our personal treasure and I respect him for that.”*

### 3) CARPE DIEM

*“How do I guess at the future? Based on…the present. The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better.”*

### 4) Have No Fear

*“Here he was, face-to-face with his enemy, but there was no need to be concerned.”*

### 5) Take Action

*“There is only one way to learn…through action. When others tried to make gold and failed it was because they were ONLY looking for gold. They were seeking their personal treasure without wanting actually to live out the personal legend.”*

### 6) It’s Not All Perfect

*“It’s like the flight of those two hawks; it can’t be understood by reason alone. The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise. The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect.”*

### 7) Try, Try, & Try Again

*“There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve…the fear of failure. But what if you fail? Then at least you die in the midst of trying to realize your personal legend. That’s a lot better than the millions of others who die never really knowing what their personal legends were.”*

# We’re moving our family to a Thai island

## We’re moving our family to a Thai island

‘*Comfort kills ambition*’ so the saying goes. Well, I’m not sure we’d describe our life — 3 children in 3 years and startups a plenty — as quiet, but we reached a breathing moment this summer where we thought, why not change it up?

(Read my wife’s *slightly different* [version](https://medium.com/@benkeene/a-mums-perspective-on-moving-her-family-to-thailand-7c3c81a8922e?source=linkShare-b015b854ef06-1537262463) of the decision making process).

The push factors in the decision weren’t strong but they were growing. We were struggling to sell our house and so had no fixed plans of ‘where next’ might be. Our eldest daughter was due to start school, but none of our children are yet immersed in their education. I am still enjoying my work helping people start their businesses at [Escape the City](http://escapethecity.org) but the programme is now in a strong place for others to take it forward (and my late nights and weekends in London aren’t so popular at home).

But the moment the idea settled in my mind was on holiday this summer. Two weeks into a digital detox and I was clearly getting withdrawal symptoms whilst scrolling through my wife’s instagram (it wasn’t my phone so it didn’t count)…and I stumbled across this:

![[Escaping Escape!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/baqcmjjous25h6a/Screenshot%202018-08-31%2013.21.43.png?dl=0)](1*0sb8JWiZi-rnt38CwyxtJg.png)*[Escaping Escape!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/baqcmjjous25h6a/Screenshot%202018-08-31%2013.21.43.png?dl=0)*

Either the team were trying to get me to quit through an indirect coded message (unlikely I hope!) or I needed to pay attention to the message I’d been spreading for the last few years: *Good things happen outside your comfort zone.*

So what was uncomfortable about the idea of ‘escaping escape’ and doing something different? Leaving behind a financially secure income, a job I know I can do, a great team and community, a lot of fun, autonomy in how and where I work and so on. So lots, really.

But…BUT…**BUT…**enter stage right Mr Mark Twain:
> # *“20 years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than the ones you did.”*

The idea of stepping away felt uncomfortable but also appealing because of the power of *‘What if….?’*

*If* I wasn’t committed to running the [Startup Accelerator](https://www.escapethecity.org/startup-accelerator/) programmes in London over the coming year and we don’t sell our house and Isla wasn’t tied into a school…then where and what might we do together? And that’s where the real fun begins.

### What were our decision making criteria for our family escape?

1. **Fast Wifi**: Sounds funny to put this as a priority but it is! With fast wifi so much is possible. Something that was particularly challenging when we first started [Tribewanted](http://tribewanted.com) in Fiji ([I used to have to run up a hill with a blackberry to answer all the emails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZfkCFR_4XQ)). Now it’s different as you can quickly narrow down your digitally connected destinations.

![](1*sWA9RPeVPx69INoK7IVQHw.jpeg)

We searched [Nomad List](http://nomadlist.com) (Generation X’s ‘Lonely Planet’), Google Earth and our own travel experiences and came up with three possibilities:

**Back to Bali**: great for startups, adventures, and the amazing Green School but felt like it might be too busy (and distracting for my work) &gt; ‘too big’

**Southern Sri Lanka**: surf, yoga, and schools but wifi too slow and not much non-city startup communities &gt; ‘too small’

**Koh Lanta, Thailand**: a village-feel international school, a great co-working community, and an island and cultural adventure &gt; ‘just right’

**The remaining criteria that made Koh Lanta the most compelling:**

**2. A Local, International School: **The [Global Village School Lanta](https://www.gvslanta.com/) is a small, friendly and welcoming community (from our experience chatting to the teachers and parents online so far). It’s somewhere where we hope both Isla and Mali can enjoy their educational adventures!

**3. Lots of Nature & Adventure:** So many places to explore…but being just off the beaten path of the popular Thai-Andaman sea and with the [Mu Ko Lanta National Park](https://www.thainationalparks.com/mu-ko-lanta-national-park) to discover, Koh Lanta feels like the right balance of well-connected island life and exciting local expeditions.

**4. Affordable:** Although life in Thailand will be cheaper than the UK, we have factored in costs for 5 of us for travel (flights, new passports, visas, immunisations, insurances), a local vehicle (not all of us can fit on a moped), school fees and some expenses to cover at home. Living on Koh Lanta will cost us about half of what it does in the UK but with these other outgoings factored in, it will be, we’ve forecasted, about 20% less. We’ll keep you posted if it’s dramatically different!

**5. Endless Summer: **Will it be sunnier and warmer than a long English winter? Good, we’re on our way.

**6. Cultural Change:** Although the island is clearly a tourism destination (which we’ll be part of even though we intend to stay longer than 2 weeks) it appears to have retained a lot of the local culture and pace of life. It will be interesting to see if this remains the case during peak season (December-March).

7. **Safety**: Good communications, clinics and hospitals, access to town/airport etc — is important to us with young children. Koh Lanta appears to have it all setup.

### **Other factors for going now…**

**Exit before Brexit**: The news bubble is like a grey cloud of confusion hanging over our country. Everyone’s mixed up in it, whether they want to be or not — so we realised the only way to lift the fog is to escape for a while (plus I’m curious to see how the human, economic & technological growth in South East Asia is panning out).

**We are the lucky ones**: More positively, it never ceases to amaze me the huge variety of opportunities we have today to live, work and travel. The risk is we don’t take them.

![Telling Isla, Mali & Jack we’re moving to ‘an island’ with a little help from Moana & Maui (I know, not totally culturally & geographically accurate but it helped them understand/get over-excited)](1*pDCs8shQvdYSpAtdiDCtFA.jpeg)*Telling Isla, Mali & Jack we’re moving to ‘an island’ with a little help from Moana & Maui (I know, not totally culturally & geographically accurate but it helped them understand/get over-excited)*

## So what about work?

A lot of people line-up ‘the next job’ before they quit their previous role, let alone book flights to the other side of the world for their whole family. I tend to find that a little (or a lot) of commitment to the next stage helps you focus so much better. The danger, otherwise, is that you entertain the idea without ever going for it. I’ve felt that at times too.

Anyway, now I’m focused (we’re leaving on October 2nd) and so here’s my project plan for life on Koh Lanta:

[**Rebel Book Club](http://rebelbookclub.co.uk)**: A side project I’ve been running with a [friend](https://www.instagram.com/bsaulgarner/) I met in Bali in 2015. We’ve built a wonderful little community of 300 ‘rebel readers’ in London (and now in Oxford) who read one non-fiction book a month (we’re up to 40), and meet-up to enjoy a book-inspired cocktail and discussion.

[**Tribe Builders](http://tribebuilders.co): **A new project to help founders maintain momentum post-launch. All too often, great ideas and hard work stall after the initial excitement. My plan is to build a membership community supporting each other to complete their monthly tasks and feel like they’re part of a bigger team. [Apply now](https://www.tribebuilders.co/) for our first batch of memberships (being released October 2018).

Alongside this I’ll be coaching/mentoring entrepreneurs through [Virgin Startup](http://virginstartup.org), [THNK](http://thnk.org) & [Zinc](http://zinc.vc).

**The Remote Family**: Considering setting something up [here](https://www.instagram.com/theremotefamily/) to help other families do what we’re doing. I think we need to have the experience first!

**Other Projects:** I’m interested in collaborating and helping (remotely) on new opportunities too: startups, education, social impact. [Get in contact if you think I can help.](mailto:ben@tribewanted.com)

[**Escape the City](http://escapethecity.org)**: Although I won’t be working on Escape projects in London in the near future, we have a fantastic new startup team in place to help lots more people get their ideas out into the world. Escapees, you are in the best hands with [Skye Robertson](https://twitter.com/skyebird), [Jonny Miller](https://twitter.com/jonnym1ller), [Matthew Trinetti](https://twitter.com/trinetti) and the team for the next round of accelerators. A big thank you to Dom, Skye, Mia and all the ‘escapees’ I’ve met for a really fantastic few years. You’ve inspired us to do this! I know you understand this decision more than most.

[**Reiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiki)**: My talented wife and co-pilot in life, Susannah, has recently qualified as a Level 2 Reiki Practitioner. When not caring for, feeding, or nurturing our ‘Keene Beans’, her interest in holistic and natural medicine is something she hopes to explore more of in Thailand.

![Beach School: Isla & Mali’s new classroom](1*sxddTg4eRFFCSA2pKNsg-g.png)*Beach School: Isla & Mali’s new classroom*

### Join us

We leave in early October and plan to stay in and around Southern Thailand for the next 9 months to see how Isla and Mali get on with their new school and how we get on living and working as a family in a different part of the world.

We hope people will say hello if you’re heading to that part of Thailand or even better, make an excuse to come out over the European winter.

I will be sharing the ups and downs of the experience (family life, remote work & travel etc..) on this blog and [instagram](http://instagram.com/tribebuilder).

เจอกันใหม่ (hopefully on Koh Lanta)

# The 4 Pillars of Good Writing

## Photo by Sara Santandrea on Unsplash

Which hard skill do recent college grads lack the most? In 2016, PayScale.com [asked](https://www.payscale.com/about/press-releases/payscale-and-future-workplace-release-2016-workforce-skills-preparedness-report) employers this question. The top response was “writing proficiency.”

Wow. Our education system teaches few practical skills, but it does emphasize writing. So what gives? Incompetent teachers? Unteachable students?

Actually, the problem for many college graduates is having absorbed their academic training all too well. The challenge for them is to unlearn the bad writing habits picked up from 16-plus years of school.

Doing so takes the right approach, but it also takes work. An article can’t teach you good writing. At best, it can teach you how to teach yourself to write well. So, I won’t offer much style advice. Instead, I’ll explain the mentalities and practices that are most fundamental for becoming a good writer, and that are also most missing among young writers, as I’ve found as an editor and writing coach.

## 1. Give Your Readers a Good Experience

As a student writer, your job was to perform according to specifications. A successful essay was one that jumped through the right hoops as defined by the assignment requirements and grading rubrics. It also demonstrated that you had done the reading and attended the lectures.

But as a real-world writer, you’re now in the experience business. Your job is to show your readers a good time: to intrigue and inspire, to enlighten and engross, to please and provoke. You’re a dealer in fascinating ideas and satisfying arguments, a purveyor of a-ha moments and epiphanies.

Now you’re writing for readers, not graders. Real-world audiences are looking for a good experience, not a “correct” performance.

## 2. Read More, Especially Stuff You Love

But to offer a good experience, you must be able to recognize one. Every good chef is to some extent a connoisseur. Similarly, to be a good writer, you need to be a discriminating reader. To produce quality writing, you must be able to appreciate it when you read it and to distinguish it from mediocre or poor writing.

How does one become a connoisseur of food? Through practice: eating a lot of dishes, especially delicious ones. How does one become a connoisseur of words? Again, through practice: reading a lot of books and articles, especially ones you love. To be a good writer, you need to be an avid reader.

College students read a lot. Why doesn’t that make them good writers? The problem here is that it is mostly compulsory. There is no space to seek and discover what kind of reading experiences you love if all your reading time is taken up with stuff you are assigned. You cannot make someone a connoisseur by force-feeding them.

Your reading diet needs to be voluntary if it is going to help you figure out the kind of writing you love. Find a topic you are curious about, look for some well-reviewed titles on Amazon, and dive in.

I myself only blossomed as a writer after I rediscovered my long-lost love of reading. And that only happened after I graduated from college and was no longer tied down to a syllabus.

My first post-grad reading love affair was with books about history. I became obsessed with learning the story of human civilization, from ancient Mesopotamia to the present. Through pursuing this passion, I developed a discriminating taste for history writing.

Later, I started writing historical vignettes of my own. These were published on a major website and garnered admiring comments from readers. This was my debut as a published writer.

It was only after being able to recognize excellent history writing that I was able to produce it myself.

## 3. Edit Until You Enjoy It

In your first draft, when you are initially hammering out your sentences, good taste will be of some help. But where it really makes a difference is in self-editing.

Be picky with your own prose. Demand quality. Now that you know what you like, go back and edit your own writing until you enjoy reading it: ideally until you love it.

Rearrange sections to ensure a logical flow. Reword awkward phrases. Add creative flourishes, like a vivid metaphor or a delightful turn of phrase. Make the wording musical to your mind’s ear. Tweak and fine-tune. Take as many editing passes as needed to carve the piece into something you’re proud of.

Above all, prune. If you’ve recently graduated from college, your writing is probably way too wordy. Minimum word counts have trained you to pad your prose.

Here’s a worthwhile exercise: next time you write something, try cutting its word count in half. Comb through every passage and ruthlessly delete anything that doesn’t clearly contribute value to the piece.

Is that paragraph a digression? Remove it. Would your meaning be clear without that adverb? Zap it. All that verbal foliage will only drag the reading experience down. Once you trim it away, your piece will be much more brisk and enjoyable.

## 4. Actually Write

No amount of tips and tricks will make you a good writer. It is not a matter of adopting the right formula or following an expert’s dos and don’ts. Ultimately, it’s up to you to teach yourself how to write well through experience and self-evaluation. Most best practices can only be learned through actual practice.

And as with any form of training, you have to get your reps in. The more frequently you write, the faster you’ll improve as a writer. Start a blog with [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) or [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/). Challenge yourself to write and click publish every day for a month.

Share your posts on social media. Occasionally review your older posts and notice how your writing has evolved. Identify flaws that seem to be persisting or virtues that seem to be missing. Push yourself to improve every week. If you do that for a month, you are certain to be a much better writer than when you began.

Why not start today?

# How do you make it as a creator? You walk through fire, that’s how.

## How do you make it as a creator? You walk through fire, that’s how.

Sometimes people ask me about how to make it as a creator. They’re looking for the safe path, the sure bet.

How can they seamlessly transition from their day job, to making a living making their art?

I don’t have the answer they want to hear.

Imagine your child is in a burning building.

Your art is your child. Your life is the burning building.

With every second that passes, the fire renders another point of entry impossible to navigate. That window is covered in flames, or a supporting beam is blocking that hallway.

It becomes increasingly difficult to save your child. At some point, the whole thing will collapse, and it will be too late.

You can wait for the authorities to come. You’ll be safe, but your child may perish in the fire. Your physical body will be fine, but you’ll always wonder what you could have done.

So this is what you do if you want to save your child — this is what you do if you want to make a living making your art: You walk through fire.

Yes, if you choose a safe route — one where you do your thing on the side with whatever tiny bit of energy you have leftover after getting home from your 9-to-5, and then you hope that you can replace that income before smoothly transitioning—you’ll be okay, but your art may never see the light of day.

I’m not saying that it can’t be done. I’m saying this is the only way I know.

I’m also not talking about some kind of artistic compromise—like you’ve transitioned to doing freelance work, but you’re trying to get that out of the way so you can do what you *really* want to be doing.

I’m talking about this situation: You both don’t know exactly what your art is, *and* you don’t have a clue how you’ll get paid doing it.

What constitutes “walking through fire?” It’s something different for everyone. Here’s my path, starting post-college:

* **Develop a financial runway: **Three years of eating [80-cent Banquet meals](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/10-years/), while sitting in a gray cubicle in Nebraska. Invest all savings in the stock market.

* **Learn to think differently:** Three years in Silicon Valley.

* **Go your own way:** [Cash out](https://medium.com/startup-grind/my-40-000-diy-mba-a95142fd29e2) a year’s worth of living expenses from the stock portfolio. Leave Silicon Valley in the midst of a boom, with job offers for more money than you’ve ever made nipping at your tail.

* **Search for “it”:** Three years experimenting in a cheap Chicago apartment. This is how I found the idea for my [first book](http://designforhackers.com).

* **Pursue “it”:** Six years of marketing and developing around my first book, as well as more experimentation. You’re still not making as much money as those Silicon Valley job offers promised.

* **Double down on the second wave of “it”:** Cut out loose ends in your business. [Move](https://medium.com/the-mission/yes-you-can-leave-the-north-america-bubble-a72f8d3aa583) to a “third world” country to design your life around your craft.

* **Make it (?):** After three years of “doubling down,” [one of your books](http://geni.us/F6eL) [takes off](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/july-2018-income-report/). Maybe you’ve made it by now?

It’s different for everyone, even the above doesn’t work without some lucky breaks. The main point is, you’ll do whatever it takes, however long it takes. With a little overlap on these events, that’s about a sixteen-year process.

How do you know if a path like this is right for you? It all depends upon your answer to this question: If that building comes tumbling down, with your “child” in it, will you be able to live with yourself?

# David And Goliath

## 

This is the story about a man who tried to get the largest business in his industry to buy half his business. Lucky for him they laughed him out of the room.

**This is an episode of [*The Story](https://apple.co/2G0hs4l)* podcast. You can listen to an audio version of the following story on [iTunes](https://apple.co/2KnbUQF) or [Google Play](http://bit.ly/2Mp9H7F).**

## And now… onto [The Story](http://thestorypodcast.com)

David was giving his pitch to Goliath on why they should invest and partner.

“In the alliance we’re proposing, we would be your online division while you operated the retail side. You would own 49% of our company and we would operate under your name.”

The CEO of the Goliath smirked. “How many customers do you have?”

“300,000,” said David.

The CEO chuckled. “That’s nothing. Do you realize we have 7700 stores worldwide?”

David nodded and hoped that the CEO of Goliath couldn’t see the sweat beading on his brow.

This deal had to work. His company was in trouble. It was three years old and still hadn’t turned a profit. He knew he was onto a sound idea but it was just ahead of its time. He needed a partner with deep pockets and the same long-term vision.

Before David could say another word, the CEO of Goliath stood up, signaling the end of the meeting.

Now he was in full blown attack mode. “Don’t you realize that dotcoms are crumbling all around? This digital thing is never gonna take off, your business is already finished — you just don’t know it yet. You might need us, but we don’t need you.”

David’s heart sank. Now he was flying home empty handed.

On the flight, he started to think up a new plan.

David knew what the future would be, but it was happening more slowly than he thought. He had been thinking and working at these problems for years, in a way he had been working on them his whole life.

Back when other fresh high school graduates were wasting their summer playing video games, he pounded the streets selling vacuum cleaners door to door. He loved that job.

His loved it so much that he deferred his freshman year at college to keep selling — earning enough to pay tuition that year.

After graduating, he boarded a plane bound for Swaziland as a Peace Corps volunteer to teach high school math. He returned home two years later and jumped right into grad school at Stanford. That experience introduced him to entrepreneurship, which led him to join a startup. There, he learned about business and eventually decided to start his own.

Later, David would reflect on that decision to leave a secure path and enter an arena dominated by Goliath’s and say that:
> # “Once you’ve hitchhiked across Africa with 10 bucks in your pocket, starting a business doesn’t seem too intimidating.”

He and two buddies went on to launch Pure Software. There first product was a program which identified bugs in Unix software. The business took off, even though none of them really knew how to lead a company. Their strength was developing excellent products, and revenues doubled every year for four straight years. The timing was right. They took Pure Software public in one of the most successful IPOs of 1995. Two years later, the company was acquired for $750 million and the David walked away a multimillionaire.

His next business, (the one he was trying to sell half of to Goliath) wasn’t going so well.

Each day, he commuted to work with one of his employees and they would bat around business ideas.

The businessman said, “I just want to be the Amazon of something.” At the time, Amazon had built a powerful book-selling engine. Their model was made up of three simple components. One, it was a high-demand product. Two, that was ordered online. And three, was delivered via the mail.

For months, they talked about a slew of possibilities. One day, on their way to work, David had to make a stop to return a rented movie.

His buddy suggested, “What about renting movies online? People buy them online.”

David thought and replied, “I think VHS tapes are too delicate to survive repeat shipments. But… I wonder… a friend of mine was telling me about a new technology for movies called DVDs. It’s like… movies on CD.”

His friend gave it some thought. “Never heard of a DVD… you think it’ll catch on?”

“Yes because CDs did,” said David. “Let’s test mailing a CD and see what happens.”

When David arrived at the office, he found a blue greeting-card envelope. He grabbed a CD off his self and dropped it in. “We’ll send it to my house and see what happens.”

David bit his nails for the next 24 hours. If the experiment didn’t work, their business might die. While he waited, he couldn’t remember ever being so excited to get the mail. Finally, the mailman arrived and he ran to the mailbox. There was the blue envelope. He held his breath and opened it…

The CD was in perfect condition.

David laughed with delight and called his friend. “It worked! People don’t know it yet, but DVDs are going to replace VHS tapes.”

A new company was born and David and his friend called it Kibble.

Kibble shipped its first DVD in 1998 — only one year after the technology had been introduced in the US. They changed the movie rental model by not requiring return dates and not charging late fees. Kibble limped along for three years, waiting for market acceptance of DVDs. DVD players were just too expensive, so most consumers held onto VHS technology. But they were still able to build a base of 300,000 customers.

In those days, dotcoms didn’t need profitability to go public. They needed growth and some promise of a future business model. David felt an IPO would give them enough cash to survive. So they started working toward going public.

But then the internet bubble popped. Investment funds dried up, and in 2000 David found himself at Goliath’s offices begging for them to invest in Kibble.

The Goliath was Blockbuster, who owned most of the movie rental industry.

They laughed at David’s pitch and Kibble and sent them on their way.

Despite the humiliation, David knew they were onto something big. He could sense where the market was headed. Kibble faced rough times, and had to lay off one-third of their workforce in order to survive.

Then Kibble caught a break. Because early adopters had paid enormous sums for early DVD players, the market was heating up. New, lower priced DVD players were created, and consumers started snatching them up.

Luckily, David had the foresight to build relationships with the DVD manufacturers, and managed to secure a deal to slip a free trial offer for Kibble in many of the new DVD players.

Soon Kibble was earning serious revenue. DVD use surged, so did their partnerships, and just two years after the meeting with Blockbuster, Kibble went public.

Well they didn’t actually go public under the name Kibble.

They realized it was a poor name, and all their friends kept asking what kind of dog food they were going to sell.

So they changed the name and went public under a name you might know.

Netflix.

David in this story is of course, Reed Hastings. His friend who was there from the beginning is his co-founder, Marc Randolph.

Reed never lost his long-term vision. He knew that Internet speeds would eventually improve and that streaming would eventually become the preferred viewer experience.

Reed said early on, “Movies over the Internet are coming, and at some point it will become big business… We want to be ready when video-on-demand happens. That’s why the company is called Netflix, not DVD-by-Mail.”

In 2007 — ten years after starting — Netflix launched its streaming service and developed a deal with cable network, Starz, to secure popular movies. Consumers scratched their heads. Why would anyone want to watch a movie on a computer? Yet Reed’s long-term vision proved spot on.

In 2012, Netflix began producing original content. Critics scoffed at the notion, but quickly back-peddled when Netflix contracted big Hollywood names and won awards.

And a fun sidenote… shortly after Netflix’s went public, Blockbuster saw their success. They did what most Goliath’s do when they’re pummeled by a David. They tried to copy and knock off the product. At that point in time Blockbuster just posted its first loss of $1.6 billion, starting a decade of decline. Blockbuster tried to compete head to head against Netflix, but couldn’t catch up. In 2010, Blockbuster’s stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for trading too low. Blockbuster closed its last store in 2013, and their passing on purchasing Netflix is now considered one of the epic fails of business history.

Reed would reflect on it all and say that,
> # “Being an entrepreneur is about patience and persistence, not the quick buck, and everything great is hard and takes a long time.”

There were many times in Netflix’s early days where it was a David, vulnerable to Goliath.

Instead of competing directly with Goliath, they tried to collaborate. When Goliath tried to kill them, they stayed focused, again, ignoring the competition. Reed could have made the mistep of opening stores and trying to become more like Goliath, instead he kept playing 3D Chess and started to prepare for streaming and original content.

Now Netflix touts 125 million subscribers worldwide.

So if you’re David trying to partner with Goliath, don’t worry. Goliath might need you far more than you need them. If you’ve seen the future and know what will happen, at a certain point you have to stop trying to convince others on what will happen and just build it.

# This Unconventional Way of Consuming Books Will Transform How You Read

## This Unconventional Way of Consuming Books Will Transform How You Read
> # I once believed in the sacredness of books — each one deserved to be read in its entirety. I’ve since abandoned my tired practice and reinvented how I read.

When’s the last time you listened to an album from beginning to end? Yeah, right. But of course you read books that way — I mean, who in their right mind wouldn’t? Turns out loads of people. The catalyst for my new reading regime was when a friend sent me [this podcast](https://tim.blog/2016/01/30/naval-ravikant-on-happiness-hacks/) featuring *Angelist *founder Navil Ravikant. Frequently dubbed the Yoda of Silicon Valley, he made the compelling case for:
> # Having no obligation to finish any book

![](1*F3eoB-IrRyEqwOgeYb6z2w.jpeg)

“I came up with this hack, where I started treating books as throw away blog posts or as bite-sized tweets or Facebook posts, and I felt no obligation to finish any book,” confesses Ravikant. Within weeks of hearing this, I’d proudly joined the proponents of this untraditional approach. I no longer feel compelled to finish a book because I’ve given myself permission not to finish. The obligation I had felt since childhood had vanished and that guilt of not finishing has melted away. With this new revelation, I no longer waste time, and will never *get stuck* on a book again.

## Binge Reading

Ten years ago, the average American was consuming roughly [100,000](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/the-american-diet-34-gigabytes-a-day/?mtrref=www.google.com) words a day. If you visit about 200 web pages a day — a pretty easy feat — you’ll have seen a whopping [490,000 words](https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/nov/02/digital-media-news-sites-information-overload). That’s the same length as *War and Peace*. The problem is that very little information, if any, sticks with you. It surges out your brain faster than it came careening in.

![](1*UU1AlTUgyqPiqt8WGhoq3g.png)

The goal is to convert the information you read into knowledge. Bits and bobs, anecdotes, quotes, takeaways, passages, prefaces, epilogues, and more — that resonate with you are items that you may want to *do something* with. Perhaps it’s to share with a good friend or broadcast to the world.
> # “The impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it’s destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you” — Annie Dillard

The point is not to be a hoarder of what you learn but to actively process, share, deliberate, debate, and continually adjust your thinking through feedback. Whether it’s revealing what you read or writing what you think, if you fail to do this as Dillard warns: *you open your safe and find ashes.*

![](1*JlXAROyS3_7eiAT0g8QnDA.gif)

We must take care in what we learn as this is what we’ll know. When reading, there’s often a false *feeling of fluency*** **explains Faria Sana**. **A psychology professor at Athabasca University, she says that the information flowing in, “Actually doesn’t stick unless you put effort into it and concentrate and engage in certain strategies that will help you remember.”

Since we tend to forget most of the books we read, I’ve made it a point to not let that happen to me. Here’s how:

1. ***Scan*** the table of contents, mark what you want to read, and consider jumping in wherever you fancy

1. ***Scribble* **in the columns, underline, and yes dare I say it, dog-ear pages

1. ***Summarise** *the book (relevant passages) and in your own cryptic handwriting make notes on notecards. (Part of this process is inspired from Ryan Holiday’s [*notecard system](https://ryanholiday.net/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-everything-you-read/))*

1. ***Script*** a blog post (if possible) like this one, or even better yet, take notes like Derek Sivers does and [***Share](https://sivers.org/book)** *them with the world

1. ***Speak** *to others on what you’ve learned or incorporate the best nuggets into a a talk (if that’s your bag)

Et voilà! Scan, scribble, summarise, script & share, then speak. You won’t need to look anything up in a secondary resource, the knowledge is living, breathing, and evolving in your primary one (that gooey mush between your ears). Like a Super Jeopardy! champion, recall everything on demand but with your own unique twist to boot.

## The Forgetting Curve

When I first learned that others happily chose not to read books from cover to cover, I was horrified. The nerve of those who only read the parts of a book that interested them — silently dissing the author. What I thought a misappropriation of bandwidth, an ill-fated undertaking, a foolish strategy — was, in fact, the best way to get the job done. And that job, of course, is learning.

![](1*HQy2odJwWOplHskd4LHIHg.png)

The *forgetting curve* marks the decline of memory retention over time. The curve to the left shows how information is rapidly lost when there is no attempt to retain it. The curve is steepest within 24 hours after you learn something. After a few days, you’re lucky if you can recall one-quarter of what you read. A few days in, and you’re a goner.

Your only hope against this rapid deterioration** **of retaining things you want to remember is by reviewing. Repetition is your godsend: re-read, re-engage, and continually discuss what you’ve learned. You’ll find you recalling most, if not all, of what you intended. Goes to show you school teachers were making a good point after all.

![](1*5ExJCezkE916Ze5KjG5I2g.jpeg)

There is also sound logic in taking your sweet time getting through a book. Research suggests that if you want to remember what you read, space your reading out and let all the information slowly soak into you. We need to train our brains. We have to regularly take them to the gym for a mental workout. We shouldn’t outsource our minds, relying on Google, Wikipedia, Evernote, algorithms or AI to do the job for us.

Marketing legend Seth Godin has long argued that most non-fiction books can be summed up in just a few short pages (if not paragraphs). The core idea is sandwiched between a bunch of filler only to please publishers. Indeed, that’s why so many of Godin’s reads are exceptionally thin. Brevity also plays a large role in why his blog, with one simple new entry a day, is one of the top-rated in the world.

Plato wasn’t a fan of letters because he thought that writing would kill our need to remember. He was right. Writing did alter, if not murder, our memory. But I wouldn’t be writing this (nor would you be reading it) without the invention. Our duty is to do the best with what we’ve got.

## Continuous Partial Attention

“To be busy, to be connected, is to be alive, to be recognised, and to matter,” writes Linda Stone. She coined *continuous partial attention* which is our vain attempt to not miss out on anything. Where attention is the currency *du jour*, we are cajoled to be always-on. It leaves us in a heightened and pressurized state of anxiety and with an “artificial sense of constant crisis.”

Consuming bits on the web — so often in a hectic and fractured fashion — is rewiring our brains (and not in a good way). In depth reading which usually takes place offline (in books) is where the real transformative media lives explains creativity expert J[ocelyn K. Glei](https://mailchi.mp/jkglei/5kpdgbptbz-999015?e=f8b9dbf1e1). Yet for modern humans, books in particular are notoriously difficult to read because our attention spans have dropped below that of a Goldfish’s whopping nine-seconds.

![](1*kiazZm0M3R6s6rjmnzjS8g.gif)

You have little hope of getting through *Sapiens* not to mention this very article. And rather ironically, this is precisely why Ravikant reads 10–20 books at any given time. If something isn’t relevant to him or doesn’t hold his attention, he simply returns to it later or abandons it altogether.

True, there is a “cognitive cost” in rapidly switching from one task to another. But having many books on the go is not multi-tasking — it’s just reading — and it’s a pretty darn good strategy too. While the churn of your book intake becomes remarkable, the most striking benefit is the connections you make between disparate topics.

Books seem to find you at the right moment in your life (and on occasion make more than one appearance). You decide to read the parts of a book that feed (and fuel) your curiosity — not to win a book tally championship. Reading is a tool to help you build skills over a lifetime.

## Bookshelf Porn

Walking into a friend’s flat, I was happy to see my favourite books lining his shelves. “Wonderful books you have,” I casually remarked. “Oh I haven’t read most of them.” So were they just eye candy littered there to impress visitors like me? No, it was his reference library — a window into his aspirational self.

![](1*z2JEPa23cKQOHMbOl_pm9g.png)

The mere presence of books could work their secret magic on you over time. Just today I was thinking about the father of economics, Adam Smith, and as a result I flipped open [*Work: The Last 1,000](https://www.amazon.com/Work-Last-1-000-Years/dp/1786634104). *For month’s it’s been reclining on my shelf anxiously waiting for me.

Keep your unread books around, buy more and spread them throughout your house — on the floor, coffee table, nightstand, kitchen counter, toilet tank — you name it. You’ll eventually get round to perusing that book. Or perhaps its contents might just flow into your brain through some form of osmosis.

## Making it Stick

“How much of reading, then, is just a kind of narcissism — a marker of who you were and what you were thinking when you encountered a text?” writes Ian Crouch in [*The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-curse-of-reading-and-forgetting). *If it is a brand of self-absorption then so be it.

![](1*5W9zptbvtylwmoVVuiSoCw.jpeg)

If you’re able to transmit what you’ve learned to others (or even recommend the book you just read) you take a selfish act and flip it on its head. In the process you become wiser and more generous — and I think that’s a winning combination.

For many like myself, one of the best ways to make information stick is to repeat it by teaching it to another. I often find myself quoting statistics that seem lodged in my brain. It happens frequently enough that I’ve become known to friends, colleagues, and students as ‘random fact guy.’ Did you know that more people are dying from selfies than sharks? Of course you did. But the quirk goes far beyond frivolous facts like this; one particular revelation — the rampant [disengagement we see in the workplace](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-im-obsessed-with-the-future-of-work-4d03cad8ea36) — has upended my career.

I get it, this reading regime might work for me but it ain’t going to fly for you. A leopard can’t change his spots you say. Ah, but he can change his dietary habits. If you don’t like your new practice, you can always go back to reading one book at a time from beginning to end. It’s alright. Perhaps I’m missing a trick. Or perhaps, you shouldn’t knock something until you’ve tried it.

# This is the Hardest Thing About Creative Work

## “A library with filled bookshelves and blurred light bulbs hanging from the ceiling” by Janko Ferlič on Unsplash

These last years have been some of the most rewarding and challenging of my life. There have been moments of grief followed by ones of bliss. There have been fractured friendships and broken hearts followed by lifelong friendships with people who would bail me out of jail at 2 am. I’ve missed weddings, family gatherings, and much more. Countless conversations and shared experiences have shaped my creative life for the last ten years.

If there’s one thing that has challenged me about this book, in particular, it’s the paradox of creating for an [Audience of One](https://unmistakablecreative.com/audience-of-one/). On one side the core message is to find joy in the process instead of the results. On the flip side, I didn’t write this book so that it would linger in obscurity. It’s been a delicate balancing act of caring, while also realizing that ego is the enemy. In one of the quotes in the book, Ryan Holiday said the following:
> # One of the hardest things to do is to separate your work and the effort that you put in from the results. If your happiness with your job and your career is dependent on how the movie does at the box office, or how the critics respond to your role, you have placed your happiness with your own life in the hands of other people, and that’s a recipe for profound disappointment.

This is the most challenging thing about creative work. At some point, after the book gets submitted to production, the ink dries on the page, you execute the marketing efforts, and the finished work starts to show up on people’s doorstep, your role as a creator is over. You have to come to terms with how it has turned out. Like the authors themselves, every book has a destiny. I once read a quote that said: “Destiny is a matter of choice not chance.” But with creative work, there’s always an element of chance.

*“Your book begins to make its way into the work, and it feels a bit like watching helplessly from the sidewalk as your toddler navigates Time Square. You are not in control. No one, in fact, is in control. Not your agent. Not, not your publisher, not your editor, not the lovely booksellers fighting the good fight all over this country. There is something ineffable, wholly unpredictable — something my agent calls “magic fairy dust” — that either happens to a book or doesn’t” says Dani Shapiro.*

If it has the magic fairy dust, you might hit a best-seller list or become the beneficiary of a freakish coincidence. If by chance you succeed and have the conditional opportunity to try again, to produce subsequent work, you have to start all over again as if none of it ever happened.

My self-published book was a WSJ Bestseller. It had the magic fairy dust. My first traditionally published book didn’t even though it was a much better book. Whether my new book has this magic fairy dust remains to be seen. All I know for sure is that I’m going to wake up tomorrow and write.

# Successful Millennials Have These 7 Personality Traits

## Nicolas Cole Instagram

Being a [successful young person](https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/5-things-they-dont-tell-you-about-starting-your-ow.html) is an uphill battle.

For every person that gives you a shot, there are ten that don’t believe you have what it takes yet. They would prefer it if you just stayed the course like everyone else. They want your success to take as long as theirs did.

But part of [being “successful”](https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/5-habits-that-will-make-or-break-how-successful-yo.html) is knowing your own potential, and being able to trust yourself enough to take risks — even when everyone around you insists that you would be wrong for doing so.

If you look closely, [successful Millennials share a handful of things in common](https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/3-reasons-millennials-dont-get-promoted.html). Some of those traits are inherent in this specific generation. Others are learned behaviors, and the result of many years spent going against the grain. Success, in itself, is not something you’re “born” with — even if you’re born into wealth. Success is a mindset, and the result of daily habits that sculpt you into the person you want to become.
> So, if you are a Millennial and you want to become successful, then these are the 7 personality traits you should work to acquire for yourself:

## 1. Confident yet humble.

In order to be successful, at anything, you have to be confident. However, there is a difference between “confidence” and “arrogance” — and that difference comes down to humility.

Without humility, and one eye constantly reflecting on yourself and your actions, you will be nothing more than another arrogant Millennial (the kind Baby Boomers and Generation X-ers can’t stand).

Go after your goals with plenty of passion. Just remember to be humble about your pursuits. When you’re young, people have every reason to hate on you. Humility will help you even the playing field.

## 2. Thick-skinned without a chip on your shoulder.

Having think skin is going to be necessary for you to endure the amount of times you’re going to hear the word “No.”

However, having thick skin and having a chip on your shoulder are two different things. Millennials that operate from that “I’ve got something to prove” attitude tend to repel more people than they do attract comrades and willing mentors. A chip on your shoulder does nothing but make your own journey more difficult.

Thick skin, on the other hand, is having the maturity to hear feedback in a way that doesn’t react out of insecurity. You can hear the other person, consider their thoughts and perspectives, and apply them to your life as you see fit.

## 3. Driven while preserving your relationships.

No one succeeds alone.

In order to make your dreams come true, you’re going to have to be so driven that no one can get in your way. But if you lose all your friends in the process, nothing you achieve is going to feel the same. Being driven is great — to a point.

Part of being truly successful is being able to balance the things that make life worth living (friends, family, etc.) with your own personal goals. Don’t forget: those people you call your friends were the first to support you.

## 4. Compassionate, without seeing it as a weakness.

It’s unfortunate how many people (and not just Millennials, but every generation) sees compassion as a weakness — as if looking at the situation through someone else’s eyes is a bad thing.

But compassion is one of the most powerful traits of a leader, especially a young one. Compassion is what helps others around you feel heard, and more willing to help you. Compassion is what resolves conflicts the fastest.

Compassion is a sign of maturity and growth, and to think that you can succeed by just plowing forward is a short-sighted tactic.

## 5. Highly tactical and mindfully strategic.

Being tactical is understanding what you need to do today, in order to get to where you want to be tomorrow.

Being strategic is understanding where you want to be a year, three years, five years from now, and being able to reverse engineer how to get there.

Anyone successful looks at every endeavor through both lenses. They play the long game and the short game, and understand when they’re making decisions for the moment versus decisions that aim toward a much larger goal.

## 6. Business-minded and creatively expressive.

They don’t teach you the business side of things in art school (I would know — my major was creative writing).

They also don’t teach you how to be creative in business school.

Thinking that you can succeed with one and not the other is an old way of thinking. Part of “winning” in today’s business world is being creative, and part of “winning” as a creative thinker in today’s world requires being educated on the business end.

Successful Millennials prioritize learning (and maintaining) both. In fact, they seek out opportunities that teach them what they still don’t know, so that they can be more educated and self-sufficient.

## 7. Technologically fluent, but not addicted.

And finally, successful Millennials know the digital realm inside and out — but they don’t spend all day glued to their social media feeds.

Why?

Because their time is valuable, and they want to invest it in what matters.

Being a consumer is not the same as being intentional with your consumption. Consumers just scroll and scroll and scroll. You can be more intentional with your consumption, engaging enough to stay aware of what’s happening in the digital world without being consumed by it.

Successful Millennials know this balance well, and train themselves not to fall victim to technology. Instead, they master habits that ensure their fluency remains, while still getting done what they need to get done.

# If You Can Master These Ancient Laws About Yourself, You’ll Become Unstoppable

## If You Can Master These Ancient Laws About Yourself, You’ll Become Unstoppable
> “We are subject to forces from deep within us that drive our behavior and that operate below the level of our awareness.” -Robert Greene, [The Laws of Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525428143/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0525428143&linkCode=as2&tag=anthonymoore2-20&linkId=ae518b6c743a664c64548e4e5d0834a5)

There are no “new” fundamentals.

In the words of best-selling author Jim Rohn, “Truth is not new.”

Contrary to popular belief, there are fundamental laws that determine much of your life: your performance, energy, relationships, health, and success.

If you follow these laws, odds are you’ll naturally achieve success, [even attract it](https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/9-key-habits-that-will-make-you-automatically-attract-enormous-success-ad8af090cefd).

But if you break these laws, it’s very likely you’ll end up broken, empty, and [unfulfilled](https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/7-guaranteed-ways-to-stay-bored-lonely-and-unfulfilled-f9cc7b8676e3) — even if you do manage to achieve your goals.

Nearly a century ago, the great American author Frank Crane wrote in his book, *The Business of Life,* “Any human being that will observe the laws of life as carefully as a successful business observe the laws of business will come to that inward poise and triumph which is life’s happiest crown.”

Many people don’t follow these laws at all. They seek to take shortcuts and circumvent the process. Their useless attempts to succeed outside the law will ultimately end in failure. Sad as that is, it’s good news for the rest of us. We can succeed where most have failed. We can achieve what most others won’t.

If you want what no one else has, you must do what no one else does. Or, as my colleague [Srinivas Rao](https://twitter.com/UnmistakableCEO) wrote: “If you want to live an extraordinary life, you have to give up many things that are part of a normal one.”

If you want to live an extraordinary life, it’s time to upgrade your mindset.

It’s time to start following the laws. [Robert Greene](https://twitter.com/RobertGreene)’s [*The Laws of Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525428143/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0525428143&linkCode=as2&tag=anthonymoore2-20&linkId=ae518b6c743a664c64548e4e5d0834a5)* is a great place to start.

## Rise Above the Rest By Admitting Your Faults

I used to think that if I wanted to be the best “__________” (writer, basketball player, husband, Settlers of Catan player, etc.), I needed to be about perfect, and I embraced my pursuit of near-perfection.

The result was always the same: frustration, exhaustion, and emptiness.

I’ve learned I can’t be a perfect husband, writer, basketball player, or anything. Far from it. When I try, I just tire myself out and feel terrible from the constant failure. I especially tried this with girlfriends and romance; I declared I would do *anything*, and be *whatever* my partner needed me to be so that we could have a near-perfect relationship. I never could, and I’d end up angry and resentful.

In his new book The Laws of Human Nature, Greene advises readers to understand how irrational, narcissistic, and biased we can be, and almost always are. If we pretend we aren’t, we’ll just [remain in mediocrity](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-most-people-will-remain-in-mediocrity-6c7e24c48d12). But if we admit it…we cut loose the weight and can soar to new heights.

It’s why I failed for so many years as a writer before I finally got the hang of it — I wrote about me, me, me. It was humbling to learn that, the truth is, my readers don’t really care about *me*…they care about what I can give them and how I can help them. My narcissism and pride prevented me from seeing that.

Admit your faults. Embrace them. Then, take action. Do as best as you can. In the words of author [Ryan Holiday](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday): *“Ignore what other people are doing. Ignore what’s going on around you. There is no competition. There is no objective benchmark to hit. There is simply the best you can do — that’s all that matters.”*

You’re not that great. But that’s OK. Neither am I. But we can do great things by forgetting our silly pride and moving to help others. That’s where success and fulfillment start to come in: by selflessly serving others.

“If you want a billion dollars, help a billion people,” said uber-successful entrepreneur [Peter Diamandis](https://twitter.com/PeterDiamandis). Or as my favorite author of all time C.S. Lewis wrote: “Humility isn’t thinking less of yourself, it’s thinking of yourself less.”

## How To Truly Influence People and Develop Key Relationships
> “Influence over people and the power that it brings is gained in the opposite way that you might imagine. Normally we try to charm people with our ideas, showing ourselves off in the best light. But the royal road to influence and power is to go the opposite direction: put the focus on others.” -Robert Greene

Deep down, people don’t really care about you — your accomplishments, your record, your numbers.

They care about how you can help them. And they won’t even listen to you unless they feel that you actually care *about* them.

Another great lesson I’ve learned so far from *The Laws of Human Nature* is this: let others be the star of the show. That’s what truly influences people and actually creates a lasting relationships — not a transactional one, but a relationship based on trust and respect.

When I was just starting out writing, I wrote about myself *constantly. *I mean, I’m great, right? People should *know* I’m great.

Of course, nobody read. I’d reach out to every blogger, podcaster, and website I could think of, listing all my (mostly exaggerated) accolades as a writer, and how they should post my guest pitch. No one responded, for years.

It wasn’t until I started focusing my message on others that things changed. When I focused on my readers, the numbers took care of themselves. I also paired that with doing dozens of informational interviews where I’d take interesting people out to coffee, shut up, and listen to their wisdom.

Do you want to truly influence others?

Do you want to actually *have a relationship* with your role models?

Focus on them. Don’t hype yourself up or indulge in self-absorbed talk; focus on them, and the influence and relationships will follow.

## “Change Your Circumstance By Changing Your Attitude”

You attract what you are.

You find what you search for. If you’re always looking for the bad, the unfair, the I-knew-it-was-too-good-to-be-true, make no mistake:

**You’ll always find it.**

Anton Checkhov, considered to be one of the greatest short story fiction writers in history, had a rough upbringing.

Born in rural poverty, his father beat him and his 5 siblings constantly, forcing them to work day and night in the family-owned grocery store. It got so cold, the ink in Checkhov’s pens would constantly freeze, making it impossible to do his schoolwork.

Checkhov’s father eventually spent the grocery store into bankruptcy, abandoning the rest of the family to go live with Checkhov’s older brothers. His brothers would send him letters, telling how terrible and awful their father was, and probably always will be.

Checkhov had a choice — he could commiserate and join in, embracing his terrible circumstances and his lot in life. But he didn’t. “Why do you refer to yourself as my ‘worthless, insignificant little brother?’ Don’t you know where you should be aware of your worthlessness? Before God, perhaps…but not before people. Among people you should be aware of your worth.” Even Checkhov was surprised at his kind tone.

Checkhov realized his father’s terrible cycle — born a lowly serf and beaten by his father, he employed the same behavior with his children. Checkhov saw this cycle, and chose to broke it. He adopted a new attitude, and went on to become a world-famous writer.

The rest of the story is outlined in [*The Laws of Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525428143/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0525428143&linkCode=as2&tag=anthonymoore2-20&linkId=ae518b6c743a664c64548e4e5d0834a5)*. I can relate to Checkhov’s story; there are similar truths and cycles in my family history. Fathers and relatives have carried dysfunction to children for generations. I could’ve continued the cycle, but didn’t. I went to therapy, counseling, and chose a new life for my wife and future kids.

This isn’t some feel-good story; Checkhov felt tremendous pain and hurt from being abandoned by his father.

But Checkhov turned tragedy into triumph, a common behavior of many of the world’s most successful, influential people throughout history.

If you want to change your circumstances, change your attitude first. External changes are always preceded by internal decisions; results come *after* action.

Change your attitude, change your life.

![[Eric Ward](https://unsplash.com/@ericjamesward?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*glLePFNkkD09wl5_)*[Eric Ward](https://unsplash.com/@ericjamesward?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

## In Conclusion

There are ancient laws and fundamentals that, if followed, can bring wonderful abundance and success to your life.

You don’t *need* to follow these rules to get success. There will always be lucky people who are blessed with fortune without earning it.

But in his book *The Richest Man in Babylon*, George Clason wrote how unearned gold either makes wanton spenders who develop insatiable tastes, or hoarding misers who know they don’t possess the ability to replace it.

Instead of ignoring the fundamental laws of success and behavior — like most people do — choose to utilize them to your advantage.

Rise above the rest of the pack admitting that you’re not that great — but you’re working on it. Share what you’ve learned so far. Report back from enemy territory, as Stephen King wrote, and tell us what you learned.

Truly influence people by *giving*, not using them for selfish gain. Listen to them. Serve them. Nobody cares about you — they care about how you can help their life. So help them.

Finally: upgrade your attitude. A bad attitude basically guarantees [you’ll never achieve true success](https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/a-bad-attitude-guarantees-youll-never-achieve-massive-success-cb45c0bceb69). But if you want to change your circumstances, change your attitude first.

# Quarter-Life Crises Are Good For You

## 
> ***“So teach us to count our days**
 **that we may gain a wise heart.” — Psalm 90:12***

I’m about to turn 23, and I’m feeling the pinch of time. It really does pick up speed.

By 23, I expected I would have my own business, a published book, a trusty old horse, the looks of Indiana Jones, a Batcave, and a sidekick. I’m sure you had similar high ambitions when you were 17 or so: maybe you were going to travel, read all the great books, or invest and become financially independent at an early age.

I’m not saying I’m having a quarter-life crisis. But I am saying I understand the people who do.

Around the time life speeds up, it can be very easy to start forgetting and neglecting all the things you said you were going to do. By the time you reach the quarter-century mark of our lives, you realize you’ve either over-shot our goals or under-budgeted time and effort for your achievements.

I’ve done a lot of cool things in 23 year of life — things I never expected I would do. But I also see all the ways I shirked from my goals, wasted my time, wasted good wealth, and stayed comfortable when I should have been bold and wise.

Here are a few things I wish I had known coming out of my teens into my twenties:

**1. Always be cultivating and protecting your independence.** Breaking out of the gravitational pull of the life model set by your parents and your peers is harder than you thing. It’s not a once and done thing — as I assumed somewhat. You must constantly review your lifestyle and resist the subconscious pull of imitating others. You must be capable of repeating all of the hard decisions and hard conversations and hard sacrifices of your “coming of age” in new forms.

**2. Things come in cycles — so prepare for a marathon, not a sprint.** Each moral dilemma, expense, setback, challenge, duty will feel new, like a one-time challenge that can be forgotten and then left behind. But you will realize slowly that these things come in cycles — and that you have to budget for them in terms of time, energy and resources. Too many times I’ve thrown everything I have at a problem or desire, only for it to come back again to find me unprepared. I should have

**3. Time dilates. **Again, that old thing about time running faster? It’s entirely true. Once you get into work, you’ll find all of that youthful free time shrinking and shrinking. It’s easy to be lulled into thinking that just working a job well is progress. It isn’t — not if you want your own Batcave or cruise ship (insert wildly big goal here). You will have to notice how the weeks and months blend together — and learn from that flow how precious your time is. To manage to reach your goals as your time shrinks, you will have to be increasingly disciplined and intentional about how you use your time.

**4. You aren’t special. **Around my age, you start losing all of that “special snowflake” status you may have had when you were college-aged. You no longer get to compare yourself to college students. You finally have to compare yourself to what you thought your adult self would be life. And you probably will be disappointed. But that’s a good thing. You should be competing against and aspiring to the kind of lives led by the best men and women in history. And to even start on that path, you have to realize how far off the track and how unexceptional you currently are.

**5. Progress and regress both compound quickly.** Most if not all progress works on the principle of compound interest. And with time going by faster and faster, you can either see progress or regress compound faster and faster. Every year passing by puts you further behind or further ahead — there is no standing still. Small habits started young will snowball (particularly where character is concerned). I’ve gone from running a mile to running a half-marathon in a year of progress on one metric. I’ve also seen myself spend more and more of my money (money I should be investing) from a habit of trading money for convenience. Not good. I’ve also wasted this effect by spreading myself too thin on things to learn or do.

The reason I’m *not* having a quarter-life crisis? Because now I know these things. And I know [it’s half-time for my youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A5x53O7ylU). In the words of Clint Eastwood (just replace “America” with “me”)
> ***“All that matters now is what’s ahead. How do we come from behind? How do we come together? And, how do we win? Detroit’s showing us it can be done. And, what’s true about them is true about all of us. This country can’t be knocked out with one punch. We get right back up again and when we do the world is going to hear the roar of our engines. Yeah, it’s halftime America. And, our second half is about to begin.”***

We need a good hard slap in this day and age to remind ourselves that life is short. We need a good reminder that life is passing us by and life will pass us by — comfortably — if we don’t do anything about it.

Let’s use our birthdays (and quarter-life crises) to remember that.

# This Entrepreneur Is Turning Science Fiction Into Science Fact

## This Entrepreneur Is Turning Science Fiction Into Science Fact

### Shawn Frayne and the quest for the hologram.

**Like the Death Star taking out Alderaan, *Star Wars* blew America’s collective mind when it hit theaters in 1977. **The movie became the defining myth for a generation, fascinating audience with high adventure in a galaxy far, far away and inspiring kids to dream of mastering the Force or taking the helm of the Millennium Falcon.

In our own backwater galaxy, we don’t yet have lightsabers that can deflect blaster bolts or hyperdrives to power us through the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs, but [Shawn Frayne](https://lookingglassfactory.com/about/) is building a real-world version of one piece of iconic *Star Wars* technology: The hologram of Princess Leia that R2-D2 projects to deliver her iconic line, “Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.”

![](1*MDw2C2qn-c7GroFKOQ-vQg.jpeg)

Shawn embarked on his mission to build a hologram in high school and, after nearly 20 years of experimentation, cofounded a company, [Looking Glass Factory](https://lookingglassfactory.com/), to make good on that promise. [The latest iteration of their volumetric display just launched on Kickstarter, and appears to do just that](http://www.lookingglassfactory.com):

![The Looking Glass in action.](1*qsIg3Wo2p5ar6jqaJZ57ZQ.gif)*The Looking Glass in action.*

Shawn was kind enough to answer a few questions about human-computer interaction, media innovation, interface battles among the tech giants, and the inspirational power of science fiction.

**In your view, what were the key turning points in the history of human-computer interaction? What new opportunities did each paradigm shift unlock? What hidden assumptions govern the status quo of our relationship to computers, and how might the future be different?**

I think a lot of the chase for new interfaces over the past century has been focused on bringing the interaction between people and computers more closely in alignment with how our species has evolved to work and communicate in the physical world. To the end of enabling non-specialists to begin to interact with and use the power of computing platforms and networks. The standard example of this sort of shift is the transition from an abstract command line interaction toward a popularized virtual desktop GUI with the Macintosh in 1984, but I also consider things like the transition from telegraph to telephone to be a closely related phase transition, since this allowed regular folks, the non-specialist, to communicate at a distance for the first time.

Each paradigm shift like this — and these seem to only come along every few decades — gives more people access to greater and greater powers of creation and communication.

Our work in Looking Glass Factory is focused on getting more information from computers into people’s brains through three-dimensional display and interaction. This is analogous to the command-line to GUI transition in a lot of ways. For instance, to simply place a virtual light in a desired position behind a virtual character — let’s say Woody from *Toy Story* — using a 2D screen requires a number of rotations of the 3D scene on that 2D monitor, to simply understand where that light is in relation to Woody in virtual three-dimensional space. That placement might take 15–20 seconds for a specialist now, and a minute or two for an amateur. But with a holographic desktop display like the Looking Glass, that same skilled designer can place the light into position in three-dimensional virtual space in a split second — and the amateur can too, since the movement of the virtual light is now much closer to the experience of moving a real object or a real light around in the real world, which we’ve evolved to know how to do with great efficacy.

This may seem like a trivial example, but it has major implications — that simple solution of the 3D placement problem has ripples through all design of almost the entire modern world, as most 3D design of buildings, rockets, virtual characters is already being done in 3D. It’s just not being done in a way that is aligned with how our monkey brains are used to working, so it’s been slow and requires significant training to do, but that’s about to change.

Human-computer interfaces are the main tool of our species at this point, and their power and value ultimately lies in letting more of the world communicate and create in more powerful ways than was possible before. Making interfaces that give new power of creation and communication to folks with less and less specialized training is, in my view, the goal of the modern toolmaker.

**Virtual and augmented reality systems are getting a lot of attention, even if few applications have gone mainstream. What’s special about Looking Glass’s approach to changing how we interact with virtual worlds?**

Our approach in Looking Glass Factory, and how we designed the Looking Glass holographic display that just launched, is governed by two simple principles. One, that people want a low-friction experience. We don’t want to put something on our heads if we don’t have to. And two, that people enjoy doing things in small groups. That’s it. Those two things, of making interfaces that are instantaneously useful without the friction of putting on a headset or glasses of any sort and of making that experience something that small groups of people can partake in at the same time, are very different goals than the goals of and beliefs held by the big companies developing AR and VR headsets.

We take an approach that respects the ways in which people have evolved to live in the real world and has more resonance with how we’ve interacted with information and with each other in the past. You know, sitting around a campfire and telling stories or listening to the radio in a living rooms. We believe the Looking Glass is the next step in that evolution, and I think it’s important because it means that folks can connect with richer content without sacrificing all the things that are great about the real world and person-to-person interactions. Being able to evaluate a 3D thermal flow simulation for, say, a rocket engine part or to play with a virtual character with your kids is something best done in groups, where a glance between the 3D virtual world and the person sitting right next to you carries a huge amount of information. VR and AR headset-based approaches give that up and in that way I think are less powerful tools and ones that ignore all that is powerful about real-world interaction.

Also, I personally don’t want Mark Zuckerburg to own the high-speed port to my brain — my eyes — with a VR headset, and the approach we take to HCI in Looking Glass Factory is meant to counter that dystopian future. But that’s another conversation. 1984 won’t be like *1984*, I hope.

**How has media innovation shaped the art and entertainment we create and consume? What are the most surprising things people have done with Looking Glass technology?**

We dream in ways that have been impacted heavily by the 2D moving screen media of the past century, and no doubt this has shaped what we create. I find I mostly dream in the third person, and I think this is a direct result of the movies I watch and the home videos I see, in which I’m watching a character or myself in the third person. That’s pretty insane if you think about it. The interfaces and displays of the past century have actually rewired how we dream. I don’t think it’s a bad thing necessarily, but it’s something that I think will continue to happen as interfaces continue to change. I believe this will be just as true for the shift from the 2D illusion of life, as the Disney folks call it, to the 3D illusion of life that’s happening now.

We’ve seen folks making incredible virtual characters that live in the Looking Glass, in some cases that you can feel — literally feel — by tacking on a haptic feedback array to the Looking Glass. I think we are just at the very beginning of seeing what sort of holographic apps folks make though, now that the Looking Glass is launching and a world of 3D creators can finally have a holographic display on their desks.

A big application for me that is in the works is lightfield capture direct to lightfield display (which is the technical category of device that the Looking Glass falls in). This will open up applications like holo-skype, where you can feel as if someone from across the world is right there in front of you, as real as if they were really there. Again, without the hindrance of a headset. I travel a lot between our labs in Brooklyn and Hong Kong and my family is spread all over the world, so this one is particularly and personally important application for me.

The best computer interfaces eventually become communication interfaces, and that’s what I hope happens with the Looking Glass.

**My immediate reaction to seeing Looking Glass in action was, “Our science fiction future has arrived.” Have you found inspiration in science fiction books or movies? How has science fiction influenced your ideas or worldview, and what role do you think it plays in our culture?**

Absolutely. I started making conventional laser-based holograms in high school after seeing the holographic shark swallow up Marty in *Back to the Future II*. More recently, I saw this [holo-message player in *Adventure Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAMbvt-a7fw)* and thought, damn, that looks exactly like a Looking Glass. So, I think the dreams of sci-fi inform the technologies of the future and vice versa.

![](1*hbtZGXTbsUf84oVIhv-Thw.jpeg)

![Shawn’s daughter with a real Looking Glass on the left vs. Adventure Time’s hologram display on the right.](1*n5KQ-Kp5eAWvy4selv5lew.png)*Shawn’s daughter with a real Looking Glass on the left vs. Adventure Time’s hologram display on the right.*

**What do advances in holographic displays mean for tech giants betting heavily on AR/VR?**

A lot of folks ask me why this sort of holographic display is possible now, and how a small startup of 20-people can have the gaul to take on the giant companies like Microsoft and Apple and Facebook in the interface wars.

I usually say that commodity pixel density on LCDs and OLEDs is at a level now that allows for a 45-view superstereoscopic display like the Looking Glass for the first time (thanks to the emergence of retina resolution tablets) and that computers on the desks of most 3D creators are fast enough to generate those 45-views at 60fps for the first time as well (thanks to the games industry and the fast evolution of GPU power).

But I also think there’s a unique misdirection that’s happened that has given us this rare opportunity to make a fundamental leap in the chase for the next interface after 2D screens before the big companies have. After Facebook acquired Oculus, a lot of the brain power and financial resources in the big companies that was historically spent on holographic/lightfield/volumetric displays was rerouted to systems that went on on person’s head. While all the big companies are looking one way at the headsets, it gives the unbelievably rare opportunity for a small startup like us to make this advance. Hopefully the misdirection lasts a bit longer before they catch on.

# How to Drastically Increase Your Free Time

## 

It’s the end of another busy workday, but before you can relax at home, you’ve got to make a 30-minute drive through congested traffic. When you eventually pull up to your home, you open the front door, and then immediately crash on the sofa. You’re completely exhausted.

Does this sound familiar?

It’s certainly a common scenario. But, what makes it even worse, is the fact that it’s unlikely to be a one-off situation. Many people experience this every workday of the year!

It’s no wonder then that the majority of people are feeling overwhelmed by work and stressed by the demands of life. They feel like they just don’t have the time or energy to achieve what they want, and to do things they’d like to do. In fact, I would go even further, and say that most people can’t even find the time to do what HAS to be done — let alone time for family, friends and hobbies.

To give you a couple of examples of this, just think for a moment of the pressures that full-time working parents experience, as well as the many people who are forced to work more than one job in order to keep paying their bills.

Are you one of these people?

If yes, don’t worry, as I’m going to show you some simple ways of ordering your life so you have time left to do the things you really want to do. Take Control of Your Schedule

Just like money — you should have a budget for time.

That’s because time is non-renewable. Meaning you can’t get it back once it’s been spent. That’s why it’s important to understand where your time is going and where you could improve — especially if you’re feeling overwhelmed with everything on your plate.

Chances are, you’re spending time doing things you may not need to be doing yourself (delegation), should be doing for less time (prioritization), or could get rid of all together (replacing bad habits with good).

## Prioritization

You may be surprised to learn that you consume a colossal 34GB of information every day. And that’s on top of the 50,000 thoughts you generate in the same 24-hour period.

With this amount of mental activity and pressure — it’s easy to see why you might feel overwhelmed by the endless information and data that come your way.

Fortunately, there’s a simple way to take back control of your mind. And, it involves using something that you almost certainly already carry with you every day… your smartphone.

Yes, your smartphone can act as the perfect memory and organization tool.

Let me explain.

Instead of trying (and inevitably failing) to remember all the important stuff that comes your way, you can let your smartphone take the strain. It can also help you plan and keep track of your days, weeks, months and years.

Until now, you might have only thought about using your smartphone for social media, news alerts, phone calls and selfies! But, your phone can do much more than these things. Especially if you install the right apps.

I recommend installing [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) on your phone. This powerful app makes it quick and easy to jot down notes and ideas — anywhere, anytime. For instance, you can manually type notes, or you can capture images or even links to webpages. And, searching and finding things in your notes is easy, too, thanks to the clever tagging and categorizing options.

I’ve used Evernote for several years now, and I can honestly say that it’s saved me hundreds of hours. Previously, I used to jot things down in the inherent notepad app. But I frequently found myself wasting time searching through old notes as they were very unorganized and sometimes difficult to retrieve. With Evernote, your notes are stored securely in the cloud, so even if you lose your smartphone — you won’t lose your notes.

The other app I recommend you install is [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/about/).

This app is available for iOS, Android and any browser.

If you’ve never used it before, here’s why you should:

• You can capture important dates, such as meetings, birthdays and anniversaries.

• You can set reminders and alarms for key times and dates.

• You can easily view your upcoming days, weeks and months.

• You can share your calendar with other people, such as your partner or colleagues.

• You don’t need to spend a cent (it’s a free app!).

Google Calendar has helped me simplify and streamline my day-to-day life. And, I’m sure it’ll do the same for you, too.

Of course, to get the most out of the Evernote and Google Calendar apps, you’ll need to make a habit of using them. (See the habit improvement section below.)

## Delegation

However strong your willpower and however much energy and drive you have — you are just one person. That means you only have a limited amount of time to work on the things that you want to achieve.

This is why [delegation](https://www.lifehack.org/688325/how-to-delegate-work-the-definitive-guide-for-successful-leaders) is such an important part of a healthy and successful life.

So what exactly is delegation?

I like to describe it as leveraging time from an outside source to give you opportunities to increase your quality time.

Let me give you an example to show you what I mean.

You’re no fan of gardening, but you hate to see your lawn at the back of your house turning into a jungle! So, every week or so in the summer, you head to the shed and pull out your rusty old lawn mower. It’s not great at cutting grass anymore, but with persistence, it does the job. From start to finish, you spend about 2 hours to get your lawn looking half-decent.

But, as I mentioned, gardening is not your thing. And quite frankly, having to regularly cut the grass has become a painful chore that eats into your free time on the weekends.

There is a solution to your problem…

You could choose to hire a professional gardener, or even a neighbor kid to help out–you simply need someone who could come every week to cut your lawn and look after your flower beds, etc. Not only would this save you the hassle of doing the work yourself, but it would also give you a few hours of extra free time a month. You could use this for whatever you fancied, perhaps learning a musical instrument, writing a book or just for meeting up with friends and family.

Of course, it’s not just gardening you might want to delegate. Think about delegating things that fall into the following three categories:

1. Tasks that you don’t enjoy doing — perhaps cleaning your car or preparing your tax returns.

2. Tasks you shouldn’t do — you might enjoy fixing your washing machine, but it’s likely to take you much longer than getting an expert to fix it quickly.

3. Tasks you can’t do — for example, if you want to set up a website for your business, but you don’t have any technical skills, then you’ll probably want to hire a website developer.

Once you’ve decided what you’re going to delegate, then start delegating it!

It’s at this point that you’ll begin to see the tangible benefits to your life. You’ll have more energy, more time, and you’ll also feel freer and happier than you’ve done in ages.

## Habit Improvement

We all have habits — some good and some bad!

However, you may not have thought about just how much bad habits can cause you to waste time.

One quick example of this relates to the start of the day.

If you wake up with an alarm, do you get out of bed immediately when the alarm goes off, or do you hit the snooze button (perhaps several times)?

Snoozing might seem like a good thing at the time, but it’s definitely a bad habit. Even if you only snooze for 10 minutes in a morning, that’s an hour a week that you could use to practice your hobbies or even to help build your career.

Fortunately, snoozing is just a habit. And, habits can be changed.

Let’s see how it’s done…

First, you need to understand how habits are formed.

Picture in your mind when you learned to drive a car. At the beginning, it was nothing short of nightmarish. The pedals, the mirrors, the maneuvering, the parking! After your first few lessons, you probably thought of giving up. But, your determination was strong, and you persisted with your lessons. And, a couple of months later you were rewarded with a successful driving test pass.

While the lessons you had were certainly helpful, the real reason for you becoming a proficient driver was the power of habits. Just think how many times you practiced changing gears, reversing into parking spaces, etc. The first few times proved embarrassingly bad, but as you persisted, you became better and better — and eventually the required skills and techniques became habits for you.

This is how all habits are formed: the constant repetition of a specific behavior.

Of course, once a habit has been adopted, it’s very hard to break (just think about the difficulties people have quitting alcohol or cigarettes).

But, there is a way to do this…

Instead of trying to break a habit, work on replacing it with something more positive.

For instance, coming back to snoozing, if you force yourself to get out of bed when your alarm goes off, you could then use the next 10 minutes or so for some gentle exercise. Now, this would probably be a very difficult thing to do for the first few days. But, keep going, and not only will it get easier to replace your snoozing with exercise, but after a few weeks, it will become a habit for you.

In other words, your old, negative habit will have been replaced by a new, positive one.

## Reclaim Your Time

So now you know the secrets to drastically increasing your free time.

Use your smartphone to improve your time management and to schedule your tasks, and replace your time-wasting habits with productive alternatives.

All that’s left is for you to begin taking action.

As the famous proverb states:

“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”

Take yours now!

# Why Obstacles Help You Awaken Your Greatest Potential

## Photo by David Beatz on Unsplash

## Victory Is Attainable
> # “Success is determined not by whether or not you face obstacles, but by your reaction to them. And if you look at these obstacles as a containing fence, they become your excuse for failure. If you look at them as a hurdle, each one strengthens you for the next.” — Ben Carson, Gifted Hands

Two identical acorns from the same oak tree are planted in distinct locations. One is grown in the middle of a dense forest while the other on a steep hill by itself. The oak on the steep hillside is exposed to frequent storms and fierce gale winds. As a result, its roots plummet deep into the earth spreading in every direction, enfolding giant boulders to secure its position. While the tree isn’t growing fast enough, the growth is occurring underground. It is as though the roots know they must protect the tree from the threatening elements by positioning itself firmly beneath the soil. The acorn planted in the forest becomes a weak, frail sapling having to compete with other giant oaks for nutrients and space. Since protected by neighbouring trees larger and stronger, the little oak does not see the need to spread its roots for support. Obstacles compel us to turn our weaknesses into strengths, instead of cowering from them as many people do. They are **not to be surrendered to but to be overcome**, for in overcoming them do we gain the inner conviction and resilience to succeed.

## Develop A Resilient Mindset
> # “Wanting something is not enough. You must hunger for it. Your motivation must be absolutely compelling in order to overcome the obstacles that will invariably come your way.” — Les Brown

**Obstacles illuminate the path to success by exposing challenges in which to prevail, thus ensuring victory is attainable. **They are goal-posts leading us towards goal achievement. Consider your most recent motivation to pursue a goal. What obstacles emerged along the way? How did you overcome it What insights did you gain? For several clients whom I’ve worked with over the years, the single biggest impediment to success occurs months into their campaign. Enthusiasm gives rise to unforeseen obstacles which impose upon their success. Yet contained within each obstacle, is a renewed optimism to gain valuable lessons and key insights. Obstacles highlight limiting beliefs or neglected emotional conflicts, which need our attention if we are to meet success. It is the opportunity to reconcile with facets of our character opposed to the obstacle.

Take for example the fear of success, which cripples individuals well before they set out towards pursuing their goal. By attending to our fears before realising our achievements, we are better suited to savour the victory when it arrives. **A successful person inundated with fear is no more successful than the sum of his fears**, looming over him akin to a dark cloud. Obstacles reinforce a resilient mindset by allowing us to develop mental fortitude, mainly when victory is attainable. It underscores the person we have become in light of the obstacles faced. Comparable to the acorn tree roots plummeting deep into the earth, life exposes weeds from our psyche if we stay attentive to the lessons learned. **Thus, obstacles serve as necessary mental and emotional growth. **Obstacles may be regarded as a transitory state, yet our thoughts relating to the obstacles may become permanent.

## The Path Toward Success
> # “Often it isn’t the mountains ahead that wear you out, it’s the little pebble in your shoe.” ― Muhammad Ali

Obstacles are not the cause of our problems. Our reaction to the obstacles which highlight an error in our thinking is what needs our attention. It is vital to appreciate nothing is fixed nor permanent. Life is subject to change, which rise and fall in a cyclical fashion. **Every so-called problem contains the seed of opportunity and the womb of creation**. If we stay attentive to the underlying lessons, we can transform the experience into personal triumph. Our obstacles give way to fundamental lessons and breakthroughs since they reinforce vital clues leading to success. **Every attempt to overcome an obstacle strengthens a pathway to success. **It is not in overcoming the obstacle that we prevail. It is by being observant to the lessons conveyed on account of the obstacle, that we gain valuable insights. As you reflect on your recent challenges, pause for a moment to consider the lessons gained to overcome them. Contemplate your answer to the following question: “What does the greater intelligence within me seek to learn from this experience?” There is always a greater lesson vested in the personal discovery of a gift you are yet to harness. As you awaken that potential, the path toward success is illuminated.

# The Power Of Your Words

## Be Impeccable With Your Words

![](0*CLux-gnXWstzX8Fw)
> “Whatever happens around you, don’t take it personally… Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves.” ―Don Miguel Ruiz

### **Food For Thought**

## **Be Impeccable With Your Words**
> # *“Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.”*

It’s an age-old kids’ rhyme… but how true is it really?

We’ve all felt our fair share of physical pain — bruises, scratches, broken bones — but when compared to emotional hurt, which one is harder to shake?

For most injuries, there is little pain after the initial shock. Our cuts heal, bruises go away, and bones fuse back together. But when someone calls you a name, gossips about you, or says something mean, it sticks in your head a lot longer than the memory of physical pain does.

The truth is… words have power. They can hurt, and they can heal. They can tear down someone’s world or build it up.

That’s why we need to be careful with what we say. **We must be impeccable with our words.**

### **Word Origin: Impeccable**

Peccable comes from the Latin word “pecatus”, which means “sin.” The “im” in impeccable means “without.” So, impeccable means “without sin.”

### **Word Origin: Sin**

A sin is anything that you do which goes against yourself, what you value, or what you believe. In Hebrew, the word “chait” is often translated to “sin.” A closer interpretation of the word is “to make a mistake,” or “to be off the mark.” So a “sin” is something that misses the mark of what you value yourself to be.

To be impeccable therefore means not going against yourself.

And to be impeccable with your words means being careful that what you say does not go against the values you hold to be true.

Your words have the power to both create and destroy. It’s a shame that humans often use words thoughtlessly.

We are loose-lipped and don’t properly vet our thoughts before they come tumbling out of our mouths.

We forget just how much impact what we say can have on someone, either positively or negatively. The words we choose to use build our own reality and build the reality of those around us.

Be thoughtful about what you say. Every time you open your mouth is an opportunity to stay true to yourself and what you value… or an opportunity to stray from that path. 🤗

This point — to be impeccable with your word — is part of a book by Don Miguel Ruiz called *The Four Agreements, *which we will be highlighting this week in Mission Daily! Here’s the schedule:

> Those pebbles in our shoes are made of Conflict Language. Countless instances of ‘don’t’, ‘can’t’, and ‘haven’t’; constantly giving up our power by blaming others and relentless indecision. These things cause epic amounts of pain for ourselves, our loved ones and the world around us.”

# Patience&#58; It takes three years to accomplish anything meaningful

## Patience: It takes three years to accomplish anything meaningful

Whenever I get impatient waiting for results, I remind myself that it takes three years to accomplish anything meaningful.

This has been my experience, anyway.

After college, I spent three years in a gray cubicle in Nebraska. I learned how to live in the “real world,” I built financial padding, and I spent nights building web design skills. Then I got discovered by a Silicon Valley startup.

I spent three years in Silicon Valley, learning how to believe in myself and my own ideas. Then I was ready to go out on my own.

I spent three years experimenting in a cold Chicago apartment. I left Silicon Valley in the midst of a boom just to follow my ideas. Then I got a book deal to write my [first book](http://designforhackers.com).

Now it’s been about three years since I moved to Colombia to double down on writing and podcasting. My [book](http://geni.us/F6eL) is starting to do very well (Seth Godin [endorsed it](https://seths.blog/2018/07/books-worth-reading/)), and my [podcast](https://kadavy.net/blog/archive/love-your-work/) is gaining traction, too.

Yes, you can get a lot done in a year. You can get a lot done in a day. You can even get a lot done in ten minutes. But it takes three years to really accomplish —to build and combine a mixture of new skills, and get buy-in from the rest of the world.

The first year, you’re trying to find the right direction to go. The second year, you’re going that direction. The third year, you’re trying to get someone to notice.

I don’t know if Abraham Lincoln really said this, but he said it in the movie, *Lincoln*: “Time is a great thickener of things.”

To really accomplish something, not only do you have to change your skills and mindset, but you also have to change those of the people around you. At first, they don’t believe in you, if they notice you at all. You’re not that good, anyway.

It takes time to believe in yourself. It takes time to get good enough to earn that belief. If it takes time do that, imagine how long it takes to change the opinions of others.

Unfortunately, three years feels like a really long time. When you’re in the midst of something new, struggling to feel like you have any idea what you’re doing, it seems as if you’ll never get anywhere. That’s when you can remind yourself: It takes three years to accomplish anything meaningful.

When you get there, I promise: The view of the path behind you is beautiful.

# This Can Be Your Life If You Choose It.

## Illustration by Oliver Munday

I was sitting down last week with a friend for lemongrass and ginger teas — because that’s how we roll in Melbourne.

My friend was telling me his recent life challenges and why he’d stopped replying to everybody’s messages.

I’ll get to the point: he’d got stuck in the daily grind.

### Your life is not this:

* Wake up

* Eat breakfast

* Go to work

* Have lunch

* Come home

* Ask your partner how their day was

* Play with kids (if you have them)

* Look forward to the weekend

* Go to bed

* Rinse and repeat

If this is how your life is, chances are you’re going to have challenges. Not because these daily activities are a problem but because there’s so much more to life.

When every day is the same, and you don’t know why, you become lost.

## What do I mean by lost?

You go back to old ways. In my friend’s case, his mental health issues kicked in again. He started feeling sorry for himself. He lost his way.

For me, getting lost looks like going back to a state of negativity. A state where the world is against me and everything feels impossible.

## Your life can be different if you choose it to be.

This is not hyperbole. Your life can be different.
> How?
> By not getting stuck in the daily grind. The way you do this is by being present. Noticing right now instead of looking down at your phone.

You can also break your routine. Don’t do the same thing every day. Add some small twists and turns to how you do things.

Your life doesn’t have to be boring and full of routines. Habits are good to have as long as they don’t become 99.9% of your day. Having nothing but habits takes the variety out of your day.

You end up thinking the same way day in and day out. This stops you from seeing the endless opportunities that are available to you if you can only see them.

## There has to be meaning.

No matter how big or how small, meaning gives you a reason to wake up outside of just following some pre-defined routine.

My friend that was going through issues last week didn’t have a meaning. He’d forgotten why he came to work. To shake up his reality, I told him about the day before where I’d volunteered at the local homeless shelter.

He asked me why I did it.

I told him *“It gets you out of your head. It makes you think and feel completely different. You stop feeling sorry for yourself. It reminds you of what it’s like to have a meaning.”*

## We make the mistake of thinking everyone’s life is perfect except ours.
> # “I get this all the time. People think I live some rockstar blogging lifestyle full of free lunches, endless high-fives, smiles and opportunities. The reality couldn’t be further from this fake idea”

I have the same battles and challenges. 
I get stuck in routines too. 
I sometimes chase productivity over meaning as well.

No one has a straight flush of perfect days where all their hopes and dreams come true. Rejection, punches to the face, and disappointment affect us all.

> The way you choose the good life is to acknowledge and push through the difficult parts of life.

As hard as I try, some days just suck. Some days I don’t feel like writing or my career is in the dumps.

The only difference is what you choose.

For me, I choose to keep moving forward. I choose optimism even when nothing makes sense and all the chips are stacked against me.

There’s no secret hack other than choosing to not settle for a life of routine and one that contains no variety.

You get to make that choice. That’s the difference.

The life you want is your choice. It’s not made for you.

Choose to change things up.

# Why Your Old Friends Are More Powerful Connections Than Your Close Friends

## 

Growing up, Michelle McKenna-Doyle was always a fan of sports, specifically football. Her passion for football ran in the family. Her father was a devoted fan of legendary quarterback Joe Namath, and her brother accepted a full scholarship to play football at the University of Alabama. Indeed, her father was almost certain he would see his child make it to the NFL one day. And he was right — it just wasn’t his son. McKenna-Doyle’s career took a winding path, but eventually she found herself in the Chief Information Officer role for several different Fortune 500 companies.

One day — while checking her fantasy football league — she stumbled upon a job listing on the NFL website and eventually she decided she would apply. But she had no connection to the NFL, so she started exploring her network. The closest lead she could find was a former colleague, who worked for an executive search firm. His company wasn’t handling that particular search, but he knew who was and made the introduction. His referral helped Michelle interview with the senior leaders of the league, and she got the job as CIO. On the day she started, she had been given the highest office a female executive had ever held in the league. And her father finally got to see one of his children make it in the NFL.

Our tendency when things get tough is to seek out trusted, familiar counsel. When we need a new job, for example, we default to those close to our network. We tell our friends and family, but ironically skip over our weak ties and go right to coldly responding to job postings online. Or when we need advice about a major problem, we tend to only share our dilemma with those close to us — those we feel comfortable around. But that comfort comes at a cost. Most of the strong ties in our network are connected to each other. They are often so tightly clustered that information known by one person is already known by everyone else in that cluster.

But, as [I found while researching my new book](http://amzn.to/2up15sv), it’s actually our weaker connections that often build a bridge from one cluster to another and thus give us access to new information — not unlike McKenna-Doyle’s old colleague who now worked in the executive search world. Even though the strong ties in our life are more likely to be motivated to help us, it turns out that weak ties information may be more valuable than the strong ties’ motivation.

This counterintuitive finding first came from a now classic study by sociologist Mark Granovetter. In 1970, Granovetter was a PhD student at Harvard University and decided to conduct a study of job transitions. He asked hundreds of people who helped them find their current job and how often they saw those contacts (often, occasionally, or rarely). When Granovetter looked at the collected results, he found that less than 17 percent of job changes saw their contacts often. Over 55 percent said they saw their contact occasionally and over 27 percent said rarely. “The skew is clearly to the weak end of the continuum,” Granvotter [wrote in his 1973 paper presenting this data](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/225469). “It is remarkable that people receive crucial information from individuals whose very existence they have forgotten.” Over time, other researchers would come up with a shorter name for such a weak ties that used to be stronger — a better name for McKenna-Doyle’s old colleague. They would label them a *dormant ties *and their research would prove just how valuable these weak connections are.

Researchers Daniel Levin, Jorge Walter, and Keith Murningham have been studying the power of dormant ties for almost a decade. Specifically, they have been surveying business executives, encouraging them to deliberately reactivate old connections, and then observing the results. And the results have been quite powerful. In [one experiment](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-power-of-reconnection-how-dormant-ties-can-surprise-you/), the trio asked a group of 224 executives from four executive MBA classes to reconnect with and ask for advice from two people to whom they had not spoken for at least three years and a few people they speak to regularly. Then, they asked the executives to rate the advice received.

As one can imagine, many of these executives were not excited about the idea of cold calling old colleagues and asking for advice. However, as the researchers, and the executives themselves, discovered, the advice from the dormant ties was more likely to be valuable than the advice from current connections. “In spite of their initial hesitation,” the trio wrote, “almost all of the executives in our studies report that they have received tremendous value from reconnecting their dormant relationships.”

Dormant ties are a wealth of new, different, and unexpected insights because they are interacting with other social circles and encountering new experiences but were also once stronger relationships that don’t require much effort to rebuild rapport with.

Like the executives studied, and like McKenna-Doyle no doubt felt, reaching out to old colleagues and friends can be uncomfortable, but the pay off is more than worth it. What can make it especially awkward is only reconnecting when the time comes to find that new job or get counsel on a new project. So don’t wait.

Instead, start today and make reconnecting a habit. Make a list of 4–5 people, just like the executives in the study, and make it a point to reach back out to one per week through email, telephone, or whatever feels best and catch up. If we want to maximize the value of our network, then we need to make sure we are using *all*of our connections and not limiting ourselves to just our current strong ties.

When it comes to new information and opportunities, our weak and dormant ties are much stronger.

# How To Deal With Toxic Coworkers

## 

There are some people who just drain your battery. There are some coworkers that are just negative — that are always angry — that have it out for everybody. If you met them driving out on the street, you’d remember that we invented car horns specifically for jerks like these (okay…not really…but we do seem to use car horns more often for them than whatever reason they were invented for). But car horns that’s probably not a viable option for dealing with the frustration jerks at work can trigger, you do have to share an office with them.

But there is a strategy you can use.

One of the most interesting discoveries we’ve made studying the people and behavior that strains interpersonal relationships is that emotional distance is one of the easiest ways to lessen that impact. If you can find ways to create more emotional space between you and the office jerk, then you’ll experience less frustration and emotional drain. And a few years ago, I learned a trick from Dr. Robert Sutton, a management professor at Stanford University. Sutton told me that the trick for gaining emotional distance is to pretend that you are some sort of anthropologist studying jerks.

So instead of saying, “I’m so frustrated because I have to work with this jerk coworker,” you can reframe and say, “I’m so lucky that I have such a wonderful specimen of jerktitude here to observe.” You can observe and keep track of the jerkish things that they do as a researcher studying the behavior of a foreign culture would.

Carry a little notebook around if you need to. (In fact, that might help on the day that HR finally comes calling.)

Whatever you do, do it in the service of reframing from grief to gratitude that you have wonderful example of jerkish behavior. If you think like an anthropologist — that your job is almost to study this person — then you start putting up a little emotional separator between how they’re acting towards you and you taking it personally. Emotional distance is the key to dealing with toxic coworkers, especially ones from which you can’t get real distance.

Think of yourself as a jerkologist and how fascinated you are with this amazing new specimen.

# I’ve Been Working In Tech For Over 20 Years — And This Is The Best Way I’ve Found To Measure…

## I’ve Been Working In Tech For Over 20 Years — And This Is The Best Way I’ve Found To Measure Employee Success

### And how having well-defined metrics can guide your team in the right direction.

***By [JC Grubbs](https://minutes.co/author/jc-grubbs/), founder of Tandem***
> # *Discussing metrics helps employees realize how much their individual contributions matter to the company.*

The late, great business writer and philosopher Peter Drucker once said: “What gets measured gets managed.”

If you run a business, these are words to live by. But, when measuring success, companies typically make the same two mistakes: either not measuring anything at all, or measuring the wrong things.

Companies that don’t use success metrics typically grow and learn based off of purely anecdotal experiences. They don’t even collect, let alone interpret, the data—which can lead to flawed decision-making and poor outcomes.

On the other side of the coin are the companies that do measure things, just the wrong things-they track metrics that aren’t important overall to the enterprise.

When choosing the metrics by which you’ll measure success, one good place to start is by tying them to your company’s mission. Track things that are directly related to your [company values](https://minutes.co/great-company-culture-is-more-than-perks/), core functions, and overall strategy. If your metrics don’t match up to your guiding principles and goals, you’re not only wasting your time, but drawing focus away from the most important things. And, you’ll likely be picking up false signals that can lead you away from your objectives.

## When you decide how you’re going to measure success, you’re telling your employees, “These are the things that matter most.”

Well-defined metrics guide each team and individual employee in a number of ways:

* **Having clear metrics sets clear expectations.** The lack of specific objectives is one of the biggest issues companies across all industries face. Without setting clear expectations, your employees will lack direction.

* **Easy to understand, visible metrics help employees trust the process-and their co-workers-more. **Teams operate best when everyone knows what everyone else’s expectations are, because it allows people to disengage from their coworkers’ responsibilities. The first lesson drilled into Marines at boot camp is to have complete faith and trust in the person next to them. Creating trust and respect is key for any high-functioning team.

* **Setting clear expectations eliminates employee uncertainty**. If people have wiggle room, they will wiggle-and that creates issues. For example, I always tell my sales team that “bench time” is bad for everyone. It’s bad from a financial standpoint, but even more importantly, people tend to get restless and issues bubble to the surface when a team doesn’t have a goal in front of them.

## The best success-tracking system I’ve found in my career is surprisingly simple.

Our metrics produce signals that warn us when something is off. Investigating those signals leads to vital insights.

When measuring our engineering team, for example, we look at agile development pace, or what we call “velocity.” To measure velocity, we first assign point values to tasks. Then, we look at how many points are “completed” in a given sprint, usually 2 weeks. That number is the team’s velocity, and it’s instructive in helping us plan for the future of a project. It also gives us a lens through which to view productivity over time.

It also helps identify variables we may not have considered. For example, if a team’s velocity is 10 points one week and 50 the next, it probably doesn’t mean they worked one-fifth as hard that first week. More likely, it’s a warning sign that a process simply isn’t working as it should or that some sort of blocker exists.

Another strategy we use is having project leads fill out report cards, which account for everything from project and client management to timelines, budgeting, and production. We measure each area on a red, yellow, green scale. We look at groupings of these ratings over time to find trends. For example, if we notice a yellow or red path forming, we’ll break down our processes, identify root causes, and make adjustments.

In a meeting, you get much more useful information by saying, “Looks like you have a lot of yellow in this area. What’s up?” rather than, “How’s it going?” In a sense, the entire process is simply a question generator-but a well-directed question generator. It ultimately results in precise, insightful answers that lead us to things that need to be addressed.

We’ve been doing this since we started the [company](https://madeintandem.com/), and the questions and what we measure have morphed over time. We now better understand what questions to ask and what’s truly important to us. And we’ve learned it’s an ongoing process that requires constant revisiting in order to consistently receive useful results.

## We’ve found that part of identifying what should be measured includes consulting the people being measured.

I used to create metrics in a vacuum based on my own experience. But the process became exponentially more productive when I started including our project leads and other senior influencers. They deeply understand our mission and core values, so they were able to critically examine potential metrics and identify important things I might have missed, as well as things that we just don’t care about anymore as a company.

Discussing metrics helps employees realize how much their individual contributions matter to the company. It allows them to set their own [goals](https://minutes.co/align-your-personal-goals-with-your-organizational-goals/), in part, and often results in their feeling more ownership over their responsibilities.

This is why it’s so important to not only create success metrics, but constantly revisit them, realign them with your company mission, and ensure you’re measuring the *right* things.

# How To Use Refeeds For Faster Fat Loss

## 
> *“It always seems impossible until it’s done.”*

— Nelson Mandela

The start of any diet is exciting.

You feel motivated by the thought of change, the idea that through the simple acts of eating and exercising you can change your body.

The first few weeks and months usually go well too;

* The weight comes off consistently

* You feel engaged and motivated

* Your diet plan is satisfying

However, slowly but surely the weight loss slows down, your motivation wanes and your feelings of hunger never seem to go away.

Next thing you know you’re binging every weekend.

Putting away pizza, chocolate and popcorn like it’s being discontinued.

Then, BAM, you wake up one morning and realised you’ve gained back all the weight you lost and then some.

## Why Does This Happen?

The answer is set point theory.

Set point theory says that your body has a set weight that it will actively try to maintain in response to your efforts to change it.

When you try to lose weight your body will respond by;

A — Losing weight as a result of your calorie deficit

B — Trying to ‘defend’ it’s preferred set point

This means when you stay in a calorie deficit for a prolonged period of time you *will* lose fat, but the effectiveness of this fat loss will decrease over time.

The body does this through 2 main processes;

* [Adaptive thermogenesis](https://www.liftlearngrow.com/a-e)

* A decrease in the production of the hormone Leptin

These 2 processes conspire against you to slow down the loss of fat, increase hunger and generally make fat loss faster.

## Adaptive Thermogenesis

Adaptive thermogenesis the name for the changes in metabolic processes when dieting for prolonged periods of time and is described as;

*“the decrease in energy expenditure (EE) beyond what could be predicted from the changes in fat mass or fat-free mass under conditions of standardized physical activity in response to a decrease in energy intake.” *([1](https://www.nature.com/articles/0803523))

This basically means that as you diet your daily energy expenditure will decrease over time, often by a large amount, which means your calorie deficit will become smaller and smaller to the point you’re no longer in a calorie deficit at all.

The greater the calorie deficit and the greater the duration of the deficit the higher this reduction in metabolic rate will be ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11010936)).

## Decreased Leptin
> *“Leptin is a mediator of long-term regulation of energy balance, suppressing food intake and thereby inducing weight loss.” ([3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17212793))*

It’s commonly known as the “satiety hormone” because of its effect on your hunger.

Its produced by your body’s fat cells and usually works in conjunction with Ghrelin (which does the opposite of Leptin and increases your hunger) to manage your weight. ([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17212793))

However, when you eat in a calorie deficit Leptin creation is suppressed. This results in increased hunger & cravings.

This is backed by research which shows your diet impacts the secretion of Leptin which in turn affects energy balance and weight change. A study ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12403078)) found that;

1. When at their set point, individuals produce a given amount of leptin and in turn maintain a state of energy balance.

1. Weight gain results in an increased plasma leptin level, which elicits a biologic response characterized in part by a state of negative energy balance

1. Weight loss among both lean and obese subjects results in decreased plasma levels of leptin, which lead to a state of positive energy balance

Now the problem arises when you react to the effects of adaptive thermogenesis and decreased Leptin by;

* Increasing activity

* Reducing calories

Although it seems like a logical response to a decreasing daily calorie need, it is, in fact, counterproductive as any additional fat loss is short-lived whilst the increase in the side effects of being in a calorie deficit is much greater;

* Decreased leptin levels (and an increase in hunger)

* Reduced resting metabolic rate

* Reduced activity levels

* A worse mood

* Lower motivation

As a result, most people quit, vowing that fat loss doesn’t work for them.

However, this doesn’t have to be the case.

There is a better way, a more effective way to overcome your set point and reverse the effects of adaptive thermogenesis and decreased Leptin levels.

The answer is refeed days.

A refeed is commonly described as a planned increase in calories (a little over maintenance) used when dieting to negate some of the downsides of eating in a calorie deficit.

They do this in 2 main ways;

1. Boosting Leptin levels which suppress hunger and encourage the creation of a calorie deficit and in turn weight loss

1. Provide mental reprieve from the rigours of dieting which improves long-term adherence to a calorie deficit

When it comes to refeeding, you want to prioritise a high carbohydrate intake.

This is because the primary goal of a refeed is to raise Leptin levels and research shows ([6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10334310), [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336)) that carbohydrate is far superior in comparison to fat at doing this.

Eating a high carb intake also has the additional benefit of increasing glycogen stores in your muscles and fuelling your workout performance. ([8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336))

With all of this in mind let’s look at how to set up your refeed day.

![](1*dnIecnjQTXrOpyQQzl8Jaw.jpeg)

## How To Setup A Refeed

When it comes to refeed days the first step is to determine how often you should do it. The answer to this question is based on your current situation.

This because the leaner you are and the longer you’ve been in a calorie deficit the more likely you are to be suffering from metabolic adaptation. ([9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19198647))

The guidelines are as follows;

**20% Bodyfat Or More = **Refeed once every month

**15–20% Bodyfat = **Refeed every 2 weeks

**10–15% Bodyfat = **Refeed once a week

**10% Bodyfat Or Less = **Refeed twice a week

To set yourself up for the refeed you want to raise your calories to a little above maintenance (200 calories over is fine) and then set up your macronutrients as follows:

* Protein = 0.8–1g per lb of bodyweight

* Fats = as low as possible (30–40g is what’s largely recommended)

* Carbs = everything else goes to carbs

It’s as simple as that.

Keep your protein constant, fats low, carbohydrates high and refeed your way to leanness.

## Takeaway Point

A normal side effect of dieting is a reduction in daily energy expenditure and the slowing of weight loss.

As a result, many people think they can’t lose weight and give up on their goals. However, this doesn’t have to be the case.

By using strategic refeed days you can help to minimise the impact of these effects and sustain weight loss.

Setup your refeed in 3 simple steps;

1. Determine how often you need to refeed

1. Increase your calories to maintenance level on your refeed day

1. Prioritise a high carbohydrate, normal protein and low fat

1. Go back to your calorie deficit & reap the benefits of a successful refeed

# Embrace the Devil (or Learning to Love the Rising Criticism on Your Road to Success)

## 

I gave the best speech of my life.

It was for a speech contest within my Toastmasters district that preceded the world championships. The winner of the competition would go on to the international contest to face distinguished speakers from around the globe. I had competed and won the three previous tiers of contests to square off against five regionally and nationally-known public speakers. My presentation had everything right: humor, a well-executed delivery, heartwarming anecdotes, and an inspirational message. I took my seat after my speech feeling like a million bucks.

A short time later, the results were announced.

Third place. Not me.

Second place. My name wasn’t called.

First place . . .

Someone else.

Wait!

***What?!***

I sustained my composure (especially since the winner was seated right next to me) but deep down inside I was shocked. And I know what you might be thinking. Maybe I was delusional. Perhaps I hadn’t done as well as I thought.

Well, to put your suspicions to rest, when the winner was announced, I did hear a few muffled gasps from the crowd. After the contest adjourned, four individuals stopped me as I left to express their surprise that I didn’t win. A friend later messaged me to say I should have won, or at least placed.

I considered not using this example, and some of the anecdotes to follow, for fear such narratives may be interpreted as me being a sore loser or griping how the world isn’t fair. And you may still conclude that at the end of this piece. But before you judge, know this:

***I wouldn’t have changed a thing about my performance.***

My best is my best. In the noted example, I believed I was good enough to win. Others felt that way too. But not the judges of that contest. And that’s OK. Those in the audience able to appreciate my message heard it. I spoke to them. That is what matters.

That same mindset of mine — of making an authentic connection, impact, or effort — has been put to the test several times within the past year as lessons of fortitude and perseverance have dogged me at every turn. In what seems nearly every attempt I have taken to improve myself, I have met resistance, mainly in the form of criticism. Criticism — much like that manifested in the aforementioned contest — resulting in rejection.

Rather than dwell on the negative and get discouraged, though, I turned inward. I meditated on what went wrong, learning from my failures and drawing an interesting conclusion, one I never thought an introvert like me would ever grasp.

*I need to embrace the devil.*

No. Not the Prince of Darkness. I’m talking about the demon that haunts all of us on the road to success. The one who tells you that you aren’t good enough, talented, or skilled enough. The devil of doubt who points to your inadequacies and failures as examples that you lack the experience necessary to proceed on the road to your success.

For years — no, *decades* — I listened to this devil and his curses, trying to resist his pessimism though eventually giving in to his doubt. In doing so, I kept myself from taking any number of risks or moves where I may have failed or experienced injury. Perhaps you can relate. For my demons have kept me from . . .

Moving to L.A. to pursue a career as a screenwriter.

Moving to New York to pursue a career as a novelist.

Applying to numerous jobs that were above my so-called paygrade.

Approaching women (when I was still dating) I felt were out of my league.

Networking with strangers to try to advance my career.

And so on and so forth.

There was never any one big moment where I allowed myself to be talked out of taking such risks. Rather, it was those little moments that snowballed and ultimately led to my apprehension. As they say, the devil is in the details. A worrisome thought there would creep into my mind. I would consider it, rationalize my doubt, allowing the fear to set in. Then I would analyze what I dreamed of or wanted against the odds. *How many screenwriters make it in Hollywood? One in a million I suppose.* Such scenarios would play again and again until I finally gave up on the notion of going for it.

That was all my *internal *criticism. Now let’s talk about the *external* kind.

When society rejects you, it can hurt a million times over. Even the most cautious of us experiences it every now and then, in activities so mundane a putting your dating profile out there or submitting your application through a job board. Silence or a lack of response hurts too. It becomes the devil you don’t want to experience, the silent killer, along with all the other demons you seek to avoid.

So with so much criticism out there — so much opportunity for rejection and such — why embrace it?

Five years before that iconic speech contest I started telling you about, I was at a low point in my life. My job was a dead end. My career stalled. In response, I took a good, hard look at myself and knew that if I wanted to do anything to change my situation, I would have to take some real chances.

Though afraid, I did just that. I joined Toastmasters, a public speaking organization, even though speaking in public terrified me. Having grown up with a speech impediment, I always avoided voicing my thoughts or opinions whenever possible, always preferring the written word to the spoken one.

I also started writing my first book. Again, the prospect crippled me. My attempts to make it as a screenwriter had failed. But I knew that I had a story within me, one deserving to see the light of day, if not on the screen, then on the page.

I took a leap and switched from a new career. As a non-published writer, my day job had been in insurance, an industry that I loathed from my core. I had an opportunity to work in human resources, a move that intrigued me yet filled me with anxiety.

In all three scenarios, I took a chance. I joined Toastmasters and began to give speeches. I saw through the completion of my first book. And I stuck with a five-year career in human resources.

The results?

Yes, there was criticism. But there was also something else . . .

My speeches were panned. Though as I went on to speak more and more, I improved. As for my book, I went on to self-publish it. Then there is my career in human resources. Over the past five years, I managed to be promoted five times.

Logic dictates that as you become better at something, your mastery leads to a certain level of improvement. You avoid the mistakes of a greenhorn or first-timer. Your quality of output becomes cleaner. You produce results faster.

And all that improvement leads to less criticism, right?

Well, it can. But if it does, you’re living the wrong life.

As counterintuitive as it may seem, with greater mastery should come an increase of criticism. Yes, that same criticism you fought hard to avoid all your life. Why? Because you have reached a level of competence you’ve never had before. You rise to a new stage, an arena where you battle not amateurs but heavyweights.

Sure, you could stay a big fish in a small pond. As a football star, you could walk away from a mediocre career in the NFL, content on having crushed it in college and high school, where you were adored and everyone knew your name. As an executive, you could stay at a small company of a hundred employees and never aspire to lead a team of thousands, for which you’d have to manage a larger budget, a more diverse workforce, and have many more eyes on you. Or, as an artist, you could remain content with showing your work at local coffeehouses or galleries, never taking a chance to put yourself out there before an agent or manager who represents some of the top talents of your field.

You could avoid that increased threat of criticism like one who steps away from the edge of the sand as the tide rises and threatens to wash over bare feet.

Or you could embrace it.

The devil. The doubt. The criticism. And all the potential for self-improvement, growth, and personal development that comes by taking risks and just going for it.

As they say, with no risk comes no reward. The greater the risk, the greater the reward. What they don’t dwell on is the number of times the risk comes to fruition, of how common deprivation is, in the form of rejection and loss, whether it be in money spent as an investment that never sees a return, or debt that is accumulated in the pursuit of an education, or in just-plain-simple-wounded-pride. Yes, the motivational speakers and self-help gurus often gloss over the finer points of risk, of the devil that threatens to do harm. You and I, however, know better. We know the potential hurt that can come with taking a chance.

Yet, here I write, encouraging you to embrace the potential for criticism, risk, and defeat. On the path to achieving your own brand of greatness, I encourage you to embrace it all anyway.

***Why?***

In less than a month, I’ll self-publish my third book. Those who I have dared to share it with have enjoyed the glimpses they have read. I know it’s the best thing I’ve ever written. Is it *the* best? In my modesty, I can answer no. Still, I press on, to continue pursuing the dream of writing, striving to improve a little with each project.

I just secured two phone interviews for the following week. The open positions are in human resources. Are either my dream career? No. But they are better than any opportunity I’ve ever worked in before.

Tonight, I’ll read a children’s story to my son. Two, actually. Then I’ll tuck him into bed. Will it be the greatest performance of a children’s book ever done? Umm, no . . . But it will be special. It will be a thread in a string of readings I have done for him since he was born, a trend I will continue. This mention might seem mediocre and slight. It is anything but, especially for a shy kid who grew up with a speech impediment, who never imagined having a voice all his own. One to share with his son.

Embrace the devil. Prepare to face the demons that haunt you every day. Face the criticism, rejection, and pain that comes with trying to improve your life.

For out of your attempts, struggles, and efforts will emerge a better you. Not the devil you have encountered. An angel. The best of you.

# From Learning to Code to Writing a Book on App Development&#58; A Trailblazer’s Journey

## Exclusive Interview with Mohith Shrivastava

![](1*_BSX61CxShyqW7oT7Kgc8Q.jpeg)

Mohith Shrivastava, author of the new book* [Learning to Develop Apps on the Salesforce Lightning Platform](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1787124673/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)* shares tips on starting a career as a Lightning App Developer. He also explains how you can quickly advance your skills to create engaging digital experiences and business-changing apps.

Mohith is a technical architect at [CodeScience](https://medium.com/@CodeScience), a company that helps customers build AppExchange applications on [Salesforce](https://medium.com/@salesforce). When a company or individual has an idea for an app, CodeScience assists them every step of the way. Mohith and his team help with everything from planning and design, to finalizing and publishing the app on AppExchange — the world’s largest business app marketplace.

When Mohith joined CodeScience, his initial focus was to become familiar with the market and the problems CodeScience clients were trying to solve. As more businesses bolted their growth levers on to the Salesforce Ecosystem, Mohith helped them design apps with unique features that had different look and feel, functionality, and data requirements. Very quickly, he found himself building fully-functional, business-changing apps that would reach thousands of Salesforce customers.

## **The Act of Giving Back**

After significantly improving his app development skills in just a few years, Mohith decided to write a book and share his knowledge of building apps on Salesforce’s Lightning Platform.

“The aim of this book is to help our developer community increase their base knowledge of the Salesforce’s new [Lightning Application Development Platform](https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/app-dev/lightning-platform/).

The overall idea is to help those who want to become Lightning app developers understand the fundamentals and quickly advance their skills to build highly customized solutions — something that was previously only available to professional developers. In essence, this book bridges the gap between the skills of a Citizen Developer and those of a Professional Developer.”

## **What is a Citizen Developer?**

Ultimately, all the requests for apps come from within the business. So if each department has the tools to build the apps themselves — without having to first reach out to IT — then development time shrinks significantly.

“One of the things Salesforce offers you is Lighting App Builder, where you can drag and drop the components that Salesforce provides out of box for you to solve that particular problem. There’s a component if you want to show all the details about an object, if you want to show the related list, or use flows to configure business logic, make screens, forms, and more.

Citizen Developers are the next frontier of application development in the enterprise. This movement essentially democratizes application development and makes it available to non-technical people. Platforms like Lightning are the tools business people need to ride this new wave of IT.”

![](1*p9UzPH-sKXBJ9BzzMmazig.png)

## **Advancing the Rank from ‘Citizen’ to Professional**

Of course, for many Citizen Developers, their foray into application development is just to meet a business need in order to do their day jobs.

But for some, Citizen Development becomes something they really enjoy. They treat it like a hobby and start discovering more ways to customize apps — for example, adding AI or integrating data from other systems.

For such developers, Mohith’s book is perfect. It helps them take their customization chops to the next level by showing how they can use the Lightning component framework to add building blocks, customize the user interface, and more!

Additionally, the book goes into the basics of using SalesforceDX — Salesforce’s environment for source-driven development which makes it super easy to build and update apps at scale.

## **For Business and IT Leaders: Where to Find Developer Talent**

Mohith’s advice is:

“The best resource is online communities. Whether that’s a [Salesforce’s Trailblazer Community](https://success.salesforce.com/featuredGroupDetail?id=a1z30000006IDYtAAO#a0L3000000Rq7JgEAJ), or just Stack Exchange. Within these communities where a lot of people collaborate, you will find people who force their queries and community members to actually step in and help with the solving of that particular problem. Those would be my go-to resources to find talent because you really can look into each profile, see how many answers they have submitted, and what the quality of the answers are. There is little chance of going wrong when you hire someone from a community like that because you can actually see their resourcefulness and immediate knowledge.

The second way is looking at some of the open-source projects. So, we can go to something like GitHub and look for some of those open-source projects on Salesforce and find who actually authored them, who are the contributors, and find out about their journey. You can find a lot of talent here because they actually have the experience of building an open-source application and using the technology. ”

## **Advice for Developers-to-Be?**

“Yes! Obviously the first few days of anything that you learn is going to be challenging, whether it is driving or learning to develop an application. It’s always going to be challenging trying to learn new things, but it gets easier the more you learn, especially if you pay proper attention. Continuously improving on your skill set is one of the things I would advise, meaning try and really work on actual projects rather than just reading stuff.

One of the things that I’ve observed is when you actually learn by doing in software, you try to understand things in a more holistic manner — the deeper you go, the more your interest and curiosity levels increase. So be curious.

Go and actually build things. Act upon it rather than just reading and forgetting about what you read.”

# 14 Characteristics of an Entrepreneur Bound for Success

## 

Nine out of ten startups will fail. Do you have what it takes to succeed?

It might seem like the founders who succeed have some inherent edge — some intangible and elusive quality that sets them apart from the pack. But the truth is, the most successful [entrepreneurs](https://mobilemonkey.com/blog/2018/01/best-instagram-business-account) have a well rounded and developed set of skills that complement a specific set of traits.

Understanding the skills and traits of successful entrepreneurs helps sharpen your own focus, guiding which areas you’ll need to focus on to improve your own chances of success.

For example, [basic coding skills](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-to-choose-which-programming-language-to-learn-infographic.html) have become incredibly important for entrepreneurs, who need to understand the technology even if they’re not actually doing the coding work themselves. Thankfully, the barriers to building those skills are low, and you can easily [take coding courses for free online](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/7-more-places-to-learn-to-code-for-free.html).

It might be more difficult to develop the characteristics of an entrepreneur most likely to succeed, like persistence and the ability to accept failure, but it can be done. Often, these [personality traits](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/4-major-personality-types-amp-ideal-careers-for-each-one-infographic.html) are learned over time and only through experience, which is why you may see founders succeeding [only after they’ve failed many times](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/avoid-these-18-entrepreneurial-mistakes-for-a-more-successful-start-up.html)!

Other skills to focus on in order to increase your startup’s chance of success include developing your ability to make data-driven decisions, marketing savvy and accounting or bookkeeping. These are [universal skills](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/8-skills-your-child-needs-to-be-the-next-great-entrepreneur.html) that will serve you well in any venture you attempt, whether you’re actually having to do much of the legwork yourself in your early days, or simply needing to understand how the different parts of your business work in order to [hire the best talent](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/why-you-shouldnt-hire-someone-from-harvard.html) and make the most informed decisions.

This recent infographic from open university Udacity serves as a visual list of character traits and skills most critical to entrepreneurial success. Its creators interviewed experts including Eventbrite’s Julia Hartz, [Mark Cuban](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/billionaire-mark-cuban-s-unusual-tech-investment-strategy.html), and Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky and shared their best advice for entrepreneurs as part of the infographic.

# How Writing for One Hour a Day Can Improve The Quality of Your Life

## “shallow focus photography of person in white and black striped top writing on white paper” by Lonely Planet on Unsplash

When most people think about developing a writing habit, they imagine having to spend countless hours in a quiet room isolated from the rest of the world. This keeps them from trying to develop a writing habit at all. But you can accomplish remarkable things in just[ one focused hour a day of uninterrupted creation time](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-power-of-one-focused-hour-a-day-22e4851f89b1).

We overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a year. An hour a day doesn’t sound like a lot of time when we look at it in isolation. But when you add it up throughout the year, it’s the equivalent of 15 full days. Just imagine what would happen if you committed 15 full days to one project or idea. You would make a lot of progress.

In writing for a just one hour a day, I come up with ideas for blog posts, sections for the books I’m writing, and reflect on the key insights I’ve gained from conversations with guests on The Unmistakable Creative podcast. Writing for one hour every day produces an exponential ROI and an infinite value that can’t be measured. Writing for one hour a day can improve the quality of both your personal and professional life.

## Compounding Effect and Professional Growth

Because [habits are the compound interest of self-improvement](https://unmistakablecreative.com/habits-are-the-compound-interest-of-self-improvement/), you may not notice any significant changes in the first week, month, or several months of writing. It was something I experienced firsthand when I started writing 1000 words a day in 2013.

* Within 2 months of starting the habit, AJ Leon invited me to speak at his first conference.

* I self-published 2 books

* Soon after, my writing began to resonate with my readers like it never had in the 4 years prior

* The talk I gave at the conference became the foundation for The Art of Being Unmistakable.

* After continuing the habit for 2 years, I landed my first book deal

Because we only see the results of most people’s efforts we tend to undervalue incremental progress. When I asked peak performance coach Renita Kalhorn what separated her clients who produced results from those who don’t, she said it’s a willingness to set micro goals and focus on the process instead of the prize. Just because you can’t immediately see the progress, it doesn’t mean you aren’t making any.

## Improvements in Mental Health

It might seem strange that a daily writing habit could improve your mental health. But as I wrote in an [Audience of One](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733), “If I plotted out my levels of happiness on a graph, the peaks would always be when I was writing or working on a creative project of some sort.”

* Anxiety is mostly the result of feeling that we have no control over our lives. The beauty of writing every day is that we have an element of our life that we can control. At the same time, the blank page always contains a mystery that will unfold.

* **Presence:** Most of our suffering is the result of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. But when we do deep work like writing for an hour a day, it pulls us into the present moment. We’re able to live in the moment while keeping our eyes on the horizon.

* **Something to Look Forward To**: According to most happiness researchers, having something to look forward to has a significant impact on our well being.

* **Healing Trauma: **While I wouldn’t consider it a viable substitute for therapy and counseling, writing about our painful experiences can cause them to lose their power over us. By getting things out of our head and onto the page, we’re able to see the circumstances of our lives more objectively.

Before my daily writing habit, there were days of the week when I dreaded getting up in the morning. Now, my mornings are my favorite part of the day.

## Figure out where you currently spend your time

Chances are you already spend an hour a day doing something that is not aligned with your essential priorities. Download a tool like Rescuetime and let it run in the background. At the end of the week, you’ll have a strong sense for where and how you’ve spent your time. Was it time well spent or was it time wasted on shallow, temporarily intoxicating digital validation in the form of likes and hearts?

## Commit to The Easiest Part of the Process

The biggest obstacle most people face when it comes to developing new habits is getting started. So rather than commit to an hour a day, commit cracking open a notebook or sitting in a chair. The inertial will eventually carry you into following through on the habit.

## Getting the most of out of your 1-hour

If you’re going to get the most out of 1 hour of writing, you have to create the right conditions. You have to increase your attention span by reducing the competition for it. In an Audience of One, I recommended the following framework:

1. **Set everything up the night before**: For most people, I suggest they do their writing first thing in the morning. By setting up everything you need (i.e., pen, notebooks, etc.) the night before, you increase the likelihood that you’ll follow through. What you’re doing is designing an environment that is conducive to the person you want to become.

1. **Leave your Phone Out of the Room: **You’ll be amazed by how much your productivity increases just by leaving your phone out of the room for an hour each day.

1. **Drown out the noise:** Use a pair of noise cancellation headphones. Put an instrumental or techno track on repeat.

1. **Use distraction-free writing software**: Unlike a word processor, distraction-free writing software has limited functionality. You can’t do much in it other than write.

1. **Use a distraction-blocking tool:** It’s tempting to depend on willpower to resist distraction. But it rarely works because you have a limited supply of willpower. Tools like Rescuetime reduce your dependence on willpower and force you to focus.

## James Clear’s Idea Generation Framework

[I recently interviewed ](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/proven-way-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones-james-clear/)[James Clear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear) [on The Unmistakable Creative Podcast](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/proven-way-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones-james-clear/) about his new book, Atomic Habits. Because he writes some of the most well-researched articles I’ve read, I wanted to understand how he did it. This the process he shared with me:

You’re coming across ideas all the time right like when we talk in this conversation. I think you need to have a central holding ground where you just put all the ideas in your life whether it’s from a conversation or a book. For me, that’s Evernote. I have a notebook in Evernote titled articles. Whenever I come across an interesting idea, I dump it into there. Sometimes it’s just a title for an article. Sometimes it’s one sentence. Occasionally I’ll riff for a little while, maybe a couple of paragraphs. But all of that goes in the same folder.

I typically write either earlier in the morning or before lunch or late at night Whenever I’m sitting down to do that; I’ll go to that list and look through all the notes that are in there. I have hundreds of these. I start to look for ones that connect in some way. Sometimes I have a couple of articles that are in progress. They’re just like holding grounds for ideas.

Then, occasionally I’ll go through and try to find ideas that are on the same topic. Let’s say that you have five things that are related to creativity. So, I pull those ideas and put them into the same note. Then an article starts to take shape loosely.

I can see which holes are there and what things I need to research a little bit more. So then maybe I’ll pick up a book or do some research on some of the things that are missing or some questions I have. As that starts to build out a little bit and gets closer to a thousand or 2000 words, I break it into five sections.

There’s an introduction. Then I make this point and then make the next point. And then I have some practical takeaway, and then there’s the conclusion. It’s not always five pieces, but I kind of chunk the article out like that. Then I’m moving those chunks around to figure out broadly where they fit. Once I get to that point, I usually put it into WordPress so I can see what it looks like on the page. That’s really when the real work begins for me. So all of that kind of precursor to getting to that point is mostly a collection of ideas and just trying to get the general shape of the article.

## From Focus to Flow

In an interview with Chase Jarvis, Steven Kotler said it takes roughly 90 minutes to get into a state of flow. In a state of flow, you’re likely to experience a 500% increase in productivity. By the time you finish writing for 1 hour, you’ll find yourself dancing on the edges of flow or be in it. What took you 45 minutes you’ll be able to do in 15. Your reflexes will be sharper, and your sentences will be more coherent.

Don’t underestimate what you could accomplish in one hour a day. I’ve built the majority of my body of work in about an hour a day. When it comes to any habit, whether that’s writing or going to the gym, frequency matters more than intensity. Habit is the precursor to becoming a master of your craft. If you’re willing to give something one hour a day, you might end up doing the greatest work of your life.

If you write for an hour a day, you’ll have a reason to get up in the morning and have something to look forward to. As a result, you’ll be happier and more fulfilled. Once you’ve developed the habit of writing every day, it’s something that you’ll likely do for the rest of your life. You’ll become the author of your life story because words are the building blocks of all creation. With the power of words, we shape our reality and become the architects of our destiny. Of all my habits, hobbies, and rituals, nothing has done more to improve the quality of my personal and professional life than writing for an hour each day. As Dani Shapiro wrote in her book Still Writing “I believe you can learn everything you need to know about life from an ongoing attempt to write.”

# Great Story, Wrong Title&#58; The 1 Simple Reason Why Truly Brilliant People Get So Little Views On…

## Great Story, Wrong Title: The 1 Simple Reason Why Truly Brilliant People Get So Little Views On Their Content

### Which title are you more likely to click on?

***By [Nicolas Cole](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77), founder and CEO of Digital Press***

As someone who has written thousands of articles on the Internet, as well as helped over 150 founders, investors, speakers, and professional athletes write articles of their own, I’ve learned a thing or two about what it takes to get someone to “pay attention.”

I’ve experienced this same scenario [more times than I can count](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/comparing-myself-to-millionaires-and-billionaires-5-unforgettable-life-lessons-i-learned-before-turning-29/):

I find my way to a Venture Capital firm’s website. On the footer, I see a few social links. One of them is a link to their Medium blog (or the personal Medium page of one of the firm’s partners). And before the page even loads, I know exactly what I’m about to find.

* I anticipate three, maybe four posts total, with no real consistency or long-term commitment.

* I anticipate ambiguous titles, of which my only reason to click would be to answer the question, “Who on earth would do this?”

* I anticipate a blurry header image, compliments of Google images.

* I anticipate no real introduction, no real frame of the argument. No subheaders to guide the reader along. Just big blocks of text, paragraph after paragraph.

* **And most of all,** I anticipate very little engagement.

And sure enough, everything I’ve anticipated is right there, in plain sight, for me to stare and say to myself, “How is this a good representation, in any way, of the firm’s leadership and perspective on the business world?”

## There is 1 very simple reason why such brilliant, successful, even well-known people get so little views on their content.

I’ve seen it with renowned Silicon Valley investors.

I’ve seen it with legendary creative directors, renowned public speakers.

I’ve even seen this happen with New York Times best-selling authors.

Expertise isn’t the issue. Knowledge and experience and memorable stories are plentiful from these kinds of people. Even their chicken scratch shifts your perspective and leaves you thinking about the world differently.

What’s unfortunate is that more people won’t benefit from those brilliant insights. Because they won’t be clicking on the article in the first place.

## And I can tell you exactly why.

As someone who has written thousands of articles on the Internet, as well as helped over 150 founders, investors, speakers, and professional athletes write articles of their own, I’ve learned a thing or two about what it takes to get someone to “pay attention.”

Here’s the big secret: you could have a great story, you could have the most eye-opening insight the world has ever heard, but it only matters (on the internet) if you get the frame right.

And that starts with the title.

## Let me give you an example.

Which title are you more likely to click on?

1. *Evernote And Why*

1. *The Story Of Evernote: How 1 Sporadic Decision Led To The Company’s Flagship Product Feature*

(FYI — I was just using Evernote, hence the example. I have no idea whether or not 1 sporadic decision led to the company’s flagship product feature. But it sure sounds like a great title, no?)

You’d have to be crazy to tell me that Title #1 is more compelling than Title #2. How? In what universe would you find yourself scrolling through your Facebook feed of washed-out engagement photos, news links, and viral videos, see the title, “ *Evernote And Why,*” and think to yourself, “Well I just absolutely have to spend the next 37 seconds of my life checking *that* out.”

You wouldn’t. In fact, you probably wouldn’t have even noticed the title in the first place.

You’d have scrolled right past it.

## I’ve been writing online for a long time. I wrote my first blog post when I was 17 years old, and never looked back.

And I can tell you that there is no more valuable skill in today’s digital age than understanding the science behind viral-worthy headlines.

Or, forget the word “viral.” Just the science behind writing *worthy* headlines.

Because unless you can get your potential reader to pause and feel compelled to enter your universe, they won’t. They’ll opt for something easier to understand, faster. And to clarify, that doesn’t mean to “dumb down” your content, or the quality of what you’re saying. It means streamlining your idea, compressing it, fitting the entire arc of your message into a small handful of words-so much so, that the reader can immediately understand the journey you’re about to take them on.

But instead, I find many of the business world’s most brilliant minds, the people who *actually* have something to meaningful to say, would rather opt for “unconventional” titles. “Creative” titles. And in doing so, they think they are achieving some level of mystique and allure-when in reality they’re welcoming ambiguity and confusion.

So, here’s a piece of writerly wisdom: the words “good” and “bad” are inefficient ways to measure effective writing. They’re subjective, at best, and your aim should never be “good” or “bad.”

### Your aim should be clarity.

If the reader can’t immediately understand the road you’re about to take them down, you’ve lost them.

And what good is cutting down a big, brilliant tree with your educated opinions if no one is in the woods to hear it?

# Are Networking Events Worth It?

## 

For a lot of people, networking feels like a four-letter word. The mere mention of the term brings up memories of some reco-mandatory networking event your boss made you attend, or that a friend forced you to go to because you’re on the job hunt. Since I wrote [*Friend of a Friend](http://amzn.to/2up15sv)*, this is one of the biggest objections that I get to networking in general. We’ve all had those sort of uncomfortable feelings while at one of those unstructured, meet-up, cocktail party things. We know from the research that [networking makes us feel dirty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFrqZjIDE44), especially when we have a very transactional mentality to it, and so we don’t want to go to these events.

But are they worth it? Is it worth grinning and bearing it and going to these events?

And the answer — based on research — is no…but also…yes.

In my favorite study of networking events — where they actually tagged people and tracked who they talked to — researchers found that people spent a disproportionate amount of time with people they already knew. On average, participants knew about a third of the room prior to the event, and then they spent 50% or more of their time with people that they already knew. This is despite claiming they were attending in order to meet new people.

What this suggests is that networking events turn out to be a great way to reconnect with weak and dormant ties. However, it also suggests that networking events are not all that effective for meeting new people. If they are an unstructured event, they are poorly suited for making new contacts. If you’re trying to meet new people, it’s a much better idea to work the fringes of your network, your [friend of a friend](http://amzn.to/2up15sv)connections. That is going to allow you to expand the number of contacts much better than hitting up another networking event.

However, if it’s the right industry — if it’s the right event — and you know that people are going, then this research suggest networking events can actually be a great chance to reconnect with your weak and dormant ties. The trick is to know ahead of time who is going to be there. Send them a message ahead of time. Make sure you know that you want to get some time talking with them to catch up and reconnect. Networking events are fantastic for reconnecting with people you already know. But the unstructured nature of them makes them pretty bad for meeting new people.

So, are networking events worth it? No. But also, yes.

It all depends on what your plan of action is once you get there. But you need have a plan of action. So make a plan in line with the research. Specifically, make a plan to use the event to reach back out to your weak and dormant ties.

# The SaaS Learning Curve

## (or, why SaaS = Service as a Software)

![](1*wJ28sLvF2Abc6DD2aL3lWQ.jpeg)

*Originally published by [Sean Sheppard](https://twitter.com/seanasheppard) on the [GrowthX Blog](https://growthx.com/saas-learning-curve-saas-service-software/).*

The SaaS Learning Curve for most founders is longer than it needs to be. So long that it outpaces most early funding, leaving founders short of the traction milestones required for their next funding round.

![](0*3zXuZKNhkNbd0vwb.png)

Founders can avoid this outcome with one simple but powerful realization: It’s not your technology that wins, but the insights you generate by seeking fit within a market.

That’s worth Tweeting, don’t you think?

That means you need to resist the temptation to focus on building a product and spend your time (and early funding) on working closely with early customers in solving a specific problem. A problem large enough to sustain you through the learning curve.

Here’s a trick to make this easy (please share):
> # Start thinking of SaaS as Service as a Software, not Software as a Service. [**CLICK TO TWEET](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Start+thinking+of+SaaS+as+Service+as+a+Software%2C+not+Software+as+a+Service.+&via=seanasheppard&related=seanasheppard&url=https://growthx.com/saas-learning-curve-saas-service-software/)**

## Service First Makes for Better Software

People don’t care about your products. They care about their problems. If you can solve their problems partially today via Service as a Software and more fully over time via Software as a Service then you will increase your chance of winning. This requires you to be high touch and low tech until you no longer have to be.

![](0*NHqoP5nQ43IpxnaT.png)

Servicing your customer accelerates your learning. Your best opportunity to learn and build what you want is by manually servicing your customer. It can take years to build a self-service product. So build a service-first culture and leverage that approach to build what your customers want.

## There’s No Shame in Leading with Service

The now-common refrain from the investment community about predictable, recurring licensing revenue puts pressure on founders which is not always correct. As such, it has convinced a generation of SaaS founders that they’re failing if they have to lean in with services while they are building a more whole and complete software.

This can create a whole host of unhealthy and misaligned behaviors that can result in a longer learning curve which in turn creates the potential need for more time and runway to learn and ultimately reduces win rates.

It’s true that humans don’t scale, but neither do startups that build interesting features without solving a market need. In the early days, you’re not ready for scale. A services mindset helps you find fit with a market need (and, ultimately, something worth scaling).

## Adopt a Service-First Mindset

A Service as a Software approach helps you develop deeper insights into the problems you’re solving and build a more robust and stickier software solution for your market. Far from worrying, SaaS founders should rejoice when their early customers are asking for service! Where they should worry is if the market doesn’t respond. Silence speaks louder than words!!

Service as a Software is more than an important mindset to help founders focus on problems over features. In some circumstances, services-first can help a SaaS startup beat the competition. Tom Tunguz penned a great blog on this topic. Finish reading this article and then head over to his site to learn why [in early markets, services can be a competitive advantage](http://tomtunguz.com/services-and-solutions-vs-point-products/).

## Selling Vision vs Reality

![](0*KIz_IvckphhPC0vL.png)

Service as a Software does not mean stop selling your vision. It means stop selling your product to customers (as if it’s complete). Instead, recruit early partners who share your vision and are willing to implement your reality. And your reality as an early-stage startup is that most of what you’ve built is riddled with “happy accidents.”

![](0*5WKikI2ewzC6iIK1.png)

A startup is a series of experiments. You need to constantly ask yourself WWBRD (What Would Bob Ross Do). He would celebrate being less wrong tomorrow than he is today! Be like Bob; be a learn-it-all (not a know-it-all).

So how do you identify and recruit early partners? I’m glad you asked

## Recruiting Early Partners

I’m often asked, “which customers do I go after first”? The framework for answering that question starts with asking the same question differently: “Which customers are open to sharing my vision while accepting my reality?”

The answer is in Geoffrey Moore’s must-read book, “[Crossing the Chasm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC119W/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)”. The cohorts most likely to share your vision with an appetite for accepting your reality are referred to as Innovators and Early Adopters. These groups of people are willing to take the risk associated with working with incomplete products to realize a shared vision.

Innovators represent about 10% of the market and will provide you with great product feedback but rarely have a budget. As such, they are quite useful in the pre-revenue stage of a Service as a Software company.

Early Adopters represent another 10–15% of the market and they have a budget. They often buy because they seek a competitive advantage. They see that being achieved by working with you to realize what should become a shared vision for your product.

## The Early Customer Mindset in the SaaS Learning Curve.

Regardless of your customer, all commerce is human to human (until the bots take over). It is vital to recognize that humans rely on the humans building the product to solve their problems; they don’t rely on the product.

After all, when was the last time anyone sought recourse from a product when something goes wrong? Never! They seek recourse from those who convinced them to join them on a wayward journey. They expect service from you, not your product!

## The Early-Stage SaaS Metric that Matters the Most: Learning

The next question I get is “how do I know where I am in the learning curve, or if I’m making progress?” To effectively commercial innovation you need to accept that learning precedes revenue. If you start the journey with a Service as a Software mindset and build a functional learning organization, you will accelerate your path through the SaaS Learning Curve.

This requires you to create an environment that supports rapid on-the-job learning by adopting a growth mindset, developing your business acumen, facilitating cross-functional communication, and embracing ambiguity.

Learning powers your early journey as a Service as a Software founder. It helps you efficiently transition from a non-scalable (but critical) Service as a Software approach to a profitable, predictable and scalable Software as a Service business.

# 5 Ways To Avoid Common CEO Mistakes

## 

As the CEO, you’re responsible for *everything*.

You serve as the public face of your company, liaise between the board of directors and employees, and make sure your team feels heard and happy. For better or worse, your decisions impact every aspect of the business — from the bottom line to employee happiness.

My experience as the CEO of ShipChain has made me realize the importance of prioritizing your long-term vision over short-term profit.

Take Sears, an innovator, an industry “disruptor,” and dominant market force thanks to its mail-order catalog. You could even argue that it pioneered the direct-to-consumer shipping model we’re seeing [in the market today](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/direct-to-consumer-retail-strategies/). Sears could’ve been the world’s leading e-commerce company — there’s no reason why it couldn’t have been as big as Amazon. But the executives ignored the importance of the internet, and today, an American icon is tragically going bankrupt after being in business for more than a century.
> # While not every misstep you make will lead to bankruptcy, each bad decision can cause the company’s reputation to take a hit.

To direct a thriving company as a CEO in any industry, here are five common mistakes to avoid:

## **1. Know when to delegate.**

Executives often fall for the trap of trying to do everything themselves.

After all, you can probably complete a task faster and cheaper than anyone else, and you trust yourself to do it correctly. But unless your company is in its infancy, getting involved in the day-to-day activities is actually more of a hindrance than a help.

### When you’re stuck in the weeds, you don’t have the time or mental clarity to focus on your business’s core vision.

If you’re like most CEOs, you’ve achieved success due to your work ethic and strong personality. But you have to be willing to step back and accept the reality that you can’t do everything *and* effectively guide the company at the same time.

In a growing company, your job is to set the tone and manage the C-level, not do the books or write the code. Hire an accountant to help with the numbers, pay a programmer to do the coding.

Delegating isn’t an option — it’s a necessity.

## **2. Recognize that your expense costs aren’t everything.**

Everyone wants to improve their bottom line, but you need to be strategic about which costs you try to cut.

Think about mail consolidators, the third-party companies that the U.S. Postal Service hires to sort some of its mail. While mail consolidators do save the USPS 5–7%, this isn’t the whole story. Adding in a middleman means the mail can take up to twice as long to deliver this mail when compared to first class mail. And in the age of Amazon Prime, most customers are not happy about waiting an extra few days for anything.

**On the surface, saving 5–7% sounds great.**

But in the long run, trimming expenses without maintaining quality and efficiency will cost you more in refunds and disgruntled customers, not to mention the harm to your brand identity and reputation.

Don’t cut costs without thinking about how it will impact your brand.

## **3. Always think in the long term.**

Building a brand doesn’t happen overnight, and you have to always train one eye toward the future in order to be competitive.

I admit that I’ve been guilty of getting so engrossed in the short term that I lose sight of my company’s long term vision. But when you’re not looking ahead, you’re like a horse wearing blinders — you see only three feet in front of you instead of the entire horizon.

And this is a *huge *problem.

### Not only will you have difficulty solving problems, but you won’t be able to figure out what the problem is in the first place.

I studied physics in college, and the professors of my upper-level classes didn’t simply give me an equation to solve. Instead, I had to figure out what the problem itself was before I could apply an equation to it, and eventually solve it.

Isaac Newton didn’t just define gravity: he had to figure out *why* the apple fell out of the tree in the first place.

Likewise, you have to think long term to be able to anticipate and understand the problems facing your company and industry.

## **4. Pay your people well.**

Many leaders commoditize human labor.

Instead of paying a little more for the best people, they accept high employee turnover. But the more turnover you have, the more you have to pay for training. Worse yet, you’ll earn a reputation for treating your workers poorly.

Besides paying your employees more, you should show them you care about what they do. If I ran a trucking company, for instance, I’d get my commercial drivers license to prove that I really enjoy the freight movement and respect the amount of work my employees put it.

People are everything, and creating a positive work environment is key to any thriving company.

## **5. Never blame your team.**

As a CEO, you have to accept responsibility — even if something’s not your fault.

In the logistics world, parcels get lost or damaged and vendors don’t deliver on time. Trucks crash, destroying the containers and their contents. Between shippers, carriers, and customers, there’s a lot of finger pointing when something goes wrong.

But this is par for the course. There’s always a risk with using a third-party intermediary or driving on a public road, and you have to communicate this reality to your customers in a graceful way.
> # If you take responsibility for errors and never blame your team, both customers and employees will respect your authority.

If you avoid these five mistakes and keep your eye trained toward the future, you and your company will be well on your way to becoming the next Amazon, rather than the next Sears.

# Here’s why you can’t hit home runs every time.

## Here’s why you can’t hit home runs every time.

I recently had a conversation with my new publisher about the book I’m currently writing. I asked, “What would make this book a home run for you?” (I’m not a baseball fan, but I am a fan of baseball analogies). He replied, “There are no home runs in publishing, Ozan. Just singles and doubles.”

I can’t tell you how much I love this response.

For all my life, I’ve been trying to hit home runs, but end up feeling dismayed when I inevitably come up short. As obvious as it is, this realization came as a huge relief: It’s impossible to hit home runs every time you step up to the plate. What’s more, you don’t *need *to hit a home run every time you step up to the plate.

But don’t take it from me. Remember the [Amazon Fire phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Phone)? The company lost $170 million over that gigantic misfire. Or even better, the [Google Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass)? It was supposed to be the next best thing after the smartphone, but ended up as an embarrassing failure. This was one piece of technology that was decidedly uncool to sport: People wearing it were branded “glassholes.” These products feel like a distant memory now. When we look at successful businesses like Amazon and Google, we remember the highlights, not the lowlights. As Jeff Bezos says, “A few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn’t work.”

Put differently, you must kiss a lot of frogs before you find the prince.

Speaking of princes, Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors. He’s made over a hundred movies, and he says “seven or eight were good, a dozen more are decent, and the rest are god awful.” But we don’t remember the crappy Tom Hanks movies (yes, I’m talking about Turner and Hooch). We remember Philadelphia, Big, and Apollo 13.

Adam Grant gives several additional examples in his book, [Originals](https://www.amazon.com/Originals-How-Non-Conformists-Move-World/dp/014312885X). Shakespeare is known for a small number of his classics, but in the span of two decades, he penned 37 plays and 154 sonnets, some of which have been “consistently slammed for unpolished prose and incomplete plots and character development.” Picasso produced 1,800 paintings, 1,200 sculptures, 2,800 ceramics, and 12,000 drawings, only a fraction of which are noteworthy. Just a handful of Einstein’s 248 publications had real impact. But when we judge the greatness of these individuals,” Grant writes, “we focus not on their averages, but their peaks.”

There’s a passage that I love in the private notes of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (published posthumously as [Meditations](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0812968255)). From 2,000 years ago, he writes: “Don’t go expecting Plato’s Republic; be satisfied with even the smallest progress, and treat the outcome of it all as unimportant.” Arguably the most powerful man at the time is reassuring himself that it’s okay to not be Plato, that he can’t hit home runs every time.

If that’s not amazing, I don’t know what is.

Consistent home runs are not only impossible, but trying to hit a home run every time can cripple the batter. This was the Achilles heel of the great tennis player Andre Agassi. As he explains in his autobiography, [Open](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Autobiography-Andre-Agassi/dp/0307388409), one of his trainers told him: “You try to hit a winner on every ball, when just being steady, consistent, meat and potatoes, would be enough to win ninety percent of the time. . . . There’s about five times a year you wake up perfect, when you can’t lose to anybody, but it’s not those five times a year that make a tennis player. Or a human being, for that matter. It’s the other times.”

The question I asked my publisher was flawed. Life isn’t about repeatedly hitting home runs. Rather, it’s about strikeouts, singles, and doubles, until we slowly, but steadily, reach home base.

# The 6 Worst Traits A Business Leader Can Have

## 

We hear all the time about what [great leaders](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-1-leadership-skill-everybody-overlooks-664b627ff6b3) *should* be like.

* How they’re empathetic

* How they’re humble, yet driven

* How they’re transparent, ethical, *inspiring*

But what about the traits that make for *poor* leaders? I’ve worked for a variety of editors and [CEOs over my career ](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-4-lessons-i-learned-during-my-first-job-that-have-made-me-a-better-ceo-today-684290bd13a8)— for leaders who were inspiring and for leaders who were cancerous — and in reflecting on what sort of leader I want to be, now, I draw from those negative experiences just as often as I do the positive ones.
> **Ultimately, I believe we have to know how *not *to operate in order to be the most effective versions of ourselves.**

Here are the most harmful habits and traits I strive to avoid.

## **1: Operating with a lack of trust and transparency**

Dishonesty is cancerous and difficult to cloak.

Which is to say, it poisons morale and makes your employees dislike you. And poisoned morale, of course, disrupts productivity and hinders your company’s overall capacity for operating effectively.
> # If you think you can keep your team inspired while being dishonest to them about what’s happening behind closed doors, think again.

All of your staff — top to bottom — can tell when you’re lying to them.

In fact, there’s rarely a reason not to be entirely transparent with your team, especially at a young, growing company. No matter the situation, your team deserves to understand what sort of logic or procedural mechanisms drive the decision-making processes at your company.

Moreover, employees simply appreciate knowing where the company stands — it inspires them. If you are honest, they will want to help shoulder more of the load.

## **2: Only pushing your own ideas**

Great leaders seek creative solutions to thorny problems everywhere they look.
> Ineffective leaders, on the other hand, approach problem-solving processes much more myopically.

They suffer from what I call “not-invented-here-syndrome.” I’ve experienced this first hand with some of the larger companies I’ve worked for. The managers refused to listen to folks, like me, who were lower on the proverbial totem pole. They didn’t realize how toxic this was for morale until they saw the comments in exit interviews.

Ultimately, managers and CEOs who don’t identify good ideas when they’re presented to them — even from the lowest employee on the team — stunt morale, potential, and, ultimately, their company’s bottom line.

## **3: Playing the blame game**

No matter what company you’re running, if you’re the one running it, the buck *has *to stop with you. You’re the one in charge. Unbreakable accountability is a burden you have to bear.

As it happens, a certain unwillingness to hold yourself accountable is a surefire sign of a cowardly CEO. The worst leaders *never *accept responsibility for blunders, churned customers, or bad quarterly reports. Instead, they expend effort looking* *for *others *to blame.

This, simply put, is unproductive, not to mention damaging. As a practice, it disincentivizes employees from taking risks or coming up with creative solutions to problems because they fear being the subject of the boss’s scorn. In time, they leave; such work environments are inherently unsustainable.

## **4: Not listening to your employees**

Great CEOs understand that inspiration can come from every employee on staff.

Failing to understand this — or, worse, willfully ignoring it — is an indicator of a defective leader, and certainly of a leader who will never achieve greatness. Discrediting those who work “below you” simply because they’re technically subordinates is a sign of ignorance, and makes it impossible to build a loyal, engaged, and faithful team.

As it happens, a loyal and inspired team is exactly what leaders are charged with cultivating.

**5: Focusing on the now and short-changing the future**

This trait, in particular, is difficult for modern CEOs to correct. In today’s corporate environment — in which positive quarterly reports that please anxious stockholders take precedence above all other goals — it can be seen as sort of anthemic.
> # But great CEOs prioritize and focus on projects and goals which will most benefit the company and are thus based in reality — not corporate hyperbole.

Prioritizing short-term goals risks long-term security.

## **6: Inconsistency**

This is something I’ve battled myself as the President of [BookBaby](http://bookbaby.com): I have, in the past, been blamed for changing strategic course too often based on shifting market conditions or new opportunities.

Unfortunately, making a habit of that makes it difficult to achieve long-term goals. Strategy shifts must always be coordinated and well-thought out — not to mention transparent. The folks working with you should understand the logic informing the decisions you’re making, as well as the manner in which you’ve made them.

Moreover, they have to believe that whatever decisions you’re making, you’re making for the betterment of the company. It’s hard to remain confident in a leader who makes key decisions seemingly on a whim.

In fact, that sort of behavior only triggers confusion.

## **The central theme to all of these corporate failings is this: they erode trust and respect among your employees, and render you less effective as a leader in the long run.**

At the end of the day, your employees are your troops; they’re looking to be led. They need commanders they can depend on.

But in order to be that leader, you need to work consciously on developing the right sort of habits. Often, that starts with understanding how *not *to operate.

# Habits are the Compound Interest of Self Improvement

## “person wearing black-and-white Nike low-top sneaker” by SJ Baren on Unsplash

People struggle to develop and maintain new habits because they make their efforts unsustainable.

* **They work out like crazy for a few days (usually at the beginning of the year), and never go back to the gym.**

* **They try to meditate for 30 mins one day and don’t give it another shot until 10 days later**

* **They try to build an empire fueled by a burst of inspiration on a random Saturday afternoon.**

When people attempt to make a change this way, they overlook [the profound power of consistency](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-profound-power-of-consistency-3f1a361bb8fd). When it comes to developing and maintaining a new habit, frequency matters more than intensity. If you do something frequently, a compounding effect will start to take place.

## Build the Identity of the Person You Want to Become

To build the identity of the person you want to become, ask yourself what the behavior of a person who has the habit you want to develop is?

* What is the behavior a person who is in shape? They go to the gym consistently

* What is the behavior of a prolific writer? He or she cracks open a notebook every day.

[James Clear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear) refers to this as identity-based habit formation. In [An Audience of One](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733), I shared a story James told me on the Unmistakable Creative podcast about one of his readers who lost over 100 lbs. Instead of setting a goal to work out, he set a goal to drive to the gym, and he would only allow himself to stay for 5 minutes. After a certain point, he realized that he might as well work out. If you take the first step towards a habit, the inertia is often enough to carry you to the next one.

*Note: I was fortunate to get a sneak peek at James’ New book,[ Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299)* (available for pre-order on Amazon). An interview with him, which will air next wee inspired the idea for this post.

## Take Minimum Viable Actions

Sometime last year we launched an online course called Finish What You Start. In the process of developing that course, our copywriter [Kingshuk Mukherjee](https://medium.com/@Kingshuk) came up with the term minimum viable action. In the same way, a startup can launch a minimum viable product; you can take minimum viable actions to develop a new habit.

* If you want to develop a writing habit, your minimum viable action could be sitting down at your desk or cracking your notebook open

* If you want to read more, it could be sitting down in a specific chair with a book in your hands
> # ***When you take a minimum viable action, the inertia is often enough to carry you to the next step. You build momentum and the identity of a person who has your desired habit until you become the next best version of yourself.***

## Raise Your Level of Intensity Gradually

In [a recent episode of the Unmistakable Creative](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/chris-bailey-productive-world-distractions/), I asked Chris Bailey [how people can get better at managing their attention](https://unmistakablecreative.com/state-attention/). And he said the following:
> If you’re not on a deadline, you’re going to work on something until you feel no resistance to it. Could I write for an hour today? No the thought of it puts me off. What about 45 minutes? Thirty-two? Twenty fifty? Yeah, I can do 15. Then refocus for 15 minutes. You find that resistance level to tame distractions and then over time as you ritualize this idea you block off periods in your calendar to get into this mode. Over time you lower that default level of stimulation the amount of dopamine coursing through your brain because of this novelty bias that’s embedded within us and you become better able to think more deeply about your work.

When something becomes effortless for you, raise the level of intensity. In the same way, you’d never go from lifting 25lbs to 100lbs in one day, you want to increase the level of intensity to the point where you can get there without too much resistance, but it’s still somewhat challenging. To put it more concisely, bend but don’t break.

## What if You Miss a Day?

After 7 years and 2 books, I still miss the occasional writing day. Sometimes it’s because I’m in bed with someone (a good reason to miss a writing day). Other times it’s because I’m hungover, and occasionally I need a break. One way to handle this is to reduce the scope but stick to the schedule. Instead of writing a 1000 word, I write 500. Many people quit altogether after they miss one day. But if you make your goal progress instead of perfection, you won’t be so demoralized by missing one day.

## Develop a Keystone Habit and Stack More

When you try to change too many habits at once, none of them stick. If you try to become a person who reads every day, writes every morning, goes to the gym 3 times a week, and meditates daily all in the span of a week, none of those habits will stick.

But if you start with one keystone habit, it will create a ripple effect into every other area of your life.

* One of my first keystone habits was surfing. When I got into the habit of surfing almost every other day, I started drinking less when I went out. I valued being up in the morning because that’s when surf conditions are usually best.

* After I developed the keystone habit of writing 1000 words a day, what followed was reading every day, and eventually a consistent meditation habit.

The best time to stack a second habit is after you’ve maintained the first one with consistency. If you go through this process of stacking, eventually you’ll find yourself making the impossible possible.

## The Compounding Effect of Habits

Every now and then I have a friend who will tell me they want to learn how to surf. I share a story with them that I mentioned in my previous book, [Unmistakable: Why Only is Better Than Best](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016JPTK9G).

A few weeks after my first three attempts to surf, I went to happy hour at a bar in La Jolla. The guy sitting next to me had been a long time surfer who gave me a simple piece of advice that made the difference between me quitting and becoming a surfer. He told me to go 50 times because by that point I’d be too invested to quit.

While he didn’t state it explicitly, he understood that every surf session would have a compounding effect. It took more than 15 sessions before I stood up on a wave. Eventually, I worked my way down from the Costco Wavestorm to riding a 6-foot shortboard and found myself surfing at a skill level that seemed impossible when I started. I had a similar experience with snowboarding. After two seasons and close to 30 days on the mountain, I got to a point where I was able to get down a black diamond.

The progress we experience from the compounding effect of any habit isn’t immediately visible. As a result, people give up quickly. They don’t realize that every day the show up they’re building momentum. They are moving closer and closer to a breakthrough or inflection point.

## Systems Vs Goals

I’ve said before that having a system is essential increasing your creative output. Having a system allows you to focus on progress instead of perfection and put your energy and effort into what you control. A system also will enable you to experience visible progress, which in turn increase your motivation. In the picture below you’ll see three jars of marbles. Each jar represents a system that’s tied to a specific goal.

![](0*52dYKhI247UM8Ih7.jpg)

* **Jar 1: **I put one marble in for each hour I spend doing deep work like reading and writing, and another for each article I publish. It’s the system that is aligned with my goal of growing our email list to 50,000 subscribers.

* **Jar 2: **I put one marble into the jar for each sales call I make or email I send to people who might be able to hire me as a speaker or advertise on the Unmistakable Creative. It’s the system that’s aligned with my revenue goal.

* **Jar 3**: I put one marble into the jar for each day I go to CrossFit, surf or exercise. It’s the system aligned with my goal to lose the little bit of a gut that I have before my sister’s wedding in February.

It’s my personal adaptation of the paper clip method.

## Purpose and Meaning

It’s worth considering why you want to develop some habit. People read articles like this one and think that’s the reason to develop a habit. They treat guidance like gospel and make decisions that aren’t aligned with their essential priorities. There’s nothing that everybody should do, even though there are plenty of people who will tell you there are. (Most of them they also sell products for how to do that thing they say everybody should do). The goal isn’t to live a life that’s just efficient, but rather a life that’s meaningful.

From writing 1000 words a day to learning how to surf, I’ve seen the compounding effect of habits over and over in my life. As I said in [An Audience of One](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733), habits are at the building blocks of all creative work and for that matter just about every goal you’d ever want to accomplish.

# The Best Way To Give Advice To Someone.

## 

As a blogger, I’m asked to give advice a lot. I genuinely want to help others so learning to give advice correctly has allowed me to impact more people.

Whether you want to be a leader, coach or entrepreneur — knowing how to give advice will help you.

If you give advice incorrectly, then you’ll risk being disrespectful, pissing people off and not helping others to take the positive action that will assist them.

I also try to remember that I don’t have all the wisdom in the world and I don’t know everything.

Some of my advice is useful and some of it is not. Removing your ego from the advice you give makes the quality of your wisdom much higher.

### Here’s the best way to give advice:

## Tell a story.

Dry information and stats don’t inspire people to make a change or listen to you. Storytelling is how you make your advice human, relatable and real.
> Every great speech or piece of advice comes bundled with a story. The story is what people remember and that’s how they’ll remember your advice.

I don’t know about you, but I never remember facts, figures or statistics. Unless you’re a lifelong, successful, trivia show contestant with a brain for remembering facts and figures, always include stories in any advice you give.

One tip though is to keep your story short and concise. Don’t tell a story that goes for 90 minutes if you can avoid it.

Chunk the story down into what happened, and more importantly, what your audience can learn. Pro’s give advice through telling stories — just look at Ted.com for examples.

## Chunk it down.

A long piece of advice that is complicated will rarely be absorbed or put into practice.

Chunk your advice down into simple steps that your audience can follow. Keep your advice simple wherever possible and focus on key takeaways.

*What can someone listening to your advice takeaway with them?*

I find the power of threes works best. Aim for three steps or three takeaways if it’s possible in the context of your advice.

## Have a good structure.

Just like a good speech, high-quality advice has a solid structure. There’s an introduction, a body and a conclusion that highlights the takeaways.

This makes your advice easier to follow and more likely to be retained by that very old computer that’s living in our heads called the brain.

Be logical with your advice and structure it in a way that makes sense. Start with your most important point or think about the timeline in relation to your advice. What events happened first or what steps do you begin with?

## Be respectful.

I get people all the time emailing me and saying things like *“Should I be a stripper?”* or *“Should I kill myself?”*

Leading with respect is very important because to do anything else could lead your audience to not take your advice, or even worse, use your advice to harm themselves or put themselves in more pain.

![Image Credit: [Super Girl](https://www.zazzle.com/supergirl)](1*W2SB6gDhX84KeiE_jKEKLQ.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Super Girl](https://www.zazzle.com/supergirl)*

Not everyone is Superman or Superwoman like you, so don’t talk down to your audience. Appreciate their situation even if you haven’t been there yourself and concentrate on being of service.

No one likes to be spoken down to and you have your own issues. You’re not perfect either. Remember that whenever you’re giving advice.

**Even if your audience disagrees with your advice, they’ll respect you if you respect them first.**

## Get to the point.

If your audience is millennials, then you’ll want to get to the point. Our attention span is only decreasing as time goes on and so those who can get to the point will win in this new attention economy.

**Your advice may be amazing, but it will never be heard if you can’t get to the point.**

Respecting your audiences time is how you get them to listen to your advice. Even try telling them up front how long the advice will take to deliver.

You don’t need to tell your life story when giving advice. Focus on the advice that will lead people to take action or think differently. Adopt the mindset of *“All killer no filler.”*

## Make it inspirational.

Advice that is simultaneously inspiring works. I’ve witnessed this over the last few years with my own audience.

People just want to be inspired. **Being inspired is how you get people’s attention. **Inspiration makes us feel good and positivity always wins.

Inspiration that doesn’t inspire action though is useless. A one-off pump up session of advice doesn’t help anyone in the long-term.

Focus on how you can inspire and also get people to think and follow through with action.

## Use your own experience.

We’ve talked about storytelling already. Many people tell stories but never include their own experience.

Your experience is the best advice you can give. No one has exactly the same story or list of experiences as you, so that’s what makes your advice truly unique.

If you’re planning on making a business around your advice, this is an important fact to realize early on.

All of us have experiences worth sharing. Many of my coaching clients tell me they don’t. When I test that theory, I find out every time that we all have personal experiences that can help others.

Your personal experiences are more valuable than you think.

## Relate your advice back to their problem.

Lots of people give advice without knowing their audience’s problem. The best advice is tied back to the listener’s problem.

If you want to be effective with your advice you need to learn to tailor it to the audience. This sounds easier than it looks.
> **The best way I discovered to understand my audience’s problems was to ask them (in the case of 1–1 advice) or for large audiences, to research my audience’s problems through websites like Quora.**

I’ve found that our problems all come from mostly the same list. Our problems are not as unique as we think — they are in our own head.

If all you do is give advice that doesn’t solve the real problem, you’re wasting your time. I even try to reference my audience’s problem in every part of the advice I give.

**Become obsessed with the problem and your advice will be effective.**

## Inject emotion.

The best advice contains your own emotion. Linking your advice to emotion is another practical strategy to get people to take action.

Injecting emotion into your advice requires you to be bold, authentic and vulnerable which is why so many people forget this valuable step when giving advice.

![Image Credit: [Monde Des Hommes](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/311381761713175975/)](1*H70dgCaXmkUff1qe_ePFWA.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Monde Des Hommes](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/311381761713175975/)*

We all remember when someone got emotional while giving a speech or when we felt the same emotion as the person giving us the advice.
> # “We’re all human and emotion unites us”

Emotion is what can make your advice feel universal. We’ve all felt sadness, laughter or emotion in our lives. Put this into your advice if you want to influence your audience to make a real and rapid change.

## Final Thought.

Next time you have to give advice, you’ll now have a toolkit you can use. Giving advice is a privilege and it should never be taken for granted.

The sole purpose of giving advice is to help someone. 
Don’t forget that.

# The Case for Being Good Enough

## Don’t aim to be consistently great; aim to be great at being consistent.

![](1*nALI5yyNzaklcwYjQ3iuMw.jpeg)

It is better to strive to be great at being consistent than striving to be consistently great. Why? Because being consistently great is really, really, really hard. Especially over the long haul.

Take a moment to reflect on an ongoing process that you’re involved in. It could be anything, really — from parenting, to coaching, to running, to managing, to teaching, to writing, to making art. It could even be something less exciting like storytelling in PowerPoint or financial modeling in Excel.

Now think about how often you’re great. I’m talking about the really on top of your game, everything clicking, firing on all cylinders kind of great. Also think about the effort-level, focus, and presence of mind-body that kind of perfect performance demands.

Is that a reasonable expectation to set? Or, is it an expectation setting you up for a few really good days and a lot of failed ones?

Perfect is enticing, especially when you’ve experienced it, when you know it’s possible. But that doesn’t mean it’s probable.

Being perfect every once in a while and internalizing it as an ongoing expectation is a surefire way to lose motivation, experience anxiety, and burn out. Setting perfect as an ongoing bar rarely leads to your best performance — and certainly not to your best life.

Some simple math makes this clear.

Let’s say that it’s reasonable to be about 80 percent “on it” 90 percent of the time: 0.8 x 0.9 = .72. That’s a lot better than being perfect, or 100 percent, only 40, or even 50, percent of the time: 1.0 x 0.4 = 0.4 and 1.0 x 0.5 = 0.5.
> # Being perfect every once in a while and internalizing it as an ongoing expectation is a surefire way to lose motivation, experience anxiety, and flame out.

For most people in most endeavors, especially in those that unfold over time, it’s better to aim for good enough rather than great.

Good enough is a lot more probable than great. Good enough is a lot less angstful than great. And, the reality is that good enough over and again is precisely how you become great to begin with. Go big or go home and you often end up home. Go small, steady, and consistent over time and you end up with something big.

# Presidential Leadership Scholars&#58; What is it and how to apply?

## This article reflects my personal experience and is not an official post nor endorsed by the Presidential Leadership Scholars program.

![PLS offers a unique opportunity to gain insight into the personal lives and personalities of our past Presidents and leaders](1*dQZyA4ywQpnXG-vQrbNaXg.png)*PLS offers a unique opportunity to gain insight into the personal lives and personalities of our past Presidents and leaders*

I became a Presidential Leadership Scholar (PLS) as a member of its inaugural 2015 class.* *The program was one of the most memorable and educational experiences I’ve gone through and I highly recommend it. PLS creates space and opportunity for personal growth, development, and engagement with a new network of remarkable people.

I am often asked about this program so I would like to put forward my thoughts publicly to help as many potential applicants as possible:

### What is the Presidential Leadership Scholars program?

PLS is an annual program that first began in 2015 and so far admits approximately 60 [Scholars](https://www.presidentialleadershipscholars.org/scholars/#all) each year. There are four Presidential centers that collaborate to make it possible:

* Clinton Foundation

* George HW Bush Presidential Library Foundation

* George W. Bush Presidential Center

* Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation

The curriculum is also managed in collaboration with leaders from the Georgetown McDonough School of Business.

The best way I can describe PLS is as an executive version of the [White House Fellows](https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/fellows/) program. While White House Fellows is a full time one year program in Washington DC, the Presidential Leadership Scholars program is approximately 24 days spread out over six extended weekends at various Presidential centers and libraries. All expenses, including travel, are generously covered by the program.

Each PLS session is around 4 days long and there are a total of 6 sessions. The opening and closing sessions serve as an introduction and a graduation, and the four modules in between emphasize learning around one of the following themes:

* Vision and Communication

* Decision Making

* Persuasion and Influence

* Strategic Partnerships

![Condoleezza Rice visited one of our sessions and was a remarkable person to learn from](1*w-9Folm-u35pIQsIDFPvug.jpeg)*Condoleezza Rice visited one of our sessions and was a remarkable person to learn from*

As you visit the Presidential centers during each weekend session, you will hear directly from the Presidents and many of their top advisors and cabinet members. The access during the program is unparalleled and provides insight into many of our country’s top leaders of recent decades.

The curriculum also incorporates experts to facilitate sessions on leadership and personal growth. All the sessions have a taste of an MBA curriculum, but the cohort is quite different than what you would find in top MBA programs and the spirit is much more about civic service.

### **What is the Personal Leadership Project?**

The Personal Leadership Project (PLP) is a project each Scholar proposes for themselves and is expected to pursue during PLS (and for some beyond). [As explained by PLS](http://www.bushcenter.org/publications/articles/2017/07/presidential-leadership-scholars-program-is-developing-leaders-and-changing-lives.html): *“These projects are aimed at improving the civic or social good by addressing a problem or need in a community, profession, or organization.”*

The PLS is therefore a civic-social oriented initiative each Scholar leads during and after the program. You are expected to leverage your experience and abilities, help the benefactors of the initiative, as well as achieve personal growth.

**My advice for the PLP is the following:**

* **Do not create a new organization** from scratch. It is unlikely that there is a cause out there worth supporting which does not already have a champion that could use build upon

* **Leverage something you are passionate about** and that is related to your personal experience

* **Try to find a way to mix the PLP with your full time work** else it will become daunting to carve out the time necessary

* **Think big and be practical. **Your project should be worthy of your time, so it should be ambitious but should also practical and achievable

As an example, when a female friend of mine from the venture capital industry was applying, I suggested creating a program that would leverage her firm’s brand and help promote female founders in her area and eventually nationally.

As another example, let’s say you work in the tech industry and happen to be passionate about consumer privacy. You could start by working with your company to promote privacy education in your local community. Even better would be to begin building a coalition with other tech firms to support this nationally, which you could probably do by leveraging an existing electronic privacy organization or platform. This can only work if you are already passionate about the subject of electronic privacy, just as an example.

Some people already work in a civic oriented field and their projects can more directly align with their full time job. See my classmate, Daniel Anello, [as an example](https://www.presidentialleadershipscholars.org/scholar/danello/).

### **What do you gain from the program?**

The program was a deeply rich experience and each person likely benefits in different ways. I would highlight my top three as:

1. **Learning from top leaders through personal interaction**

![I served in Iraq while Secretary Gates was leading the DoD, and personally meeting Robert Gates was one of the definitive highlights of my PLS experience.](1*KU56mD6-LPFAnmnFSHIT_g.jpeg)*I served in Iraq while Secretary Gates was leading the DoD, and personally meeting Robert Gates was one of the definitive highlights of my PLS experience.*

We may all hear speeches and read books by the world’s top leaders, but there is a new insight to be gained when interacting with them up close and personal. I often found myself engaging in a (relatively) small group discussion with either former Presidents or their top advisors, and sitting alongside former Presidential Cabinet members during dinners. There are many opportunities to interact; for example I got to spend about 5 minutes standing in a buffet line and speaking with President George W. Bush. Although brief, these experiences give provide a new insight into the leaders that have shaped so much of our foreign and domestic policy over recent decades.

**2. The Scholar network**

![PLS Class of 2015. Opportunities to spend time with the other Scholars of the program was an incredible opportunity](1*ZvD3IgB4oFox1yHh8Kqg9Q.jpeg)*PLS Class of 2015. Opportunities to spend time with the other Scholars of the program was an incredible opportunity*

Having graduated from programs like Harvard Business School and Y Combinator has given me a strong appreciation for the power of networks. PLS has enhanced that by enabling access to a new set of networks that I was previously not exposed to. I have been able to learn from leaders of non-profits, foundations, and other for-profit that I would otherwise haver never met.

There is also an annual meeting of Scholars which is a great way to maintain and strengthen those relationships over time. Once a year the Scholars of all classes are invited into a reunion of sorts, and this has become one of the highlights of my year. As the network grows over time, I expect this event to grow as well. There are also efforts to create more regional events, which will become more and more practical as the number of Scholars grows.

**3. Carving out the time for yourself to reflect and think**

Most potential applicants to PLS are probably very busy people. They likely also already know why [leaders need solitude](https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/#.Weo44BNSxHY). While PLS is not exactly a program of solitude, it does create a lot of space and opportunity to reflect and conduct introspections that one would otherwise not have time to do. The inspirational sessions combined with the moments of reflection in the “in between” space can lead to valuable personal growth.

### **Who should apply?**

Anybody who is interested in the program should apply, as there is no reason to self select yourself out if it’s something of interest. That said, the following is the typical backgrounds of successful [Scholars](https://www.presidentialleadershipscholars.org/scholars/#all):

* Accomplished professional within a given field (what “accomplished” means is subjective)

* Age is generally late 20s to early 40s

* Possess a track record of excellence

* Have shown impact, or at least meaningful interest, in one’s community or the betterment of society at large

* Many have a background in non-profits or public service, but there are plenty who come from for-profits companies such as tech firms, law firms, and financial institutions

### **Tips on applying to the Presidential Leadership Scholars program?**

The first step is a written application with essays and a couple of recommendations. Take this seriously and start the work early so you can put it down and come back to re-read it with a fresh perspective.

A group is selected from the applicant pool to conduct personal interviews. From my personal experience, the program selects around 1 in 3 of those interviewed but that might change year to year.

For my class the interviews were done via video conference with a panel of three or four people asking you questions about your background, your goals, and your application. Make sure you have a quiet room with decent lighting, a good internet connection, and that you dress appropriately.

Here are some more considerations for your application:

* **Communicate how PLS will help leverage your current and future civic contributions.** PLS is intended to accelerate the careers and amplify the civic contributions of its Scholars. Understandably, PLS must validate to its donors the value of the program and the return on the donor’s investment through positive contributions to society. So show PLS how your participation will help return value to that investment given the objectives of the program.

* **Strong recommendations can go along way.** If you can get a recommender that is already close with one of the Presidential centers then that certainly couldn’t hurt. Avoid bland recommendations by people with impressive titles or name recognition if they aren’t able to provide you a detailed recommendation.

* **Choose a PLP that is both grand and pragmatic**. You want to find a balance between having a concept that is so tactical that it can only help a small number of people and something that is so large and vague that there is no practical roadmap to achieving it. It should also be well aligned with your personal interests. Please also don’t come up with an idea of starting a new non-profit. There are plenty of non-profits out there for nearly every problem set in the world, and creating a new program is likely not the right answer. Instead, think of what advantage your professional skill sets can provide and how you can leverage those skill sets to achieve a goal that is of personal interest to you and of value to society.

* **The program is strictly non-partisan**, and is not a platform to leverage for political interests. This is not a program to help jump start a political campaign or to promote a partisan agenda. Embrace policy but eschew politics.

![George and Laura Bush were very generous with their time and the entire Scholar class. Regardless of how one views his politics, everyone walked away with a great level of respect for the former President’s authenticity and good-natured ways.](1*sSTe2OZBw_nnD8pAuYDSYQ.jpeg)*George and Laura Bush were very generous with their time and the entire Scholar class. Regardless of how one views his politics, everyone walked away with a great level of respect for the former President’s authenticity and good-natured ways.*

### **What happens after the program?**

One of the best parts of the program is the life long network it creates. PLS hosts an annual meeting of Scholars at different Presidential libraries each year. For example, in 2015 we were hosted at the Ronald Reagan Library, in 2016 at the JFK Library, and in 2017 at the Richard Nixon Library. In 2018 we will be meeting in Washington DC.

Each annual meeting is an opportunity to reconnect with the program, fellow Scholars, and to generally reflect and rejuvenate.

### **In Summary**

The Presidential Leadership Scholars program is an incredible opportunity to learn, grow, and connect with leaders of past administrations and current/future leaders from across a diverse network. These connections and the program’s curriculum enriches the lives of all its Scholars and enables us to have an even larger impact on our communities and society at large.

# This Little Thing From Brain-Science Will Help You Lower Anxiety In Daily Life

## A photo of my grandfather’s “Daily Entry” journal

**The other day I had a vivid flashback** to a scene from my childhood.

The memory is of my grandfather, stooped over with a little hunch, and wearing his auto mechanic’s jumpsuit. He’s standing in his study, pecking at a typewriter.

I remember being a kid and finding him there in the mornings whenever we stayed at his house. Every morning — it felt like — I would wake up earlier than everyone else and wander into his study and find him there, stooping over his typewriter doing the same thing: writing his “Daily Entry.”

A little while ago, [I wrote](https://shane.substack.com/p/july-snow-report-love-growth-and-the-power-of-words) about how science shows that putting our experiences into words helps us get through life better. That’s certainly what Grandpa was doing here with the Daily Entry. But as I’ve reflected on those memories, I’ve realized there was something else afoot, too.
> The Daily Entry wasn’t just a journal. It was a personal ritual. And I’ve discovered that there’s something more powerful about that than I realized.

Throughout history, humans have used rituals to help people remember important stories and lessons. (E.g. In the U.S., we light fireworks every 4th of July in remembrance of our war of independence.) And in my research for my book [*Dream Teams](http://sha.ne/dt)*, I dove into the science of how rituals can tie a group of people together, even if they’re very different from each other. (E.g. in the early years of [my company](http://contently.com) we used to go around the table on Friday during lunch and have everyone share one thing they were excited about and one thing they were worried about. This helped us safely air issues, but also bonded us together.)

And of course, humans have used rituals to build relationships with God(s) throughout history as well. “Every faith is built around rituals and ceremonies that help believers feel closer to their divine attachment figure,” writes neuroscience writer Jonah Lehrer, author of the wonderful 2016 book, [*A Book About Love](https://www.amazon.com/Book-About-Love-Jonah-Lehrer/dp/147676140X)*. Jonah describes the psychology of “proximity seeking,” which is a natural urge humans have as part of creating secure attachments.

In other words, rituals help us feel safe and secure with each other. And that’s psychologically important for helping us to weather hard times or be able to take risks and explore uncharted territory in our life journeys.

All this gave me a theory about my Grandpa’s Daily Entry ritual. As I’ve been doing a bit of personal assessment lately, I thought that perhaps in the same way that rituals bring people closer to each other, a personal ritual like journaling every morning might help me get to know myself better. It certainly seemed to help my grandfather.

Then I realized something. I already have lots of personal rituals. In fact, the areas in which I feel the most confident happen to have little rituals attached to them. E.g:

* My writing ritual (which involves coffeeshop hopping and setting up my computer in a certain organized way, etc.)

* My thinking ritual (which involves long walks and runs)

* My “important interview” ritual (which involves wearing my fake glasses)

* My stress-reduction ritual (which involves cleaning and throwing things away) each are more than just motions — they’re *my things that help me *even though they have little practicality attached to them*. *(Well, maybe cleaning does…)

A deeper examination of the psychology of rituals shows that developing personal rituals indeed helps you to build a better relationship with yourself. But something else happens as a result of personal rituals.

**They help us reduce anxiety.**

Dr. Nick Hobson is one of the most prolific researchers on the psychology of rituals, and he’s got a bunch of stuff to say on this:

“It’s generally agreed upon in neuroscience research that the brain’s chief job is the following — to draw predictions about the future, and to orient behavior in line with those predictions,” Hobson [writes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ritual-and-the-brain/201709/the-anxiety-busting-properties-ritual). “A brain that cannot predict (one that is *uncertain*) makes a human feel threatened and anxious.”

Things in life are constantly happening outside of our control. This unsettles our brains. But, Hobson explains [in another piece](https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/18154-the-emerging-science-of-ritual-a-new-look-on-an-ancient-behavior) on the subject, “The very act of engaging in a scripted sequence of ritualistic movements tricks the brain into thinking that it’s experiencing the pleasant state of predictability and stability.”

In other words, for a person like me who gets bouts of anxiety in daily life — and whose interests and ambitions leads him to get into a lot of uncertain, often entrepreneurial territory (I suspect if you’re reading this you’re similar to me!) — rituals can be helpful in managing day to day emotional state.

And the more you practice a personal ritual, the better the effect!

“The certainty that rituals create through their basic structure gets compounded over time,” Hobson writes. “The more we do them, the more meaningful they become, both to us and to others with whom we might share them. And meaning, as everyone can attest to, is a powerful psychological force that can respond to almost any source of uncertainty and anxiety.”

So. I’ve decided to take a look at my life and see where personal rituals can help me feel more secure. I’m examining the rituals I already have, and I think I’m going to make some more. Maybe I’m going to start bringing my Lucky Coyote with me more places. Maybe I’m gonna make this morning meditation practice of mine into more of a ritual process than just a habit. Maybe I’ll start stretching every morning to my favorite music, going through the stretching routine we did every week at jiu jitsu class when I was a kid. I loved that routine.

I’m not saying that we should turn into those baseball players who have to turn in three circles before they can do anything, but I’m convinced that everyone ought to take a look their life and see where rituals can help us relate, perform, and emote with the most confidence.

After all, “rituals aren’t there to help us survive,” Hobson writes. “Rather, they are there to help us thrive. They are there to allow us to be the best version of ourselves.”

# Three questions I ask before making a decision

## 

1. **What’s the worst that can happen?**

When it comes to creating worst case scenarios, my imagination is particularly vivid. My creativity kicks into high gear as I think about all the awful consequences that can follow from a simple decision gone wrong. I can visualize, in intricate detail, how life as I know it will come to a swift end from a bad blog post, a botched podcast episode, or a dumb question I asked.

But, as the Stoic philosopher Seneca reminds us, “we suffer more in imagination than in reality.” The parade of horribles I dream up never materialize. Yes, bad things do happen from time to time, but they’re never as bad as I imagined.

The cure? Follow the timeless wisdom of Yoda, who said “Named must your fear be before banish it you can.” But Yoda failed to mention one important thing: naming your fears in your head is not enough. Thinking about the worst — letting the amorphous fears of an uncertain future marinate in your head — takes awful consequences and turns up the volume on the drama ([all the way to 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOO5S4vxi0o)).

The naming, I’ve found, must be done in writing — with paper and pencil (or pen, if you’re into technology). Writing your fears down undresses them. Once you lift up the curtain and see “the truth” behind it — a la Wizard of Oz — your fears are no longer the great unknown masses that continue to block you from soaring. Once you see your fears with their masks off, you’ll find that the feeling of fear is often far worse than the thing that you fear. You’ll also realize that, in all likelihood, the things that matter most to you will still be there, no matter what happens.

Finally, don’t let the fears you write down become long-unused archives of memory. I review what I write on a regular basis through a journaling app called [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com/). Every morning, it brings up what you wrote on that very day in previous years. This regularly exposes me to previous fears that I thought were insurmountable but turned out to be speed bumps at worst. Through repeated exposure, I end up inoculating myself and realize that my imagined fears are just that: imaginings.

**2. What are my biases and preconceptions?**

We tend to undervalue evidence that contradicts our beliefs and overvalue evidence that confirms them. We filter out inconvenient truths and arguments on the opposing side. As a result, our opinions solidify, and it becomes increasingly harder to disrupt established patterns of thinking.

Before making an important decision, ask yourself, *What are my biases?* *What do I know on this topic (*or better, *What do I think I know?).* As Richard Feynman said, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”

Also ask, *Do I really want this particular belief to be true?* If you find yourself skimming through Google results to find that one study that confirms your decision, be careful — be *very* careful (particularly since you’ll always find that page, especially if you’re willing to click through to Page 10 on the search results).

Another way you can expose your biases is by asking, *What fact would change my decision?* If the answer is “no fact would change my decision,” you’re in trouble. A person who is unwilling to change his or her mind even with an underlying change in the facts is, by definition, a fundamentalist.

**3. Who will disagree with me?**

It’s not easy exposing our own preconceptions. It doesn’t help that we live in a bubble and surround ourselves with people that operate on the same frequency. If you’re lucky enough to have people around you who disagree with you, ask them for their opinion.

If you’re not so lucky, then ask people who normally agree with you to disagree with you. I often give trusted advisors early drafts of book chapters and ask them to point out — not what’s right, not what they loved — but what’s wrong, what should be changed, what should be taken out. This approach provides psychological safety to those who might otherwise withhold dissent for fear of offending you.

These three questions often have no easy answers. But they’re well worth asking if you’re in the business of making difficult decisions.

# Want to Join the Best? 6 Companies Share How They Put Employees First

## A Roundup of Employee-Focused Practices and Business Models

![](1*bH86W_gDPAAa_AxYdpFF4g.png)

Certified B Corporations are redefining success in business to be those companies that consider their impact on all stakeholders — workers, the environment, the communities in which they operate. The businesses most successful at building in supports and protections for employees have made B Lab’s Best For The World: Workers honorees list.

To make the list, honorees must score in the top 10 percent of all Certified B Corporations on the Workers section of the B Impact Assessment, which examines the company’s relationship with its workforce and measures how the company treats its workers through compensation, benefits, training and ownership opportunities provided to workers.

We asked several Best For The World: Workers honorees to share their insights and practices that have improved their positive employee impact.

![](1*oyCiy8cLCAxnoSvR3oskEA.jpeg)

### [Atomic Object](https://www.bcorporation.net/community/atomic-object-llc)

Grand Rapids, Michigan

*Atomic Object creates applications for web, mobile, desktop, and devices.*

“As a company that prides itself on experimentation as a strategy and openness to new ideas, Atomic Object has adopted or built several practices that support the workplace and employment experience. Atomic Object is 100 percent employee-owned and practices open-book financial management.

“Atomic’s leaders have developed an annual compensation adjustment process to ensure competitive and fair pay across the company. In the software field, what should ideally be 40-hour workweeks often consume more, uncompensated time at work. To combat this trend, all Atoms are paid hourly, based on their individually tracked time.”

## [Kinesis](https://www.bcorporation.net/community/kinesis)

Portland, Oregon

*Kinesis is a marketing and consultancy firm that helps small to midsize business owners.*

“Marketing agencies have a reputation for being extremely fast-paced, with a high rate of burnout. Industry-wide, annual employee turnover is estimated to be upwards of 30 percent — almost twice the national average — and growing by double digits every year. We decided to combat this by creating a happy and engaged company culture.

“We do this in a few ways: paying fair salaries substantially above the living wage and market comparisons, creating structured career paths to enable us to promote from within, and working tirelessly to build a team that is made up of people who are smart, engaged, and care as much about each other as they do about the work. Our next major milestone will be developing an equity sharing program for employees.”

![](1*7deU6s2fJykF7XUsQw7LGg.jpeg)

## [CauseLabs](https://www.bcorporation.net/community/causelabs)

Denver, Colorado

*CauseLabs is a socially conscious innovation firm that leverages web and mobile technologies to build custom digital tools that positively impact people.*

“Despite being a completely distributed team (or perhaps because of it) we have built a culture of trust, respect and transparency alongside a playful energy. We tackle some of the world’s most challenging problems, so it’s important to be mindful, and to encourage and support each other both in work and in life. We have great benefits, but team loyalty and tenure is most likely linked to the meaningful work we get to do each day and how it impacts the world around us.

“Aside from their daily work tasks, employees are also involved in community volunteering and CauseLabs offers a flexible schedule to accommodate these community commitments.”

## [Schoolzilla](https://www.bcorporation.net/community/schoolzilla-pbc)

Oakland, California

*Schoolzilla is an education data-management platform designed to improve education for students, especially those from underserved communities.*

“We at Schoolzilla take our organizational values seriously and embed them in all that we do. We honor our teammates weekly by sharing anonymous feedback, setting up a compensation structure that reduces bias, and doing performance reviews every six months.

“Every two weeks at Schoolzilla, we gather as a company and report where we are on our two primary metrics — one financial, one impact — and the aligned subgoals. Each team shares what’s working well, what they’re doing next, and asks for ideas and input from the rest of the company.”

![](1*lzbsAJ8mDQ5X0RyNUPYrhQ.jpeg)

## [Myplanet](https://www.bcorporation.net/community/myplanet)

Toronto, Ontario

*Myplanet is re-energizing how people connect in the workplace. The company is dedicated to building a workforce that reflects the diversity of its community.*

“For us, the single biggest area of success has been how we work to be best for our workers. We believe that being a force for good starts from within, and our staff team is essential to that. Every single full-time team member at Myplanet is an owner or option holder, because we’re committed to keeping the company employee-owned. It’s part of what influences our culture and instills that sense of pride and commitment to ongoing collective improvement.

“Listen to your employees. They’re the heart of your business and hearing what matters to them means not only you are paying attention to their needs and concerns, but the whole organization will be aligned on the values driving your mission forward. To come into the office (or onto the factory floor or out into showroom — wherever your business is) and know everyone is on the same page, that everyone feels heard, and that everyone is excited about the ways they can continue to help drive progress is a powerful thing. And that can only be achieved by recognizing what motivates your team and empowering them to make changes that matter.”

“In the case of compensation design, we think about enhancing the nine capitals — psychological, human, health, spiritual, knowledge, social, cultural, natural, financial — at the level of the individual team member and how they reverberate into the team members’ family and community.

“Broadly speaking, offer opportunities for people to grow and develop interior-oriented qualities and capacities.

# How To Get People Involved In And Committed To Your Company Goals

## 

The concept of work has undergone a fundamental shift.

People no longer want to go to their jobs every week, put in exactly 40 hours, and repeat that pattern for 20 or 30 years. Instead, everyone is searching for purpose.

They’re searching for self-actualization through their marriage, work, life.

So, as a leader, you can’t just send out memos with a list of goals and expect everyone to band together and commit to them.
> # You have to harness the desire for purpose and commitment in a way that brings people together around your company goals.

That sort of commitment — passion, excitement, dedication — only comes from people who are truly engaged with their work. It comes from a community that sees a future where everyone benefits from what’s being done. It comes from people who feel their job has a meaning and a purpose beyond 5 o’clock in the evening.

And you’re responsible for building that community.

Here’s how to do it:

## **Purpose has to be discovered and nurtured — you can’t implement it.**

You can’t announce purpose at an all-company meeting or put up a billboard.
> The desire to work together and [commit to goals](https://artplusmarketing.com/how-to-accomplish-goals-when-you-have-no-idea-where-to-start-cffcf2040467) often develops from a single spark.

In that sense, creating a sense of purpose is very similar to starting a bonfire. All it takes is a single match. The challenge is that you can’t just decide to strike a match. But you can architect the right conditions and environment for when the spark happens.

At the most basic level, a group that comes together has to like each other. They have to respect each other’s professional skills and knowledge, and they may even bring shared values to their work environment.

As the CEO of a biotech company, Morphic Therapeutic, I find those shared values revolve around wanting to do good science. The act of discovery is core to the human condition. People want to be in a place with integrity and a commitment to the science we’re working on.
> # When shared values are in place, the conditions are right for a sense of purpose to develop.

People begin to bond. They have conversations about shared life experiences, mutual interests, and long-term goals. Eventually, something clicks and the spark begins to create an entity far greater than a company — a community.

## **The community and purpose draw people in.**

Finding a common purpose causes people to come together within an organization.

And once everyone begins to see their futures as intrinsically linked, work stops being a zero sum game. People cease to see themselves as an individual who can “win” or “lose” depending on the situation. They begin to view success as something that is achieved by the entire group.

In many situations, it’s natural to feel as though you’ve lost when someone else wins an award or achieves a major goal. And there are plenty of companies out there where the culture never progresses past that mentality.
> But when a company has evolved to the point where people really feel as though they’re part of a group working toward a common set of goals, everything changes.

At this point, if a team member does something great, people recognize it as an achievement that helps move everyone forward. While you’re always pivoting between your individual needs and those of the group in a community, the fundamental aspect of this collective mentality is that you don’t feel you lost because someone else gained.

No one’s keeping score anymore. If a colleague has a victory, it was just their turn. Yours will come soon enough.

## **Purpose has to be actively pursued.**

You can’t implement collective purpose in a company by decree. But you can’t just wait around and hope for it to occur, either.

That’s why building a community is about getting to know people on a personal level, understanding their challenges, and having conversations about values and goals.

It’s about creating the conditions for the collective mission to emerge.

Something I’ve noticed is that people almost universally seem scared of networking and getting to know other people. So at Morphic Therapeutic, I emphasize helping people network so they can create an external community for their own career paths. I do that first and foremost because I want them to have successful careers. But I’m also hoping some of that networking ability translates into how they think about community within the company as well.
> *Because if people spend time building their own personal communities, see the value, and live their lives outside of work with a sense of purpose, that’s going to translate to their work lives.*

You have to understand others and *amplify *what they feel capable of. Be a force multiplier.

You can’t simply give speeches or implement your way to a purpose-driven community within your company, but you can give people the tools and support for it to emerge on its own.

# Startup Lesson #4&#58; There is a third way to make money

## By Richard Reis

*Recently, I started building an app, [Gurgeh](https://www.gurgeh.com/). **Every week I learn something new **(this is a common feeling among founders). So I decided to share my weekly lessons in the hopes that (1) I don’t forget them and (2) they help you on your own journey.*

In the world of startups, we usually only talk about two ways to make money. Either (i) raising money, or (ii) charging people (users or advertisers).

However, **there is a third way **that isn’t as commonly discussed.

I was going to call it *“the side hustle”… *But I don’t like the way it sounds. Instead, I’ll take a page out of [Tim Ferriss’ book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002WE46UW/?tag=richardreeze-20) and call it, *“the muse.”*
> # “Our goal is simple: to create an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time. That’s it. I will call this vehicle a “muse” whenever possible to separate it from the ambiguous term “business,” which can refer to a lemonade stand or a Fortune 10 oil conglomerate — our objective is more limited and thus requires a more precise label.” — Tim Ferriss

You probably get the idea.

A muse is something small **built with the sole purpose of making money**.

No changing the world. No IPO. Just something that helps you pay the bills.

Startup founder strapped for cash? This can be your life saver!

The most famous example of this was [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) (for more information, read *“[Brian Chesky: I lived on Cap’n McCain’s and Obama O’s got AirBnB out of debt](https://pando.com/2013/01/10/brian-chesky-i-lived-on-capn-mccains-and-obama-os-got-airbnb-out-of-debt/)”*)

![Cap’n McCain’s and Obama O’s were the “muse” that made $30,000 and saved Airbnb’s life.](1*vyzulgefOEvIWXoSwEca4g.jpeg)*Cap’n McCain’s and Obama O’s were the “muse” that made $30,000 and saved Airbnb’s life.*

I had known this story for a while, but never thought much of it.

That was until I found out recently that [Austen Allred](https://twitter.com/AustenAllred) made $33,000 from [his muse](https://medium.com/user-acquisition-for-hackers/secret-sauce-growth-hacking-guide-sold-33-000-in-its-first-week-bd37561997), which helped him launch [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)!
> Sidenote: Can you think of other cool stories where a muse helped a startup? If so, drop a comment below and let me know *😊 *I believe this “third way to make money” should be discussed more often.

A muse helped build Airbnb and Lambda School? I had to give it a try.

Since I think it’s too early to raise money for [Gurgeh](https://www.gurgeh.com/), and I don’t want to charge users (my goal is to help users have **more** money, not less), **a muse is the perfect option**!

### My muse experiment: [MostRecommendedBooks.com](https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/)

I like [Tim Ferriss’ podcast](https://tim.blog/podcast/) and I like reading books, so I decided to **combine both**!

Recently, my friend [Anurag](https://twitter.com/anuragwho) and I launched a website where you can [find awesome book recommendations](https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/) (we creatively called it *“MostRecommendedBooks.com”*).

It shows two things:

1. The books recommended by all of Tim’s guests (and a few other people).

1. The ranking of [top books](https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/top-books) that are recommended over and over again.

![My muse ❤️](1*kFMhZcY3JgYzPHtgRnqe6A.png)*My muse ❤️*

This is cool because (a) it’s simple and (b) it doesn’t charge people anything (it makes money from affiliate links).

Hopefully, this little experiment is the muse that will help my startup flourish 😊

Now, it’s your turn. **Can you think of a muse that will help you make extra money?**

### But…

Here’s a warning. **Do not let the muse distract you from your core business!**

One of the most important qualities in a great founder is** focus** (blog post on this coming soon).

If you let your muse take too much of your time, you will lose focus.

This is bad (it will **probably** lead to the loss of your startup).

As you probably guessed, this completely defeats the purpose of a good muse.

Remember, **build and sell your muse quickly **(and then go back to your main goal).

And that’s it for today!

See you next week.

Be well.

# Want breakthrough success for your business? 7 keys to making “Black Swans” happen.

## Want breakthrough success for your business? 7 keys to making “Black Swans” happen.

Yesterday, Seth Godin blogged [about my book](https://seths.blog/2018/07/books-worth-reading/). As you can imagine, this had a positive effect on sales.

![](1*8fDsuNabWtwjpAzAQGw5KA.jpeg)

This was what I call a “Black Swan” marketing event. It reminds me of the time my [email list](http://kadavy.net/tools) [grew](http://email1k.com/course/lesson-10/) from 5,000 subscribers to 30,000 subscribers within two weeks.

![](1*Hgy6UGgXraEGWePpfZvJMw.png)

Or the time my book [debuted](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/d4h-the-book/) on the top 20 on all of Amazon.

![](1*2XamUUrIkIpwhFNUxR1RWA.gif)

It also reminded me of the time I got my [book deal](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/d4h-the-book/) in the first place, the time I collaborated with behavioral scientist [Dan Ariely](https://twitter.com/danariely) on [an app that Google bought](https://medium.com/s/story/what-i-learned-about-productivity-while-reinventing-google-calendar-c3b507fa7f12), or the time a Silicon Valley startup discovered me in Nebraska.

These “Black Swan” marketing events have three characteristics:

* **Unpredictable.** I didn’t know any of these events were going to happen.

* **High-impact.** Each of these events completely changed my business. Once a Black Swan event happens, it becomes a milestone. I then refer to everything as “pre-*x*” and “post-*x*.” (It still remains to be seen whether the Seth Godin endorsement will have this effect. Some events that seem to be “Black Swans”, such as having my [podcast featured on the Apple Podcast’s home page](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/apple-podcast-itunes-front-page-feature/), turn out to not be high-impact in the long term.)

* **Hard to replicate.** You can’t know exactly how these events happen. You can rationalize after the fact, but you can’t simply follow the same steps, and get the same result. You can merely create the conditions, which we’ll get to.

The term Black Swan comes from [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://twitter.com/nntaleb)’s book called…[*The Black Swan](http://geni.us/Y2l4)*.

![](1*ThDb_JBf_0y4LJYeNPSL8g.jpeg)

The best way to illustrate what a Black Swan is like, is to think about a turkey. The turkey gets fed every day. Each day the turkey gets fed, it confirms the turkey’s belief that humans are nice, and that humans are looking out for its best interests. Then…

![](1*0jPzBCQgKAdSKoaIGpbLqA.jpeg)

…Thanksgiving happens. The turkey made the mistake of forming beliefs about tomorrow based upon data from yesterday. The turkey’s beliefs were increasingly wrong, because the turkey misinterpreted that data. (The turkey thought being fed was a good sign, when in fact it was a bad sign.)

Taleb often talks about Black Swans in terms of bad events. For example, the financial crisis of 2008 was a Black Swan. 9/11 was a Black Swan. Both were hard to precisely predict, and we refer to both of these events as “pre-*x*”, or “pre-9/11” and “post-*x*”, or “post-9/11.”

But Black Swan events can also be good events, as is the case with the many Black Swan marketing events I’ve experienced in more than [ten years](https://medium.com/s/story/what-i-learned-about-productivity-while-reinventing-google-calendar-c3b507fa7f12) in business.

One of Taleb’s defining factors of a Black Swan event is that it’s rationalized after the fact. We employ our biases trying to explain how the event happened, or we find data that matches up with our theory of how it happened.

This is where popular marketing methodologies such as a/b testing can become dangerous. If we aren’t careful to use solid methodologies, we can be led astray. I illustrated this by [showing up to a 300% “increase in conversions” in a/a tests](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/aa-testing/)—meaning the “increase” I saw was merely statistical variation. As one of Taleb’s other books would explain, I was [*Fooled by Randomness](http://geni.us/qvrRoq)*.

You could use poor data methodologies to come up with false reasons. You could even use “good” data methodologies to also come up with false reasons. I tend to call this “data blindness,” or being “irrationally rational.” The focus on what can be measured can actually make you blind to the—often unknowable—truth.

In [*Antifragile](http://geni.us/EAmBrZ)*, Taleb calls post-hoc rationalization “lecturing birds how to fly.” Imagine a physics professor showing a bird a bunch of equations to explain to that bird how it should fly.
> # We have the illusion that the world functions thanks to programmed design, university research, and bureaucratic funding, but there is compelling — very compelling — evidence to show that this is an illusion, the illusion I call lecturing birds how to fly. Technology is the result of antifragility, exploited by risk-takers in the form of tinkering and trial and error. —Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Antifragile

Randomness, and tinkering and trial and error, play a big part in making Black Swan marketing events happen. You can’t know exactly how they happen. But, you can create the conditions for these events.

So, how do you create the conditions for Black Swan marketing events? Here’s what has helped me:

1. **Believe in Black Swans**. The concept of the Black Swan comes from living in a world full of white swans. If you have never seen a Black Swan, you might decide they don’t exist. You’d be using “absence of evidence as evidence of absence.” Simply knowing that these Black Swan events exist will open you up to making these events happen.

1. **Avoid doing things that won’t lead to Black Swans.** If we don’t keep in our minds that Black Swan events exist, we get drawn into activities that have little chance of leading to Black Swans. For example, you’re unlikely to make a Black Swan happen by a/b testing the button color on your landing page. (In [*Zero to One](http://geni.us/Om2G)*, Peter Thiel calls this kind of thinking “incrementalism.” Taleb calls it living in “mediocristan”—in contrast to the world of “extremistan”, where Black Swans exist.) So, use your knowledge that Black Swans exist to divert your attention away from activities that won’t lead to Black Swans.

1. **Think in the long-term.** Everyone wants overnight results. This makes us even more biased toward mediocristan-activities like tweaking an ad campaign. When I look at my own Black Swan events, they all involve assets that I had previously built up over the course of years. Before sending my book to Seth Godin, I had built up over 100 Amazon reviews, over the course of six months. I also had [Seth on my podcast](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/seth-godin-podcast/) more than a year earlier, after spending a patient two and a half years trying to get him on the show, and after being a fan for nearly fifteen years. I doubt he would have endorsed my book if I had merely demanded it of him in a cold email.

1. **Avoid big projects full of unknowns.** It’s impossible to win the lottery without buying one ticket, but your chances of winning [don’t improve much](http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-powerball-maryland-odds-20160111-story.html) by buying more tickets. Even though you should think in the long-term, don’t invest months and years in a huge project with no clear signs that it will pay off.

1. **Make small bets with big potential upsides.** Instead of investing months or years in a huge project, instead, spend weeks or days—or even minutes—on small projects. Small things can lead to huge things, and they can also give you signals that make it worth investing more—yes, the old [*Lean Startup](http://geni.us/ShzX)* approach. I got my first book deal because I wrote a blog post. I teamed up with Dan Ariely because I wrote a blog post. My endorsement from Seth Godin came from a series of emails.

1. **Make the unreal real.** To make Black Swans happen, you have to avoid tweaking what sits in front of you. Instead, you have to make exist something that doesn’t yet exist. This includes mere changes in definitions of things that already do exist. I existed, yet I wasn’t a best-selling author—in fact, I was a twenty-five-year-old in a gray cubicle in Nebraska with no connections. After making the unreal real several times, I eventually became a best-selling author. This seems obvious, but it makes a world of difference in your confidence. After you make the unreal real enough times, it starts to get easier.

1. **Do the crazy idea.** We spend too much time in mediocristan because we’re scared. Meanwhile, we have plenty of crazy ideas that we dismiss without even thinking about it. (In [*The Heart to Start](http://geni.us/F6eL)*, I call this “The Voice.”) Crazy ideas by definition don’t have past data to back them up, so it takes courage to pursue them. But, crazy ideas have a higher chance of leading to Black Swan events than do “normal” ideas.

As you get more successful, pursuing Black Swan events gets harder. If you’re successful, you have lots of opportunities. You commonly hear advice about the importance of saying “no” to opportunities that aren’t going to pay off.

But if you say “no” to every opportunity that doesn’t have a clear payoff, you’ll get stuck in mediocristan—yes, your business will grow incrementally, but you have little chance of stratospheric success.

Dan Ariely mentioned in a recent [podcast conversation](https://fs.blog/dan-ariely/), with [Shane Parrish](https://twitter.com/farnamstreet), his strategy to counter the pressure to say “no” to nearly everything. He’s sure to practice saying “no,” but he also says “yes” to some small percentage of opportunities that don’t make sense for him to pursue. He’s opening himself up to more Black Swan events.

We’re naturally attracted to the sure bet. We can measure our efforts and results, and assure ourselves that we did the right thing. But to truly have breakthrough successes, we need to ignore sure bets, so we can invest in the crazy idea. It will lead us through uncertainty, but it eventually pays off—you just don’t know how, or when.

# The Planning Fallacy&#58; Why You Miss Your Deadlines, And What to do About it

## Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash

How often do you find yourself racing at the last minute to finish a task?

If you’ve ever missed a deadline the planning fallacy may well be the culprit.

Most people are more conscious about time and how they use it. They have a better awareness of how much of it they will spend on impending tasks.

Others are very prone to be optimistic when ‘budgeting’ it. They display an optimism bias and underestimate the time needed for every task for the day.

This is a common pitfall when managing time, called ‘t**he planning fallacy**’.

We consistently underestimate how long it will take to write a post, an ebook, record podcast, complete a side project, or hold a meeting.

The **planning fallacy was **first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979.

This phenomenon can occur regardless of your knowledge that past tasks of a similar nature have taken longer to complete than generally planned.

“The more steps you have in whatever project or task you’re working on, the greater the chance that in one of those steps you’re going to hit a snag and it’s going to turn out to be atypical,” [writes](https://bigthink.com/in-their-own-words/why-you-cant-plan) Julia Galef of Big Think.

Planning fallacy is one of the most common and consistently demonstrated cognitive biases.

For example, a house can only be built on time if there are no delivery delays, no employee absences, no hazardous weather conditions, etc.

Even if each hurdle is unlikely, there is a high probability that at least one will occur.

In every project, people rarely consider the *what if*s, which is why they underestimate their task completion times.

The good news is that being aware of how cognitive biases affect you can help you be on the lookout for them, and change your behaviour to compensate.

## **Resist the tyranny of the urgent**

According to research, bite-sized tasks and interruptions can disrupt concentration for up to half an hour.

Urgency wrecks productivity. Your ability to distinguish urgent and important tasks has a lot to do with your success.

Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, “What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important.”

Urgent tasks require your immediate attention: phone calls, meetings, tasks with tight deadlines, and other issues that require you to take action quickly.

Important tasks help advance long-term goals and complete serious projects. They are tasks that actually push the needle.

But unfortunately, we tend to put important tasks aside and deal with the urgent tasks that provide a rapid sense of accomplishment but doesn’t help advance long-term goals.

Kat Boogaard of Trello [explains](https://blog.trello.com/planning-fallacy-overloaded-at-work), “Our brains have the not-so-helpful tendency to conflate real, productive work with those other small, menial, and mindless tasks. By totally pushing those out of your mind (and off your to-do list) for now, you won’t be tempted to color code your inbox when you should actually be completing that presentation that’s due in two hours.”

Learn to limit the amount of time you’re wasting on non-urgent/non-important tasks.

The fundamental approach to solving this vicious circle of work is to understand the difference between urgent tasks and important tasks.

## Break big tasks into smaller pieces

The more steps your task or project involves, the more opportunities there are for something to go wrong.

When you are making predictions, pay attention to the steps you need to take, and not just the outcome.

People who procrastinate often feel overwhelmed and the task seems insurmountable.

By breaking a bigger project into smaller tasks, the work is more manageable and less intimidating.

Think of each component that is involved in the process, and allocate time for it to be completed.

Examine the parts of any task, and figure out step-by-step what you need to do to get it done.

Create a timeline for completing your tasks. Having a deadline will make you more focused for each task.

Give yourself 30 minutes to complete something or an hour. If the task is too large to complete in an hour, break it into smaller tasks, and time box those smaller tasks.

To help you stick with your new work hours, set appointments for 30 minutes after you’re supposed to get off work. So if you tell yourself you’re absolutely going to leave work at 5 p.m. (or even better, at 3 p.m.), set an appointment for 5:30 p.m. and stick to it.

Set a hard deadline.

Set a specific goal for the end of that length of time, and set it in stone.

If you set a tighter deadline for each of your tasks today, you’ll be inspired to find the most productive way to meet those deadlines and get your work done.

Make a list of the tasks you need to accomplish by close of day today. Then, think about how much time it will take to accomplish each of those tasks.

Once you begin your work, you’ll find you’re in a race against the clock.

That’s exactly what you want because it will inspire you to get it done.

When you’re done, take a look back and see how you’ve fared. Measure your progress and improve accordingly.

Did you inflate the time required for some tasks?

There may be some tasks that you simply can’t cut hours on or some that you can cut even more time from.

Adjust your schedule to work better, faster and smarter.

## Use the Pomodoro technique

Begin tracking your time to get a more realistic handle on how long specific projects and tasks take you. That can easily override your optimism bias and keep your expectations in check.

The [Pomodoro technique](http://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique/) teaches us to work with time, instead of struggling against it. It can help you power through distractions and get things done in short bursts.

The Pomodoro Technique, strictly about time-management was developed by Italian entrepreneur Francesco Cirillo. He created this simple study habit (when he was still a college student in the late 1980s) to maximize his productivity and reduce a feeling of burnout.

It focuses on working in short, intensely focused bursts (20/30/40 minutes), and then giving yourself a brief break to recover and start over.

The technique requires a timer, and it allows you to break down your large complex task into manageable intervals.

Once you start a task, you aim to finish it before attending to urgent but unimportant tasks.

## **Beware of “time bullies”**

When you are on the clock or supposed to be working, your time is for your work. Protect it.

Say no more often.

”Saying “No” means you have time to focus on your own creation, tasks and projects, rather than responding and reacting to requests.

In the words of Paulo Coelho: “When you say YES to others, make sure you are not saying NO to yourself.”

Don’t get suckered into tasks you don’t have time for.

Saying No is hard, but it means you say Yes to focus and sanity. Use your power of choice to say “Yes” or “No” when you mean it.

## Key takeaway

Falling into the planning fallacy can make you feel overloaded.

If you are able to recognize and address this issue before it gets out of hand, you will be less likely to allow it to impact your success.

Human judgment sucks.

Don’t rely on your personal, subjective judgment of how long something is likely to take or how involved it will be because that’s likely to suck.

Measure and compare.

How well did past projects performed in terms of their PLAN versus the ACTUAL time it took to complete?

* What went well?

* What didn’t go so well?

* What can you do differently next time?

Rely on evidence.

Track your progress and base your decisions on past evidence.

# A Life Lesson from 30,000 Feet

## 

The final announcement came over the intercom:
> # “As always, we thank you for flying Southwest.”

As we taxied across the runway, a wide, solid strip of land that undoubtedly used to be a cow pasture, passengers began to fall asleep. The early morning flight was a mistake because the world is quiet and black and I have too many chances to ask myself why.

Why am I following orders to fly out West? Why am I going to a conference for an industry I do not desire to stay in? Why do I take meeting after meeting?

**Why am I addicted to “yes, I will?”**

I am crammed up against the 16-inch window of our steel cage which, in only a few moments, will magically escort us 1,789 miles from Nashville to Las Vegas.

Although it has not rained since yesterday afternoon, dew from the morning swims down the top of the plane and across my window. First moving slowly, the drops collect until finally giving in to gravity. After a while, the 737 picks up speed and individual drops turn to streams. They remind me of the game I used to play on my computer — *Snake*.

*Snake* is a game where you use 4 arrow keys to direct a collection of pixels which is supposed to be a snake toward a different colored collection of pixels which is supposed to be snake food. I remember them being apples, but I don’t think snakes eat apples. Maybe they were bloody rats.

The game starts simply enough because your snake is small. You don’t have much to manage: guide your monster toward the food. Don’t hit walls and don’t trip over yourself. Here’s where the game gets hard — the more valuable trinkets you collect, the longer your snake gets. In this magical world, eating more food instantly changes your body composition. There is no narrative to this adventure except to accumulate goodies and get bigger. In a matter of seconds, you go from maneuvering your tiny snake in a world of infinite possibility to frantically jerking your controls back and forth in a panic, trying not to crash into a wall or trip over yourself.

You wonder why you had to pick up all those trophies in the first place.

We are now above the clouds and I see more snakes — snakes of houses leading to the fat belly of a city. Snakes of roads we couldn’t help but build. Snakes of highways marking the path where white people plowed over red people because we could and, apparently, we had to. Manifest Destiny and all that. Achieve the goal at any cost regardless of how big your snake gets or how difficult it becomes to maintain.

You go to school to get a degree. You get a degree to get a job. You get a job to earn money. Your money helps make you more attractive to a partner. With this partner, you raise children and teach them the value of being smart and having money and growing up and wanting more. And as your snake gets longer you wonder what the point of it all is, really, and if you wouldn’t be better of closing the game to write your novel or take those photographs or make that movie.

Nobody wins at *Snake*.

You go in circles within walls and then you die. Some people die with a very long snake. Some wipe out immediately, unable to master the controls. We feel pity for these people because they are bad at the game, but then they get up and leave the rat race to do something more fulfilling.

Maybe they are the smart ones.

Much love as always ❤

# An Infallible Guide&#58; How You Can Be a Top Medium Writer — Key Learnings From My Experience

## An Infallible Guide: How You Can Be a Top Medium Writer — Key Learnings From My Experience

Over the past 2 and a half years, Medium has paved the way for some incredible opportunities for myself and others. Because of my writing on Medium, I have landed a [column](https://www.inc.com/author/dakota-shane) on *Inc. Magazine* (where I write 6 times per month), I have spoken on industry-leading podcasts like [*Social Media Examiner](https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/medium-bloggers-publish-dakota-shane/)*, given talks at conferences like Social Media Camp (Canada’s largest social media conference), and driven a number of clients to hire Arctiphi (my marketing agency).

![Social Media Camp in Victoria, BC :)](1*QAH67IAFyWMlgEnaTTXQDQ.jpeg)*Social Media Camp in Victoria, BC :)*
> # Most recently, I’m excited to say that one of the top business book agents in the world will be representing my book. The best part? The upcoming book came from a [Medium article](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-7-mindset-shifts-needed-for-successful-social-media-marketing-c6951f62a063) I wrote a while back that performed pretty well.

I don’t say this to brag, but to show everyone who’s reading this that the opportunities on Medium, when strategic and calculated, can truly be life-changing.

Busting my ass had paid off, at least by the numbers. I’ve learned a lot about navigating Medium and what works on it, so I wanted to share those learnings with you.

**Medium is very competitive, which is why I think I’m in a particularly good spot to share some insights and tips with you all. I don’t have 30,000 followers. I’m not a serial entrepreneur who’s sold 13 companies. And I’m sure as hell not Barack Obama.**

**So if I can find success on Medium, you can too.**

Let’s get started:

## 1. Have a niche, even if you don’t stick to it all the time.

Having a niche on Medium is important when it comes to growing an engaged following. By consistently writing on certain topics, you will slowly but surely begin to position yourself as an authority in whatever area it is you cover.
> **This does not mean you have to stick to your niche in all of your articles. In fact, one of the most interesting aspects of Medium is the lack of one-dimensional influencers. It’s awesome to see CEOs writing articles about music, and artists writing articles about politics.**
> **That being said, if you meander too much and too often, it will be hard for audiences to know exactly what value you can provide them.**

In the beginning, try to be a one-trick pony. Once Medium grows, your audience grows, and someone needs assistance in your area of expertise, who do you think they’ll reach out to? Hopefully you!

Some of the most popular writers on Medium do this and have risen to the top as a result. [Jessica Semaan](https://twitter.com/jessemaan) is the poet on Medium. [Benjamin P. Hardy](https://twitter.com/BenjaminPHardy) is the self-help aficionado on Medium. [Sarah Cooper](https://twitter.com/sarahcpr) is the quick-witted, hilarious comedian on Medium. They have a niche, and they excel at it.

While I might not be on the same level as those mentioned above, my hope is to be the “social media marketing guy” on Medium. I think have a solid start — although [Gary Vaynerchuk](https://medium.com/@garyvee) is making a little difficult for me ;p

It doesn’t necessarily matter *what* your niche is because Medium is bound to expand it’s reader base.
> # Even if your niche is tiny on Medium at this very moment, 2–3 years from now it‘s bound to grow significantly given the speed at which readership is growing on the platform. What’s important is that you find your niche, and you stick to it.

## 2. Being genuine works.

Just be yourself. Imposter syndrome can only get you so far. Perhaps that’s something that resonates with my readers. I don’t try to be anyone I’m not. I’m a kid who is starting a social media agency, and loves to write. I’m not yet at the level where I can work with Coke and Nike and Google. My clients are much smaller. But that’s okay.

It’s good to lay things on the line. No one likes anyone with a stick up their ass. Be yourself. Be different. Be interesting.

## 3. Adding value is always the best course of action.

At the end of the day, people don’t want their time wasted. They want to read content they will gain value from.

There is a time and place for writing for yourself. I do it all the time. Many of us do. It’s therapeutic and helps our brains get kickstarted. **But here’s the thing:** If you want to write for an audience, then you’re going to have to make some sacrifices.

If you aren’t giving others a *reason* to read your content, as in adding value, then they won’t read it. Plain and simple.

After you have finished writing an article, try your very best to honestly answer this question:
> # “If I saw this on my feed, would I spend 5 minutes reading this?”

If the answer, deep down, is no. Then try a different approach. Perhaps a more somber article would do better if you switched the tone to comedic, or vice versa.

## 4. # of Comments as a key indicator of success.

Don’t get me wrong, Reads are great. Claps are even greater. But one of the most undervalued metrics, in my opinion, is the number of comments you’re receiving on your articles. Medium is trying it’s very best to be a conversational platform, so their algorithm factors in the number of comments when deciding which articles to promote.

Get your audience in on the fun. Invite them to give their own opinion on the topic you cover, and never shy away from productive debate. It’ll only benefit both you, your audience, and Medium as a whole.

## 5. Scrappiness is key.

![](1*XB8sYkOYbWFCJa649l0tow.gif)

Be scrappy. If you have a certain publication you‘ve wanted to get on for a while, then do everything in your power to get on it. Send the editor a witty email and make an intro, Tweet at them with a link to your work, connect with them on LinkedIn.

Don’t be creepy, but do everything in your power to make sure your content is seen by the amount of people it deserves to be read by.

**One thing to always remember is this: Have your work finished. Don’t reach out to an editor of a publication with an idea. Bring your A-Game, and have proof of it. A finished product is proof.**

If you have what it takes, you will eventually get discovered if you are scrappy enough.

## 6. Read Medium all the time.

You’ve gotta be a student of the game to excel at it. LeBron can recount, play-by-play, games in the NBA Finals from years before he was even born. He’s a true student of the game.

If you want to see what works on Medium, then you have to read Medium. All the time.

You wouldn’t try and create a documentary before you watched one, would you? I hope not.

This worked particularly well for me in [one of my articles](https://medium.com/the-mission/snapchat-is-not-for-everyone-don-t-believe-the-hype-here-s-why-7d7b87a62417).

I was able to see every single person and their dog was talking about how amazing Snapchat was, so I decided to challenge a handful of those notions.

You can do the same! **Listen, evaluate, and respond.**

## 7. You’re gonna have some stinkers (off-days).

![](1*xToir2TQ7M8espAUaRJKAg.jpeg)

Experimentation is a key ingredient in discovering *what* truly works for *you*. This is why it’s crucial to take chances. Try writing a topic you feel a bit uncomfortable in. Try putting a twist on the tone in your articles, in the call-to-actions in your articles, and everything else.

Numbers don’t lie. You’ll be able to find out what resonates well with your audience, on Medium as a whole by diversifying what you put out.

### Sometimes, you’ll have some stinkers. It’s inevitable. We’ve all been there and had them. If you haven’t, then you’re not taking enough chances.

I’ve had some articles completely fall flat, and others take off into the Top 20. Yet, as cliche as it sounds, I learn way more from my failures than I do my successes on Medium.

Embrace the stinkers you have, learn from them, and move forward.

## 8. Oftentimes, Medium is a skimming platform — not a reading platform.

Use this to your advantage. You don’t have to describe every tiny detail to tell your story in text blocks longer than the Old Testament.

Unless you‘re writing a poetic piece, fictional piece, etc. then be sure to keep it short. Keep it concise. Make your point, and be gone. Oftentimes, Medium readers are too busy doing awesome shit with their lives to waste any ounce of time.

Again, make your point and be gone.
> # Medium’s sleek interface, callouts, headlines, quote features, and more make it easily readable — almost skimmable (I think that’s a word) — which is one of the reasons a platform based solely on reading and writing is thriving in an era where the average human attention span is less than a goldfish.

## 9. Leverage Twitter, even if it’s just to say “Thanks”

Given Ev Williams was the co-founder of Twitter and is now the founder & CEO of Medium, the two platforms go, more or less, hand-in-hand.

Prior to writing on Medium, the only reason I ever logged onto to Twitter was to keep up with the news or read stream-of-consciousness Tweets from washed-up celebrities. I never had much use or love for the platform.
> # Even if you do not have a large Twitter presence, the platform is a great place to connect with your audience when they share your work. Writing comments on Medium is quite a commitment, which is intentional by design. Twitter is the polar opposite of Medium in this respect.

Today, the sole purpose of my Twitter account is to say “thank you” and connect with those people who share my Medium articles. I don’t try to gain thousands of followers. I barely ever Tweet if it is not related to Medium or conducting research for a client.

It’s not that I don’t know the value Twitter holds. I work in social media marketing 7 days per week, so I’m aware of the power it holds. It just isn’t my type of platform. I enjoy long-form, less frequent, deeper interactions with people as opposed to frequent, short interactions.

## *Bonus Tip: Use the Referrers option as a networking tool.

The Referrers button on Medium is clutch! This feature tells you the sources of your article’s traffic. To view it, go to the Stats page.

![Inside the Stats tab](1*-KaUOC9IbWJsuti33JHFgQ.png)*Inside the Stats tab*

![Screenshot of Referrers feature.](1*mMTgsMPgxNzPBLx9lkGlng.png)*Screenshot of Referrers feature.*

The way I use it is as a networking tool. If I notice a sizable amount of traffic has come from a blog post, or a certain publication, I will reach out to the owner/editor and introduce myself. I’ll say thanks, and connect with them.

Because these people liked your article enough to share it to their own audiences, it’s likely you two share similar interests. Every so often, this can lead to some great business opportunities. If it doesn’t lead to anything, at least you got to meet an awesome person!

## What’s still missing from Medium?

Medium is not perfect. There is a lot of ironing that needs to be done. If an adequate compensation model does not unfold for writers, they will not only outgrow the platform, but Medium’s success will never be able to hold a candle up to the platforms like YouTube — whose compensation model has paved the way for 19 year old content creators to buy million dollar houses.

If a stronger community does not unfold, I’m afraid writers will grow sour — after all, writing is a lonely profession, and an even lonelier hobby.
> # …writing is a lonely profession, and an even lonelier hobby…

These are a couple of the problems. But nothing great is without it’s problems. And if we’re all patient and stay faithful, I’m sure everything will pan out as it should.

**On a small scale, Medium is emblematic of real life.**

**Your successes don’t mean anything if you don’t continually bring your Agame.**

**Networking is key to success.**

**You have to provide value to others.**

**You have to develop a specific skill-set to rise above the noise.**

**You’ve got to be as consistent as you are spectacular.**

**But most of all, you’ve got to be patient.**

# 10 Rules To Change Your Life For The Better.

## 

After starting a business that almost crippled me, I decided to change my life for the better. At the start, I didn’t know how to do it. I had many limiting beliefs and was one of the most negative people you’d ever meet.

Through hard work and pain, I discovered how to change my life for the better. I transcended this idea when I figured out the true wisdom of how to make other people’s lives better.

Before you can get there, you have to change your life first. The end goal is actually not all about you, but it starts out like that.

This is a natural progression that occurs when you change your life for the better. You see things in a different way and that’s the real change.

### Here are the rules to follow from my own transformation:

## Rule #1. You must grow

Growing is how you build the skills necessary to change your life. Growing is admitting you don’t have all the answers, but it’s also being prepared to search them out yourself.
> # “Growing is taking responsibility and getting what you want thanks to hard work”

Growing is about listening and understanding how to learn. It’s the acquisition of skills and knowledge that will take you to the next level and make you look back on your progress with a smile.

![Image Credit: iStock](1*KAU3Fm8pC6BT5XLWGxYJ6g.png)*Image Credit: iStock*

## Rule #2. Define your goals and then crush them

Having a rough idea of where you’re heading and a way to measure your success is important.

Otherwise, you will feel like you haven’t achieved anything and that can kill your motivation. I don’t believe in overdoing it, though.

Aim for a few big goals and then spend the majority of your time executing them. Link your goals to daily habits that are achievable, and you’ll crush them to pieces. Ask yourself the question, “What does success look like?”

Use that as the basis for writing your goals and the specific actions you’ll take to accomplish those dreams.

## Rule #3. Choose uncomfortable over comfortable

All the big changes in my life that gave me growth were uncomfortable. I didn’t want to do public speaking in front of lots of people. I hated flying. I wanted to keep eating junk food and I felt too tired to exercise.

If I chose to be comfortable, I would never have changed my life for the better.

Doing things that were a stretch gave me a sense of fulfillment that can’t be matched by sitting on the couch and watching endless TV shows. I had to get off my lazy ass and embrace the fear!

## Rule #4. The answer to almost all requests of your time is NO

![Image Credit: Getty Images](1*LgD8oO0pI7rUx6FEWJuHDQ.png)*Image Credit: Getty Images*

Change requires time. During the transformation period — and even now — almost all requests for my time come with a reply of NO.

Saying NO gives you space and time to think and contemplate the change. Time allows you to assess what you’ve done to date.

You have to make time to change your life for the better. Life gets better when you have time to live it your way!

## Rule #5. Action will get you there faster

Overthinking, planning and talking to endless mentors and experts won’t help you change.

Taking deliberate action without having all the answers is how you make mistakes. Mistakes lead to breakthroughs and breakthroughs lead to you changing your life.

**The quickest way to get the change you’ve been looking for is to execute. Success lies in the execution, and changing your life is no different.**

We all want to change our life but most of us never take the action needed. We say things like *“One day I will”* or *‘Someday when I have time.”*

One day and someday never come. Before you know it, you’re on your deathbed full of regrets and all of the hope you had for your life is gone.

I don’t want this harsh reality to come true for you. The time to take action is now!

## Rule #6. Cherish what you have now because it can all be taken away

Too many people in life don’t appreciate what they have available to them. When you flip this fact on its head and become grateful, your life changes.

You think differently, and you act differently because you’ve come to grips with your mortality and the mortality of those around you.

None of us are going to live forever and any of us can be taken away at any moment through tragedy.

Don’t wake up in a hospital sitting next to your grandma wishing you spent more time with her during her final years. Cherish her now. Gratitude will make your life better and simpler.

## Rule #7. You are responsible

![](1*bD4lAiT4TBDEf_0YAeKnBg.jpeg)

This is a huge one! The government, your workplace, your colleagues, your family, the traffic cop who gave you a speeding ticket and the country you live in are not responsible.

**The only person who’s in control is you.**

When you quit the blame game and focusing on outside circumstances, you realize that it’s all up to you.

There’s immense power in this idea because the one thing you can control is yourself. So, if you have all the control, then you can change your life for the better. All you need is you.

## Rule #8. Don’t lie. Ever.

There’s enough BS in the world without you adding more. Lying separates you from the rest.
> Honest people get disproportionate results because they didn’t take shortcuts by lying to get there. All of us will eventually figure out the truth, so quit lying.

Turn lying into transparency. Tell people what you think. Admit your failures. Show your weakness so that you may find strength. The truth will help you find yourself.

## Rule #9. Love is all that matters

Love your partner. Love your family. Love your work.

If you strip back every part of the human experience and bring it back to its core, the only thing you’ll find is love.

Love is what created you. Love is what will get you through the darkest of moments. Love is all you have when you leave this world. Love is what people will remember when you’re gone.

![](1*c4mb0OaLPeIbS0uMfiKeEg.jpeg)

## Rule #10. Start with death and work backwards

That’s the only motivation you’ll ever need to hear. No more picture quotes, inspiring blog posts like this and podcasts with words of wisdom.
> # “Your death is already pre-planned for the future and set in stone, so don’t waste another second”

Do the things you’ve always wanted to do. Quit holding back or hiding from the truth. Change your life for the better right now!

# Why You Should Start A Lie Journal

## How tracking my fibs and exaggerations in daily speech yielded surprising consequences

![This quote is actually one Lincoln himself quoted of a man from church. But Abe subscribed to it, too.](1*4he6s_bXWcVuvOKP17ksOA.jpeg)*This quote is actually one Lincoln himself quoted of a man from church. But Abe subscribed to it, too.*

**A month ago I started a Lie Journal.** I wanted to track how many “white lies” I told in a month. I decided to start tracking this because of how seriously I take my job of finding and telling the truth as a journalist — and I wanted to see how congruent I was with that standard in my personal life.

Technically, I started the Lie Journal 25 days ago. So the month is not quite over yet. But so far so interesting.

**For example:** Do you see what I just did there? Once I started paying attention to little untruths in my everyday speech, I immediately started catching myself telling needless exaggerations and convenient fibs, mid-paragraph. Sometimes those clarifications didn’t make a real difference in the stories I was telling — but sometimes they did.

**Even cooler:** Each day the number of lies I told seemed to decrease. Here’s what I wrote down in the Lie Journal on the first full day:

* I told the barista at The Bean that I was “good” when he asked how I was doing.

* I logged into The Bean WIFI as Bob Barker and not my real name.

* I told my colleague I was around the corner when I was late to get her card back, but I was actually further away (2 blocks).

* I was honest with people at the breakfast event that I wanted to go (when I normally would have been more gracious and said “It is OK!” and stayed)… but I gave a couple of them the excuse that I was heading to therapy, which was not actually until later.

* I told the server lady at Bob White Counter that I didn’t want a biscuit because I didn’t want to waste food. But I knew I wasn’t going to eat all the chicken either, and I let her give me extra to replace the biscuit. I lied to myself that I would eat it and it was just about the carbs. But I think I just wanted to accept her kindness. [1]

Versus a couple days ago, in which I only caught myself telling one:

* I told my friend I met with that I already ate, cuz I didn’t want to eat. (Should have just said I am not hungry.)

As you can see, each of these white lies are fairly inconsequential. I guess that’s why we call them that. Some of them may not even count as lies. I was being conservative. Nobody got hurt. (Except maybe me, deep down in my soul.)

Though I don’t often subscribe to Slippery Slope arguments (it’s usually a fallacy), my hypothesis has been that if I get good at catching the little lies, I’ll be less likely to find myself caught in a more consequential lie — in my personal life OR in my work. (White lies breeding grayer and grayer lies, etc.)

But no matter how accurate that hypothesis ends up being, I’ve found it liberating to stop myself when I exaggerate in day to day interactions and stories — and even better, to prevent myself from exaggerating in the first place.

Turns out there’s not much harm in just telling the unvarnished truth, even on the little things. And that is a great little anxiety killer.

But an even more pleasant surprise has come out of this exercise.

I’ve decided that some of my white lies are just random conveniences, and many are efforts to spare myself or someone else the discomfort of knowing what’s really going on.

But I’ve learned that when I am up front with people about what’s really going on with me, not only do they appreciate the candor, but they often open up themselves. I’ve had some deep conversations already during this exercise that I would not have had if I’d have withheld whatever little thing I might normally have fibbed about.

One of those deep conversations led to a discussion about keeping a daily Gratitude Journal, which I’ve decided is going to be the thing I keep track of next month. It’s going to be my birthday, after all. There’s a lot to be grateful for!

Near the top of the list: the ability to learn and grow every year.

I will probably end this month’s Lie Journal by making some decisions about what kinds of things I decide are okay to withhold order to spare someone a burden. (E.g. telling the barista I’m “good” when I’m having a bad day may actually be okay, if he really is just saying “Hello” and is not actually asking how I am.) *(I’m working on a bigger writing project that all this ties into, and I’ll be sure to update you on it.)*

Meantime, I’ve decided I’m going to tell The Bean my real email address. They make good breakfast burritos and give me free WIFI. And besides, it feels like the right thing to do.

# 6 Ways to Strengthen Your Leadership Voice.

## 

Recently I was asked to facilitate leadership workshops for senior teams in two of London’s largest advertising agencies. These are agencies with a long legacy, an outstanding reputation and massive global reach. To say the pressure on their future leaders is intense is an understatement!

The focus for each workshop was the same: How can each individual sharpen and toughen up their leadership voice as they start to assume more responsibility within their organisation? And, most importantly, how can each leader become more inspiring, visionary and strong in a fast-paced, ever-shifting landscape with as many differing personalities as there are conflicting agendas?

These are difficult questions: and there are no easy answers. However, closely facilitating a challenging conversation around these themes is both important and necessary.

Each workshop begins with a frank discussion about what currently works, and also what stands in the way of our leadership success. We shine a light on our personal blind-spots and give and receive constructive feedback to accelerate our growth. The process is often electric as people slough off facades, dare to speak directly and raise points of urgency. For many it can be the first real workplace conversation for some time, and this fosters a strong sense of togetherness, openness and egalitarianism that is often missing.

At heart, though, the work is about developing team *edge*. We learn to play shoulder to shoulder with greater skill, acumen and competitive advantage so that we win more battles than we lose on the corporate battlefield.

## **6 Insights to Power up your Leadership Voice…**

### **1.** **Bias.**

We all have it. It is the personal filter through which we view our complicated world and is based on our upbringing, experiences and interpretations that don’t often withstand rational analysis. However, if we fail to challenge our strongly held assumptions, we create the very divisions we abhor. And, sadly, the result is a polarised “them and us” attitude that fuels militancy of opinion and passive aggression in the workplace. If left unchecked, our environment becomes toxic with little room for openness, exploration and discovery — all of which are essential attributes for both personal leadership and corporate growth.

**The Solution?**

Question your assumptions, particularly your most strongly held beliefs. When we stop blaming other people’s behaviour for our lack of power, we have to take the necessary responsibility to change. And, in doing so, we move from a powerless victim state to a stronger sovereign state. This doesn’t deny injustice in the workplace, but instead means asking yourself the more powerful question: W*hat are you going to do about it?.*

When we channel our anger *constructively, *we assert clearer boundaries, strengthen our resolve and rally others behind the values of integrity and respect. Leaders operating from this position can more powerfully navigate the tough business conversations that bring progress.

### **2. Listening.**

Few do it, or are even able to when pushed, and many instead prefer to speak over others to win peer recognition. Silence can feel like death or is so incredibly uncomfortable that such people will keep looking for opportunities to voice their fixed opinions. Discussions feel one-sided and closed because if leaders lack strength and can’t effectively govern the space between people, the balance tips unfairly towards the more dominant and denies airtime to the more timid and sensitive. And, ultimately we lose contact with large swathes of people who could contribute positively.

**The Solution?**

Develop rabbit ears, paying close attention to the non-verbal communication of your teams. If the power is out of balance, be assertive and *ensure* that interpersonal boundaries are respected. The benefits of this type of leadership are huge! As the more reticent learn to speak up and the dominant learn to listen (rather than wait for their turn to speak), we *all* realise that, despite the discomfort of breaking habits, we can now pay attention to what is actually going on. And, with this improved awareness, we acquire valuable information that would otherwise be missed, information that is often fundamental to a team’s success.

### **3. Emotional Intelligence.**

This is the ability to read emotions, both in one’s self and in others, and then to use this data to effectively steer the whole team towards a shared goal. This level of emotional sensitivity is woefully lacking in most workplaces. Instead, what we often get are leaders struggling to be honest with themselves, let alone their teams, and it’s little wonder that unspoken resentments constantly brew below the surface. Goals are often missed and morale sinks as staff turnover inevitably accelerates.

**The Solution?**

Develop your sensitivity by paying attention to what you *feel*. Then, use your own feelings as data to powerfully intuit and detect what’s really happening under the surface. You can then use this information to bring out the best in *everyone.* Emotional intelligence isn’t about pouring out our emotions in a bid to be “authentic” and real: it’s about being emotionally attuned and reading the temperature in the room. And, most importantly, it’s about developing the wisdom to know when to strike and when to refrain, given the constraints of the commercial world.

### **4.** **Political Correctness**.

The larger the firm, the more complex it becomes to navigate everyone’s diverse opinions, emotions and behaviour. What results is often a rigid political correctness in a misguided attempt to create group cohesion amidst the chaos. Yet, political correctness is an anathema to creativity, innovation and edge. When we can’t share our unique ideas for fear of recrimination from the more militant voices in the room, we lose our spontaneity and ability to engage in critical discourse. We can put out as many colourful bean bags as we like and keep scrawling our motivational quotes on whiteboards, yet without honesty and openness, corporations become sterile, tense and humourless places. A leader that buys into this ethos lacks any real power as most of their precious energy is wasted on pleasing the masses.

**The Solution?**

Develop a healthy dose of assertiveness, and get some backbone to say what you think and challenge group think. When said with respect, we ought to be able to express our unique viewpoints — especially if they go against the grain. No one person or group holds a monopoly on truth; this is about open discourse and critical thinking. Standing up to political correctness is absolutely imperative in encouraging your teams to show up fully, contribute different ideas and actually get excited! A strong leader will facilitate a space where all ideas are encouraged and openly critiqued without resorting to shame. This is true diversity.

### **5. Passivity.**

Many leaders weaken their presence by over-apologising or subtly dismissing what they have to say. The problem with excessive apology is that we signal our sense of unworthiness to others and actively give them permission to devalue our needs. There’s a clear payoff; we get to stay small and gain only pity and sympathy, rather than risking disapproval for stepping up. On some level we think we don’t deserve equal respect. But we are wrong.

**The Solution?**

Take your worth seriously. Know that you deserve respect and space. And notice that whenever you dismiss your worth through yet another apology, the only person putting you down is *you.* The idea that we must somehow grovel for respect is abhorrent and puts us in a vulnerable position where we become open to exploitation. So, pay attention to this habit and redirect your finite energy into strengthening your voice rather than devaluing it. The less we apologise for ourselves, the more direct we become with our teams and the more respect we gain.

### **6. Aggression.**

The flip side of passivity is aggression. There are those who use coercion, threat and hostility in an attempt to gain dominance and authority. Such people misguidedly believe they get better results by beating others with a proverbial stick. However, all this behaviour really achieves is the destruction of creativity, morale and respect. The more subservient among us, especially those keen to win approval, will keep running on the hamster wheel to keep their managers happy — but at what cost? Anxiety, burn out and secret dissent.

**The Solution?**

Become a positive role model in the workplace. Lead through powerful example by encouraging, rather than crushing, the potential in others. Never resort to blame, shame or attack just because someone is not acting how you think they *should*. There is zero strength in that approach. Instead, model confidence, respect and sensitivity so that you inspire your teams to step up rather than wallow in weakness. Because, when we care for our teams, we bring out the best in everyone. This doesn’t mean we cant challenge others, question consensus and say what needs to be said. Instead, it means we always use kindness when we say it.

Developing our leadership voice is challenging work. It demands that we look within, root out our own barriers to communication and get really honest with ourselves. It means we individuate from the pack and relinquish our need for constant approval. And, most importantly, it means we focus on what really matters: *people.* If, above all else, you care about the grandest of pursuits — the development of our fellow humans — you’ll become a fine leader indeed.

# What Questions To Ask The People Who Report To You

## For good managers, asking questions comes naturally

*A list of things CEOs can cover in one-on-one meetings with their managers, and some gentle ways to open up the discussion*

“She was the best manager I ever worked for,” said James. “She didn’t interfere at all in what I was doing. But she asked me questions every time we met— and those questions made me hugely better at my job.”

We were in the middle of a coaching session. James is the CEO of a fast-growing tech startup, prodigiously talented and indefatigably hardworking. But he hasn’t had much experience managing other people. And so he’s still learning how to be a good boss.
> # The greatest challenge in managing other people is to find the narrow path between interference and neglect

One of the most vivid things that came out of our discussion was getting James to talk about his own experiences when he’d been managed by other people. There was the one who disappeared for what felt like weeks on end, leaving him to make decisions without support but then looking disappointed when things didn’t turn out exactly expected. And there was the one who checked up on everything, five times a day, telling James not only what to do but how, in excruciating detail, to do it.

But the manager who taught James, the most, paradoxically, was the one who asked him the best questions.

Questions are great if they’re asked the right way. They help you resist the temptation to judge the situation before you understand it. They prompt the other person to find an answer for themselves, rather than do what they’re told. And they help you listen more. It’s not by accident that we all have two ears and one mouth.
> # Good questions help you to be a supporter and a guide, rather than a master and commander

The need for good questions is especially urgent in startups. When they’re successful, they grow like weeds, and it’s hard to stay organised when half the staff has been in the job for less than six months. When you have a group of people reporting to you who are each responsible for a team of other people, your biggest job is to make sure that they’re managing their teams competently. And that typically requires you to cover a lot of ground in a short time.

I’ve written a separate post about [SCRIM, a framework](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-look-behind-the-scrim-when-managing-people-who-report-to-you-36caf83d52ec?source=friends_link&sk=a03cb7aa961365e73dd20553a86f2c25) that helps you do that. It’s worth understanding in detail, but the one-sentence summary is that a checklist for good management covers five things: Selection (hiring the right people); Coaching (training them to do the specific tasks required in the job); Reliability (making sure things are done on time and to quality); Involvement (getting people motivated and engaged); and Monitoring (choosing and watching a few measures that tell you how things are going).
> # Five ingredients in good management: Selection, Coaching, Reliability, Involvement, Monitoring

These five things can therefore provide a useful structure for you each time you have a one-on-one (OOO) meeting with someone who reports to you. So if you choose, you can simply share the SCRIM acronym in a team meeting and ask people to consider the issues before their meetings with you. But that may sound too much like ordering them around. How do you turn the five topics into an agenda, and how do you avoid telling your reports what to do? Hence these questions.

### *1. Who’s your best performer this week? Who’s having most trouble?*

Most people are kind, and so instinctively recoil from firing people. This means that hiring mistakes — bringing in unsuitable people — often take much longer to recognise and fix than they should.

Given that resources devoted to coaching and training are wasted on the wrong people, Selection is arguably *the *most important agenda topic — but it’s unless you want to acquire a Hannibal Lecter reputation, don’t ask people straight out who in their team is incompetent and needs to be fired.

With the questions phrased as above, you can help your managers get in the habit of speaking honestly to you about how their people are doing. And if you simply wait rather than diving in with your own view — perhaps asking the occasional ‘What else?’ if the person you’re meeting dries up — then they will often start giving you surprising detail which you can mentally file away for later.

Once you’ve verified, by asking the questions below about coaching, that the manager has made a serious attempt at training any team member who is in doubt, you’re ready for a discussion at a future meeting of whether the under-performing team member is right for the job.

### *2. What skills do they need that they don’t have? How could you help them become more independent?*

These questions address the Coaching issue; they force the person reporting to you to think about whether they’ve trained their team adequately and what that training should consist of. When a manager feels overworked or claims that their team is incompetent, lack of attention to training is often the underlying issue.

Interestingly, one CEO said to me recently that the ideal report would be someone who could just be left to get on with it. I don’t agree; if they can do that, they probably have the skills to be much more senior, and you’ll therefore be paying for a far more experienced person than you need.
> # Anyone who truly needs zero supervision ought to be doing your job, not theirs.

The sweet spot for a startup founder is that you want people in the company to feel that working for your company was the job where they learned the most and grew fastest. What that means for the company is that you get talented people, but at low cost.

### *3. What do you expect your team to do every day and every week? How consistent do you feel their execution is?*

These questions address the reliability issue. If a thoracic surgeon with more than a decade of training still needs a checklist to ensure they don’t mistakenly leave a scalpel or a sponge inside your chest, then it’s unrealistic to expect that someone two years out of college is going to perform with 100% reliability every time.

It’s their manager’s job to help define a set of habits (maybe at the start and end of each day and week), so they’ll learn over time to zip through tasks quickly and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.
> # It’s the manager’s job to define a checklist for the people who report to them

This is an issue of process design that requires a particular ‘system mindset’, and most individual contributors (and many managers) can’t do it for themselves. If you’re CEO, it’s your job to make sure their managers design the right processes for them. And to help them if necessary.

### *4. Who in your team do you think could be most likely to quit? Who’s most enthusiastic? How’s morale? What could you do to improve it?*

These questions address the issue of Involvement, or how engaged people really are in their jobs. The first few times you ask, they’ll often uncover process problems — one CEO I work with discovered that sales people were taking precious time after each call to write up notes in their CRM, simply because they didn’t have headsets that allowed them to type during calls. And after that, they’ll uncover compensation issues: X wants a pay rise, Y wants a promotion, Z wants a bonus or more stock options.

But financial compensation is often a substitute for broader satisfaction at work; that’s why investment banks pay so well. Your questions can help reveal *and then fix *internal politics, personal animosities, and wider or more existential concerns.

Over time, you can broaden out from discussing just the most and least motivated. Good managers will have a sense of the morale of every individual working for them, and they ought to be able to report to you on it.
> # Money is often a substitute for broader satisfaction at work; that’s why investment banks pay so well.

### *5. What numbers tell you how well things are going in your department, and what needs to be fixed? How do you predict what your results will be next week or next month?*

These are great questions for Monitoring, and they’ll have a bewildering range of answers from contacts per day or close rate in sales to Fibonacci points per sprint in software development.

The important point is this: once you can find out the measures that reveal how well things are going, you’re in a position to home in on the biggest problems first and fix them, rather than asking your reports to give you exhaustive updates on everything that’s going on.

Only rarely can you expect managers to identify the right metrics themselves; if you’re CEO, that’s often your job. But monitoring doesn’t work best imposed from above. When your reports feel that they had a hand in deciding what indicators to watch, you’re likely to get more engagement from them in meeting their targets.

A good rule of thumb is to ask people for their ideas on what to measure and how. If they come up with an idea that’s obviously not going to work, no need to tell them; simply wait. Ask them for another idea — and then, when they’ve come up with three choices, invite them to assess the pros and cons of each. Well-chosen metrics or KPIs are immediately actionable: the number tells you what problem you need to solve.

You’ll probably be able to come up with lots more questions that your company and your context better fit. But the key thing is that they should be questions, not instructions or suggestions. The more you put the problem in front of someone who reports to you and ask them to solve it, the more you’re helping them get better at their job rather than doing their job for them. And the more you’ll be like James’s memorably inspiring, best-ever boss.

Another point to remember, which I’ve learned from a number of CEOs, is that the SCRIM process takes time to work. The first time, you’ll probably be asking people questions that you have never asked them before. Maybe they assumed those things were your responsibility, not theirs. And so it’s unlikely that in your first OOO you’ll be able to get through all of them. But that’s OK; persevere.

One final thought. What do you do if you realise, after a number of sessions with one of your reports, that actually they’re just not capable of applying the SCRIM framework to their own team? If so, they’re not going to be able to ensure that the people reporting to them are appropriately selected, coached, reliable, involved and monitored.

If that’s the case, and you’ve done your level best to help and encourage them over a period of time, then you’ve learned something important: that one of you isn’t actually the right person for the job. Either you’re not cut out to be CEO, or they’re not capable of managing the team they run. And the problem therefore is yours to fix.
> # If they can’t apply SCRIM, then either they’re not capable of managing their team or you’re not cut out to be CEO.

# 5 Lessons Summer Camp Teaches Future Entrepreneurs

## 

Friends from outside New England sometimes look shocked when I tell them my three kids are spending the summer at a sleepaway camp in the Maine woods. “You send your kids away for seven weeks? Don’t you like them?”

For those without this tradition, I suppose it seems odd to send children as young as 8 years old away from home for weeks at a time — but I can tell you that they are excited to go and usually sad to come home.
> There are many practical benefits to camp that my wife and I have seen firsthand.

Our children have gained leadership skills and independence at camp. They’ve learned self-advocacy and become more responsible. In fact, they’ve learned many of the same skills that entrepreneurs and emerging leaders need to be successful. Here are a few of the most important.

## **1. Take responsibility for your actions.**

Children at sleepaway camp don’t have their parents around to pick up the slack or whisper constant reminders in their ears, so when kids forget to put on sunscreen, they get burned. If they forget their cleats, they don’t play soccer. These are critical life lessons.

Pain is a powerful teacher, as I’ve seen with my middle son. He started getting migraines for the first time this year, and we were worried about how he would manage them at camp. After his first migraine there, however, he stepped up and internalized what his body needs. He has since been very responsible about avoiding his headache triggers and has had fewer migraines as a result.

Like kids at camp, entrepreneurs have to learn how important it is to acknowledge reality and take responsibility for our actions, for better and worse. Doing so sets the tone for a company culture where failure is embraced for what it is — a lesson learned.

## **2. Get out of your comfort zone.**

Summer camp encourages kids to try new things in a safe environment, one full of support from peers and counselors. Kids regularly [get out of their comfort zones](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-flux/201512/5-benefits-stepping-outside-your-comfort-zone), something that is good for everyone.
> # Founders should strive to create a similar environment — one where people take on new challenges and work to become their best selves.

The first year my daughter arrived at camp, she was afraid of the water. She was so nervous about even taking the basic swim test that her mother and I half expected her to too fail. But, when she had to step up to the expectations set at camp, she surprised even herself. By the end of the first week, she chose to complete the half-mile lake swim. A few weeks later, she got up on water skis. This rate of accomplishment would be the envy of any startup founder.

Entrepreneurs can learn a lot from this model. Creating a business culture that encourages risk-taking in a supportive environment — through mentoring and coaching, for example — can really pay off.

## **3. Focus on values and expectations.**

It’s impossible to make every decision for a growing business, yet entrepreneurs have a tendency to micromanage. That’s not a scalable model. Instead, set teams up for success by giving them goals, establishing guidelines for action and letting go. This is another lesson from camp.

Before my kids left for Maine this year, my wife and I talked to them about our family’s core values and gave them some tips for how they could live them at camp. It was all we could do, because we were not going to be there to provide course corrections and daily instruction. We simply had to trust them.
> **Parents need to let their kids grow up, and the same principle applies to employees.**

Rather than micromanage, set high expectations, and give your people room to discover how to meet them.

Yes, there will be failures, but there will also be growth. And your goal should be for people to grow under your leadership, not remain dependent.

## **4. Practice leadership.**

Leadership is a tough job, and tough jobs take practice. Camp has given my kids the chance to practice making decisions and handling the consequences — experiences they will carry with them for the rest of their lives.

This year, for example, both my boys were elected to serve as lieutenants for their respective age groups in [Color War](http://www.fridayfwd.com/color-war-competition-virtues/), a camp-wide competition that encompasses not just athletics but also singing, bunk inspections and even silent meals that are judged for points.

My boys had to set up the teams and organize line-ups for the competitions. Sometimes their teams won, and sometimes they lost. They were held responsible, so when their friends weren’t happy about their decisions, they heard about it. (Welcome to management, kid!).
> Leaders also need to give their teams opportunities to experience both the benefits and challenges of leadership.

Delegating tasks can be difficult for anyone who likes to be in charge, but if you don’t let others take responsibility for some areas of the business, you will never have time yourself for strategic, blue-sky thinking.

## **5. Make time for relationship-building.**

Finally, camp has given my kids quiet time — something we all need to reflect, recharge and reconnect.

Since the camps we send our kids to have strict “no technology” policies, our children take a long break from social media and instead get social the old-fashioned way. They don’t even miss their devices, which is a beautiful thing.

Many people think they could not survive being unplugged from today’s interconnected world, but [technology breaks can benefit all of us](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247799). Taking time to focus on in-person relationships strengthens emotional intelligence.

What’s more, when you’re not distracted by having Instagram, Facebook, the news and more in your pocket, you can focus on exploring new endeavors, like mastering archery skills or creating a killer go-to-market strategy. Learning to focus like that is invaluable — at camp, at work and elsewhere in life.

Of course, I don’t know if any of my kids will end up becoming entrepreneurs themselves, but even if they don’t, I am confident their time at camp will pay off. Learning to make friends, take responsibility, make decisions, take risks and lead teams will give them a step up and critical leadership skills for whatever they choose to do.

# Oatly’s Marketing Strategy — Unveiling the Hype!

## This brand was sold out in New York. Now, it is coming to Berlin.

![Oatly’s ad campaign in Berlin Mitte](1*QGbRAG39BB346KHNDgG3yg.jpeg)*Oatly’s ad campaign in Berlin Mitte*

In 2016, Oatly arrived in Williamsburg, the place to be for the hipsters of the hipsters. It didn’t took long until it went out of stock. The cool kids were devastated and even willing to pay twenty dollars for a quart.

Exactly the same happened in the U.K. and Sweden.

***So what is this Oatly hype all about?***

Oatly has invented the oat drink. The company does oats and oats only. While it started off as a niche player, its range now embraces a variety of oat-based diary products.

Matcha latte. Lemon elderflower OATgurt. Oat spread basil tomato.

Rickard Öste, a food scientist at Lund University Sweden, has founded the company in the 1990s. He has developed a patented enzyme technology to copy nature’s own process and turn fibre rich oats into nutritional liquid food.
> Oatly’s mission is to deliver products that have maximum nutritional value and minimal environmental impact.

Until today, the brand is independent.

## Market Entry Strategy in Germany

I live in Berlin. A city full of energy, life and — recently — oat drink ads. Tons of them. Oatly has taken over the urban landscape and dominates the public discussion. While their media spending is impressive, their ad strategy certainly is out of the box.

### The Campaign

Oatly has released outdoor ads only. They are product-focused, clean and provocative. The ads make fun of themselves and joke at the marketing industry: “You actually read this? Total success.” By hijacking the city overnight, Oatly awakes memories of a subversive guerrilla campaign. Its ironic headlines even shed light on the commercialisation of street art culture in Berlin: “We made this ad look like street art so you would like it better than if it was just an ad.”

### The Distribution

Oatly is available at supermarkets and organic grocery stores. The brand has also launched its very own Barista Edition so obsessive latte artists can showcase their skills. This super foamable oat drink is introduced through local coffee shops in Berlin. On the brand’s website, the official Oatfinder helps every coffee addict to find the closest CappOATcchino.

### The Target Group

All ads are in English. They target young and hip urbanists who are into street art and food culture. This target group takes care of its nutrition and appreciates vegan and vegetarian food trends. Conventional marketing non-sense from big brands turns them off and is considered as inauthentic.


### The Ad Strategy

Oatly’s magic lies in its paradoxe value proposition. The brand bridges the gab between selfishness and altruism. Consumers can achieve personal health benefits and still contribute good to the environment. Surprisingly, Oatly’s ad campaign doesn’t celebrate this momentum at all.
> No ad addresses the benefits of the products.

Instead, Oatly uses the ad space for a gigantic hack. It makes fun of all the large corporations that run traditional and stale marketing campaigns. The Swedes break with these rules. By doing so, they position themselves as an independent funny and sympathetic alternative for diary products. The brand establishes an authentic relationship with the cool kids on the block.

New York has survived the oat-milk shortage.

Let’s see what happens in Berlin…

# Don’t look for the right answer. Try this instead.

## 

In solving problems, our first instinct is to find the right answer.

In boardrooms across America, executives fall over each other to be the first to deliver the correct answer to a perceived problem. Doctors assume they’ve got the right diagnosis based on symptoms they’ve seen in the past.

Here’s the problem.

When we immediately launch into answer mode, we end up chasing the wrong problem. When we rush to identify solutions — when we fall in love with our diagnosis — our initial answer hides better ones lurking in plain sight. The difficulty lies, as John Maynard Keynes put it, “not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones.”

This is known as the Einstellung effect. In German, *einstellung* means “set” and in this context, it refers to a mental set. When we’re familiar with a problem, and when we think we have the right answer, we stop seeing alternatives. The initial framing of the question, and the initial answer, both stick.

Our education system reinforces the Einstellung effect. In schools, we’re taught to master problems, not to reframe them. The problems are handed to — no, forced upon — students in the form of problem sets. The phrase “problem set” makes this clear: The problems have been set (*einstellung*) and can’t be changed or questioned. A typical problem sets out “*all* of its constraints, all of its given information, comprehensively and in advance,” as high school teacher Dan Meyer [explains](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2018/rough-draft-thinking-bucky-the-badger/). The students then take the prepackaged and preapproved problem and plug it into a formula they memorized, which, in turn, spits out the right answer.

We then bring this conditioning into our adult lives. We continue our search for formulas, life hacks, and right answers. We ask the same cliche questions over and over again — *How do we think outside the box?* — but expect different results. Over time, we become a hammer, and every problem looks like a nail.

But finding the right question is often the key to finding the solution. “Every answer,” as Harvard business school professor Clayton Christensen puts it, “has a question that retrieves it.” The answer is often embedded within the question itself, so the framing of the question becomes crucial to the solution.

If you define your problem as a missing hammer, there’s only one possible solution: finding a hammer. But if you reframe the problem as a nail that’s sticking out, other solutions might work just as well.

Albert Einstein reportedly said that if he had an hour to solve a problem he’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions. There’s no evidence he [actually said](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/22/solve/) this, but he did believe that “the formulation of the problem is often more essential than its solution.”

Research supports this approach. Expert physicists spend more time than novices in understanding the problem before they begin crafting solutions. The most creative art students spend more time in the preparation stage than their less creative counterparts. Even after spending time viewing the problem from different angles, the more creative individuals keep an open mind and stand ready to make changes to their initial definition of the problem.

The next time you’re tempted to engage in problem solving, try problem finding instead. Ask yourself, *Am I asking the right question?* *Is there a different way of framing the problem? If I changed my perspective, how would the problem change?*

Breakthroughs, contrary to popular wisdom, don’t begin with a smart answer.

They begin with a smart question.

# Stop Talking Before People Realize You Have Nothing of Value to Say

## Photo by Nik Shuliahin on Unsplash

If you’re a writer, you’re watching all kinds of people, noting what they do well and noting what you see that you don’t want to become.

How does so and so do it? How did he/she do it so fast?
> Where’s my golden ticket?

The truth is, for most of us, there’s no golden ticket. Success happens over time and with a lot of hard work.

I’m listening to a lot of people and I’ll bet you are too. Unfortunately, some of them are too busy talking to realize they have nothing of value to say. Some have extremely large audiences, are a huge success, others have medium audiences. And some have small audiences. They’re all noisy.

Unless you’re [Grant Cardone](https://twitter.com/GrantCardone), [The10XEntrepreneur](https://medium.com/the-10x-entrepreneur), no one wants to hear from you all the time. Pretty sure his claim to fame is that he was everywhere, all the time. He was noisy. It worked for him.

Narrow is that gate.

## Building a platform is like parenting

Hope you chuckled. Stick with me. Don’t you get sick of hearing your kids’ voices some days? Let’s be honest.

I love my kids. I like to spend time with my kids. When they fight with each other over stupid stuff and use their voice in the wrong way I want them to shush, quickly. Repeating the same mantra over and over again tunes me out.
> # Feed me. Feed me.
> # Can I have your attention, your money, your fill in the blank?

If you’re building a platform, a list, a following, it’s also this:
> # Give me your time.

Please don’t misunderstand this to say kids and family don’t deserve time. They do. They deserve a lot of time, but they don’t deserve all of your time all the time, especially when it’s rude, irritating, and doesn’t respect boundaries. Family is one of the most important jobs I’ll ever love, and sometimes I need a break to be me.

Stop talking at me. To survive you need a curtain call on the noise.

* scroll faster

* stop listening

* unsubscribe

The trouble is a lot of people out there are making too much noise with daily videos in every group, on every profile. They’re so busy grinding, they’ve forgotten how to say anything of value.

It’s like my kids fighting in the backseat while I’m driving.
> I need to concentrate here, so we all don’t die. Please stop. If I have to pull this car over, I’m gonna… For goodness sake, will you shut off the noise?
> # Blah, blah, blah, blabbity, blah, blah.

I reach my arm around the driver’s seat to make enough contact to get their attention.
> # Mom, why are you yelling?

Because you are so busy talking that you refuse to listen to anything other than the sound of your own voice. Why do I have to yell before you hear me?

### Turn off the noise when you have nothing of value to say. Learn this life lesson and it will go well with you.
> # “Speak softly and carry a big stick,” — Theodore Roosevelt

He was a man of wisdom, speaking during a time when wisdom could easily be heard. There’s no improving greatness, but our times have changed.

Today people make a ruckus, so much noise they drown out wisdom.

A more appropriate quote for current times is this:
> # “Speak when you have something of value to say and let the crevices of silence grow wisdom and direction.”

That one is all mine. Proper credit appreciated.

## Be an expert, don’t be a doofus.

Everyone wants to be an expert. Unless you’re an expert at something, nobody will hear your name. You don’t have all the answers, even in your field of expertise. If you don’t know, be wise enough to say so, and point to someone who does.

If you don’t know anyone who has the answer, then do some research. Offer the best information you can, acknowledging you don’t know while soliciting feedback, and arrive at the answer together.

Don’t be a doofus.

## Respect

I keep coming back to two books:

![](1*9PSDgyq5R0tGcj1hTtqonw.jpeg)

![[Boundaries](https://amzn.to/2OuXjoI) and [Love Languages](https://amzn.to/2Ou6mGp) on Amazon](1*Cas6hsFlmmY4-_EDF2u26A.jpeg)*[Boundaries](https://amzn.to/2OuXjoI) and [Love Languages](https://amzn.to/2Ou6mGp) on Amazon*

One helps people maintain healthy boundaries by defining who you are and who you are not, and influencing all areas of your life — physically, emotionally, spiritually.

The second one has a practical life application about how to learn what other people need and how to connect with them in a meaningful way. It’s not just for couples. It’s for everyone. Are you speaking the same language? The problem isn’t love — it’s your love language. It teaches respect.

## Introduction

I’d like to introduce you to [Tom Kuegler](https://twitter.com/tomkuegler7). Practically speaking, we speak the same love language — that is to say we care about the same things: we’re digital nomads, we travel, and help writers. He’s my mentor, my teacher, and my friend. Recently he shouted me out in his list of friends here:
[**Why You Need To Meet More People Like You Right Now**
*The door swung open and all I saw was yellow.*medium.com](https://medium.com/the-post-grad-survival-guide/why-you-need-to-meet-people-like-you-17316b7ae06b)

I have a lot of respect for him because we care about some of the same things. When he speaks, he has something of value to say. And, he respects my time. When I catch his [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8nN0X9k1JO3IlYUEPtA83g) they’re short and sensible. He shares quick, actionable tips, then he quits talking.

When I read his emails he talks in the same way. “Coming to you today with two (or three) quick points.” He says them quickly and efficiently, then signs off. He recognizes people are busy and time is a precious commodity.

His [Medium Mastery](https://www.publishousnow.com/product/the-medium-mastery-academy/) course will turn your writing life around. Not only am I a student, I’m an affiliate.

## Life

We all have needs. Those who work online need to develop relationships and build something people want to buy.

Don’t you wish more people would stop talking before they remove all doubt they have nothing of value to say?

Don’t be one of them.
> # Be a Tom.

# 18 Self-Help Books Quotes about Vulnerability, Creativity and Being Yourself

## 

Here are the best quotes I found in these 3 books, I strongly recommend to read the books if you’re interested to get a deeper understanding of them as well.

**The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, Mark Manson — About Being Yourself**
> True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.
> Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. […] our struggles determine our successes.
> Our values determine the metrics by which we measure ourselves and everyone else.
> The more we admit we do not know, the more opportunities we gain to learn.
> **Don’t just sit here. Do something. The answers will follow.**
> Inspiration -&gt; Motivation -&gt; Action -&gt; Inspiration -&gt; Motivation…
If you lack the motivation to make an important change in your life, do something —anything, really — and then harness the reaction to that action as a way to begin motivating yourself.
> If we follow the “do something” principle, failure feels unimportant.
> Travel is a fantastic self-developement tool, because it extracts you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves.
> Death scares us. […] Yet, in a bizarre, backwards way, death is the light by which shadow of all of life’s meaning is measured. Without death, everything would feel inconsequential, all experience arbitrary, all metrics and values suddenly zero.

**Daring Greatly, Brené Brown — About Vulnerability**
> “When we were children, we used to think that when we were grown up we would no longer be vulnerable. But to grow up is to accept vulnerability. To be alive is to be vulnerable.” Madeleine L’Engle
> In fact, what I’ve heard over and over throughout the years is one clear message: **“The most valuable and important things in my life came to me when I cultivated the courage to be vulnerable, imperfect and self-compassionate.”**
> When you shut down vulnerability, you shut down opportunity.
> If you choose not to decide, you still made a choice.
> Sometimes the bravest and most important thing you can do is just show up.

**Big Magic, Elizabeth Gilbert — About Creativity**
> A man cannot dress, but his ideas get cloth’d at the same time; and if he dresses like a gentleman, every one of them stands presented to his imagination.
> We all spend our 20s and 30s trying so hard to be perfect, because we’re so worried about what people will think of us. Then we get into our 40s and 50s, and we finally start to be free, because we decide that we don’t give a damn what anyone thinks of us. But you won’t completely free until you reach your 60s and 70s, when you finally realize this liberating truth — nobody was ever thinking about you, anyhow. […] People are mostly thinking about themselves.
> **A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week.**
> I have never created anything in my life that did not make me feel, at some point or another, like I was the guy who just walked into a fancy ball wearing a homemade lobster costume. But you must stubbornly walk into that room, regardless, and you must hold your head high. You made it; you get to put it out there. Never apologize for it, never explain it away, never be ashamed of it. You did the best with what you knew, and you worked with what you had, in the time you were given.

# Human Connection is the Key To Marketing

## Mark Viden discusses how the Hello Humankindness is bringing dignity back to healthcare and marketing

![](1*udxnzzK6ruUb3avZkBSe1A.png)
> # “Advertising is an art, but there is a science behind it, too.” -Mark Viden

There is no doubt that marketing and advertising are key factors in the success of any business, large or small. [Mark Viden](https://twitter.com/markviden?lang=en) knows that better than most. But as the VP of brand and marketing at [Dignity Health](https://twitter.com/DignityHealth), Viden has made forming human connections just as central to the mission of the brand as turning a profit.

Viden spearheaded [Hello Humankindness](https://twitter.com/humankindness?lang=en), a branded channel with mixed media that brings human connection back into the business of healthcare and has helped Dignity Health find success.

On *Marketing Trends*, Viden was happy to share some of the things he’s learned along the way.

Viden’s journey as a marketer began as a young man, when he read the work of David Ogilvy, commonly referred to as the father of advertising and the founder of Ogilvy & Mather, one of the most famous advertising firms in the world.

“His integrity comes through in all of his work,” Viden says of what drew him to Ogilvy’s work. “And then, most importantly, it’s that advertising is an art, but there’s a science behind it, too. It’s data, analytics that wasn’t present in his day but is so important today. Knowing who your audiences are, knowing how effective your messages are, these are the things we think about a lot and it makes me think back to David and his idea to measure everything you do.”
> # Key Takeaway #1: Measure everything that you do.

At his first job, Viden got a good look at campaigns that worked and ones that didn’t, including the Infiniti car campaign that focused on the materials used in the car rather than the car itself. Watching how that campaign was built, and how innovative and well-done it was, yet still having it be unsuccessful in the long run, taught Viden a great deal. It led him to the lesson he gives to every young person who wants to get into the industry.

“You have to keep knocking at the door,” Viden says. “You have to be resilient. You have to handle rejection and you have to find the right person who sees something in you and lets you in.”
> # Key Takeaway #2: Learn to handle rejection. Be resilient and keep trying.

“Patience, persistence, respect and listen are really key attributes that anyone coming into any kind of enterprise should adopt. And I said the word ‘listen.’ Listen is what people are looking for in healthcare quite a bit.”

After researching the healthcare industry, Viden and his team found that patients reported not feeling listened to, which reinforced their belief that to listen to people, to look them in the eye and form a connection, is the most important thing. Out of this research, Hello Humankindness was born as the overall brand campaign for Dignity Health. The idea was to make dignity relevant in the marketplace.

“What’s so unusual about Hello Humankindness is that it is an invitation into something that I think is much larger than healthcare itself,” Viden says. “We wanted this concept that human connection is the most important thing and that we all hold the power to heal. We wanted this brand purpose to stand for something in a world where you may have 1,000 friends on Facebook, but you may know or connect with so few in real life. We wanted this to be a movement.”
> # Key Takeaway #3: What will people always want? Focus on improving things that you know are not going to change.

People want kindness and someone to listen to them, so Hello Humankindness created a better way to make that a reality. The company wanted to honor their founders from years gone by, religious sisters who believed that everyone should have access to healthcare, and bring the legacy of healing to customers in a meaningful, branded way that stood out.

Dignity Health looked to what the consumer needed and tried to make sure their healthcare journey was simple and as pain-free as possible. The company’s goal is to improve people’s lives every day — radically different than so many others’ mission. And they were making it happen through marketing.

“This gets back to what is a brand? Why is a brand relevant? And how can a brand add value to your organization?” Viden says. “A brand is the sum total of the experiences, good and bad, that someone has with your organization, product or service. Advancing a brand has to be true to that experience. What marketers need to do is take the essence of what’s true about the organization and make it real…. What do your people feel? How do they behave? How do they engage and how do people who engage with those folks feel at the end of the day?”
> # Key Takeaway #4: Take the essence of what’s true about your organization and make it real in every customer experience.

Thanks to the Hello Human Kindness campaign, Dignity Health has brought healthcare and human connection to millions of people across the United States. The company works in 21 states and with more than 60,000 caregivers who are committed to providing compassionate care to every patient.

“What’s so satisfying about working at a healthcare company is that you’re hopefully changing lives for the better,” Viden says. “As a marketer, I think that’s a dream come true.”

As his career continues, Viden and his work with Hello Humankindenss will no doubt serve as an example for young marketers who are coming up in the business. For them, Viden has simple advice.

“The best mentors are people that you interact with because hopefully, ideally, you’ll observe their actions and you’ll see how they do things,” he says. “I think watching and observing effective people, there’s no substitute for that.”
> # Key Takeaway #5: You are who you spend time with. Learn from them.

Hear Viden’s full interview on [*Marketing Trends](http://bit.ly/2DF9f55)*, and be sure to check out the [Hello Humankindness campaign](https://hellohumankindness.org/).

# Focus on Producing and Creating, Not Consuming and Entertainment

## Focus on Producing and Creating, Not Consuming and Entertainment

Ordinary people focus on consuming and entertainment, bingeing on every possible substance and activity: TV, food, alcohol, drugs, sex, social media.

But extraordinary people focus on producing and creating. These individuals switch teams and leave the “mediocre majority”, joining the small yet immensely powerful people that produce the truth the world desperately needs.

Who do you want to be — a consumer, or a creator?

Do you want to learn and grow, or grow numb through entertainment and distraction?

Do you want to trade your dreams for the safety of following the rules like everyone else? Or do you want to blaze your own path and create your own lifestyle?
> “The problem is that our culture has engaged in a Faustian bargain, in which we trade our genius and artistry for apparent stability.” -Seth Godin

## When You Focus on Consumption, You Get Weaker, Slower, and Unhealthier
> “From the day you were born, you were baptized to play for ‘Team Consumer,’ from the Barbie Doll and the Tonka Truck to the *Star Wars *action figures. You’ve been conditioned to demand: to want products, to need products, to buy products, and of course, to seek out the cheapest of those products.” -MJ Demarco

The world doesn’t care if you succeed. Frankly, the world prefers you *don’t* succeed. Why? Truly successful people don’t follow the rules; they don’t behave the way the world wants them to. This is bad for business — the business of earning money from your lazy, consumption-oriented behavior.

The world wants you to buy, buy, buy. There’s a lot of money in leveraging your fears and insecurity; they are incredibly powerful buying motivators. When you’re sad, unhappy, alone, or afraid, it feels good to buy something (some researchers have called this “retail therapy”). [One such study](https://northstarpsych.com/files_uploaded/8df9f1b646b4900b8dd33849f6e898c5.pdf) wrote, “*A bad mood does lead to greater purchase and consumption of unplanned treats for the self*.”

Here’s another way to put it: your fears and insecurities are **incredibly expensive.**

But what really happens when you focus on consuming instead of producing — when you respond the same way most people respond?

**You feel worse.**

Avoiding your suffering is a form of suffering itself. Running away from struggling is a major struggle itself. When you focus on consuming and avoidance, you only end up weaker, slower, unhealthier, and worse than before.
> # “Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance.” -Mark Manson

![[Tyler Nix](https://unsplash.com/@jtylernix?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*Fc-dlJY9wkUulb7x)*[Tyler Nix](https://unsplash.com/@jtylernix?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

## Here’s What Happens When You “Switch Teams” and Focus on Creating Instead
> “Once you see the world from a producer perspective, your perceptions sharpens like a fine-tuned radio frequency, from static to clear stereo sound. Suddenly, opportunities have clarity, ideas surface, and scams are exposed.” -MJ Demarco

Never forget — the rich, wealthy, and successful are the *minority.* If you want to be in that minority, you need to switch teams and join those with a producer mindset.

**It’s time to reorient yourself. **If you’re reading this, I know you’re someone who’s sick and tired of the same old losing game; the one where you’re never consistent, never get what you really want, and spend most of your time working on *other *people’s dreams, not your own.

**It’s time to go from lower/middle to upper class.**

**It’s time to go from ordinary to extraordinary.**

**It’s time to go from amateur to professional.**

It’s time to give up your old life. It’s not working. Even if you managed to win the lottery and be one of the tiny fraction that actually makes it out, the reward for that path isn’t even worth it.

As author [Srinivas Rao](https://twitter.com/UnmistakableCEO) once wrote:
> # “If you want to live an exceptional and extraordinary life, you have to give up many of the things that are part of a normal one.”

Producers build wealth. They give genuine value to the world and truly help people, which is how you build wealth in the first place.

Consumers, on the other hand, spend their way into heavy debt and being poor. Consumers primary focus on entertainment and laziness, preferring the TV to reading a book any day of the week (especially weekends).

When you focus on creating, your open yourself up to new possibilities. You start [automatically *attracting* success](https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/9-key-habits-that-will-make-you-automatically-attract-enormous-success-ad8af090cefd) rather than frantically chasing it.

Here’s what happens when you decide to make this mindset shift.

* You won’t be so tired anymore

* You’ll create incredible momentum and reliable consistency

* You’ll have renewed energy, focus, and creativity

* You’ll find you enjoy your work more

* You’ll find yourself saying “no” to mediocre obligations

* You’ll feel increased confidence and competence

Consumers focus on escaping reality through entertainment.

But producers become more awake as they focus on giving their gift to others, which ignites and helps the lives of everyone around them.
> “The greater your own internal fire is, the more people will want it. They will ignite their own fires. They will try to light up their own dark caves. The universe will bend to you.” -[James Altucher](https://twitter.com/jaltucher)

## Want Extraordinary Results? Then You’ll Need Extraordinary Thinking & Actions

The larger mob of society will never experience true success.

Why?

Because this majority is unwilling to become the CEO of their life — they’d rather someone else call the shots.

They are unwilling to take risks, to [fail publicly](https://theascent.biz/dont-be-embarrassed-9707a263df20), and be forced to try again after getting knocked down.

They are unwilling to sacrifice what is good for what is *great*.

In short, they are unwilling to give up their “normal” life.

But this is what is required to live an extraordinary life. You must give up the “normal” life for something far more valuable.

Evolving is painful.

The more you evolve into the best version of yourself, the more you’ll be required to give up. You’ll reach a point where you’ll no longer be able to tolerate negative relationships. Eating bad food. Spending your time on time-wasting activities.

Giving these things up is painful. Most people aren’t willing to do what needs to be done.

For the select few of you who choose to take extraordinary action, you’ll start seeing extraordinary results. A common extraordinary action is to shift from being a drone-like consumer to an inspired, creative producer who creates the content the world needs.

In his autobiography, Bryan Cranston (Walter White of the renowned *Breaking Bad*) described the lesson he learned that helped him go from an average actor to an extraordinary one. Here’s what he wrote:
> “Early in my career, I was always hustling. Doing commercials, guest-starring, auditioning like crazy. I was making a decent living…but I felt I was stuck in junior varsity. I wondered if I had plateaued. Then, Breck Costin [his mentor] suggested **I** **focus on process rather than outcome**.
> I wasn’t going to the audition to *get* anything: a job or money or validation. I wasn’t going to compete.
> I was going to **give** something.
> I wasn’t there to **get** a job. I was there to **do** a job. I was there to **give** a performance. If I attached to the outcome, I was setting myself up to expect, and thus to fail. My job was to be compelling. Take come chances. Enjoy the process.”

Cranston went on to say after he made this mindset shift, he felt much more relaxed and free. There was no longer any pressure, because the outcome was irrelevant. “*Once I made the switch, I had power in any room I walked into,” *he wrote. “*Which meant I could relax. I was free.*”

Soon after this shift, Cranston was offered a role in the wildly popular *Malcolm in the Middle,* for which he was nominated for 3 Emmy awards. He is now one of the most respected and well-known actors in the world.

This is the difference between ordinary and extraordinary thinking; from that of an average consumer to a true producer of greatness and incredible quality.

Anyone can unlock this potential to outperform 99% of the competition. But it starts with choosing to be extraordinary and leaving the herd of consumers so you can create your deepest, truest work.

Ironically, it is the producers who are able to consume as much as they want, when they want. They have already built their sustainable system that helps others and usually runs *without* them, giving them time and freedom to consume what they want.

Most people aren’t willing to make the change from consumer to producer. Producing your gifts is hard; frankly, most people see the price for that life and choose the life defined by the couch and Netflix.

This life isn’t for everyone. But if you’re someone who wants increased influence, affluence, and focus, make the shift. Go from someone who focused on entertainment and distraction to a true learner who helps people by producing their gift.

# The Principles of Hermetic Philosophy — Vibration

## The Principles of Hermetic Philosophy — Vibration

Within everything, from the tiniest molecule to the tallest mountain, vibration occurs.

Nothing in the Universe is ever truly at rest… everything vibrates, everything has a pulse.

This includes our mental and emotional states.

Just try not to think or feel something (even if that feeling is emptiness) for any given amount of time.

Go ahead, I’ll wait.

Can’t do it, can you?

It’s because you’re not *meant *to — nothing in the Universe is.

So how can you use this? How can you apply it to your life in order to manifest and achieve your wildest dreams?

***Think in terms of momentum.***


Momentum is what keeps a good thing going.

It’s also what keeps a bad thing going.

When you give any particular thought or feeling power, good or bad, you add to its momentum.

That’s how certain actions or circumstances start occurring, and eventually, how they become *habitual*.

When you’ve built up enough momentum, enough *vibration, *with any given aspect of your life, it will begin to persist.

It will begin to manifest.

So it stands to reason that if you want to pull your ideal life into your present, *you need to vibrate in accordance with it*.

***In other words, you need to build momentum that will lead to those ideal circumstances.***

What is an action you can take today that matches the vibration of what you envision?

Maybe you envision getting in better shape, what matches that vibration?

Exercise.

Maybe you envision making more money, what matches that vibration?

Practice of a marketable skill and an understanding of economics.

It doesn’t have to be anything big, just as long as it *matches the vibration of your ideal vision.*

And the more you do this, the more intuitive the process will become. You’ll begin to tell instantly if any given action is in alignment with your bigger picture, the long-term plans you have for your life.

But it’s going to take some time to get to that point, especially if you’re just beginning within the context of your journey.

My advice?

Get in tune with your *general* vibration. Don’t overcomplicate it — find out where you’re coming from on a daily basis.

Are you coming from a place of scarcity and negativity, or abundance and positivity?

Be *honest* with yourself. You’ll never make any progress otherwise.

If it’s the former, then you need to sit down and really think about what specific behaviors you need to cut out in order to get to a healthier place.

If it’s the latter, then you need to sit down and really think about what specific behaviors you need to double down on, the ones responsible for you being in a healthy place.

Work towards *tuning in *to your thoughts and feelings, because if you haven’t noticed yet — this is all cyclical.

The more in tune you are with your thoughts and feelings, the better they’ll serve you. And the better they serve you, the more in tune with them you’ll become.

# Five Insights From Tien Tzuo

## Zuora founder and CEO sits down with The Mission Daily to dish on subscription-based businesses

![Chad Grills (right) and Ian Faison (left) showing off Subscribed with Tien Tzuo at Zuora HQ](1*R5NFaVbwuwTyGTRDubYfqQ.jpeg)*Chad Grills (right) and Ian Faison (left) showing off Subscribed with Tien Tzuo at Zuora HQ*
> # “Technology is allowing us to get the things we want without the shackles of the physical product.” -Tien Tzuo

When Tien Tzuo, the CEO of Zuora, [appeared on](http://bit.ly/2IOovuy) *The Mission Daily*, he had a ton of insights to share, from his early days at Oracle and Salesforce, to how he built a massively successful, publicly traded technology company.

Tzuo grew up in Brooklyn, New York and attended Cornell, where he studied electrical engineering. But more than earning a degree, the ivy league school was the place he discovered his passion for software.

“One thing I really liked about software was the immediate gratification,” Tzuo said. “In the B2B space, where you’re working really closely with customers, you could literally spend all night coding, bring it in the next day to the end users, and get that immediate feedback. That’s what I really, really liked. I was able to get immediate feedback and make an immediate impact on the customers and the companies I was working with.”
> # **Key Takeaway #1**: Early in your career, work closely with the customer so you see the problem your product is solving.

After school, Tzuo landed at Oracle, a Silicon Valley-based cloud software company. While traveling back and forth to the Bay area for the job, Tzuo fell in love with the tech scene out there. He applied to Stanford Business school… but was rejected the first time around. The second time he applied, he was accepted, and it is from Stanford that he earned his masters in business administration.
> # Key Takeaway #2: Don’t be afraid of rejection. Try and then try again.

“Fast forward to ’99, I was at an enterprise software company realizing that this doesn’t make any sense. I know that the future is the internet, but I’m at an enterprise software company that is not focused on the internet…”

Tien realized he wanted to marry the business of software and the internet, and linked up with Marc Benioff, the founder and CEO of [Salesforce](https://medium.com/@salesforce). Tzuo took a leap of faith and jumped onto the startup ship with Marc, becoming employee number 11 at Salesforce. He was appointed the Chief Marketing Officer of the company with his sights set on making an impact in the tech world.
> # Key Takeaway #3: Take risks and make the leap when you find a good leader to follow.

The Salesforce team believed that on-demand computing — which later became software as a service (SaaS) — was the future, and they wanted to make it a reality. So they did. They created technology at the company that changed the game and made subscription-based software a business. But they also developed the company in a way that made it a model for other businesses to follow. Salesforce created a “Customer Success Department” and a sales development tract and department to maximize their leads from the internet. Tzuo helped build Salesforce into an industry leader, moving from CMO to Chief Strategy Officer.

“I’ve always geared toward lateral moves,” he said of his progression through the various parts of the tech world. “It seems every two or three years I wind up changing roles. When you do that I think you wind up with a much bigger toolset.”
> # Key Takeaway #4: Learn other business functions and how they work together.

“Because I was at Salesforce so early, I saw a lot of things. What I loved about my nine years at Salesforce was this idea that you had to figure things out. Figure out how to make the subscription business model work for the software industry, which now in hindsight we see was the big disruptive force in the software industry over the last 20 years. And then our question was, was that going to be limited just to the software sector? Or was this a broad trend that could apply to anything? And if it was, that was really interesting. Could the subscription business model apply to other industries?”

In Tzuo’s book, *Subscribed: Why the Subscription Model Will Be Your Company’s Future — and What to Do About It*, he details early versions of this model working and gives examples such as Zipcar and Netflix to illustrate that sooner than later, people won’t be buying cars and movies, they’ll be using subscription-based services to get those things when and where they want them.

At Salesforce, Tzuo and his colleagues proved that subscription as a service could work for software, but Tzuo didn’t want to end there. He became obsessed with the idea of how subscription-based services could change the face of business, but also how it could affect the economy and society in general.

“If you’re offering software as a service to somebody, you can see what your customers are doing, and that was fascinating,” he said. “You become obsessed with making sure the customers have a great experience because you need them to come back every day. The subscription model forces a win-win relationship between the business and the company. Before it was like, we could trick you into buying a product and then great, now you’ve got the product. But you don’t have a long-term relationship… This flipping of thinking about not the product, but the customer, it expands your way of thinking.”

The subscription business model was the future, and Tzuo knew it. So he teamed up with a few co-founders to create [Zuora](https://twitter.com/Zuora), a subscription management technology company to help businesses modernize their subscription-based business. At the company, which offers the only SaaS platform that automates all subscription order-to-revenue operations in real-time for any business, Tzuo is constantly fostering innovation and pushing Zuora employees to reach higher. In fact, people feel so empowered as leaders in the organization that they call themselves “ZEOs”.
> # Key Takeaway #5: Empower your employees to think like the CEO of the company.

“We’re obsessed with how to build a company where it’s not a top-down company, it’s a bottom’s up company, or a decentralized organization. If you can make that happen, then innovation is going to happen because people are naturally innovative and people are naturally creative. But you’ve got to unlock it? If you can unlock that and their spirit, you can do something special.”

With that belief as a guiding principle, Tzuo and Zuora to remain at the forefront as SaaS continues to grow.

# This Is Why You Are Addicted To Your Thoughts Without Knowing It

## Photo by freestocks.org on Unsplash

## **Regurgitated Thoughts**
> # *“A sick thought can devour the body’s flesh more than fever or consumption.” — Guy de Maupassant*

Who would you be without your thoughts?

Who is the person you call “I” reading these words right now?

Ponder these questions while I give you an insight into something I experienced whilst meditating some years ago. One evening, towards the end of a meditation session I experienced a brief episode of no thoughts. It scared me, though I recognises my thoughts once more in the next instance. It was as though I had gone off-line for a short period of time. What frightened me most about the experience was the notion I didn’t exist. If there is no experience of thoughts, who am I? My thoughts confirm my existence and so I felt at ease when I began to experience them once more.

We are addicted to thoughts without realising it. I mean that in the kindest way. Our experience of thoughts confirms our presence within the fabric of reality. It was the French philosopher René Descartes who once proclaimed: “I think, therefore I am.” This is a persuasive declaration that suggests our thoughts give rise to our humanity and experience of reality. In a similar vein, psychologist and author Loch Kelly confirms our compulsive addiction to thoughts when he writes in *Shift into Freedom: The Science and Practice of Open-Hearted Awareness:* “The habit of continually looking to thoughts for satisfaction, even positive thoughts, creates a similar kind of addiction.”

From the moment we’re born until our passing, we process anywhere between 60,000 to 80,000 thoughts a day. Many of those are regurgitated from the previous day; rarely do we think anything new. For example, when was the last time you had an original thought or were moved by a powerful insight? Was it days, weeks or months? We are accustomed to thinking the same thoughts day in day out and wonder why we live monotonous lives. It was the founder of Hay House, the late Louise Hay who once wrote: “You are not a helpless victim of your own thoughts, but rather a master of your mind.”

If we were to observe our thoughts more often, we would notice they are habitual and dictated by past conditioning, our level of awareness and perception of the world. This explains why we are addicted to thoughts because we trust them to be true. I’m not suggesting this is bad, however, our addiction to thinking can lead us astray and cause stress if we don’t make time to disconnect from our thoughts.

Loch Kelly says we can change our addiction to automatic thoughts by observing them instead of becoming invested in them: “Paying attention to automatic thoughts is simply a habit we can change. When you shift into awareness-based knowing, automatic thinking moves into the background, and you experience true peace of mind.”

## **Break The Addiction To Thoughts**
> # *“The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation, but your thoughts about it. Be aware of the thoughts you are thinking.” — Eckhart Tolle*

Our thoughts are our best friend and our worst enemy. They come and go from our mind and even though they are impermanent, it often feels like they have taken up residency in our mind like squatters refusing to leave. No matter how hard you try to remove negative thoughts, they keep showing up. What if it isn’t necessary to drive them away, but see them as the sum of the thinking process?

What I mean is, *negative thoughts* is a label we assign to disempowering thoughts we don’t like. I would argue that they can be useful and our task is to integrate them into the wholeness of our being instead of trying to banish them. Thoughts are addictive when we cannot be alone in silence for more than five minutes. This is the feedback I’ve receive over many years from clients who are stressed. When I invite them to find five minutes a day to meditate, they’d rather have a surgical procedure performed than be alone with their thoughts.

Many people flee from the voices in their head by being preoccupied with activities that distract them from being alone. This is apparent whether through: socialising, gossiping, checking social media, consuming alcohol or addictive foods. These are distractions that prevent us coming home to the quiet stillness of our core self. It needn’t be that way. It is possible to reclaim your thoughts and not be consumed by them. However, it takes practice and diligence to see past the narrative they promote while recognising you are not **your thoughts but one who experiences them**.

Thoughts will always have a narrative to persuade us of something that is wrong in the world. We are naturally drawn to this and create a dialogue which later forms our character. These events start when we follow the trail of thoughts down a slippery slope.

To break our addiction to thoughts, we must first realise their impermanent nature. This helps us to discern the transient nature of thoughts and that we needn’t bind ourselves to them. Rather, we see them as a mental occurrence that come and go like ocean waves crashing into the shoreline. When we let go of our addiction to thoughts, we realise a powerful undercurrent beneath them, in the form of an expansive love and that my dear friends is who we really are.

# Kind Hearts, Changing Lives

## 
> # *Knowing that we can be loved exactly as we are gives us all the best opportunity for growing into the healthiest of people.*
> # *Fred Rogers*

Every once in a while, films come along that are so warm and true that you can’t help but grin all the way through. With Fred Rogers, there is always a smile, and the new documentary, *Won’t You Be My Neighbor*, illustrates the positive effect he’s had on so many of our lives.

Tugging on a different set of heartstrings, we get another healthy dose of pleasure in *Heart Beats Loud*. This scripted movie, with talented actors, is really anchored by honest people doing their best. In this case, connecting and growing through music.

### **Won’t You Be My Neighbor**

Filmmaker Morgan Neville (*20 Feet from Stardom*) examines the life and legacy of Fred Rogers, the beloved host of the popular children’s TV show “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” A powerful and emotional portrait of one of the most genuine people to ever come into out living rooms. Both nostalgic and relevant.

### **Kindness Revisited**

Beginning in 1968, Rogers shot 895 episodes, over 31 seasons. Quite a run. I was one of those kids who watched his show everyday, entertained, and learning some valuable lessons without even knowing it. For all his gentle kindness, he tackled some hard subjects, from racism to divorce; but he always delivered his messages with love and care. Setting positive examples.

Mister Rogers understood that children have deep feelings, and that we all just wanted to feel safe in our homes, and in our neighborhoods. There was always an invitation to be closer to one another. In the end, he made us all want to be better people.


### **Hearts Beat Loud**

Widower and aging Brooklyn hipster Frank wants to start a band with his teenage daughter, Sam just before she leaves home to attend college. When a song of theirs finds the digital airwaves, it complicates Frank’s attempts to let go of his dreams of stardom and let Sam find her own path.

### **A different kind of neighborhood**

It’s set in the artsy world of hipster Brooklyn, not quite Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. The people onscreen include pothead bartenders, struggling record-store owners and gay teenagers. But they are real people, who care.


We care about the heroes because their hearts beat loud, because they care about each other. We like that Mr. Rogers cares about us, and everyone else. And I’d like to believe that being exposed such characters can be contagious. We could use a little more of that in these divisive times.

Both of these movies kick off limited theatrical release June 8 and then will be on digital platforms.

# How To Stay Fit And Focused As A Busy Leader

## 

I don’t run obsessively every day, and I definitely don’t examine every bit of food that comes across my plate.

But I’m generally in pretty good shape.

**The reason for that is I generally live a fairly active lifestyle. **Nothing too crazy, but I’m usually doing something that keeps me moving. I enjoy running when I have the time, and I’ve found [coaching my kids’](https://theascent.pub/what-children-can-teach-us-about-teamwork-79472c591e73) sports teams keeps me on my toes.

Recently, I started riding an electric bike to work.

And that bike ride got me thinking about the connection between physical activity and mental sharpness. I like the bike because I don’t show up at work drenched in sweat. But it does involve quite a bit of mental exercise — navigating cars, construction, and the general chaos of the daily commute.

Every day, I show up to work alert and ready for action.
> # As a leader, or anyone who’s incredibly busy, staying fit is important for managing a crazy schedule.

The connection between exercise and energy is real — if you aren’t mentally sharp, you can’t perform your best. For a few decades now, studies have shown a link between [exercise and mental performance](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-does-exercise-benefit-cognition/).

Here’s how I like to think about fitness and how it helps me as a CEO:

## **Exercise for both mental and physical energy.**

Everyone has trouble sleeping before an important day at work or school.

It often happens to me before board meetings, when I’m trying to prepare and worrying about all the little details. I go to bed, but I don’t get much sleep. Suddenly, it’s 2:00 AM — and I know I won’t be able to drift off anytime soon.

So, I get up and go for a run.

While it may seem counterintuitive, that run actually gives me the energy to make it through the day. If I stayed in bed and stared at the ceiling, I’d be groggy and unfocused for my meeting. But when I get that exercise in, I’m fully alert and mentally clear throughout the day.

### That’s the great paradox of exercise — it actually creates energy.

If you have a chance to work out in the middle of the day, you’ll notice that you’re mentally sharper and more energetic for the rest of the afternoon.

Now, I’ve crashed heavily when I get home from a long day, but I know I was much more effective than I would have been without doing what my body needed at the time.

## **Give yourself a chance to restore your mind.**

Go sit on a bench in your local park and watch the joggers cruise by one afternoon. You’ll notice they almost all sport a pair of headphones, pumping out their favorite workout music.

Personally, I think that’s a mistake.

I understand the reasoning behind it — they get a boost from high-energy tunes — but I think they’re missing out on one of the most important aspects of their exercise.
> # When you go for a run, a bike ride, or even a walk, that’s a time to be alone with yourself. To reflect and contemplate.

I don’t meditate in the classic sense, legs crossed and eyes closed, but I do find that running is a form of natural meditation. Because when you begin pushing yourself intensely, your mind automatically focuses. It’s a waste to squander that [with distractions.](https://theascent.pub/3-steps-every-employee-should-take-to-avoid-unnecessary-distraction-9fb1723c34be)

Next time you’re working out, leave your headphones behind and see where your mind goes. You may be surprised at how well you can focus without any interruptions.

## **Don’t think of fitness as work, but as preparation for opportunities that come your way.**

When people talk about why they exercise and eat well, they usually relate it to their goal of staying healthy.

But there’s an underrated aspect of being fit that most people overlook — the opportunities that come along with it. There are all kinds of activities that happen spur-of-the-moment.

* A friend asks you to go skiing with them next month.

* A coworker needs an extra body in their soccer game tomorrow.

* Your brother wants you to come along on a 10-mile hike next Saturday.

You may not have been training specifically for any of these things, but if you’re generally in shape, you can pull them off.

The best example from my own life is the time my friends and I [went to Guatemala](https://theascent.pub/my-vacation-to-guatemala-threw-me-outside-my-comfort-zone-and-made-me-a-better-ceo-back-at-the-56c21d5c9d96) to hike a volcano. This was not something we’d been preparing for, but the volcano was erupting, and my friend said, “We have to go this weekend.”

That’s an experience you want to be ready for. If you aren’t, you’re going to miss out on something amazing with people you care about.

As someone with a busy schedule, it’s important to think about fitness not as another job, but as something you do in order to be alert and available for everyday demands and new opportunities.

# 5 Ways to Take Breaks and Reward Yourself Without Killing Your Momentum

## 5 Ways to Take Breaks and Reward Yourself Without Killing Your Momentum

Have you ever taken a break during a big project, and wound up killing your momentum?

You’re busy working on your novel, or other paperwork, and starting to get into the zone, when…your stomach rumbles, or your coworker (or kid) interrupts you, or you simply decide you’ve worked hard enough.

So you gt up, get a snack, drink some water, surf some YouTube…and you’re gone.

Your focus is zapped, your motivation has plummeted, and the day ends without you finishing what you planned to finish.

*Not again!*

We all know that if you don’t take breaks you will burn out eventually. It’s unhealthy to hunker down for hours at a stretch without getting up to stretch, use the bathroom, rest your eyes.

But breaks have a habit of derailing us from our projects — especially if they are particularly dreadful projects that we don’t want to do in the first place, but have to.

So how do you balance health with productivity? How do you take breaks without getting distracted (as we so easily do nowadays) and leaving important tasks unfinished?

## How to take healthy breaks without killing momentum:

### 1. Refuel before you think you have to

Everyone is a little different in terms of how long it takes to get “into the zone” on any work project. That’s why the Pomodoro Technique (use a timer to set 25 minute intervals of work time with 5 minute breaks) does not work for everyone.

When I am working on a novel, for instance, or some other absorbing story-related project, I may need to go for several hours at a stretch so as not to lose my train of ideas, and that ephemeral *feeling* that I want to capture.

However, doing this for 8 hours at a stretch (which I have been known to do) *is not healthy. *I forget to blink, to eat, to drink. This may sound romantic, but it’s a quick road to sickness — mental and physical.

So I am learning to stop BEFORE I feel like I have to. They say, if you feel thirsty, you’re already dehydrated. It’s the same with other basic physiological needs.

Our minds are able to suppress our physical needs to incredible degrees. (Just read any true story of survival. WWII POW survivor Louis Zamperini, for instance, once lasted on the open ocean for *47 days *without food or water (he and his companion survived on rainwater and the occasional raw fish or seabird).

But even though we CAN ignore our physical health in order to pursue mental tasks, doesn’t mean we SHOULD.

In Japan, so many workers literally work themselves to death that they even have a word for it: *Karoshi*, “overwork death.”

Employees succumb to strokes and heart attacks due to excessive stress and a starvation diet. Don’t let that be you.

By the time you’re starving, your bladder is bursting, your eyes are burning and your head is aching, you’re too late. Do this too many times, and you *will *get sick.

Take breaks, and take them *before* you feel you need them.

Okay, so that takes care of the “health” part. What about the “not killing your momentum” piece?

### 2. Take productive breaks, not relaxation breaks

In his book, The Motivation Myth, Jeff Haden advises people to take “productive breaks” when in the middle of hard work.

In other words, breaks are not the time for you to surf Netflix or Youtube or Wikipedia, read a novel, or play a quick game of solitaire.

Instead, choose tasks that make you feel accomplished to reinforce your sense of being productive.

Do a little cleaning, or some jumping jacks, read a (ideally nonfiction) book you’ve been meaning to read (good fiction books have this dastardly way of sucking you in and not letting go until you reach THE END).

Just, whatever you do, don’t let your mind veg out on mindless entertainment, which can derail you for the rest of the day.

### **3. Take breaks right when things get good**

This tip is particularly helpful for writers, but works for anyone:

Take a break just when things are getting good — you’re reaching the climax of your story’s plot, or when you’re *almost *done with the first part of your task.

That way, when you are taking your break (for health reasons, see #1), you’re really itching to get back to work.

When I was in primary school, class was FUN. I actually *loved* going to school, and resented weekends and summer break because I couldn’t wait to go back and learn more, because learning meant playing. I *looked forward *to it, and if I could’ve cut the weekends short, I would have.

(Later, of course, as school got more difficult and less fun, I appreciated weekends a whole lot more)

But the main thing is that when you have something to look forward to, you won’t be tempted to dawdle on your break. If anything, you can’t wait to get back to what you were working on.

### 4. Predetermine when and how long breaks will be and stick to it

When it comes to unpleasant tasks, knowing that scheduled breaks are coming gives you motivation to work harder and better and faster.

Figure out how long it takes for you to — use the bathroom, drink water, eat a snack, do jumping jacks — whatever healthy activity you plan to do for your break, *and then do not let yourself take longer*.

Also, determine *when* you will take your break through gamification. Tell yourself you only have X amount of time before you get Y done, and make it a competition — against yourself.

Games are intrinsically rewarding, because they are challenging, yet come with the *possibility* of victory. Learn to gamify your work. Make it hard, but not impossible, for you to accomplish vast amounts of work in a scarily short amount of time.

Research showed that, on average, the most productive office workers took 17 minute breaks in between 52 minute work sessions. 52 minutes is just short enough to stave off cognitive boredom, but not so short that that you don’t have enough focus to get real work done.

### 5. Plan the biggest reward at the end

If you’ve been looking to watching a certain show all week, or you can’t wait to dig into your favorite pie, or you’ve bought a new game and can’t wait to try it out, save it for your final break.

## Taking breaks does not make you lazy

If anything, it makes you healthier and more productive — *if you do it right.*

Humans aren’t perpetual motion machines, though with the proliferation of smart technology, we’ve started to deceive ourselves into being “on” all the time.

We all need breaks — in the middle of work, at the end of the week, and a few times during the year. That’s why we have weekends and vacations on the large scale, and bathroom breaks on the smaller scales.

Just be careful that you really use that breaktime to refuel and rejuvenate, not wear yourself out even more. We’ve all heard of people who stress out over planning vacations, try to cram too many activities into one trip, and then come back needing a “vacation from their vacation.”

That utterly defeats the purpose of a vacation.

You don’t have to do crazy stuff to refill the tank.

Usually, all you need is a brief mental unplug, a little physical exercise, a drink of water and a healthy snack and you are good to go again — on the small and large scale.

So listen to your body and your mind. Take a break. Don’t overthink it.

You’ll be much happier (and healthier!)

# Humans Are Not Built to Be Happy. Humans Are Built to Survive

## Humans Are Not Built to Be Happy. Humans Are Built to Survive

These days, the concept of happiness seems ever-present on our minds.

We reflect on the things that give us joy and how to incorporate more of it into our lives. We talk about how to deal with mental disorders and depression. We battle isolation, criticism, and negativity on a regular basis.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 4 percent of the world’s population [suffers](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-depression/depression-top-cause-of-disability-strikes-young-and-old-who-idUSKBN1621NL) from depression. Global economic losses amount to over $1 trillion a year due to decreased productivity. When people become fatigued or stressed, they find it hard to resolve problems at work and in the home.

If we’re so obsessed with happiness, why are we so unhappy?

## Our Obsession with Happiness

Ironically, our happy-oriented culture could be the source of our unhappiness.

In one [study](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/57d2f8668419c276f91f3b04/t/59384f54e3df2838a51f45e1/1496862549987/happiness-and-rumination.pdf), three groups of participants were asked to solve a set of problems. One group was led to the “happy room”, which was filled with books on happiness, motivation, and photos of people vacationing. Here, they were asked to solve a set of impossible tasks.

The second group was also asked to complete the same set of tasks, but in the neutral room, which contained no happiness books and posters. The third group was asked to complete a set of tasks in the happy room, except the tasks were solvable.

In the end, the group that couldn’t solve the problems in the happy room was three times as likely to dwell on their failures compared to those who had tried and failed the same activity in the neutral room. The first group experienced more negative thoughts as well. The third group, who successfully completed the solvable tasks in the happy room, did not experience negative thoughts or dwell on the problems.

When we put these findings in the context of society, we can see how our environment affects our moods. Advertisements show groups of people laughing, friends post images of themselves having a good time, and motivational messages encourage us to stay upbeat and positive.

Feeling any different creates a sense of isolation and loneliness. Like the participants in the study, being surrounded by happiness when we’ve [failed](http://www.jumpstartyourdreamlife.com/4-ways-failure-advantage/) increases our sense of negativity.

The question then becomes: How should we approach happiness? To answer that, let’s take a look at its origin.

## The Origin of Happiness

Happiness has been discussed widely in many cultures, ranging from the ancient Greeks and Romans, to the Buddhist and Hindu religions, to the Vikings. Greek philosophers Socrates and Plato first discussed the concept of happiness around 400 BC, which Aristotle built upon later.

Interestingly, the word that Greeks used to describe this phenomenon was “eudaimonia”. The first part “eu” translates into “good” and the second half “daimon” translates into “spirit”. Although it translates into “happiness”, a better way to describe the word is “human flourishing” or “good life”.

While we commonly think of happiness as excitement, contentment, or feeling the urge to smile, the ancient philosophers saw happiness as a virtue. According to Aristotle, happiness is about fulfilling one’s purpose. For humans, this means participating in rational activity and thought while living with honesty, justice, courage, and confidence.

In Classical philosophy, happiness is not about emotion. In fact, someone can go through intense hardship and still be happy based on their actions and thought. Eudaimonia is about living well as a human, regardless of the circumstances.

This differs quite a bit from the modern concept of happiness. We tend to see happiness as an emotional state, where we ride the highs of an achievement, or feel safe from the stresses and suffering of the world. It’s exciting and euphoric, yet also fleeting. Eudaimonia, on the other hand, is a perpetual state of being.

If we follow the ancient Greek definition, happiness was not achievable by the vast majority of people. It took understanding, discipline, and hard work.

Where many aspire, few achieve.

## What Humans Are Built For

We crave satisfaction. We want to reach a permanent state of elatedness, where all our problems are solved and our worries dissolved. While a nice thought, it’s unrealistic.

You and I can’t stay in the same mood forever. Emotions naturally go up and down, regardless of the changes or lack of changes in our lives. So if we are not built to be happy, according to the modern definition of happiness, what are we made for?

Consider this: Humans are not built to be happy. Humans are built to survive.

We are not meant to be stuck constantly in one emotional state. Think about it: If you are constantly happy with the state of things, any motivation you had would get sucked out.

Picture the last time you were really excited about something. Maybe you were ecstatic when you received an offer for your dream job, completed a marathon, or got married. Maybe you were on an adventurous trip to Iceland or out until the early hours with friends.

We want moments like these to last forever. If we could, we would prolong them as long as possible. Yet, they don’t last. Even if we could keep reliving our fondest moments, we would tire of them sooner or later. Doing something once is exciting. Doing something over and over becomes routine. While routines provide comfort and certainty, they can also be mundane.

Eventually, we want more. We tire of our current role, so we aspire towards a promotion or a new job. Going out all the time becomes boring, so we start thinking of settling down.

When you think of our purpose as survival, the motivation behind our actions make sense. We explore the unknown to bring back knowledge and resources that enrich our lives. We start a new venture, and in return we hope for a better quality of life for ourselves and our families. If we don’t fulfill our need to experience something new, we get restless.

As a result, we strive towards things, pushing through obstacles and hardships to experience that fleeting moment of euphoria. When we get to that moment, it’s thrilling. But after a while, it cools off. Then, we’re back at the beginning again in the [vicious cycle](http://www.jumpstartyourdreamlife.com/vicious-and-virtuous-cycles/) (or depending on how you see it, virtuous cycle) of happiness.

## A Realistic Way to Be Happy

Throughout the centuries, happiness has undergone various definitions: as an action, a way of life, and more recently, as an emotion. The problem with the last one, though, is that emotions don’t last. Situations change. You can only feel content for so long.

But when you look at happiness from a philosophical perspective as a way of thinking and living, you can be happy no matter your state. In the prehistoric past, happiness came by helping the tribe last another winter, whether it meant foraging berries or assisting in the hunt. In modern day, happiness comes through treating others with kindness, or managing the family finances to save for your children’s education.

As Buddha once said: *“There is no path to happiness: happiness is the path.”*

Feeling ecstatic at achieving a desired outcome is not the end goal. Why? Because feelings of excitement, disappointment, and sadness eventually pass. The only thing left is to keep acting and believing in ways that better the lives of yourself and others around you.

And if something does happen to bring a smile to your face, appreciate the moment while it lasts.

# Sometimes We Have To Eat Shit For A While Before We Can Rise Up Again.

## Image Credit: Jeff Leach Drinking some of that flavorful shit laden water

A month ago, I received an email titled *“I am giving up”* from a young woman. She was an aspiring life coach and had a huge money problem she was dealing with.

The young lady tried everything to get out of the situation and was even prepared to sleep in her car. There was one problem though: she had a daughter.

Things got so bad that she was even considering becoming a stripper to make some money fast but it was eating away at her on the inside because this very idea went against her ethics and values.

She felt she could never be a life coach again if she became a stripper, because the thought of helping other women after she had put her ass in lots of guys’ faces (this is what she actually said) was far too painful for her.

**Becoming a stripper to fix her money problem would simultaneously kill her dream of becoming a life coach.**

After she told me this story, she wanted my advice. ‘What should I do, Tim?” she said to me in the email.

I really wanted to help her.

I gave her this advice even though it sounds brutal and somewhat harsh:
> # I told her “Sometimes We Have To Eat Shit For A While Before We Can Rise Up Again.”

### Here’s how to eat shit for a while so that you can rise up again:

## Take a job you may not love.

Life is not all rainbows and butterflies (forgot who said that but it’s true). There will be times when your life goes off track and you could lose your job, all your money or even your partner. It’s messed up and we all go through it.

![Image Credit: [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/05/health/love-job-you-hate-wisdom-project/index.html)](1*7D77oSoGO4g85xsCKLUYQA.jpeg)*Image Credit: [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/05/health/love-job-you-hate-wisdom-project/index.html)*

The answer is not to go against all of your values, so you feel even more worthless. The advice I gave though goes against every self-help book and motivational quote you’ve ever read including #LoveYourWork

If you fall down, sometimes you have to eat shit for a while and if it’s a financial crisis, then that could mean doing a job or work you hate.

**When my business dreams collapsed in 2011, I took a call center job that I hated with every bone in my body.** I took the job because it rebuilt my confidence and taught me how to sell again.

I learned how the big bad corporate world worked and I became incredibly disciplined. I even learned how to love a woman again which sounds corny, but it’s true.

I ate the worst kind of shit you could possibly eat and I tried to enjoy every moment of it. I then saved up enough money to attend a Tony Robbins event and that was the catalyst for my transformation.

Superman didn’t come and save me like you see in the movies. **I had to save myself and that involved doing something I didn’t like.**

There are more lessons in the stuff you hate than you may realize. Embrace it.

## Work on a side hustle at the same time.

The first point is horribly wrong unless you couple it with a side hustle. Eating shit and having no way out of it is putting yourself through unnecessary torture that you may not recover from.

The rope marks could scar you for life without a side hustle.

My side hustle started out as personal development which eventually led me to begin blogging. Without this side hustle, the time where I had to eat shit would have been unbearable.

![Image Credit: [Matylda](http://www.matylda.com/)](1*FTivKXyeEW2LnysShY108Q.jpeg)*Image Credit: [Matylda](http://www.matylda.com/)*

Every day while I worked a job I hated, I looked forward to the small amounts of spare time I had so that I could work on my side hustle. In the first week of this difficult job, I outsold the other staff and hit 200% of my sales target.
> “I achieved 200% of my sales target because I was determined to outperform so I could gain the privileges that came with it — more time and more freedom”

Instead of being micromanaged, I got the chance to watch Ted Talks with my people leader and strategize about the future of the business.

The side hustle then became much bigger later on and now it fuels everything I do. I’m obsessed with everyone finding a side hustle, so they have something to motivate them at least some of the time.

## Eating shit is where GRIT is built.

I never used to have an “anything is possible” mindset. The grit I have was built from having to eat shit for a while.
> # “I knew that if I could make it through the muddy waters of not following my passion, I could do anything”

The harsh part of life taught me how to fend for myself and overcome my own demons, so I could rise up again out of the ashes. Grit does not come from your comfort zone.

Grit is found in the biggest and boldest of challenges where you have to use every ounce of your strength to come out alive.

The young woman that emailed me is working on developing the same personality trait. This work is what will make her an exceptional life coach.

## You’ve gotta do what you’ve gotta do.

Eating shit is short term and if you have a financial problem or something that just won’t go away, you’ve got to tackle it head on. Complaining about your situation and telling yourself the odds are stacked against you won’t help.

**When you see eating shit as short term, you develop the mindset that will help you break through.**

There’s no magic cure.

I told the young lady that emailed me to eat shit for a while (I was nicer than that, don’t worry) and do what she has to do to earn some money (without breaking her values). This battle is short-term and that’s how we all have to see it.

## Think about a situation that is worse than yours.

Speaking of eating shit, one of my mentors reached out to me and told me they had been demoted. They no longer had people underneath them and they were forced into something they didn’t love as much.

I told my mentor the same thing: we all have to eat shit sometimes.

That advice was then followed up with my story of going from business owner to a call center operator. I then told him the story of a mutual friend who had gone from a high flying job to a nobody that was ignored.

![](1*VruK1TCMVgqWP1IArk_hlg.jpeg)

He put up with that for three years and then eventually someone saw what I saw in him, and he was given a very senior role in another company.

Your situation may suck big time but getting some perspective and hearing about others who’ve had to eat shit is a refreshing way (refreshing and brown stuff in the same sentence?) to overcome the negativity you’ll experience .

## Understand that no one stays at the top of anything forever.

You could be the richest person in the world today. Eventually, you’ll be knocked off the top spot.

You could be the fastest 100m sprinter in the world. Tomorrow, or eventually, someone will be faster than you. The simple fact is that no one is permanently at the top of their game.
> # “All of us will fall from grace at some point”

What I’ve learned is that falling from grace and eating shit for a while is how you rise up again. You can’t rise up if you haven’t fallen down before.

The deep, dark problem you think you’re facing will pass- it always does eventually. This is not the time to make a dumb decision, ask for sympathy or complain.

It’s time to eat shit for a while and put in the work. Earn the right to get what you want by starting again at the bottom. That’s how you rise up again.

# The Rise Of The 7th Sense

## 

***“Every one of the five senses can be twisted to deliver a completely different picture of the world. If by picture we mean the sight, sound, smell, taste, and texture of things, a troubling conclusion looms. Apart from the very unreliable picture running inside the brain, we have no proof that reality is anything like what we see.”***

***~Deepak Chopra***

We all are aware of the ***Big 5 Senses*** right?

**Sight, Taste, Smell, Touch, and Sound.**

Is there a 6th Sense?

I know what you’re thinking.

There’s the Bruce Willis movie…


No, not that 6th Sense.

Apparently the 6th sense came about very quietly. Apparently nobody noticed.

Recently I came across an article titled [*The Five (and More) Senses](https://www.livescience.com/60752-human-senses.html)* in Live Science written by Alina Bradford. She writes:
> The sense of space
> In addition to the traditional big five, there is another sense that deals with how your brain understands where your body is in space. This sense is called [proprioception](https://www.livescience.com/56223-sixth-sense-genes.html).
> Proprioception includes the sense of movement and position of our limbs and muscles. For example, proprioception enables a person to touch their finger to the tip of their nose, even with their eyes closed. It enables a person to climb steps without looking at each one. People with poor proprioception may be clumsy and uncoordinated.

Ok so if the 6th sense is not the Bruce Willis movie but rather is ***Proprioception***…

What about a 7th Sense?

Let’s take a closer look at the Big 5 first.

## ***1. Sight***

![“blue eye photo” by [Daniil Kuželev](https://unsplash.com/@kuzelevdaniil?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*uco73hcmlFZh28Wj)*“blue eye photo” by [Daniil Kuželev](https://unsplash.com/@kuzelevdaniil?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

When I was in 7th grade, our photography class teacher Mr. Newman was talking about how some people are colorblind. Of course, my mind immediately dove into deep thinking mode about what that could mean. I raised my hand and asked if that means that we all see colors differently?

***Geoff (at age 14):*** Is the color red that I see someone else’s green? Is my yellow your Orange? Is this even possible? Do we see colors differently?

*The class fell silent.*

***Mr. Newman: ***Gosh what a profound and interesting question.

*More silence.*

We left it at that.

## ***2 and 3. Taste and Smell***

![“four person earring on black wooden table” by [Dan Gold](https://unsplash.com/@danielcgold?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*DwDVP3a2tpGx30gO)*“four person earring on black wooden table” by [Dan Gold](https://unsplash.com/@danielcgold?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

I’m looping these two together because they seem to often go hand in hand.

I sure don’t like the taste of shrimp. But some people love shrimp. I happen to love the taste of oatmeal. Many people can’t stand it. They think it’s bland. If we were to sit down and debate why I should like shrimp and the other person should like oatmeal, we’d look ridiculous. We just go ahead and accept that some people like the taste of oatmeal and shrimp, some like one but not the other, and some like neither. We have a general acceptance policy (so it seems) that some people’s sense of taste and smell can vary from person to person.

I wonder if we were as accepting of this in our more primitive days?

Curiouser and curiouser….

## ***4. Touch***

![“person showing right palm” by [Keenan Constance](https://unsplash.com/@keenangrams?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*292HGohda4vq9wx-)*“person showing right palm” by [Keenan Constance](https://unsplash.com/@keenangrams?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

I have a genuine fear of cotton balls and silk. If I touch cotton balls and silk it gives me the feeling many people hear when nails scratch across a chalkboard. Don’t ask me why I can’t touch these materials, but it freaks me out to even come close. Where does this come from? Hard to say. But just like taste and smell, some things can be more pleasant than others for certain people to touch.

## ***5. Sound***

![“group of people watching concert” by [Rachel Lynette French](https://unsplash.com/@rachellynette?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*L-E7w_bZ507tQNHA)*“group of people watching concert” by [Rachel Lynette French](https://unsplash.com/@rachellynette?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

People like different types of music. There’s certain people that are more tolerant of certain sounds (like nails on a chalkboard) than others. Some of us like loud concerts and some of us don’t. It seems as if there’s a wide amount of sounds we disagree on.

So that leaves this new color to the sensory rainbow that for whatever reason is right there yet we can’t all seem to see it. It seems to be the ***“rebel sense”***. It doesn’t want us to see it. It’s the angry / upset youngest sibling of the sensory family that runs amuck amongst it’s for the most part well behaved siblings.

What if ***The 7th Sense*** is…

## ***Perception***

![](1*v1f2bVTUdf3HKC8DJV-AjQ.jpeg)

**Definition: **The state of being or process of becoming aware of something through the senses.

**Source: **Google Dictionary

Through the senses?

Or could it be… a sense of it’s own?

![](1*mlig5ZEJAT6HoLN9ysDDqQ.jpeg)

In the attached photo we see very different views on a situation. One man sees a boat and he’d do anything for that boat. The other sees land and he’d do anything for that land. However, due to a variety of circumstances they are seeing the current situation from very different angles.

**Hypothesis:** The way in which we perceive the world seems to widely vary from person to person. Could this be a sense? A sense we are not quite in tune with yet?

The interesting thing about this is the world of the 7th sense seems to reside mostly in politics right now. Perception is how we PERCEIVE things. Who’s to say we can’t perceive things differently from person to person?

If person X, a President Donald Trump supporter walks down the street and says:

***“I like Trump. I like all he does. I like his policies and he’s doing things for the greater good. Do you not see it?”***

Meanwhile, Person Y, a Non-Trump Supporter walks down the street and says:

***“Are you out of your mind? Trump is a nutcase, idiot, disgraceful, fool! How do you not see it?!”***

First of all both sides should understand it’s not a matter of seeing. They are both referring to the “Sight” sense. It would be the same as the person who loves shrimp asking the person who hates it:

***“How do you not see it?! It’s so good!”***

That would be kind of silly wouldn’t it?

Of course the person who doesn’t like the shrimp can ***see*** the Shrimp. Just like they can ***see*** Trump. But one (perhaps more) of their senses tells them ***“yuck”***.

Maybe they did that in our more primitive days but now we recognize that people have different tastes.
> # ***What if our senses are large parts of the evolutionary growth road?***

Imagine us yelling at each other about why one person doesn’t like the taste of shrimp and one does. We would seem ridiculous.

This brings in a larger world perspective. If we’ve evolved this far, are our differences in perspective merely setting the table for an even higher stage of evolution further down the road?

If one person loves the taste of lima beans and one person hates it, isn’t it completely possible that one person could love a political candidate and the other hate them simply because it’s a sensory decision based on what makes the person who they are? Could it be a decision based on how the person’s brain interprets the world they are living in?

Let’s look at another example:

![](1*a8BYSO-xjA9rmfl3ZaCYmw.jpeg)

In the above photo everyone has a different view of the greater whole. They are all seeing the elephant from a different angle. They have a different perspective and therefore perceive what it is from a different angle. Is this in illustration of that illusive 7th Sense?

Author Scott Adams discusses what he calls*** [Two Movies On One Screen](http://blog.dilbert.com/2017/02/12/good-example-of-our-two-movie-reality/)***. This is the belief that in our reality we all are watching the same movie however our ***perception*** of it is differently.

He writes:
> I have been saying since Trump’s election that the world has split into two realities — or as I prefer to say, two movies on one screen — and most of us don’t realize it. We’re all looking at the same events and interpreting them wildly differently. That’s how cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias work. They work together to create a spontaneous hallucination that gets reinforced over time. That hallucination becomes your reality until something changes.
> This phenomenon has nothing to do with natural intelligence. We like to think that the people on the other side of the political debate are dumb, under-informed, or just plain evil. That’s not the case. We’re actually experiencing different realities. I mean that literally.

We perceive what is happening differently however we choose to fight about it. Perhaps with more of an understanding and empathy for each other we can all come to realize that perception varies within people. It is different depending on how you perceive the world.

And what if this extends way beyond politics? What if politics is just the leaping off point? Could we be perceiving everything differently from person to person? Was I right to raise my hand and ask if we see different colors differently? Is this a nod towards a wider view? A higher…perspective?

Could my perception of a political candidate from my friend’s perception of him / her be no different than my friend loving the taste of shrimp and me despising it?
> # The 7th Sense may very well have arrived.

Food for thought.

I’m off to finish my oatmeal.

See you soon.

# Making Money is the Easy Part

## It’s What You Do Once You’ve Made It That’s Tricky

![](1*Xkyr-y0AgzwgqzJIZ2LKDA.jpeg)

When you first start your business, there are a million things on your mind.

Unless you already have an accounting bent, tracking your detailed spending and expenses is not one of them.

It’s not that you don’t think about the money. But you think primarily about it coming in–not so much where it’s going after that. You have to focus on the bigger picture to ensure profitability.

And that’s fine. It’s what you need to do. Until it’s time to file your taxes, and the IRS starts asking questions about this expenditure and that write-off.

Mistakes could land you in big trouble and even capsize your business if you aren’t prepared.

Fortunately, you can avoid all that hassle and headache by doing just one thing.

## **Let Someone Else Handle Your Money**

*“Don’t let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.” *— John R. Wooden

Having a financial person in your life is one of the best decisions you can make for yourself and your business.

Whether you call them a bookkeeper, an accountant, or a chief financial officer, employing a competent financial manager is an essential part of your business. You must keep track of all of your expenses and have someone who knows what they’re doing in charge of allocating funds.

## **Counting the Cost**

*“Many people take no care of their money till they come nearly to the end of it, and others do just the same with their time.” *— Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

If you’re an entrepreneur just starting off, the cost of an accountant can feel daunting. But trust me: if you try to get everything in order yourself, the countless hours you will waste is a far greater loss.

Look beyond the initial price. You have to value your time, which is better spent developing your vision, products, marketing, and the things that will move your business forward.

It’s like hiring a bodyguard so you can get on with your job without worrying.

Be smart in who you ask to oversee the finances. Mistakes or sloppy bookkeeping can land you in trouble, and navigating the tax code is a nightmare. Getting audited can be avoided with a*** ***competent financial manager* *at the helm. Their job is to make sure that taxes are filed correctly and that spending choices never raise red flags.

If you want to position yourself for growth rather than disaster, you need someone else running the books.

## **The Devil is in the Details**

*“Never hire someone who knows less than you do about what he’s hired to do.”* — Malcolm Forbes

When you get a financial manager, they will start looking at how the smallest spending decisions add up.

By breaking down your small expenses, they could help you save thousands of dollars by making just a few changes.

At the start of your career, you might be putting a lot of your own money on the line. These small spending adjustments will enable you to save up and create some breathing room for when you might need a little help.

And while we’re at it, you cannot neglect your personal finances. Keeping track of your own spending and getting help budgeting will change your life.

Consider the classic example: if you buy a $3.50 coffee five days a week, you’re spending $910 on coffee every year. What more could you do if you reduced that spending?

## **Don’t Be a Financial Loner**
> *“One of the greatest barriers to connection is the cultural importance we place on “going it alone.” Somehow we’ve come to equate success with not needing anyone. Many of us are willing to extend a helping hand, but we’re very reluctant to reach out for help when we need it ourselves. It’s as if we’ve divided the world into “those who offer help” and “those who need help.” The truth is that we are both.” *―[Brené Brown](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/162578.Bren_Brown)

No matter how small your business is, never try to do it all by yourself.

None of my business ventures would have continued to profit without the help of financial managers. These people help me grow my businesses in the most efficient and sustainable way possible.

As an entrepreneur, you’re often looking at the big picture. You need to surround yourself with people who balance your weaknesses, can scale things down, and mind the details.

All great businesses are built by teams. Surround yourself with a well-balanced team, know the value of your time, and pay attention to every dollar you spend!

# Personal Finance Hacks (Ages 18–30)

## Personal Finance Hacks (Ages 18–30)

### How to Open a Bank Account & Invest your Money in less than 2 Hours

The biggest mistake most people make with regard to their finances is inaction (especially college students and young professionals). So this post is going to be incredibly biased towards action. Section 1 will explain what to do, section 2 will explain why.

## **Step 1: Setup a Great Bank Account (34 minutes)**

**Call Ally Bank **(1–877–247–2559). Tell them that you want to open a Checking and a Savings account. They will ask for your name, email, address, social security number, and a password. They will set you up over the phone. Ask the person on the phone to setup automatic overdraft protection from your savings account for your checking account. Ask them to help you transfer your money from your current bank to Ally Checking Account. They will need your Account Number and your Routing Number from your existing bank. This transfer should take 3–4 business days. Within the same time period you will also get an Ally Debit Card and Checks in the mail. I believe you have to be a US Citizen (maybe permanent resident?) to use Ally Bank.

### Why Ally Bank?

The foundation to your financial setup is your savings and checking accounts. There are so many to choose from, so which should you pick? 
Ally Bank.

While most banks are a headache to deal with, will keep you on hold on the phone listening to classical music for 15 minutes before you actually get to talk to a real human, give you a 0.01% interest on your savings, and charge you random fees for a slew of different situations, Ally is the complete opposite.

Ally has phone support available 24/7, never again will you call on the weekend or after work (when you actually have time) to learn that you should call back Monday morning. Ally has it’s phone number and the wait time expected for a call prominently displayed on its website. I’ve never seen the wait time exceed 1 minute. Often they also have live online chat available.

![](1*a2L5p96zRLFZS6JnsqLWdQ.png)

Ally automatically reimburses its customers up to $10/month on all ATM fees, which means that if you use the ATM less than 3 times per month you can use any ATM in the U.S. without worrying about fees. Convenient.

Ally is able to provide such incredible customer support because it is an online only bank. As a result it can save money by not having physical branches, and it passes those savings onto it’s customers and invests it into excellent support. Ally has no monthly maintenance fees, no minimum deposits, and no transaction fees. O, and it will also give you a 1.65% Annual Percentage Yield on your savings account.

I’ve hated, some banks I’ve used in the past. Ally I LOVE. It is one of my favorite products. It’s great when banking becomes a fast, fluid experience. If you already have a bank, and you don’t LOVE it. Please, take 30 minutes right now and change to Ally Bank. You will thank yourself so many times over and over and over again over the next few decades that you did so. Especially if you are currently using Wells Fargo as your bank, there is no excuse, drop everything and switch to Ally now. That was the switch I made and it’s night and day.

## **Step 2: Invest Your Money (30 minutes)**

**Call Vanguard** (800–992–8327). Tell them that you are not yet a Vanguard member and that you want to open an investment account. They’ll ask you how much you want to invest. Have a number in mind. It can be as small or as big as you like, there are no minimums. Ask them to help you make the transfer from your bank account to Vanguard. I recommend investing in a Vanguard ETF that has the minimum fees possible and follows the S&P500 so your money will grow as the market grows (almost no one beats the market).

From experience, the best interface for dealing with financial institutions is over the phone. They will guide you through everything and let you jump through all the hoops faster than doing it online.

**Why Vanguard?
**Vanguard is essentially a non-profit, therefore any profits it earns essentially comes back to you in the form of lower fees. It also has an easy to use (for the most part) website and app and they answer the phone. Don’t like Vanguard? Like another method of investing your money? No problem, go do that, but do it now. Don’t wait. Invest your money now. Take 10% (or more) of your net worth and just put it in and ETF that mirrors that the S&P500. Just Do It™.

## **Step 3: Open a Credit Card With Good Points (20 minutes)**

**Apply online **for** [**Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6/PY63SWENO5). This is the credit card I would most highly recommend for an individual. It has great points for flights (enough for a round trip from SF to Boston twice if you spend $4k in the first 3 months). Chase’s online system is also super easy to use and very fast. They can approve your request online within 24 hours. To apply online go [here](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6/PY63SWENO5). It has a $95/yr fee, but it is waived for the first year.

Once you get a credit card make sure to link it to your Ally Bank account to have automatic payments setup. Never allow a balance to carry on your card — this is not even an option you should consider. Ever. Treat your Credit Card like a debit card. It is never worth it to pay the ridiculous interest rate on credit card purchases. It is very useful to do all your online shopping with a credit card though, because transactions with credit cards are much more reversible than those with a debit card. So if someone steals your card or you want to dispute a transaction you can do so more easily with a credit card.

For all your financial touchpoints (Bank, Debit Card, Credit Card, Investing Account, etc) you should set up text updates so that every time something is bought with your card or money is moved between your accounts you can know about it).

## **Why **Chase Sapphire Preferred?

It’s consistently ranked as one of the best credit cards, especially for travel. And they approve you almost immediately and get the card to you quickly with no hassle. Main reason not to use it is if you don’t like to travel and would prefer to get cash back, in that case optimize for a card that will give you high cash back for what you spend on. If you do expect to take at least 2 flights this year just get the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. Don’t wait. Do it now.

## **Step 4: Get some Bitcoin on [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/592b3b352177a9eb86701daf) (20 minutes)**

**Register and buy **some Bitcoin on [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/592b3b352177a9eb86701daf). 
No one knows if cryptocurrencies will take off or not. But if they do, the upside will be pretty gigantic. The backbone of the cryptocurrency world is Bitcoin so it is the least volatile crypto to invest in. It is very possible that Bitcoin will go to zero, but it is also very possible that Bitcoin will 10x in the next few years. So, just so you don’t have regret later it makes sense to put a little bit of money in Bitcoin. A common strategy is to put 1% of one’s net worth in Bitcoin (depending on your risk tolerance), but if you don’t know too much about it, I’d recommend just putting in what it won’t hurt you to loose. Then forget about it (but keep your login/password safe), and just hold the Bitcoin for a few years. The easiest way to buy some bitcoin is to go to [CoinBase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/592b3b352177a9eb86701daf). I’d recommend initially just buying $100. You can do this instantly with your credit card, normally I’d say avoid the fee for buying with a credit card, but since Bitcoin is so volatile the single digit percentile fee will not make as big of a difference as waiting a few days will.

The number of times reading a contract with speechify saved me from making a mistake is crazy. Try it, you won’t know how you lived without it. I couldn’t live without it. That’s why I made it :)

# The Comfort Trap&#58; Why the Pursuit of an Easier Life Creates a Harder One (And What to Do Instead).

## Wiki commons: diogenes

Over 10,000 years ago, humans thrived and co-existed with nature.

Humans fed themselves by hunting wild animals and gathering plants. Plants flourished and animals bred with one another as nature permitted them to do so.

Nature was left alone. There was no intervention or manipulation of the natural order of things.

But, this all changed around 9500–8500 BC.

During this period known as the Agricultural Revolution, humans began to intervene with nature and manipulate the natural breeding process of plants and animals.

Seeds were sown and watered, sheep were placed in meadows and pastures for grazing and animals were forced to participate in selective breeding.

Humans believed that this new way of living would make it easier to provide food to the population, and thus live a better life.

But did the Agricultural Revolution live up to its promises?

## The Vicious Cycle of Ease and Hardship

In the best-selling book, [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](http://geni.us/sapiensbook) [(audiobook)](http://geni.us/sapiensaudiobook), world renown historian, Yuval Noah Harari, describes the early periods of the agricultural revolution:

“With the move to permanent villages and the increase in food supply, the population began to grow. Giving up the nomadic lifestyle enabled women to have a child every year. Babies were weaned at an earlier age — they could be fed on porridge and gruel.” [1]

But, Noah Harari notes that this pursuit of an easier life led to unintended consequences:

“The extra hands were sorely needed in the fields. But the extra mouths quickly wiped out the food surpluses, so even more fields had to be planted. As people began living in disease-ridden settlements, as children fed more on cereals and less on mother’s milk, and as each child competed for his or her porridge with more and more siblings, child mortality soared.”

At the time at least one out of every three children died before living till the age of twenty years old. [2]

Despite the rapid rise in the mortality rate of the population, its birth rate continued to rise even faster. And several generations later, humans had become dependent on farming for survival.

Humans left behind a life of hunting and gathering in a well-sized healthy population for a life of farming and breeding in a rapidly growing, disease-ridden population with high death rates.

By the time humans realized that the Agricultural Revolution had failed to live up to its promise of an easier life, it was too late to turn back.

They were caught in a trap — the comfort trap.

![](1*qv72yFUMfffHoo0Hfs0AKg.jpeg)

In the pursuit of an easier life, humans had unexpectedly created a harder one, as more people were kept alive but under worse conditions than before.

Humans did not foresee that birth rates would rise so quickly or that the increase in wheat consumption would lead to the spread of deadly diseases and high mortality.

They did not foresee that their profitable farms and fields would attract more dangerous threats into their society, including sophisticated intruders, wars and thefts.

Fast forward 10,000 years and humans have learned from the mistakes of the Agricultural Revolution. They’ve escaped the comfort trap and today, live a better life.

Or did history repeat itself again?

## The Ease of Ineffectiveness

Today, more so than ever — due to the advancement of technology and sciences — humans are moving at breakneck speed to discover quicker and easier ways to live.

For example, a few decades ago, it took an effort to send a message to a loved one, friend or colleague. Messages were letters, handwritten with an ink pen on paper. After writing, people would drop the letter in a mailbox and wait several days or even months to receive a response.

And when a reply letter, say from a loved one, was delivered to the senders doorstep, it was read carefully with excitement and appreciation for its delivery.

Not so in today’s digital era.

From the tips of our fingers, we can send and receive a reply within seconds from a friend living on the opposite end of the globe.

Gone are the days of messages written with careful thought behind each written word. Nowadays, people send the first thing that comes to mind. Emails, text messages and tweets are rushed and sent on impulse without much consideration for the recipient.

Back then, we’d sort through a handful of letters each month, but today, we’re bombarded every day with hundreds of messages from people who expect a prompt reply, even when their demands aren’t urgent.

Instant messaging and emails were supposed to make communication easier, but have they?

For most of us, virtual communication has become a source of overwhelm, stress and distraction from effective work.

We feel like we’re on a hamster wheel of busyness and can’t find enough time to get things done and focus on what matters most.

But that’s not all.

## The Rise of Technology and the Decline of Well-Being

The pursuit of an easier life through technology has led to the creation of more complex problems that span across every single area of our lives.

Here are some examples.

Social media was created to make it easier for people to stay connected, yet we’ve never felt so disconnected, lonely and isolated from one other than today. [3]

The internet was created to make it easier to store and retrieve information, yet it has created the safety risks of data privacy breaches, identity theft, cyber bullying, online predators, inappropriate content for children and online addictions.

Dating apps were created to make it easier to find love and a life partner, yet it’s never been harder in human history for man and woman to come together and find true love.

Electronic devices — like the computer and mobile phone — were created to make communication easier, yet nowadays, families spend their downtime together either watching TV, texting on mobile phones and using the internet on laptops, instead of communicating with one another.

The modern office was created to make it easier for workers to stay productive, yet employees spend the majority of their workday sat on a chair, slouched over a desk in front of a computer, increasing the risks of obesity, heart diseases and brain damage. [4]

We believed that technology would make life easier, but has it? Can we say with confidence that citizens of developed countries, who have access to the most advanced technology, live a happier and healthier life than those living in developing countries?

So far, our dependency on technology has created more problems — some even worse than before — and a harder life in many ways.

But, how can we revert back to the old way of living when the world has moved on? How can we escape the comfort trap to live a better life?

## Embrace Hardship

Over a 100 years ago, philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche said “That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.”

A 100 plus years later, Nietzsche’s words still ring true.

Various studies have shown that people who experience and overcome adverse events — business failures, divorce, death of a loved one, difficult work — develop the necessary [**mental toughness ](https://mayooshin.com/mental-toughness/)**required to overcome future adverse events. They also experience improved mental health, well-being and overall life satisfaction. [5]

In everyday life we’re faced with the decision to either embrace hardship or avoid it.

We have a choice to either send a lengthy email reply or set up a phone call, to either send a long thread of tweets or text messages to friends or plan a meetup in person, to either drive a mile to a destination or walk instead.

And whilst the easier choices are convenient and save time in the short-term, the harder ones save more time and create more rewarding benefits over the long run.

In the same spirit, we could embrace the hardship of pursuing our goals.

If you’re an entrepreneur, embrace the hardship of spending a ton of time, energy and money building a product that fails.

Embrace the unpredictable flow of income and the uncertain future of your business.

Embrace the loneliness and pain of sacrificing time that could’ve been spent with family and friends.

If you’re a writer or artist, embrace the hardship of failures and rejections of your proposals.

Embrace the struggles with procrastination and creative blocks.

Embrace the fear of [criticism](https://mayooshin.com/how-to-deal-with-haters/) and self-doubt of your creative work.

If you’re trying to lose weight and get in shape, embrace the hardship of regular exercise, counting calories and [eating healthy meals](https://mayooshin.com/blue-zones-diet/) each day, even when [you don’t have the motivation](https://mayooshin.com/how-to-stick-to-your-goals/) to do so.

Embrace the lack of support and criticism from your friends, family and colleagues.

Embrace the long wait of several months before you reap the rewards of your efforts and notice visible changes in your body shape.

By embracing hardship, we create new opportunities to become better at what we do, gain valuable wisdom and live a better life.

## The Joys of Hardship

There’s an ancient chinese saying “Chi Ku Shi Fu,” which means “Eating Bitterness is Good Fortune.”

In other words, embracing hardship and unpleasant experiences today, instead of pursuing easier ones, will lead to a better life tomorrow.

No matter how hard your life is today, don’t give up. Resist the temptation to pursue an easier life, embrace hardship and escape the comfort trap.

There’s light at the end of the tunnel of hardship — a lifetime of joy and fulfillment.

# 50 Questions Founders Should Ask Themselves About Investors

## The RIGHT Investors Will Thank You For Asking Better Questions

*By [Chad Grills](https://twitter.com/ChadGrills), CEO, [Mission.org](http://mission.org)*

![](1*sRdi-1kWGkuFNWQjjdY3Sw.jpeg)

I have received investment in my business from top tier VCs and investors.

I have narrowly avoided taking investment from the wrong investors.

Now, I’m the CEO of a profitable and rapidly growing company.

I could not have achieved this if I didn’t pause and start to ask myself and potential investors better questions.

So if you’re thinking about taking investment from investors…

STOP!

Before you do, I *implore* you to think deeply and create a list of questions to think about. The questions that follow aren’t necessarily for you to ask your investors, they’re designed for you to think about, and to help guide you as you select what investors you want to work with.

That simple act can save you years or decades of confusion and pain.

And the *right* investors that you need… Those *dream* investors who can help you succeed…

They will thank you for asking better questions.

These questions have helped me slow down and think more clearly. It’s my hope that at least one of these questions will help spark an insight or realization that helps you find the perfect investor(s), avoid the wrong one(s), and achieve massive success in business and life.

Before we dive in, let me explain *how* we developed this list. The foundation of this article was developed from years of being and living amongst founders and investors in Silicon Valley.

As part of our research, we spent a week working with [Founder Institute](http://fi.co).

The Founder Institute helps tech entrepreneurs build a business and raise funding with the help of experienced [startup mentors](http://fi.co/mentors), advisors, and investors. They have chapters across [180+ cities and 6 continents](http://fi.co/global). You can learn more about their pre-seed startup accelerator [here](http://fi.co/).

During our time collaborating with their team, we had the opportunity to interview and chat with hundreds of successful founders, mentors, and investors. It is through these discussions, our own research, and years of personal experience that we compiled this list.

And now, **50 Questions Founders Should Ask Themselves About Investors.**

1) Why are they doing VC instead of building another company? (Supposedly Jeff Bezos asked Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz this when they asked him to be an LP at [Andreessen Horowitz](https://twitter.com/a16z))

2) When decisions or companies have they backed that are truly doing good in the world?

3) As F. Scott Fitzgerald says, “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” Can they do that?

4) The best founders and investors can be quirky, but also effective. Do the investors you want to work with embody this originality and quirkiness? And are they effective?

5) Why are you excited about working with these specific investors for the next 5–15 years?

6) Are you prepared to get to know who this investor is by having multiple conversations and hangouts with them? Are you excited when you get to hang out or spend time with them?

7) How will their expertise, knowledge, and connections specifically help you and the company?

8) What are their goals (business model) and how will your expertise, knowledge, and business specifically and strategically help them achieve their goals?

9) Could you take feedback from this person that is extremely honest, critical, and blunt (while still respecting them)?

10) Have they built and sold a company?

11) Was that company or outcome something you admire, and will the domain knowledge they gained in the process be complementary with what you’re trying to build?

12) What evidence is there that they are willing to bet on who you are (and are becoming) as a person? In other words, are they confident that no matter what happens with the business, you *will *be able to figure it out?

13) Are they fundamental or dogmatic in their thinking? Or can they, and do they, regularly change or adjust their beliefs?

14) What personal belief have they changed in the last year or so, and why?

15) What’s the most valuable thing they’ve learned in the last year?

16) The now classic, “what important truth do [they] believe that few people would agree with them on?”

17) Who are there mentors? Who do they learn from?

18) Have they had a job or time in their life where they were humbled? What evidence is there that they can check their ego, roll up their sleeves, and chop wood and carry water?

19) What type of questions do they ask you? Are they asking what your childhood was like (a first principles approach to discovering who you are), or are they only focused on the present and what you’re currently making?

20) What proof or evidence have they given that they thoughtfully read through your deck, or are listening to what you’re saying? Plenty of investors haven’t set up proper filters or systems and get mired in a deluge of inbound. Because of this, they have a tendency not to listen on the phone or read the decks or emails you send.

21) Do they take care of themselves physically and mentally?

22) What addictions do you suspect they have and do they have a substance abuse problem? (I’m serious here- plenty of investors have more than one skeleton in the closet, and even something small like a daily overdose of sugar or caffeine can signify they’ll never be able to lend cognitive capacities to you that aren’t befuddled by adrenaline or a sugar crash.)

23) Do they want to back founders like you? Sadly, there are still many investors who actively look for founders who are borderline psychopaths that will do anything to “win”. What type of founder do they back?

24) Have they had a successful long term romantic relationship in their life? This is one of the most undervalued tells to discover what people are really like, and how well they collaborate with others.

25) Do they respect you? Do you respect and want to learn from them?

26) What portfolio investments have they been the first or lead investor in? Do they have a track record that shows courage and conviction? Are they lemming-like? Do they spray and pray, or do they back the truck up when they have conviction?

27) Have they had an exit that was more than an aqui-hire?

28) What type of compensation structure is their firm rumored to follow? Are they choosing a lower salary in exchange for a larger upside or carry?

29) Who are their LPs, and are you excited about making these people or institutions more money? If you can’t find that information, do research, or ask them. Understand if they can’t disclose all of them, but you should at least be able to turn up a few. Do you want to work your butt off to generate returns for these LPs?

30) What are the economics of the potential investment they would be making in your company, and what result do you need to generate to make it a success? For example. If they’re investing out of a $1.3B fund, do you have a coherent answer for how the piece of your business that they would own will grow to be worth $5B+ within the timeline they need to return capital to LPs?

31) What is their response when you explain to them how you’ll reach your first hundred million or billion in revenue?

32) How well are their other investments in their current or previous fund performing? Are there past or present funds up by an incredible multiple (say, ~7.7x times) that’s better than industry averages? You should want to be on a winning team just as much as they do.

33) How much do they usually invest, and who else do you have to bring into the round to make it easy for them to say yes?

34) What percentage of the companies they back go on to raise subsequent funding rounds, exit, or IPO? Are they known for making (or being willing to make) extremely large follow on investments in their winners?

35) Do they have investments in portfolio companies that are working on big challenges (AI, human augmentation, preventing war, fighting cancer, education, space, hard science, etc…). Or do they have a lot of vanity investments in Series D rounds of popular unicorns?

36) Ask people they’ve worked with how this particular investor balances helping when needed and leaving the entrepreneur alone when it’s not.

37) What is the philosophy of their boss and the firm they work for? Do their philosophical beliefs and actions align with your own?

38) Do they ever express any of their personal philosophies publicly, especially if it’s different from that of their boss?

39) Reference Check: Connect with 3 founders of successful companies they’ve invested in, and get their take on the investor.

40) Reference Check: Connect with 3 founders of companies they’ve invested in that have failed, and get their take on the investor. Bonus points if you do a reference check on the individual founders who failed (it’s easy to blame your investors for what you failed to do).

41) Do their portfolio companies inspire and intimidate you (in a good way)? Are they important for humanity and society? Or, are most of their investments in things to just amuse humanity to death on the way to extinction?

42) Do they spot serious challenges, opportunities, and perspectives about your business that you haven’t thought about?

43) What are some of their daily habits and rituals?

44) Do they use buzzwords and phrases or substantive ones?

45) Wise men have said that “the world is made of language.” Several of the best investors in the world have started to hint that they are only looking for founders who speak indefinite future tense about what they will accomplish. What type of language does the investor you’re pursuing use? Do they make vague, indefinite comments? Or do they make definite, strong statements? Can they speak about your business indefinite future tense along with you?

46) Are they willing to trust or defer to your expertise or analysis of a market? Or, do they want a scientific study done by ‘experts’ about each observation, metric, theory, or insight you’ve discovered or generated? The devil’s advocate can be helpful if he wields logic and data, but if they can’t handle being proven wrong by you… you might want to run!

47) What type of people do they want to invest in and why?

48) What do they prioritize when investing: markets, tech, ideas, or people?

49) Are they willing to get to know you well enough to gain enough context to invest in you as a person, or make the necessary effort to do (smart) character and reference checks on you? If not, how can you ever develop a positive working relationship or friendship with them?

50) Who are the five people they seem to spend the most time with? They’re becoming like those they spend time with — just like you…

# Everything You Fight Has Power Over you. Everything You Accept Doesn’t.

## “two red boxing gloves on grey surface” by rawpixel on Unsplash

We continuously seek answers outside of ourselves. We look for them in self-help books, podcasts, seminars, mentors, and spiritual teachers. But continually looking outside ourselves for answers isn’t exactly a vote of confidence in the expression of our soul’s calling. Eventually, to find our answers, we must turn inward. But going inward requires us to brave the wilderness, explore uncharted territory, and in the words of my friend AJ Leon, not follow well-lit paths, but grab a machete and hack our own.

When we go inward, we can no longer avoid our pain. We have to confront it. But there’s a strange paradox to pain. The more we fight it, the more we empower it.

Everything you fight has power over you. Everything you accept loses its problem it never gets solved? But when you finally let it go, somehow it gets sorted out. A perfect example is dating. In his course on relationships, Mark Manson says one of the best ways to meet somebody is to find something better to do than trying to meet somebody.

When the longing, striving and pushing to get what you so desperately want finally come to an end you’re free. It’s only from that place of freedom and unapologetic, no-bullshit, self-expression that you can create what Jennifer Boykin calls your beautiful immortal work and live a meaningful life.

When we surrender to the circumstances we’ve been fighting, they lose all of their power over us. But we have to be careful not to confuse surrender with resignation or apathy. When we surrender, all of our actions come from a place of peace and abundance. When desperately we fight a circumstance, we do so with the frenetic energy of chaos and scarcity.

A few days ago I was in a meeting with my content strategist. We were looking at book sales for [An Audience of One](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733), and I saw that we’d sold roughly 50 copies over the course of the week. That wasn’t going to put me on any bestseller list, or make my publisher salivate. But it made me recognize the importance of playing the long game. It was my moment of surrender. With surrender, I found clarity. I asked him what small things we could do to move the needle, and all of the following ideas came to surface:

* Change the copy on the home page and feature someone’s Amazon review

* Create a new graphic with all the pictures readers had posted on Instagram and use it in our newsletter.
> # ***A focus on progress gives you power. A focus on perfection disempowers you. When we’re obsessed with perfection, we overlook progress and fail to appreciate our accomplishments.***

If I were only satisfied when I sold 10,000 copies of my book, I would have completely disregarded and not appreciated the fact that I had crossed the threshold of my first 1000 copies.

It’s likely we can find everything we crave from some external source within ourselves. However, it requires inner work. We can’t order it on Amazon Prime and have it show up at our doorstep the day after tomorrow. The hedonic treadmill is necessary for economic sustainability. If everybody woke up one day and decided they were enough, had enough, and didn’t need to buy anything else, the economy would collapse.

## When Things Don’t Go Your Way

Surrender doesn’t mean that you won’t ever be disappointed and that everything will go your way:

* Somebody will break your heart when you put it on the line . My sister had probably the most wise perspective on relationships I’d heard in ages. “Everybody is going to break up with you eventually until you meet the person you marry.”

* You might get fired from a job, but it could end up being the best thing that ever happened to you.

* A creative project might fail to live up to your expectations, but what you learn from it could be a profound personal growth experience.

If you choose to live a full-color, full contact, and fully self-expressed life, you’re going to have setbacks and disappointments. The only way to avoid disappointments is not to take any chances at all. That’s an incredibly limited way to live your life. As I said in [An Audience of One](https://www.amazon.com/Audience-One-Reclaiming-Creativity-Sake/dp/1101981733), “Your circumstances can give you colors to paint with.” It’s all material.

## Honor the Past

For most of us, when we think of a challenging experience from our past, whether it’s a relationship that didn’t work or a job that we got fired from, we focus on the negative and overlook the positive. We carry that energy with us into the future, and the future ends up looking like the past. But when we honor the past and take the most valuable lessons from it, and the power it has over us dissolves.

One of the exercises in a book I was reading was to write something great about every person who broke up with you. But you don’t just have to apply this to intimate relationships. It can be applied to just about anything. When you do that you see that often people give you many amazing gifts despite the pain they might have caused you. As Dani Shapiro wrote in Still Writing, the blessing is next to the wound.

* If weren’t for the bosses who fired me, I might not be an author today

* One girl I dated taught me how to cook, another to dress better, and so on. It didn’t work out. But it didn’t mean there wasn’t a positive gain from it either.

* A few weeks ago my business partner Brian Koehn and I decided it was time for us to part ways. But we both agreed ending our friendship would be a much higher cost than ending our partnership. He kept us from going out of business in 2014, helped turn our business around, and because he’s left it’s forced me to step into the role of CEO finally.

When you let go of the resentment you feel towards a person who hurt you and forgive them or make peace with a difficult experience from your past, it loses its power over your and more importantly over your future. When you accept your setbacks, they become an opportunity to turn endings into new beginnings.

As somebody who has dealt with cycles of depression, I’m hyper-aware of the fact that this is easier said than done, particularly when you’ve just come out the other side or are still braving the wilderness. Here are some things that I’ve found to be helpful to both honor and let go of the past.

* **Gratitude**: While gratitude doesn’t magically solve problems, it is a subtle energetic shift that can also begin to shift your mood. When you practice gratitude, you become aware of all the great things in your life you usually take for granted.

* **Upgrade Your Environment:** Nothing has a more profound impact on your behavior and your emotions than your environments. While you don’t have to burn everything from your past in a blazing inferno (although that can be fun), you want the environment to be representative of who you’re becoming, your next chapter, not your previous one. This alone can have a dramatic impact in making you feel better. [My conversation with Jim Bunch](https://unmistakablecreative.com/podcast/the-9-environments-that-make-up-your-life-with-jim-bunch/) goes into extensive detail about the role of environments.

* **Go to Therapy**: I think everyone should see a therapist at least once. A therapist is like a trainer, but for your brain instead of your body. They raise your awareness of patterns in your life. And they’re objective. You can tell them anything without any shame or fear of how you’ll be judged.

* **Self Care:** Do something nice for yourself to close a chapter of your life and start a new one. Upgrading your environment is a form of self-care. Exercise, travel and new hobbies can all be forms of self-care.

* **Perspective:** The other night I took a Lyft from Denver to Boulder. My driver was from Congo. He told me about the civil war, corruption, and poverty in Congo. Then I asked him about his work schedule. He drove for 10 hours each day or until he earned $200.00. It was 1 am when he dropped me off, and I asked him if I was his last ride of the day. He said that he planned to keep driving. When I heard his story, suddenly all the things I was feeling stressed about didn’t seem to matter all that much. Who would have guessed that my Lyft driver would become a spiritual teacher?

**When we honor the past, we create an open space for the future. When we cling to the past, we’re likely to repeat it.**

## Honor What Could Be and Embrace Uncertainty

There are many things I thought would have happened in my life by the time I turned 40: marriage, family, etc. And they haven’t. For the first time in my life, I’m being forced to accept that kids might not be in my future. There are three potential scenarios for every life circumstance:

* **The way we thought it would be**

* **The way it currently is**

* **The way it could be**

When the way it currently is isn’t the way we thought it would be, we’re shut off to the possibility how it could be. We are effectively trying to turn the past into the present.

Honoring what could be means honoring uncertainty. And for most of us, uncertainty causes fear, anxiety, and a projection of worst case scenarios. But as [Michelle Florendo](https://twitter.com/WhatIfYouCouldB) said on a recent episode of Unmistakable Creative, what we overlook when it comes to uncertainty is the amazing things that could also happen.

## The Divine Order of the Universe
> If you’re feeling behind the eight ball and you’re thinking you should have the bestseller or the marriage, or why did that happen, or why’d you get fired, if you’re in a dark place, just take one grain of what I’m saying now. Just believe me for a nanosecond, that really, there is a divine order to things. Every single disappointment and I’ve had some significant ones. Every failure, every heartbreak, everything that I went after so, you know, vigorously that didn’t turn out, thank God. I was spared some kinds of destiny. I just have a deeper level of trust now. Doesn’t mean it’s easy all the time. Doesn’t mean I don’t want what I want.” — [Danielle LaPorte](https://medium.com/@DanielleLaPorte)

There seems to be divine order to the events of the universe:

* Every loss becomes an opening for a gain

* Every setback becomes an opportunity for a comeback

But embracing the divine order of the Universe requires faith in forces beyond our control. It’s difficult to see the good that will come from something terrible in the moment that it happens. It’s often something that we only recognize in retrospect :

* I thought not getting a job offer from Intuit after my summer internship and graduating into the great recession was the worst thing that could happen to me career-wise. But it turned out to be the catalyst for starting what eventually became the Unmistakable Creative Podcast.

* In 2013, I was laid off from a freelance writing gig. The woman I reported to said I was outgrowing the role. Shortly after that, I self-published The Art of Being Unmistakable, which became a Wall-Street Journal best-seller, and eventually led to a book deal to write [An Audience of One: Reclaiming Creativity for Its Own Sake](https://amzn.to/2KwnEPS), and [Unmistakable: Why Only is Better than Best.](https://amzn.to/297YjPz)

Thanks to the divine order of the Universe, I was spared working at a job I probably would have hated, and spared writing about subjects I didn’t care

Surrender goes counter to nearly every one of our cultural instincts, in which we’re taught to, strive, hustle, grind, kick ass and take names. But when you surrender, the result is inspired action. It has a different kind of energy to it. What we know about energy is that like attracts like. Acting out of desperation results in more desperation. Acting out of inspiration results in more inspiration. The paradox of surrender is that it puts you in a position of power.

# The Mothers Of Reinvention

## 

*Originally published by [Christopher Lochhead](https://twitter.com/lochhead), host of the [Legends and Losers Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/legends-losers/id1204044507?mt=2), in his book, [Niche Down: How To Become Legendary By Being Different](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FLKJJQQ).*

Legendary category designers never stop reminding the world that they created the category. That they are the standard by which all others must be compared. And that they haven’t stopped looking at the original problem from new angles.

Take the story of GOJO Industries. You might not know this privately held company’s name, but you’ll recognize the name of its most famous product.

In 1997, GOJO, with [its introduction of the consumer edition of Purell](https://www.gojo.com/en/About-GOJO/History)[20](ms-local-stream://EpubReader_F0600BEEAE08433DBE12AF2C04A8B28A/Content/OEBPS/Niche_Down-7.xhtml#footnote-021), convinced millions of parents and germaphobes that we should use “hand sanitizer” before and after we touch anything. Refuse to do so at your own peril!

In 1996, none of us even knew we *needed* hand sanitizer.

Today, millions of people carry the stuff with them everywhere.

Hospitals and doctors’ offices worship it via dispensers hanging on the walls. You can find bottles scattered on hotel check-in counters and at the start of restaurant and cruise-ship buffet lines.

It’s even tough to make it through boot camp without being exposed to the brand: the military is a huge customer.

At its height, [Purell owned](https://www.ohio.com/akron/business/purell-brand-handed-back-to-akron-s-gojo)[21](ms-local-stream://EpubReader_F0600BEEAE08433DBE12AF2C04A8B28A/Content/OEBPS/Niche_Down-7.xhtml#footnote-020) an estimated 70 percent of the hand-sanitizer-market category. (There was a brief change in ownership, but that’s a story for another book.) Its name is the one to beat for [mindshare](http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/how-purell-became-brand-thats-kept-our-flu-obsessed-fears-bay-170429/)[22](ms-local-stream://EpubReader_F0600BEEAE08433DBE12AF2C04A8B28A/Content/OEBPS/Niche_Down-7.xhtml#footnote-019). The brand that all other hand sanitizers are compared to.

**There’s a corollary: The bigger and more urgent the problem, the more time and money people will invest to solve it.**

You don’t want to be walking around with unsanitary hands now, do you?

The “overnight” success story behind Purell maker GOJO actually began almost 40 years earlier, in World War II-era Akron, Ohio, with a simple problem identified by tire factory worker Goldie Lippman — it was super difficult to get carcinogenic substances like graphite, carbon and tar off her hands with regular bar soap after a production shift.

You had to use benzene, which was irritating. Women, in particular, were interested in an alternative[23](ms-local-stream://EpubReader_F0600BEEAE08433DBE12AF2C04A8B28A/Content/OEBPS/Niche_Down-7.xhtml#footnote-018) because who wants red, smelly hands?

That problem inspired Goldie’s husband Jerry, who invented a formulation that was less harsh and that was delivered in liquid form. The two entrepreneurs mixed up the product using a washing machine and packaged the soap in pickle jars pilfered from local restaurants.

Yes friends, GOJO (the company’s name is a mash-up of the founders’ first names) was also the designer of the “liquid-hand-soap” category! Before GOJO, most individuals used “bar soap” to scrub their hands, faces, feet, clothes.

And the venture also came up with a way of controlling portions, so that it was more cost-effective for business owners to buy the product.

Today, more than 70 years later, GOJO’s identity is still synonymous with the hygienic benefits of keeping your hands clean.

That’s true in large part because it has never stopped thinking about the original problem and new ways of addressing it. “You don’t go up against the giants unless you have a category-defining brand,” GOJO’s current CEO, Joe Kanfer, (the Lippmans’s nephew) told *The New Yorker[*24](ms-local-stream://EpubReader_F0600BEEAE08433DBE12AF2C04A8B28A/Content/OEBPS/Niche_Down-7.xhtml#footnote-017)* *for a corporate profile published in 2013.

Where do entrepreneurial epiphanies come from?

The corollary to the Einstein observation that opens this chapter is this second life lesson from the legendary physicist:
> # **“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”**

For a sense of what that means, let’s peek inside the weird* (we love weird!) brain of Sara Blakely, the former fax-machine salesperson who founded Spanx and who became the youngest [self-made billionaire](https://www.forbes.com/self-made-women/#2f9c3a9c6d96)[25](ms-local-stream://EpubReader_F0600BEEAE08433DBE12AF2C04A8B28A/Content/OEBPS/Niche_Down-7.xhtml#footnote-016) of any gender in the United States at age 41.

All because she turned her personal clothing habit — cutting the feet out of her pantyhose — into a wildly successful new undergarment category.

Sara worked on her idea for two years (while still selling fax machines and spending more than $5,000 of her savings on research) before she would discuss it with anyone.

That’s partly because she was afraid her family and friends would try to talk her out of it and partly because she wanted to make sure she could defend it unequivocally and enthusiastically when she got around to blabbing about it.

It’s a superstitious habit she still embraces today.

And it’s not because she is afraid of failure.

As a child, Sara’s father would be disappointed if she and her brother couldn’t name at least one thing they had flopped at weekly. She would literally get a high five for falling flat on her face, literally or figuratively.

“Failure for me didn’t become about the outcome, it became about not trying,” Blakely told serial entrepreneur and angel investor [James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/02/sara-blakely/) on his podcast.[26](ms-local-stream://EpubReader_F0600BEEAE08433DBE12AF2C04A8B28A/Content/OEBPS/Niche_Down-7.xhtml#footnote-015) (A note from Heather: Run, don’t walk, to find headphones and listen to this interview. And then listen again. Actually, don’t bother with the headphones, everyone should hear it!)

Sara knew that she wasn’t the only woman frustrated with the problem of getting pants and skirts and dresses to hang “just so” without bulges or clings or whatever. She envisioned her new undergarment as the “invisible canvas” upon which great designs could be displayed.

She didn’t need fashion or retail or business experience to tell her that, which is good, because this former stand-up comedian and saleswoman didn’t have any.

“What you don’t know can be your greatest asset if you let it,” she observed during the podcast. “So if you’re sitting there right now in your life, and you have an idea or you imagine a different life for yourself, but you’re like ‘I didn’t go to school for it’ or ‘I don’t have any contacts in this’ or ‘I don’t have money to do this’ — those things, if you allow them to, could become your competitive edge. They could be what gives you the opportunity to do something amazing. If you don’t know how it’s supposed to be done, then it’s pretty likely you’re going to do it differently.”

What she did have, in spades, was persistence and an infectious enthusiasm for her idea. Sara’s a missionary, not a mercenary. Category designers are on a mission to solve a problem, to get the world out to be different and to make a difference. They are possessed. They would crawl through glass to make it happen.

And, they recruit others in their mission.

Sara’s enthusiasm stuck with the mill operator who handed Sara her first big production deal. It also won over the skeptical Neiman-Marcus buyer who followed the eager entrepreneur into the ladies’ restroom for an impromptu, visual demonstration of how Spanx works. Won over in 10 minutes, that buyer subsequently placed orders enough for a trial in seven stores.

Almost 18 years later, Sara spends an hour every weekday letting her mind wander during her morning commute. Even though she lives just five minutes away from the Spanx headquarters, she leaves an hour early. Behind the wheel, she records random thoughts and questions that pop into her head. Her running list of ideas is more than 50 pages long.

That’s single-spaced.

Here’s Blakely’s view on perpetual ideation, as told to James Altucher:

“As far as products go, I look at everything, and I like to ask why. You could look at the table sitting in between us and ask, ‘Who invented the table? How interesting. And, who is the first person who did that? What were they thinking? Is that that right way it should still be created? When’s the last time tables changed? And, Is there a better way?’

“I find things really interesting. Like the men’s undershirt. The undershirt is part of the reason I went into men’s Spanx,” Blakely told Altucher.

The men’s line wasn’t the result of some overwrought business plan or months of focus groups. Blakely just wondered: When was the last time someone actually thought to redesign the simple cotton T-shirt hiding under a men’s dress shirt? And then she empowered her team to answer that question. “I operate very much from gut and very much from product. If I can create a product that is going to change lives or make your life better or be a better option, that is where I get my energy. And, I let the rest work itself out.”

# 21 Beautiful Quotes on Embracing The Present Moment

### 3. You Don’t Feel Anxiety in the Present Moment

# When should I quit my day job to pursue my dream?

## 

**I tell budding entrepreneurs that in my opinion, the right time to leave is when your side venture produces as much income as your day job.** In reality, it’s not that straight forward. It depends on what you’re trying to build and the capital (human and financial) you have behind it.

That being said, it would be wise for you to build up and set aside 6-months cash as a personal emergency fund. Let me say that again, as a PERSONAL emergency fund — not for business. **In today’s world, you (and more importantly, your family) should have a lifeline as you scale that mountain.**

![](1*1QqakzX6XJVCo-79N5Ysyg.jpeg)

## Believe me, I know all the stories…

**Entrepreneurs who risked everything and when they were down to their last dollar they were somehow able to save the day.** In fact, two of my five tech startups were like that. Still, what percent are able to pull a rabbit out of the hat? The odds are only a fraction of any wager you could possibly make in Las Vegas. You might as well lay everything down on the pass line in craps and go for that 7 using dice loaded against it. Is it possible? YES! Should you count on it? NO!

![](1*zhWmzwkf40QAEL-VhnRX3Q.jpeg)

I can just see it now, “In just 4 hours at night I make half of what I do at my day job… I think it’s time to quit.” **Who wouldn’t want to leave their “job” to pursue their “dream?”** Let’s see… job vs dream? Hmmmm. Unfortunately, it’s a fallacy to assume that more time will produce more revenue. What if you dedicate 12 hours a day and make the same amount because the market isn’t quite ready or what you think it is? Timing is huge and if you’re not careful it will be a sobering lesson.

## I’m not here to throw water on your entrepreneurial fire.

**Go ahead and lead with your heart but keep your head involved.** My Dad once told me of a miner who sunk a test shaft in search of precious metals. As he went along, he took samples. When he got the results back, he found that there was a high concentration of gold. So, he went all in but the thing went bust. Why? Because he only took a sample when he saw color in the soil!

![](1*7om8eRsr8lIYJo16PvPXaQ.jpeg)

Would my younger self have waited for the “right” time?… I would hope so but perhaps not. I’m sorry to say but many entrepreneurs are not only fearless but also bullheaded. Still, you don’t have to rely on “dumb luck.” Make it happen but be smart along the way.

## If you want to win the day **one of the most important things you can do is learn to problem solve.**

Don’t be discouraged by obstacles. See them for what they are… opportunities to learn. Take the time to think your way through and then take a step. Continue doing so until you navigate your way around (or over or under) whatever it is. Eventually, you’ll realize that obstacles are your ally — a barrier for you is a barrier for others. Without barriers, others can easily follow your example and potentially win the day.

## Today’s takeaways:

1. **Get a mentor (or two) or do what I did and take smart, been-there, done-that people to lunch on a regular basis.** Who doesn’t want a free lunch? Use each lunch to explore the most important thing you’re working on. Tell the person everything you know about that one thing and then LISTEN to what they have to say. Remember, you’re there to get counsel, not sell!

1. **There is always a way. **Once, I really wanted to talk with this guy but he was too busy (scheduled several weeks out). All he had open was a single lunch appointment but he lived in another state. So, I set up the lunch, contacted his admin, found out what restaurant he liked, called that restaurant and had them deliver his favorite dish. Then, we chatted over Skype while eating. He was so impressed that he made a few phone calls on my behalf and the door that I was having difficulty opening was all-of-a-sudden open. Imagine that (and all for the cost of a $35 lunch, including gratuity)!

## As a side note…

**Entrepreneurship is like women and child bearing**… “the excitement of first learning you’re pregnant, the challenges and complications that follow, finally, the birth of a beautiful baby.” For serial entrepreneurs, I would add “time passes, memory fades, and you want to do it again. It’s not long, however, before you may say, ‘what was I thinking?’ 🙂”

## The Function that Produces Whatever You Want

In order to find our mission, we first have to adopt a mindset of complete personal agency. Personal agency means we accept full responsibility for ourselves — everything we do, consume, act on, or fail to act on. As we’ve no doubt noticed, there are many people who go through life unwilling to accept full personal agency.

For those seeking meaning, this is unacceptable. When we accept that we do have power over many things in our lives, it helps spotlight the absurdity of our past excuses. It makes our past selves look weak, which only proves how much better we’re becoming. If we’re going to continue to stay in a state of becoming, we must continually create and ship updated versions of ourselves.

A quick warning: full personal agency is not to be confused with irrationality or hubris. There are, and always will be, things outside of our immediate control. This collection of things and random events can be summed up as fate, or randomness. Fate and randomness will occasionally rear their head.

The person who accepts personal agency despite this truth is brave. With every challenge randomness throws our way, we can be sure that it contains a lesson. Oftentimes, it contains an advantage that is only visible to the person who is seeking full agency. Fully accepting personal agency is a practice which takes years to master, but once we do, we wield a power that looks mystical to those who bow their head to fate.

Either we go all in on personal agency or we don’t. Either we spend our life finding excuses, people, and institutions to blame, or we’ll figure how to master everything life throws our way. Either we’re waiting for a handout, the lotto, the stars to align, or a fully functioning business to fall in our laps, or we’re busy creating our lives.

I’ll admit that I had a natural aversion to this philosophy for a long time. The truth is, it takes a certain level of courage and faith to accept our own agency. But once we accept that we have control over our lives, we become free. We’re free to pursue and achieve our dreams. We’re free to create a legacy for ourselves and our families. We’re blessed with the joys which come from achieving things we formerly thought impossible.

The best foundation to build full personal agency is through first mastering our health. By optimizing our health, we are in the best position to mitigate what fate throws at us.

The level of our own health sets the stage for every future thought, conversation, relationship, skill, and achievement. We’re figuratively putting the oxygen mask on our face and breathing in deeply before we attempt to save anyone else.

When we take full personal agency in our lives, we can’t help but create the type of lives other people view as “lucky.” “Luck” is just an explanation for day in and day out preparation. Luck is the word the entrepreneur uses when he/she knows most people aren’t interested in listening to the 12-hour back-story describing their success. The person that takes full personal agency of themselves, and masters their health, can’t help but find their mission.

### The Function of You

The most valuable mindset which accompanies personal agency is recognizing that we are each a function.

In math, a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs. When we view what we’re trying to achieve as simply as a function, the process of getting there becomes demystified. Everything we allow into our lives, our bodies, and our relationships is an input. It is all directly responsible for the resulting outputs we experience in our lives. If we want to change our outputs, or what we create, we only have to properly value and filter the inputs.

The first part of creating a great function is deciphering and planning for the exact output we want. This output can change many times, but it’s important to have a direction and aim. We can work towards something temporarily and decide it’s not for us, or keep pushing forward to find out if it is. The point is we need an output which we are trying to create. That output could be a new skill, healed relationship, mastery of our health, six-pack abs, starting a business — whatever we want. The idea is to select outputs large enough that we become motivated to find the inputs needed to create them. The function mindset asks us to think global and act local.

Having an output we want to create helps us get in motion. Once we are in motion, it becomes increasingly easy to identify and pick out the inputs we need and adjust them accordingly.

Right now, the outputs we’ve created in our life are from what we’ve consumed. We are a function which has created what we’ve taken in. We are the food we eat. We are the people we hang out with. We are what we read. We become what we think about. Everything we’ve been able to produce, or have failed to produce, is a result of our inputs. If we don’t take proper care to monitor and adjust our inputs accordingly, we will fail. So how do we know what inputs we should be taking in?

In order to get the output we want, we simply need to find people who have created that circumstance. Analyze them and find out how they created what it is we value. Be sure to check and make sure they aren’t suffering from a bunch of maladies or side effects from creating what we want. Then, if we do not find any negative side effects, we study the type of inputs they used to get there. They’ve likely read hundreds of books. Can we find out which ones, and then read them ourselves? They probably exercise; what kinds of workouts do they do? If they look healthy, what is their diet like? Who do they spend time with? Who did they start their business with?

When we know the outcomes we want to create, there are only two broad categories of inputs we interact with. Those two types of inputs are ones which help us, and ones which don’t help us create the outputs we want. If any inputs fall into a seemingly grey area, be wary of them.

The foundation of everything we do starts with preventative health. Our society places an absurdly small value on the preventative medicines of diet, exercise, and sleep, yet these are the actions which produce the greatest benefits. By focusing on health first, we boost every interaction we have with others. When every interaction with others becomes better, we can’t help but continually move our lives forward. When we shield ourselves from dangerous inputs and continually make small experiments to improve our health, our entire lives can be transformed. We regain control of our brains and we boost our willpower. This practice pays dividends for the rest of our lives.

For instance, consider something small such as eliminating soda from your diet and drinking more water. This begins to bring our body’s pH levels to a normalized state. It stops destroying our body’s resistance to insulin. The lack of sugar (assuming we cut it other places as well) allows the inflammation it’s caused in our brains to heal. We then begin to reduce our risk for diabetes, Alzheimer’s, depression, and a whole host of other maladies. We start to win back control of our brains, which then influences everything else. You might be thinking this sounds a bit extreme, but it’s not. This simple act of cutting sugar from our diet can mean the difference between 60 more years of life with a healthy brain, or a slow decline into dementia. We are a function of what we consume.

When we break down our health into a function mentality where we put in inputs and produce outputs, it becomes easy to know where we’re heading. There aren’t any secrets about what we’re going to achieve.

There are two types of inputs: raw materials (food) and sensory inputs (media, books, music, etc). These inputs help us either produce or fail to produce our outputs (grit, imagination, skills, health, wealth). By becoming obsessed with the raw materials we consume, we give ourselves energy for the necessary actions and willpower needed to produce outputs we want. Now, we need only to figure out the outputs we want to create, then find and consume the right inputs.

> # “The man on top of the mountain didn’t fall there.” –Vince Lombardi

## Inputs, Outputs, and Emulation

The function mentality is simple, yet challenging to implement daily. The first step we can take towards successfully executing on the function mindset is to become certain about the outputs we want to create.
> # “A man’s worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions.” –Marcus Aurelius

We can start by listing the outcomes we want for ourselves. These could be health, satisfaction (more than money), developing the ability to do the type of work we love, being promoted, owning our own business, becoming a multi-millionaire, building an amazing family, or a combination of the above. The point is to get very specific about what we are creating. When we’re hyper specific about what we want to create, it becomes easy to find others who have created those things. When we find those creators, we can then discover and study their inputs and actions. After we identify these, it’s only a matter of consistently executing on those inputs and actions. Our minds need specificity. Our faith in where we’re headed needs to be kindled by proof that it’s possible. So let’s get started by listing the outcomes (outputs) of a function we want to create:
> 1.
> 2.
> 3.
> 4.
> 5.

Now, who has created these outputs in their personal lives?
> 1.
> 2.
> 3.
> 4.
> 5.

What are some of the inputs, mindsets, and actions they cite or have pursued (sometimes behind the scenes) in order to create what they have?
> 1.
> 2.
> 3.
> 4.
> 5.

If this process sounds simple, it’s because it is. The thing about simple processes is that most people won’t follow through with them. Aspiring to greatness requires courage, faith, and exposing ourselves to failure. The people who start this process but don’t finish are those who worry too much about failure instead of worrying about what it would be like if they never tried.

The lesser portions of our ego can trick us into thinking that finding someone to emulate means we’re not good enough. This type of thinking is poisonous. Don’t let it stop you from finding outcomes and emulating successful people.

The type of people who view intelligence and capacities as fixed are toxic. In the book, *Mindset*, Dr. Carol Dweck discovered a simple difference between those who achieve what they want, and those who do not. The difference between the two types of people was that one group saw their abilities as fixed. They bought into the concept that our brains and capacities remain the same, and we can’t change them. These types of people (surprise!) never changed in life. The type of people Dr. Dweck found who were high achievers had a mindset of growth. They saw their abilities, brains, and bodies as malleable functions they could control. They naturally achieved what they wanted.

Those with fixed mindsets never try and never learn. Those with growth-oriented mindsets sometimes have hubris and unwarranted confidence, and sometimes they under- or over-shoot, but because they get started, they’re guaranteed to learn. Those with a growth mindset are bodies in motion, and once bodies are in motion, it’s much easier to change direction and adjust course.

### Caveats on Finding Those to Emulate

I understand the objections some people have with these ideas. They don’t want to be exactly like the person they’re emulating; they have their own talents and ideas. But finding a person to emulate isn’t about becoming exactly like them. It’s not being slavish or a copycat. Finding a person to emulate for the outcomes they’ve produced is the best way we can discover ourselves. It tests us strictly and guides us on a path which has worked before. It’s through getting started that we’ll discover what feels authentic to us, and what does not. It’s when we mix emulation with thoughtfulness that we find originality.

Once we find a person or group of people who have produced what we want, we can then determine if they’ve been able to maintain the other parts of life we value. So maybe they have made a million dollars, but at the expense of their relationships. Their grown kids won’t talk to them and their girlfriends have orders of protection against them. Is that what we want?

Hopefully the answer is no, so we go on to the next person. Maybe we can find someone who has had more modest business success, but maintained their relationships and health, or someone who is building their wealth at a sustainable pace. We can continually sift through those we want to emulate until we’re left with people who have produced what we want and haven’t sold their souls in the process. Once we find these people, we can further sift through this group to identify people who came from similar backgrounds as us. For instance, if our parents got divorced when we were in our teens and we can find somebody to emulate whose parents also got divorced in their teens, that person’s experiences and inputs will likely be much more contextually relevant to us.

So the process of finding the type of outputs we want to create starts like this:

* Start exploring different outputs we may want.

* Make sure we have a solid “why” for each output we want to create. If our “why” is big enough, we’ll be much more inclined to figure out the “how.”

* Find several people who have produced outputs similar to what we want; these are potentially people we want to emulate.

* Use due diligence to try and figure out how they’ve been able to achieve what they have. Have they sacrificed certain areas of life along the way? Have they maintained balance? This due diligence exists to make sure we’re emulating those who have produced the outputs we want in a healthy way.

* Filter out those who have produced the outputs we want and have remained great people while doing so.

* Filter out those people again to find those with backgrounds most like our own. The more similar their backgrounds are to our own, the higher the probability that the inputs which mattered to them will be contextually relevant to us.

The list we’re left with is where we can start searching for the exact inputs and actions they’ve used to get the outcomes we want to achieve.

We don’t have to contact these people directly, but the people we’re left with are our ideal “digital mentors.” If these people have a presence online, it will be much easier to decipher their inputs and actions. Study their backgrounds. The more closely your background and character traits match up with those you’re emulating, the easier it will be to relate.

The more similarities we can find between their early life and our own, the better. Maybe they were an only child, or they lived in a house packed with brothers and sisters. Maybe they went to college and found it vital, or maybe they dropped out of school. Once we learn these facts, study them even further to find their interests, habits, addictions, or weaknesses. When we get that specific, we will have found someone worth emulating, and the perfect digital mentor.

It’s in this pursuit that we have a high chance of stumbling over opportunities in our own lives which are unique to our circumstances.

No matter what stage of life we’re in, there are people who have the health, wealth, and wisdom we want. This is the first time in history where many of these people are sharing their experiences and knowledge online. Many people want in-person mentors, and in-person mentors can definitely be helpful. But if we can expand our minds from demanding in-person mentors to learning to emulate the best via digital mentors, we expand our horizons. We are now able to receive virtual/digital mentorship from the best outcome producers in the world.

Now that we have an idea about the outcomes we want to create, we can dive into more of the inputs needed to get there.

# How To Recruit And Retain A Team That’s More Qualified Than You

## 

Recruiting is hard, even for hugely profitable companies whose offices look like *MTV Cribs* mansions and who offer free perks like multi-course lunches, yoga, and all-hands happy hours.

For startups, it’s even harder. You have to make your first hires pre-traction, pre-revenue, maybe even pre-product — and definitely “pre-perks.” How are you supposed to compete for the best talent?
> **I’ve experienced the struggle first hand.**

During our time building a gaming studio that was acquired by Glu Mobile, my co-founder Alex and I have grown our team from just the two of us to about 30 people. We’ve spent a lot of time on recruiting great employees. But, we’ve still had plenty of HR misses, and we’ve learned some invaluable lessons, too, about retaining top talent.

Here are a few of the most impactful.

## **On Recruiting Pre-Traction**

* ***You don’t need top talent to get initial traction.* **While everyone wants to have a dream team from the get-go, the reality is you don’t need the best engineers or designers to get your first 1000 users. There are plenty of ways you can build your first prototype, whether that’s do-it-yourself, hacking existing components, or hiring contractors — which is what companies like Uber did early on.

* ***Having a working product with traction makes recruiting 10X easier.* **This is the classic chicken-and-egg problem of startup recruiting. A lot of people you meet are on the fence and say they’ll join, but *only* once you have traction. So that’s what you should focus on first. Don’t stress about landing the “top candidates” day one (unless you have strong pre-existing relationships with them). Instead, prioritize building a product that you can sell to your customers. As it happens, that’s also what you’ll use to sell your new hires.

## **On Sourcing and Outreach**

* ***Overcome impostor syndrome.*** Here’s the truth: you’re likely not the leading industry expert in your field. When Alex and I launched Dairy Free Games, we had only made one successful mobile game before, and it was a super simple one. Who were we to launch our own gaming studio? This, ultimately, was an insecurity we just needed to overcome. See, it’s easy to let impostor syndrome get in your head and make you feel embarrassed about messaging people more experienced than you. But it’s imperative you resist that impulse. After all, everyone has to at one point or another. And to actualize your ambitions for your company, you’ll need great people–-expert engineers, designers, etc.

* ***Add a personal touch when reaching out.** *It may seem obvious, but you’d be surprised how many recruiters simply spam the same message to 10,000 developers. When you’re building out your initial team, don’t fall into that trap. Be personal. Make references to past experiences, specific technologies, etc. This will set you apart.

* ***Cold call messages should come from founders.*** We’ve A/B tested this, and it makes a huge difference. You’ll get at least 2X higher response rates. No one wants to talk to a middle man — sometimes not even a recruiter or project manager.

## **On Interviewing and Closing**

* ***Be less polished and more real.* **Think about how Donald Trump or other populist politicians have gotten elected. It’s usually not through some corporate doublespeak. It’s a matter of being “real.” People gravitate toward authenticity. The same is true of applicants in the interviewing process. So, be honest about your current state of affairs. Detail what’s working well, along with what processes you’re struggling with. Disarming honesty beats bragging and peacocking every time.

* ***Good storytelling is essential.* **The interview is not the time for you to simply re-articulate job description bullet points the candidates already know. It’s a time to see if there’s a connection and cultural similarity. It’s also a time to win the candidate over. You want the candidate to feel a certain excitement about your mission, culture, and goals. At Dairy Free Games, we’d always tell people a story of how working in gaming is the opposite of working at an enterprise software factory. Much of the time, it worked.

* ***Feel out the candidate in a casual setting.** *Once they’ve passed the hard skills portion of the interview, invite the candidate back for lunch, dinner, or drinks with you and others on the team. This will give you a chance to see how they fit and interact with your employees, and it’ll also allow you to close in a less formal environment, which is often more effective.

* ***For people on the fence, suggest a part-time contracting or consulting arrangement**. *It’s likely that your top candidates will already have a highly valued position at a top firm. Many, however, have a certain amount freedom to help in some part-time capacity. This gives both sides opportunity to feel things out. And it’s a better alternative than making a final judgment about a candidate or opportunity when one of you isn’t 100% certain whether you’re making the right call.

## **On Retaining**

* ***The best hires are the ones most likely to trigger a team’s immune response. ***Scott Belsky writes about this in [*The Messy Middle](https://www.amazon.com/Messy-Middle-Finding-Through-Hardest/dp/0735218072/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)*: every team has an immune system. When foreign bodies enter, it’s the immune system’s job to respond and neutralize potential threats. Sometimes, though, it responds a bit too hastily — especially in response to new key hires who will have a lot of responsibility that will impact others on the team. Be aware in advance of the potential for this kind of internal scrutiny — and sometimes animosity — toward top new hires, and work around it by giving new hires tasks with tangible and immediate impact on day one. This will help establish their usefulness and the reason they’ve been brought on board.

* ***Understand and accommodate desire for growth. ***Understand where each new hire’s passions lie, and where they see themselves in 5 years. One of the top reasons talented employees quit is they don’t see opportunity for personal growth.

At the end of the day, your company will prove the sum of its parts. It’s critical that you approach the process of finding and keeping those parts seriously — without ego — and with careful preparation.

What you don’t need, thankfully, is free yoga. Focus instead on the things that matter.

# How to Read 50 Books Per Year Without Really Trying (Even If You’re a Super Slow Reader)

## Image source
> “Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them.” ― Lemony Snicket

I wasn’t much of a book lover in my teenage and college years, but in my early twenties I became a voracious reader. As my writing and film career began to grow, I found myself busier than ever, but I’ve continued to read ~50 books per year for nearly a decade. And I’m not a fast reader: the average American reads 250–400 words per minute (WPM) and I’m on the low end.
> # Thankfully, reading 50 books per year really isn’t that difficult, even if you’re a slow reader like myself. **All it takes is a little discipline and a few quick environmental tweaks.**

But first, a math equation:

```
50 books x 50,000 words/book = 2.5 million words

2.5 million words / 250 WPM = 10,000 minutes

10,000 minutes / 60 each hour = 167 hours

167 hours / 365 days = 27.5 minutes per day
```


So that’s it. You need to invest just 27.5 minutes per day in order to read 50 books per year. For those who read 400 WPM, you could read 80 books per year without breaking a sweat. Here’s how I do it:

## 1. FIND the Time

Non-fiction books are the perfect fit for “Found Time,” because they’re typically broken down into independent sections. I’ve found that you can easily reclaim 27.5 minutes per day from lost time alone.

### Toilet Time

Yes, we went right there. Imagine for a moment you had two full weeks to go on a reading holiday. Just imagine how many books you’d get through. Well, your bathroom invites you to do just that — the typical American male spends 14 days per year on the can. While you definitely don’t want to sit on the toilet for any longer than necessary — Brits spend an average of 3 hours and 9 minutes on the loo each week —there’s really no point to staring at your shower curtain when you could, say, meditate [on the shortness of life](https://amzn.to/2obkicf) with Seneca or discover the absolutely epic escapee slave [Josiah Henson](https://amzn.to/2o9uS3A). (I often read while brushing my teeth, too— not only do a learn something interesting, but I typically spend far more time brushing.)

PLEASE: Only engage in bathroom reading with books you own. Your fellow library patrons thank you.

### Driving Time

Whoever invented the audiobook should be knighted and sainted immediately. Billions of hours of commuting are now potentially being less-wasted as people consume something deeper than talk radio. For long trips and book tours I stock up on novels, but when I’m home I tend to pick out non-fiction books that I can enjoy in between meetings and groceries runs, or even simply when I’m stuck at a traffic light.

### Down Time

Working out? Audiobooks
Running/hiking/jogging? Audiobooks
Walking the dog? Audiobooks
Cooking dinner? Audiobooks
Vacuuming/dusting/sweeping/mopping/doing dishes? Audiobooks

NOTE: Ignore this section if you can spend that time building a relationship with a friend or family member over these activities. Alternately, you can use this time to listen to a book together and discuss it afterward.

### **Waiting Time**

[Teddy Roosevelt](https://amzn.to/2PGPGfA) wrote 47 books, hundreds of articles, and more than 150,000 letters in his lifetime, despite spending the majority of his adult life in elected office. How? He picked up the fragments of time — little minute gaps in his packed schedule — to pen a few words here and a sentence or two there. Over the decades, it led to a world-improving body of work.

I keep two physical books in my car and never go into a store without one. While everyone else is texting in the grocery line, I’m reading the [Analects by Confucius](https://amzn.to/2LsvZo4) or [The Peloponnesian War by Thucydides](https://amzn.to/2PGzieU) (a personal favorite of Roosevelt’s.)

I also keep several books within arm’s reach in my office, too. Waiting for that file to upload on email? Read a few stanzas of the [man considered to be Machiavelli’s superior](https://amzn.to/2ocinnT). Waiting for everyone else to join that conference call? Meditate on an anecdote from [Mastery](https://amzn.to/2PFH5ty).

## 2. MAKE the Time

I find that fiction is far more difficult to dip in and out of, so you’ll need to carve a slice of dedicated reading time if you want to fully engage with the characters and plot. Thankfully, you likely have lots of time to spare: The average single American spends 600+ hours on social media and 1600+ hours watching TV/Netflix/etc per year — enough to over ***600*** books per year. (Or just, you know, Montaigne’s colossal [Essays](https://amzn.to/2oe6nSW).) Ditch the screen and re-invest the time:

* Substitute one show for one fiction book series

* Substitute an hour on social media for [the lessons of history](https://amzn.to/2PHrM3B). (possibly the best one-hour swap you’ll make in your entire life.)

* Substitute a weekly movie for a two-hour biography session

* The most important habit: [read in bed every single night](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/the-pleasure-of-reading-together-in-bed/). It’s [really good for you](https://www.lifehack.org/371544/these-6-amazing-things-will-happen-you-read-before-bed-2), and it’s a huge part of how I take in 20,000+ pages each year.

HACK: Don’t like craning your neck? Buy a pair of [periscope glasses](https://amzn.to/2NiaW9O). (It’s the best $12 I’ve ever spent.)

## 3. Change the Environment

If you want to become a prolific reader, you have to create an atmosphere of reading. Like [Ben Hardy](https://www.benjaminhardy.com/home-page) so rightly says “[willpower doesn’t work.](https://amzn.to/2ocZilD)” You must engineer your environment for success.

So: Leave books EVERYWHERE, like an Easter egg hunt. I keep multiple books in all sorts of places:

* in the bathroom

* in the car

* by my bedside

* by my clothes drawers

* in my backpack

* on my desk

* in every other room of the house

PRO TIP: Leave multiple books in each location. At least one fiction and two non-fiction in different genres. This way way you leave no room for excuses, and can grab whichever suits your current mood.

Go crazy with this idea. Friends who visit should find books in the most random of places. The garage, the laundry room, your dining tent, your apartment balcony.

Be intentional. Books are the first thing I see when I wake up in the morning. Books are always within arm’s reach of my desk and car. Books are the last thing I see before I turn out the light. It’s created a culture of reading in our home. **Do the same and you’ll find it nearly impossible *not* to read 50+ books each year.**

# If You Want What No One Else Has, You Must Do What No One Else Does

## If You Want What No One Else Has, You Must Do What No One Else Does

### “Discipline Equals Freedom.” -Jocko Willink

**What are you willing to do to get what you want?**

For most people: not much.

It costs too much suffering; too much pain, too much time. They underestimate their own capacity and mistakenly they believe they barely have enough energy as it is.

The truth is, you *can* have whatever you want —[ if you do whatever it takes](https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/you-can-have-whatever-you-want-if-you-do-whatever-it-takes-e8eaf22efdc6).

* You can become 100% financially independent.

* You can be extremely healthy, fit, and strong.

* You can consistently wake up at 5AM.

* You can earn 6 and 7-figures while working for yourself.

* You can have great relationships.

* You can go back to school and become a chef at a 5-star restaurant.

But these goals have a price tag. And, to be frank,** most people start making excuses when they see the price.**

I want an extraordinary life, a life most people have **no idea** how to get. Here are a few of my goals:

* A 6-figure annual income from passive income alone

* 100% financial independence

* Earn 7-figure annual income from real estate ownership

* An incredibly intimate and fulfilling marriage

* To be surrounded by my best friends all the time

* To be my own boss for the rest of my life

Who do you know who has this life? Frankly, I’ve never met anyone with this resume yet.

Sadly, most people will never achieve more than a few of their biggest goals. This is because **they are not willing to do what most people won’t do.**

In the words of best-selling author and entrepreneur Darren Hardy:
> # “Successful people do what unsuccessful people are unwilling to do.”

**If you want the life no one around you has, then you’ve got to start doing many things they’ve never done. **You need to do what most people are unwilling to do.

That’s the only way you’re going to achieve the goals everyone’s told you are impossible.

## Your Tolerance For Suffering Determines How Successful You’ll Be
> “I’m not the strongest. I’m not the fastest. But I’m really good at suffering.”
> -Amelia Boone, 3-time World’s Toughest Mudder champion

**How much are you willing to suffer to achieve your goal?**

World-renowned marketer Seth Godin once wrote, “*The difference between a mediocre club player and a regional champion isn’t inborn talent — it’s the ability to push through the moments where it’s just easier to quit.*”

The difference between who you are now and who you could become is largely determined by your ability to push through the moments where everyone else quits.

It’s far easier to keep going if you predetermine how long you’ll keep going.

Ultramarathon runner Dick Collins was once asked how he keeps going for so long:
> # “Decide before the race the conditions that will cause you to stop and drop out. You don’t want be out there saying, ‘Well gee, my leg hurts, I’m a little dehydrated, I’m sleepy, I’m tired, and it’s cold and windy.’ And talk yourself into quitting. If you are making a decision based on how you feel in that moment, you will probably make the wrong decision.”

You can increase your tolerance for suffering (and thus your capacity for success) if you predetermine how far you’re willing to go.

In his autobiography, Steve Martin wrote he gave himself until age 30 to make it as a comedian. He had done hundreds of small shows with little results, but he had committed to keep trying until his 30th birthday.

Your enormous success depends on your endurance to suffer when no one else will. You can increase your capacity to suffer until the end by deciding beforehand, “**I will not quit no matter what until these conditions**.”

## [Consistency Beats Talent, Luck, Good Intentions, and Even Quality](https://medium.com/@anthony_moore/consistency-beats-talent-luck-good-intentions-and-even-quality-66ba255aa4f7)
> “Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educatedderelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
> The slogan ‘Press On’ has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.” -Calvin Coolidge

Most people think achieving truly big goals are only possible for “special” people. People with inborn talent the rest of us weren’t given.

But consistency trumps talent.

Consistency beats luck.

Consistency even beats quality.

I’ll tell you right now, I’m not the best writer on the Internet. There are writers *way* more talented than me. The editors of *The New York Times* and *Business Insider* are old family friends of theirs. They have a sexier profile picture. They’re funnier, do better research, and have bigger followings.

But I can suffer, consistently. I can be consistent when they’re not. I can blog for 4.5 years and after 54 months with nothing to show for it, post another article. (Almost all of my 23,000+ email subscribers came in the past 8 months).

**It’s human nature to want to quit when it gets hard.** Everything is hard before it’s easy; most people quit when everyone else does.

But your tolerance for suffering and ability to be consistent determines how successful you’ll be. I don’t know a single one of my old writer friends who are still publishing. They don’t spend any time building up their ability to suffer.

In the words of motivational speaker Jim Rohn:
> # “It is human tendency to blame someone or something else for our lack of progress.”

For almost everyone, it’s easier to blame others for failure than suffer through it by taking responsibility.

If you want enormous, incredible success that you (and anyone around you) have never had, then build up your tolerance for suffering and rely on your consistency.

It determines precisely how far you’ll go.
> “Repetition can be boring or tedious — which is why so few people ever master anything.” -Hal Elrod, [The Miracle Morning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979019710/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0979019710&linkCode=as2&tag=anthonymoore2-20&linkId=7332f42cd37434f963b4232b9bbf43ce)

## Most People Don’t Eat Veggies, Pray, Wake Up Early, or Say “Thank You”
> “If your body is sick, if you are around negative people who bring you down, and if spiritually you haven’t developed a sense of gratitude and surrender, you will have less chances of success.”
> -James Altucher, best-selling author

Frankly — if you want to be successful, you shouldn’t listen to most people.

Many people who believe they’re “healthy” are simply aligned with the majority of a very unhealthy society. Not good.

**This is why I almost never take advice from anyone. **Most people aren’t healthy, fit, fulfilled, happy, rested, focused, or excited about their life. Author Darren Hardy once wrote, “*Never ask advice of someone with whom you wouldn’t want to trade places.*”

The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services [recently announced](https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html) by 2030, half of Americans are on track to be not just overweight, but **obese**.

They went on:

* Only **1 in 20 people **exercise more than 30 minutes a day

* 40% of the entire diet of 2 to 18-year olds is from empty calories — soda, pizza, ice cream, etc.

* The total number of fast food restaurants have **doubled** since the 1970’s

* The majority of Americans don’t eat enough vegetables, fruits, or whole-grains to be considered “healthy”

![Photo by [Patrick Fore](https://unsplash.com/@patrickian4?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](0*J5OCYu2y_I0p5V_i)*Photo by [Patrick Fore](https://unsplash.com/@patrickian4?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)*

This is just one of many studies that say the same thing — **most people aren’t living a healthy life.**

This reaches beyond nutrition and exercise, too. The National Science Foundation (NSF) recently [asked 1,500 people](https://spectator.org/59230_loneliness-american-society/) how many friends they had that they could talk with about their personal troubles or triumphs.

1 in 4 said they had **no one** to talk with. That number doubled when they took out family members.

Two thirds of Americans say they’ve [lost more than 90%](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3379362/New-study-reveals-two-thirds-Americans-lost-90-cent-pals-course-decade-romantic-relationships-blame.html) of the friends they had 10 years ago. Many Americans can only claim to have [2 close friends](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/04/close-friends-americans-two_n_1077129.html) — maybe less.

Mindfulness, meditation, and gratitude are key components to achieving a successful life. In his book *Tools of Titans*, Tim Ferriss remarked that among the 200+ high-achieving athletes, actors, comedians, politicians, chefs, writers, ultramarathon runners, CEOs, and entrepreneurs interviewees for the book, **80% said they had some form of daily mindfulness of meditation practice.**

Long ago, a wise man once said:
> # “It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.”

Do you exercise regularly?

Do you have a daily meditation ritual?

Do you eat healthy?

Why not?

## In Conclusion

“Discipline equals freedom.”

The above quote from Jocko Willink, the most decorated Navy SEAL in history, means the more disciplined you are — with your health, sleep, relationships, quality of work, etc. — the more freedom you’ll experience.

Freedom is the ultimate goal. Freedom of your time. Freedom to travel the world. To make your own hours. To spend your day how you want.

Most people will never experience this freedom, because they will not discipline themselves.

They will not choose how far they will go before quitting; they’ll just quit when it’s hard.

They will not increase their capacity for suffering.

They will continue to do only what “everyone else” is doing.

**If you want what no one else has, you must do what no one else does.**

If you want to change the future, you need to change the cause — you.

Do what no one else does, and you’ll get what no one else has.

# Why You Want To Hear “You Have Too Much Time On Your Hands”

## 

Most people believe they want to hear certain phrases from a boss or coworker.

* *“You did a great job!”*

* *“You’re so detail-oriented.”*

* *“You’re a really hard worker.”*

Those affirmations are certainly positive, but they’ve become so commonplace that they’re thrown around without much thought. In business development meetings, for example, people always say “great meeting” at the end of it — even if the meeting was nothing out of the ordinary. There’s no incentive to say anything *but* “great meeting.”

Baseline compliments are nice to receive, but oftentimes, they’re just what people say out of habit.

### Yet the one phrase you *do* really want to hear is, “You have too much time on your hands.”

Or similarly, “I don’t know how you find the time.”

People have told me some version of that throughout my career, and for the longest time, I viewed it as a negative remark. It’s only in the past five years or so that I’ve had time to think about why that statement isn’t quite as negative as I originally thought.

Here’s why you should seek this praise and take it as a great compliment:

## **Causing someone to say, “You have too much time on your hands,” actually tells you that you’re on the right track.**

I used to think of this as a backhanded compliment. It was as though my work, because it may not have been strictly related to my job, was frivolous and I should probably be [working harder](https://www.themuse.com/advice/why-working-too-much-can-hurt-your-performance).

Now, I take it to mean I’ve surprised them in some way.

When someone tells you that you have too much time on your hands, they don’t mean, “Great job working so hard.” It’s more like you’ve performed some sort of magic trick: all your work is getting done, but you’ve also been able to add something extra. You did something fun that interests you or worked on a project outside the scope of your responsibilities.
> # You’ve come up with something people didn’t expect.

It might be novel, useful, or charming in some way — and no one knows how you were able to pull it off.

## **Having extra time is different than working efficiently or clocking crazy hours.**

Personally, I’ve always been interested in graphics, and I enjoy creating cartoons and illustrations in my spare time. I’ve been “playing” with the Adobe suite of Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign for over 15 years.

Over time, I ended up creating a little book of cartoons that I give out when fundraising for [The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://engage.fredhutch.org/site/TR/Climb/FredHutchinsonCancerResearchCenter?px=1677111&pg=personal&fr_id=1670).

That’s the type of project or interest that surprises people — one that isn’t related strictly to work. Because if it were, you’d simply be another hard worker.

### When you have too much time on your hands, you’re bringing in your *outside* passions or hobbies into your job in a way that’s unique.

Just remember, you have to already be a [high-performer at work](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-ways-to-tell-whether-youre-a-high-performer-or-a-workaholic) to pull this off.

If you’re not extremely competent at work, but you show up with a book of comics that you’ve clearly spent hours on, your manager will probably say something more along the lines of, “You’re about to have even more time on your hands — because you’re fired.”

## **Unlike most career success, you can’t create a definite plan for this type of achievement.**

Once you begin planning out how to do something fun and interesting for yourself, you lose what makes it special in the first place.

You don’t want to be organizing time in your calendar under the header, “Work on Creative Thing to Amaze Others: 3:45–4:15 p.m.” Think of it more as an evolution of your natural interests and hobbies. By cultivating them, you’ll eventually be able to merge them with your work in a way that stands out.

You have to explore your passions and interests.

The other reason not to plan out integrating your personal projects with your job is that you shouldn’t be doing this in order to get credit or recognition. It should be something that springs naturally from the combination of your interests and your work.

Because there’s another dimension to going above and beyond — and it’s not something you necessarily want to be known for.

## **You have to be careful of the social issues that come with overachieving.**

This is different than overachieving and stepping on people’s toes.

In general, overachievers are not super popular people. Back when I was in high school, I had a literature class with a teacher who was notorious as a difficult grader. We had to keep a reading journal, and coincidentally, it was the dawn of the Apple II computers. I used the graphic typesetting application on the computer to produce an incredibly over-the-top version of my journal for *To Kill a Mockingbird*. When I got my grade, it was an AAA — essentially two extra A’s in the grade book.

**Suddenly, the bar had been raised for achievement.** As you can imagine, the rest of the class didn’t exactly find that endearing, and they *never* let me forget it.

The point is, you have to pay attention to your social surroundings so that you don’t come off the wrong way.
> # If you start doing other people’s jobs, your co-workers are going to resent that.

Having too much time is something completely different. You’re connecting the dots of your life into something new, unique, and useful. If it derives from your passions (and you really are having fun sharing it) people will feel that.

Aim for that surprise. That’s what makes people wonder where you find the time.

# Why Job Seekers Get Ghosted, And What They Can Do To Stop It

## Why Job Seekers Get Ghosted, And What They Can Do To Stop It

### If you’ve been ghosted, you’ve been deprioritized. Here’s how to fix it.

***By [Shireen Jaffer](https://medium.com/@shireenjaffer), co-founder and CEO of Edvo***
> # *While being ghosted is never a good feeling, you’re not at a loss. If you still feel like a job is the right opportunity for you, ask yourself, “How can I become a priority again?”*

The digital age has introduced new, and often painful, ways of ending relationships.

None of them are more hurtful than “ [ghosting](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/smarter-living/why-people-ghost-and-how-to-get-over-it.html).” For those of you who are fortunate to not have been ghosted before, being ghosted simply means that someone has stopped responding to all communication.

And sadly, this disappearing act isn’t only happening to those dating. Candidates on [the job hunt](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-job-hunt-remains-struggle-for-college-grads-2019-6) are just as much at risk of being ghosted by recruiters.

Being ghosted when you’re applying for a job doesn’t mean sending in an application and never hearing back-that happens to everyone. It means you applied, assumed the interview went well, and expected to hear good news soon.

And then, nothing.

No next steps, no calls, no emails. Just dead silence in response to your follow-ups.

Candidates can easily spend [six months on the job search](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/why-recruiting-needs-to-change/), and being ghosted when you thought you had a promising lead can be devastating. As rough as the experience feels, just know that it may not be your fault. And if it is, there are always actions you can take to make sure it doesn’t happen again.

Here’s why you may be getting ghosted and how you can reconnect with recruiters:
> # The most common reason job candidates get ghosted is also the one they have the least control over: a company simply changes focus.

Now, it’s also possible the candidate has done something that resulted in ghosting.

## If you’ve been ghosted, you’ve been deprioritized.

While being ghosted is never a good feeling, you’re not at a loss. If you still feel like a job is the right opportunity for you, ask yourself, “How can I become a priority again?”

Making your candidacy top-of-mind means following a few simple steps:

## 1. Focus on thoughtful follow-up.

Hands down, the best thing you can do is to follow up.

Send one email per week for at least three weeks. Be thoughtful in your correspondence and continue to express your interest in the company and the role. Be specific. Study trends in the industry and reference your research when you correspond with your contact. Offer thoughtful discourse that continues to show them that you can walk in and begin contributing immediately. Most people don’t ignore that type of follow-up.

And even if they tell you it’s not the [right fit](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/role-fit-vs-culture-fit-whats-more-important-when-looking-for-a-job/), at least you received a final answer and can move on.

## 2. Connect through different channels.

It’s completely acceptable to reach out through different channels if you’re not getting any emails back.

Try sending a polite LinkedIn message along the lines of, “Hey, I really enjoyed our conversation last week and would like to chat about next steps.” Just don’t bombard the same person through every channel you find. One follow-up on a different channel is enough.

## 3. Reach out to build other relationships.

If you notice the job posting has been taken down, that’s a pretty clear sign the role has been filled. If it’s still up, then it may be worth reaching out to another recruiter at the company or even the hiring manager.

This is really about showing your interest and building another relationship with someone internally. But don’t be surprised if the recruiter you spoke to is very much still active. In that case, at least you know that the interview didn’t go as well as you thought and you need to pursue other options.

## If you’re consistently being ghosted by companies, you need to find out why.

Sometimes, candidates get ghosted because the recruiter isn’t doing a great job or priorities change.

But if you’re being ghosted over and over, then it’s time to reflect on your own actions and figure out what you may be doing wrong. For instance, candidates often don’t know what skills and metrics the company is actually looking for, and without doing effective research to find out, candidates end up not [speaking the same “language”](https://www.minutesmagazine.com/3-ways-to-stay-competitive-in-todays-workforce/) as the recruiter.

Unfortunately, recruiters aren’t incentivized to give candidates feedback about where they messed up. It’s not part of their job. That’s why personalized feedback is at the core of what we do at [Edvo](https://www.edvo.com/). If you’re being ghosted consistently, then you may need personalized feedback from a trusted source. Having someone on the inside to look at your follow-ups or hold a mock interview with you can go a long way.

Being ghosted is an emotional experience, whether it’s done by a love interest or a potential employer. But you don’t have to let it define you. Figure out why it’s happening, make whatever changes you can, ask for help, and put yourself back out there.

With a little introspection and perseverance, you’ll find the right long-term match.

It all started when she and her sister were creating phrases to put on custom made t-shirts. From there, she started to see how she could use words to convey ideas and messages. After that, she became fascinated by using words (and all forms of media) to present and sell ideas.

# Life by Design&#58; Practical Steps You Need to Take to do Your Own Personal Life Audit

## Photo by Julia Caesar on Unsplash

What life do you want? In 5, 10, 40 years?

Can you honestly answer that?
> *This logic is undeniable: only change causes change.*

Most people never give themselves the opportunity to step back and see where they are in life.

We get so busy, sometimes we forget to pause, and reflect on our week, month or year.

Clayton M. Christensen, writes in his book, [How Will You Measure Your Life](https://amzn.to/2AIY1ff):
> “In your life, there are going to be constant demands for your time and attention. How are you going to decide which of those demands gets resources? The trap many people fall into is to allocate their time to whoever screams loudest, and their talent to whatever offers them the fastest reward. That’s a dangerous way to build a strategy.”

Life audit is a fundamental part of assessing how far you’ve come, where you want to go, what you should stop doing, and everything you should keep doing to become a better version of yourself.

It’s a self-reflection exercise. An audit will leave you with the clarity and space you need to “do you” at the ultimate level.

Alicia at [Lifehacker](https://twocents.lifehacker.com/perform-a-life-audit-to-set-yourself-up-for-success-in-1821648221) explains:

*….a life audit is all about organizing your life and being honest with yourself:*

* *First, write down every goal, great hope, and life necessity on a different post-it note (i.e., get a new job, win an award, live near the ocean).*

* *Second, organize the post-its by category (i.e., health, family, career, etc.) as themes start to emerge.*

* *Third, organize by time (i.e., how long it will take to accomplish/check-off each post-it).*

## When life is audited, performance improves

What’s most interesting /important to you right now and are you working towards that?

Set up a regular time to engage in a life audit.

Reexamine your goals in life as needed, and refocus where necessary.

Add a recurring weekly/monthly audit to your calendar, and start reflecting on your weekly actions.

Ask yourself these questions:

What went right? Wrong? What can I do better?

You don’t even have to spent an hour auditing yourself.

You can quickly assess how you performed each week or month, with questions like:

How is this helping me achieve my goals?

What am I gaining by having this on my to-do list? Could I achieve the same gains another way?

What would I lose by taking this off my list? Do those things play a large role in me achieving my long-term goal?

Did I consume more than I create?

How about my time management? How did my screetime affect my productivity?

If you are future-focused, this is a helpful reminder to look back, even for a few minutes, and think about how far you’ve come and what you need to do to be better, and smarter in the future.

Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping.

It’s a better approach to redefine personal progress.

Auditing yourself can help you sustain a ruthless level of prioritization and focus every week.

It’s a practical way to achieve meaningful progress.

Tracking improves everything.

Analysis of work and life brings ideas for progress.

Many people are held back because they simply don’t know how to improve.

They aren’t tracking their life enough!

The more you track, the more you know about your situation, your behavior, and your projected future.

You can even track bad behaviors, and habits.

An unhealthy behavior is something that, if unchecked, could possibly spiral out of control and negatively affect your life or derail your purpose and plans.

## Your input predicts your output

Everything you allow into your life through all your senses — **input** — is processed as **output** that creates your results.

If you expect a different output, start analysing your inputs.

Measure your current inputs.

If you are not satisfied with your current output and your results, including your beliefs and your mindset, pay close attention to everything you spend time doing.

Most information is time-consuming, negative, and irrelevant to your goals and dreams.

Don’t do the same thing over and over again, and expect different results.

Deliberate lifestyle design is based on massive consistent action — output.

Increased output necessitates decreased worthless input.

In the current age of distraction, input sources make an even bigger difference (positive or negative) in your performance at work and your overall well-being.

## Live the 80/20 lifestyle

Eighty percent of your outcomes in most things you do come from twenty percent of your inputs.

As Pareto demonstrated with his research, this “rule” holds true, in a very rough sense, to an 80/20 ratio.

At a micro level just by looking at your daily habits you can find plenty of examples where the 80/20 Rule applies.

20% of the people who are close to you influence 80% of your attitute and perception and either propel you forward or limit your abilty to deliver and make the progress you deserve.

In business, 80% of profits come from 20% of customers and 20% of products.

The important thing to understand is that in your life there are certain activities you do (your 20 percent) that account for the majority (your 80 percent) of your happiness and outputs.

Some of your time spent working inefficiently provide very little benefit.

When you start to analyse and breakdown your life into elements it’s very easy to see 80/20 ratios all over the place.

The message is simple — focus on activities that produce the best outcomes for you.

The key to making the 80/20 principle work for you is focus.

In every area of your life you can work out the few things that are really important to you and the few methods that give you what you want.

There are lots of simple, painless ways to start this “stripping back” process so that you can begin applying the 80/20 Principle and reaping the practical benefits in your everyday life.

## Actionable steps

Take a moment every month (if you can’t commit to weekly audits) to review all your input sources — including all types of media you consume.

Do your input choices really reflect your goals, dreams, desires, and values?

What input do you need to *decrease* or *omit* in your life right now?

What input do you need to *increase* or *improve* in your life?

What can you achieve in the next few months?

What is your long-term goal?

What can you do today — or every single day going forward to get you closer to your life purpose?

You are probably due for input adjustment.

If you keep doing what you’re doing now but want different results, you’re never going to have anything different than what you’ve already got.

If you’re dreaming big, it’s time to start auditing your actions, and how you live each day.

# How To Spend Your Working Day Wisely And Actually Get Things Done

## “A hand holding a tiny white alarm clock” by Lukas Blazek on Unsplash

Time doesn’t discriminate.

The CEO of a Fortune 500 company with an overloaded schedule and a college graduate [procrastinating ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2018/05/18/how-to-conquer-procrastination/#18a1b01254c6)about starting a business each get 168 hours per week to spend as they see fit.

Some people are able to accomplish a lot from Monday to Friday (or to Sunday if you count weekends) while others struggle to get much done at all.

So what’s the best way to spend your time wisely and divide the working day so you can achieve what you want? And how do other [successful people](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2018/05/15/margin-of-safety/#169103605947) spend their 168 hours every week?

### By Habit
> # *“Don’t expect to be motivated every day to get out there and make things happen. You won’t be. Don’t count on motivation. Count on discipline.” — Jocko Willink*

Author, former Navy seal and podcaster Jocko Willink gets up every morning about 4:30 a.m. to exercise intensely before working on his business or the most important task for the day.

On Instagram, he posts black-and-white photographs of his wristwatch displaying his rising time. Willink also posts black-and-white photographs of “the aftermath” of his workout, for example a sweat-drenched towel or a barbell. Typically, the photo captions tell his many thousands of followers to “Get after it.”

Willink has cultivated a habit of rising early. Although getting up at 04:30 is an extreme rising time, you can still cultivate a habit of getting up early and working on your most important task for the day each day.

Then, like pennies filling a jar, these early mornings will accumulate over time!

### By Energy Level
> # *“By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” — Benjamin Franklin*

American founding father, inventor and writer Benjamin Franklin wrote about personal development long before Tony Robbins or Jim Rohn.

In his autobiography, Franklin described how he got maximum value from a regular working day.

Like our favorite Navy seal, Franklin rose about 05:00 a.m. and worked on what he valued most first thing. Typically he started each day by asking himself, “What good shall I do this day?”

Then Franklin attended to his business before starting work. He spent his afternoons reading,looking over his accounts and dining.

In the late evening, Franklin put things back where they belonged and reviewed how his day went. He also reflected on his accomplishments or failures.

In other words, Franklin understood when he had the energy for attending difficult tasks (morning), when he was best suited to administrative tasks (afternoon) and when his mind was geared toward reflection (before and after sleeping).

### By Theme
> # *“The great opportunities and great ideas…get crowded out because you say yes to too many things.” — Tim Ferriss*

A master of productivity, Tim Ferris is a believer in the power of deep work.

When in the midst of a project, such as writing a book, he sets rules for himself, whereby he goes on “no meeting diets,” or “no conference call diets” and so on and works instead on that one thing.

Thirty minutes into [this podcast episode](https://tim.blog/2017/12/03/the-answers-to-my-favorite-questions/), Ferriss explains, he avoids activities unrelated to his book project while focused on that project.

Although you might not be writing a book, you could still dedicate a single day or even an entire week to an important project or theme and say no to everything else, like Ferriss.

For example, you could spend Mondays on business planning, Tuesdays on customer research, Wednesdays on marketing and so on.

### Spend Your Week Wisely

The trick to effective [time management](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2018/06/14/effective-time-management/#5d45ece01938) is deciding how and when you’re going to spend your time rather than letting other people decide for you.

You could create a habit you stick to each day, use self-knowledge to decide when to work on what or plan your days and weeks by project.

After all, depending on your approach, 168 hours is more and less than you possibly need.

# On Making Change Happen&#58; 3 Simple Yet Powerful Steps

## On Making Change Happen: 3 Simple Yet Powerful Steps

*Have you ever had change knock on your door?*

*That’s when you know you’re faced with two choices: either you stay where you are (and risk frustration, stagnation, or worse… regret!) Or you take a chance on faith and decide to go for something new — even when the destination is yet to be determined.*

*My incredibly brave and big-hearted client Brianne from New York decided to go for the latter.*

*After 12 years of working in a corporate job she disliked, she made the decision to find and pursue her calling. Despite fear, self-doubt, and insecurity (as we all battle with!) — she decided to bet on and believe in herself.*

*Today, I invited her to share her story of change with you. As always, make sure to leave a note to this woman who, for sure, will impact this world for the better.*

*All yours Brianne…*

Let’s face it, change is tough.

It’s uncomfortable, inconvenient and just an all-around pain in the ass. No matter the magnitude of the change to be made, it never seems to get much easier.

I stayed at a job I hated, in an environment that I despised, for nearly 12 years. It took all that time, all that misery and stress, before I finally realized that I was not the victim, I was the architect — and as long as I kept making the same choices, nothing would ever change.

Eventually, I left that job. I finally managed to alter my mindset and start making different choices. It was not easy. I was plagued with fear, self-doubt, and insecurity. Panic attacks were frequent.

What ultimately helped me change was a process introduced to me by a mentor: awareness, acceptance, and action. I’ve applied this sequence to everything from major life changes like quitting my job, to smaller lifestyle shifts such as losing weight and altering my sleep schedule. While each struggle is different, the process for resolving each is exactly the same.

Here’s how it works:

## 1. Awareness

When faced with circumstances or a problem I wish to change, I need to first be aware that there is an issue which can or must be changed. I need to admit to myself that I am struggling and then work to see my part in the situation.

My former job is a perfect example. I complained, resented and whined through 12 years of circumstances I could have changed at any time. What kept me there was a combination of fear and denial; it was just too hard for me to look at things honestly. I blamed my employer for my misery, blind to the fact that it was up to me make a difference.

It’s not easy to admit defeat or acknowledge accountability for a difficult situation; it takes honesty and courage and sometimes a long bout of suffering before anything changes. But the day finally came when I was able to change my perspective, to admit that I had been acting terribly, and not taking responsibility for my own actions and behavior. That was the day my momentum changed and I started moving forward.

## 2. Acceptance

Practicing acceptance might seem like the easy part, yet I find this step to be the most difficult of all. It’s very easy to tell myself that I have accepted something, but saying I accept something doesn’t make it true. Words are meaningless if nothing is backing them up.

When I was still working at that old job, I spent plenty of time believing I was in the acceptance phase because I had already taken the step of recognizing my part in the problem. In reality, I was shaming myself about the years I had already spent staying put, and beating myself up for remaining someplace that brought me such unhappiness.

You see, if I claim to accept something, but I spend my time blaming and shaming myself, then I’m demonstrating that I don’t believe anything will ever change and that there’s nothing to be done. This is a clear sign that I am not in acceptance.

**The key is recognizing the consequences of my choices and make the best of them instead of fighting them. If I truly accept something, then I can clearly see the choices I have made and I have faith that there are different choices I can make in the future. I can be comfortable where I am in the process because I believe in my heart there is a better way and that I will get there when I’m ready.**

This place of acceptance is tricky because it involves being comfortable with the uncomfortable. While at my job I had to learn to embrace the discomfort of showing up on a daily basis, but once I did then it became so much easier. My days became more relaxed and happier because I wasn’t so consumed with the stress. I was free once I accepted the situation exactly as it was because it meant that I knew something else was possible.

In terms of making a change on a smaller scale to something like a bad habit, a handy trick I’ve found is embrace the discomfort even further and overindulge in the behavior involved. For instance, if I’m struggling to eat better, I then make a point of eating as badly as possible.

Sounds crazy right?

Let me explain. It’s really just another way of demonstrating belief that things can and will change. If I believe that in the future I can make healthy food choices then I might as well go ahead and eat way too much of the most delicious junk foods while I still can.

There really is too much of a good thing and not only will the payoff get smaller and smaller every time, it will also get boring. Eventually, the joy I get from indulging myself will become diminished to the point where it no longer justifies the discomfort of eating food that most likely makes me feel tired, slow and like my jeans are too tight. Once that happens, I will naturally become ready and willing to behave differently.

## 3. Action

Acceptance is demonstrated by action so it’s pretty easy to recognize this stage, it begins the moment I start making better choices and taking action. This phase is the sweet spot of the process and once I am in it, then I am well on my way to real change.

At this point, I’ve had time to get comfortable with exactly where I am, I’ve let go of shame and judgment, and I recognize that anything I do or don’t do, is entirely up to me. If I still find myself blaming and shaming then that means I have more work to do in the acceptance department, even if I’m starting to make act differently.

When I am able to stop pressuring and judging myself, I basically create the perfect breeding ground for activity. I naturally begin taking actions in support of my goals and change. I quit the job, eat better, move more; I do the things which express the experience of becoming aware and practicing acceptance.

The action part of this process can go on indefinitely; generally, for however long it takes me to feel satisfied and accomplished. It can absolutely turn into a total lifestyle change if that’s what I want, the choice is up to me.

## Allowing the Process to Work

These three steps are simple, but they are not necessarily easy. Making change happen can be some of the most difficult work, but it is never impossible.

I have found that by looking at a situation through the lens of this process, I am able to break anything down into manageable parts. I become less overwhelmed and gradually more at ease with myself and my circumstances; I become willing to open my hands and receive the next possible thing instead of clinging to the past.

Simply, I become capable of making change happen.

# 5 Instant Ways To Identify A Toxic Workplace During Your Interview

## 

With 2018 being more than halfway through, many people are thinking about [making a move](https://www.inc.com/amy-vetter/think-you-need-a-career-change-how-to-use-your-experience-to-pivot.html) in the job market. In addition to looking for more compensation, advancement opportunities or a change of place, job seekers these days are paying close attention to company culture — for good reason. No matter how great the title, the pay or the role, if a company’s culture is toxic, you will regret taking the job.

Cultures are all different, but in almost all cases a [great culture](https://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/how-to-build-a-great-company-culture-from-the-ground-up.html) is one where the company’s mission is reflected in the behaviors exhibited by employees day-to-day. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work with hundreds of businesses, and I have seen that too often reality falls short of public image. I even know of several examples where expectations set during the [interview process](https://www.inc.com/jim-haudan/the-8-best-interview-questions-you-could-ever-ask.html) were shattered the minute the employee started work.

Fortunately, it is possible to spot a toxic culture in advance and save yourself from a bad career move. Here are five signs that a prospective workplace might be toxic:

## **1. Reviews are inconsistent.**

Job sites like Glassdoor and Indeed collect and publish company reviews and rank companies by culture — but look for more than just high marks. Check for consistency in the pros and cons listed to get a feel for the culture. When you look at the cons, look for patterns — especially related to the behavior of the CEO and upper management. Gloss over personal complaints and watch for posts such as “The CEO doesn’t trust anyone,” or “Anyone here that speaks up is walked to the door.” If you read those comments again and again, run.

You might also see a string of consistently bad, detailed reviews followed by several glowing comments by people who can’t seem to come up with a con. This is a sign upper management has been posting comments to try to clean things up and is a major red flag.

## **2. Vision and core values are ‘wall art’.**

You want to work for a company with a clear mission and values. If the company doesn’t have any statement of this kind, that can spell trouble. But it’s also a concern when a company’s values are nothing but wall art. To find out if that’s the case, ask questions in your interview about values and mission.

Do people know what they are without looking them up? Does anyone mention the subject to you? Also ask if the company’s awards and recognition are based on values. Such questions can help you discover if you’re dealing with a company that says one thing and does another.

## **3. Feedback is not encouraged or even discouraged.**

Great companies regularly ask their employees for feedback — *and act on it* to make the company better. Look for how feedback is discussed in reviews and ask about it in your interviews. What are some examples of things the company has changed based on feedback? What do you think would happen if you e-mailed the CEO with a suggestion? Watching how interviewers respond to these questions in the first few seconds will give you the answer you need. If they struggle to reply, beware.

## **4. Transparency and trust are lacking.**

More and more information is public these days, and companies that share their ups and downs transparently are valued for getting their employees involved in understanding the goals and the mechanics of the business. Conversely, companies that keep everything under wraps are typically the ones where unpleasant surprises eventually emerge.

For example, I recently saw a company doing a press release about all its hiring plans and spinning a very positive story to its employees about growth; at the same time, it was conducting two rounds of layoffs. Employees quickly lost trust and defected.

Companies and managers that are tight-lipped about metrics and financials also tend to have the mentality that “it’s our money, not yours.” Wouldn’t you rather work at a company designed to benefit everyone?

## **5. Family has heavy hand in business.**

Ideally, there should be checks and balances in any business, and family enterprises can lack these. So, be careful. When a husband/wife team are at the top or an extended family is forming the leadership team, it can be hard for employees to debate or challenge decisions. Imagine trying to take a complaint about your boss to his wife, the CEO.

In many cases, if you are not part of the family, opportunities for advancement are limited. Since it’s possible to go to work for a family business unknowingly, do your research.

Working at a company with a toxic culture can make it miserable to get out of bed every day and go to work — and life is too short for that. So, take some time to do your homework on company culture before accepting any new role.

# Myths And Truths About Creativity And How to Unleash it in Life And at Work

## Myths And Truths About Creativity And How to Unleash it in Life And at Work

### Fact: You Too Are Perfectly Capable of Producing Creative Work
> ”It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.” — Albert Einstein

The concept of creativity can be wildly misunderstood.

Most people would not consider themselves *creative*. It is common belief that creativity is a combination of intellectual capacity and in-the-moment inspiration. Although there are some natural capacities prone to creative work, the broad assumptions behind the creative process need reframing.

***It took me a while to understand this.***

Growing up, I was not the creative one in a family of accomplished painters, architects and fashion designers. *That was creative stuff*, not what I did. However, in recent years I have discovered that creativity (and problem-solving, creativity’s close relative) is less about the crazy spark of inspiration and more about cultivating an interest you can get to love, setting the right creative processes, and a lot of perspiration.** With all my limitations, I have shown to myself that I can also *create *when I mix genuine interest, creative tools and consistency.**

This post is my modest contribution to the debate. We will be going through:

1. The popular myths and misconceptions,

1. The essential elements that need to be present for creativity to flow in our everyday life, based on scientific evidence, and

1. A series of simple — yet powerful — practices to unleash our natural creative output.

Let’s dive right in.

## **Myth #1: Creative People Produce Only High Quality All The Time**
> “Artists who create freely and correct later are productive. They are happy. And they are the people who have a body of work to show for their efforts. When we erase until the paper tears, or see our children doing this, we must halt the obsession. Perfectionism is not a quest for the best — it is the pursuit of the worst in ourselves, the part that tells us we will never be good enough. Perfection is egotism parading as virtue. Do not be fooled.” — Julia Cameron

**Let’s take William Shakespeare.** YouGov made an analysis on the popularity ratings of various Shakespeare’s plays, which you can check below.

Romeo and Juliet, for instance, has been read or seen by more than half of the British population. Most people consider that one of his greatest pieces. And yet, he was able to follow that up with Pericles, which most of you never heard of. Rightly so, as Pericles has a popularity reading of only 1%.

**Is expertise all there is to creativity?** Are creative people producing great quality all the time? Clearly not.
> You can be creative if you silence your inner censor, focusing on producing of a large body of work rather than perfection. Take risks, practice and commit to producing the right volume which ends up paying over time. Creativity is, in some way, a numbers game.

## **Myth #2: IQ Has a Significant Role in Creativity**

Beyond some basic intellectual ability, IQ has nothing to do with creativity. The studies by the Institute for Personality Assessment and Research, at UC Berkeley, conducted by[ Frank X Barron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Barron_(psychologist)) in the 50s and 60s, prove this.

Barron brought some of the most creative people of his generation to UC Berkeley and assessed their conditions and personality. He concluded that IQ wasn’t the special sauce of these creative geniuses. He described highly creative people as ‘*’both more primitive and more cultivated, more destructive, a lot madder and a lot saner than the average person’’*.
> What appeared as a consistent character trait in these studies was a 1) higher-than-average ego-strength, 2) a natural resistance to conformity and 3) a high capacity to take risks.

## **Myth #3: Creativity is Based on a Linear Process**
> “Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep” — Scott Adams

People driven by a natural resistance to conformity tend to show above-average *resilience*. This is important, for creativity is based on trial and error in the long run.

A well-known example is Thomas Edison. He made 1,000 failed attempts while inventing the lightbulb. When prompted about this fact, he said ***“I haven’t failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”***

Furthermore, a statistical analysis by [Professor Dean Keith Simonton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Simonton) found that **Thomas Edison had *more failures than anyone else in his generation***. And yet he also made the most revolutionary invention of his generation.

We cannot embrace a creative life and think of it as a linear process. It is the messiness that we must embrace. But are we bound by the statement ***“Creativity is what creative people do”**? o*r can we go further and determine a set of objective conditions that determine our ability to be creative?

Let’s take a look at the science behind the creative output.

## What Does Science Have to Say, Instead?

**The** **Componential Theory of Individual Creativity** determines that most humans with a basic capacity can produce moderately creative work in some domain, and that the environment determines the level and frequency of such output.

**According to this theory, it is the overlapping of three key elements that determine our basic ability to to produce creative work.**

Let’s take a closer look.

### 1. The Key Ingredient: Intrinsic Motivation, Our Internal Driver
> “One of the huge mistakes people make is that they try to force an interest on themselves.” — Jeff Bezos

Teresa Amabile, in her 1997 paper *“Motivating Creativity in Organisations”*, points our at the power of **Intrinsic Motivation**, the enjoyment and sense of challenge of their work independently of any external rewards, as a primary driver of creativity. **This is the classic *“loving what you do”*, reflected in [Michael Jordan’s *“love of the game”* contract clause](http://leadershipreverie.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-love-of-game-clause.html).**

### 2. The Supporting Substance: Developing an Expertise

Expertise is the combination of technical knowledge, memory and talent development. In its absence creativity does not exist, as we are not able to be creative on any random field we choose, but only in that one that we are very familiar with.

Expertise tends to be a longer-term consequence of Intrinsic Motivation. Expertise goes hand in hand with a sense of enjoyment for a particular activity, as people rarely deepen their knowledge in fields that they don’t enjoy spending their time on.

### 3. The Tools and Processes: The Creative Skills
> “Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson

**Welcome to the “how-to” section of today’s article.**

We will discuss how to implement an appropriate cognitive style and the adoption of practices and processes (Heuristics) for the exploration of new pathways.

There is plenty of research supporting that some simple strategies can, in fact, facilitate creativity and problem-solving:

1. Provided that new ideas are the result of creating new relationships between old concepts, then regularly **applying freewriting and other brainstorming techniques **can help us unleash different perspectives and drafting potential solutions for a problem, building those new relationships. For instance, try holding paper conversations about a problem with your imaginary mentor (i.e. discussing an issue with Steve Jobs or [your favourite CEO]. How would he solve this?); or write for 10 minutes about a topic you are struggling to find a solution for, starting from the facts you do know and challenging every assumption. See where that writing leads you.

1. **Embrace non-sense. The power of the *“what-if” *questioning to cancel your auto-limitations**. Ask yourself *“What if I knew the answer to this?”* *“What if I was not limited by [this or that] external factor? “What if I had all the money in the world, would I still do [this or that] job?”* *“What if my boss could not help me, how would I do this?”*

1. **Play the volume game to your advantage:** if creativity is about the volume of output and not about intellectual censorship, then** to come up with a good idea we need to discard 100 bad ideas first**. That is why I force myself to come up with a list of 10 solutions to a problem or an idea I may be working on as I journal every morning, no matter how absurd they are. Most days one or two of the lot are worth exploring.

1. **Use your subconscious process. **The classic *“genius idea in the shower” *is the result of a process, not a random event. When trying to create something or when tackling a problem, we will usually start with research and gathering of information, followed by the deep conscious work on the alternatives apparently available to us. But surely you will get to a place in which you are no longer progressing. At that point, take your attention off it completely, *even if it feels wrong to stop working on it*. Go for a walk, cook something, play with your kids. Anything works, just trust the process.** That is when the subconscious mind takes over, continuing to work on the issue in the background**. It will allow new relationships between the old ideas to develop in the back of your mind, and most often than not the solution will pop in your head without warning.

1. **The proverbial *“sleep on it”, ***a powerful variation of the subconscious mind technique. **Thomas Edison was famous for his short creative *“power naps”***. At some point during his day, while working on a problem, Edison would stop to take a nap. He placed a notebook and a pen close by, and sit on a chair or a sofa holding a handful of ball-bearings. He then would fall asleep for a few minutes, only to wake up when the ball-bearings in his hand spilt on the floor. Then, he would immediately pick up the notebook and write down whatever was in his mind at that moment, which usually helped him break through the problem at hand.

1. **Don’t cultivate skills only. Cultivate themes as well.** I first read about this in Josh Waitzkin’s book *“The Art of Learning”*. Waitzkin is the genius kid featured in the film* “Searching for Bobby Fischer”*, who after retiring as a chess player took on the martial art Tai Chi and went on to become World Champion from scratch. He now helps top finance professionals perform consistently at their peak ability. The basic concept here is that creativity is a theme and not only a set of skills. You can improve your ability to produce creative work by cultivating *a creative mindset* in all areas of your life, beyond working on the specific skills.
> If building a skill requires for us to progress from 1) conscious thinking to 2) proactive doing to 3) unconscious being, then complementing your skills training with the broader adoption of a theme aligned with your aspiration is a powerful way to internalize the process.

## We Are All Born Creative, But There is a Decision to Make

The key to leading a moderately creative life is not relying on your genius spark when it comes, or following a correctly ordered process. It is not aiming for top quality all the time, and it is most certainly not about having an IQ of 150.

To be creative, *we need to make a decision*. It won’t just happen to ourselves:

1. **We need to start with adopting the *mindset*:** anyone is capable of producing creative work. Hopefully, this article has shown you that you have the elements in you already. In addition to this, we can also cultivate creativity as a theme, and not only as a skill.

1. **And we need to follow with *action*:** devoting time to something that you love, a field in which you can develop expertise. Nurturing it by learning and experimenting with the right tools and processes.

You will reap the rewards if you *consistently* use the above and apply yourself to the production of volume, a large body of work in your field of interest. And remember, leave your inner censor at home while at it. He is the only one who believes you you cannot be a creative person.

# How To Reach Inbox Zero and Reclaim Your Productivity

## How To Reach Inbox Zero and Reclaim Your Productivity

### …and your sanity.

When was the last time your inbox was empty?

Sometimes I feel as if I spend the entire day just [answering emails](https://melodywilding.com/follow-this-3-step-strategy-to-reduce-email-stress/), without ever finding the time to get to more important projects and tasks.

When it comes to email, there’s an inherent pressure and urgency to the task. It’s easy to feel as if we should be constantly checking emails and responding quickly…or we risk the potential of being seen as lazy, unorganized, and unproductive.

When your inbox is clogged with hundreds of emails, it’s overwhelming to look at. We can easily feel panicked and not in control.
> # But in reality, it’s not about how many messages in your inbox that matters — *it’s how much of your own brain and mental energy is in that inbox*.

***That’s*** what is sabotaging your productivity.

Maximizing your potential requires [filtering out distractions](https://melodywilding.com/5-no-fail-ways-to-finally-start-your-next-big-project/) and controlling your environment in a way that energizes your focus and creativity.

**You** **control your inbox — don’t let it control you.**

Taking a proactive rather than a reactive approach can go a long way to helping you escape email jail. Here are a few tips for creating a healthier relationship with email.

### 1. Go on an inbox diet

Checking emails every 5, 10, or 15 minutes can seriously damper your ability to concentrate. Try adapting a strategy of checking emails twice per day: once in the morning and once towards the end of the day.

Setting a [policy](https://melodywilding.com/bringing-work-home-5-tips-to-keep-work-life-boundaries/) will allow you to be focused for longer periods of time. If it helps, find an accountability partner to help test-drive this practice.

### 2. Close your email client

Close your email app or browser until your scheduled email check-in times. Rest assured, the world won’t end if you don’t respond immediately. To help curb your [addiction](https://melodywilding.com/6-signs-obsession-productivity-hurting/), try turning off your Internet connection, which makes use of a psychological technique called a “commitment device”. If you’re a Gmail user, check out [Inbox Pause](http://inboxpause.com/), a Gmail extension that puts your emails on hold until you’re ready to receive them again.

### 3. Disable alerts & notifications

Turn off email sound effects and reminders. On your computer and smartphone, disable your bells, ringing, and vibrating alerts. These can be unnecessary distractions to remove your focus from the tasks at hand.

### 4. “Unsubscribe” often & liberally

When it comes to email and work productivity, less is more. Remember that time you signed up for a department store’s mailing list to get an extra 20% off? Eliminate newsletters and other mailings that you receive on a regular basis. Clear up space in your inbox by unsubscribing to anything you’re not reading or don’t intend to read. It’s easy to do and doesn’t take long, but it is well worth it.

To make uncluttering even simpler, try [Unroll.me](https://unroll.me/). It not only helps you unsubscribe from unwanted lists, it also rolls up all your subscriptions into a digest.

### 5. Make quick decisions

Every email requires action. A good rule of thumb: if the action can be completed within 5 minutes, do it then and there.

For example, if you need to decide on attending an event, make a quick judgment and respond with a simple yes or no. For other requests, consider how much time the task will take you. If it’s something that can be done in 5 minutes, get it out of the way. Be firm and stick to the guidelines you set for yourself.

If it’s a task you need to return to, make a decision to either:

1. File the email away in an appropriate folder

1. Print it out

1. Add to a to-do list.

Be sure to schedule a time when you will return to the task and process it.

Sometimes the hardest part about emptying your inbox is accepting that you have to[ say “no”](https://melodywilding.com/6-ways-you-can-stop-being-a-people-pleaser-that-dont-involve-shouting-no/) to requests and opportunities. Your time is limited and very valuable. Don’t spend it caught up living inside your inbox.

Taking a few small steps each day to hoist email from the driver’s seat will bring you that much closer to [working mindfully](https://medium.com/@melodywilding/how-to-make-vacation-mindset-last-all-year-long-5a2cd3b25eb5) and on your own terms.

# Spiderman Was Real&#58; And He Saved 75+ Lives During WWII

## Spiderman Was Real: And He Saved 75+ Lives During WWII

### On courage, integrity, and the ability to transport people in midair
> **“While everyone else will be taking life, I’ll be saving it”** — Hacksaw Ridge (Desmond Doss)

During World War II, a skinny, unassuming young man from Virginia single-handedly rescued over 75 wounded comrades from a 300-foot escarpment under furious enemy fire, with nothing but a knotted rope.

He was the real Spiderman.

His name was Desmond Doss.

In 2016, Desmond Doss was portrayed by Andrew Garfield in the critically acclaimed biographical war film, [*Hacksaw Ridge](https://amzn.to/2l8ulNJ)** (Garfield earlier played the lead role in “The Amazing Spiderman”).

But how did this blue-collar country kid save over 75 men under active enemy fire…without a single weapon?

And how does his story apply to *you*?

## 1. Do your duty
> **“It isn’t right that other men should fight and die, that I would just be sitting at home safe. I need to serve.” **— Hacksaw Ridge (Desmond Doss)

When America entered WWII, Doss had the opportunity to avoid the draft because he worked in a shipyard.

As an Adventist Christian who refused to kill, Doss knew he would face complications, misunderstandings, and trouble if he enlisted.

But he believed it was his duty to protect his country, so he refused his boss’s offer to get a pass, and volunteered anyway — as a combat medic.

## 2. Stay true to your faith
> **“Most of these men don’t believe the same way you do, but they believe so much in how much you believe.”** — Hacksaw Ridge (Capt. Glover)

Desmond Doss was raised a Seventh Day Adventist by his mother, a devout Christian. For his entire life, he practiced the principles with which he was raised, including:

1. **Helping others**: he used to walk miles out of his way to donate blood.

1. **Keeping the Sabbath**: Doss believed in practicing all of the Ten Commandments, and when he refused to work on the Sabbath, even during training, he was bullied for his convictions.

1. **And refusing to kill**: Doss believed so strongly in not taking human life, that he wouldn’t even *touch* a gun.

In short, Doss lived out his faith and beliefs with integrity. He didn’t dither or make compromises — he just walked the walk.

## 3. Stick to your (non) guns
> **“I don’t know how I’m going to live with myself if I don’t stay true to what I believe”** — Hacksaw Ridge (Desmond Doss)

Doss had two unusual convictions that made him stick out like a sore thumb in the barracks:

* First, he believed in keeping the Sabbath by going to church and not working on Saturdays.

* Second, he believed in the sanctity of human life and refused to hold a weapon — not even to clean it.

Doss’ superiors tried to make him compromise on his convictions by making it hard for him to go to church or trying to force him to hold a gun. He refused.

As a result, he was hated by both peers and authorities, who threw shoes at him, laughed at him, and tried to get him tossed out of the army on a Section 8 “mental incompetence” discharge.

Doss stuck it out, however, and later proved his worth on the battlefield, saving the lives of some of his former tormentors.

## 4. Don’t hold grudges
> **“Please, Lord, help me get one more!”** — Desmond Doss, while rescuing the wounded during the battle in Okinawa

Desmond Doss never returned insult for insult.

During the infamous battle on the Maeda Escarpment (aka “Hacksaw Ridge”) in Okinawa, Desmond stayed behind to save others when he was ordered to retreat.

He single-handedly rescued more than 75 wounded soldiers by dragging them away from enemy fire, tying them securely with a two-pronged knot he invented himself, and lowering them one by one to safety, three hundred and fifty feet below.

Some of the men he rescued were the very people who had made his life miserable during training.

In fact, Doss even treated *enemy *soldiers.

After the heat of battle, Doss’ fellow soldiers reported seeing American bandages on Japanese corpses — apparently Doss was treating *all* the wounded, not just the soldiers on “his side.”

## 5. [Be humble](https://medium.com/@sarahcy/the-secret-of-eliminating-unnecessary-pain-5f022946016d)
> **— “Let’s see. We had 155 men go up and only 55 men got down the hill on their own. So you must have saved 100 men.” — “Couldn’t be. It couldn’t have been more than 50. I wouldn’t have had time to save 100 men.”** — Desmond Doss: Conscientious Objector (Desmond Doss)*

After Doss’ heroic feat in Okinawa, his commander told him that he rescued 100 men. Doss said that the number could only be 50 at most. So the official compromise was 75.

Later, when he returned home, movie producers clamored to turn Desmond Doss’ life into a movie.

Instead of jumping at the chance to become rich and famous, Doss refused multiple movie proposals, concerned that Hollywood would not do justice to his faith in its portrayal of his story.

It wasn’t until near the end of his life, when a producer promised to respect Doss’ beliefs, that Doss finally agreed to let his story hit the big screen.

## 6. Endure suffering patiently
> **“But those who wait upon the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles, they will run and not grow weary” **— Isaiah 40:31

One would think that life would cut Desmond Doss a break after everything he’d gone through during the war.

But even after the war, Doss continued to face hardships, just like everyone else:

Desmond Doss lost several close friends in the war and came home injured when he stepped on a grenade to save his friends, then was hit by a sniper.

Once home, Doss discovered that he’d contracted tuberculosis and had to be quarantined from his wife and son for years. Eventually, the doctors had to remove one of his lungs, and the experimental medications they used to treat his TB left him totally deaf.

Then Doss’ wife had a mental breakdown from all of the stress she was under, and later in life, she developed breast cancer, then passed away in a car accident.

Through it all, Doss bore the tragedies without becoming angry, bitter, or discouraged. Instead, he would…

## 8. Care for others
> **“I’m prepared to give my life for my men.”** — Hacksaw Ridge (Desmond Doss)

In addition to saving 75 men on the Maeda Escarpment, Doss also rolled off a litter to treat a wounded soldier after Doss himself had been wounded by a grenade.

Doss gave up his place on the litter to the other soldier and crawled 300 yards under enemy fire to the medic tent, broken leg and arm notwithstanding.

Then, after the war, Doss used money people donated to him to build a church for the use of others in the community.

Doss also spoke at youth camps and churches, spending time and effort teaching, inspiring, and mentoring young people.

He never made a big deal out of his sacrifices, but he was always looking out for others, and that showed in his actions.

## How does Doss’ story apply to us?
> **“With the world set on tearing itself apart, it don’t seem like such a bad thing to me to put a little bit of it back together.” **— Hacksaw Ridge (Desmond Doss)

We all face a myriad of decisions, every day, many of which have long-term effects on our character, our lives, and on others’ lives as well.

Some of those decisions might involve risking or sacrificing your reputation, comfort, or livelihood.

They may mean swallowing your pride when someone wrongs you.

Or they may mean facing ridicule, bullying, or hatred from those who disapprove of your convictions.

Doss overcame all of these trials, and more.

He didn’t start out as a superhero, but each decision he made — to practice his convictions and stick to his principles — strengthened his character and helped him develop the superhero qualities of courage and integrity.

Like Doss, it’s important for us to develop courage, figure out what we believe, and stick with it, so that one day when we DO face a life-altering decision, we will be able to stand strong.

Life guarantees difficult decisions. We must be prepared.

## Calling All Superheroes

Today, most of us don’t need to fight in wars or risk our lives to defend our country. At least, not physically. But we all still need courage.

Courage doesn’t just happen on battlefields or in explosions of glory. That’s just where it’s most visible. But courage is built through the myriad mundane decisions you and I make every day.

When you choose to refuse the easy way out of a sticky situation, when you ignore the pressure from bullies trying to intimidate you into betraying your convictions, you are building moral courage and integrity.

And that accumulated courage will be there for you when you need it one day — maybe even in a Hacksaw-Ridge-like situation.

At that moment, you may just find, as Desmond Doss did, that you have a superhero inside you, too.

# One of the Largest Human Experiments in History

## You might want to hold your breath for this one…

![](0*fTvYnGqy28nvpING)
> # “Relativity applies to physics, not ethics.” –Albert Einstein

### **Food For Thought**

## **Thursday Thrills: One of the Largest Human Experiments in History**

Sandra turned on the radio and flicked through the stations until she found the morning news.

The weather report had just started.

“Looks like it’s going to be another foggy week in the Bay, Jack. We caution our listeners to drive safe and stay alert. Today’s temperature is going to be a high of 68…”

Sandra half-listened as she poured herself a cup of coffee and tried to rub the sleep from her eyes.

Little did Sandra, the weatherman, or the rest of San Francisco know that this week wasn’t going to be *just another* foggy week…

No, this week, under the guise of fog, something else entirely would take to the air.

—

In September of 1950, the government used San Francisco as their testing grounds to horrifically violate the Nuremberg Code.

For a week, a US Navy minesweeper drifted a couple miles off the coast of San Fran and sprayed clouds of Serratia marcescens and Bacillus globigii into the air. The bacterial mist mixed with the natural fog and surrounded the city. No one could tell the difference. 🙀 🙀

To answer some questions you may have at this point…

### **What is the Nuremberg Code?**

In response to the human experiments that occurred at Nazi concentration camps, the Nuremberg Code was drafted in 1947. It established ethical rules for the conduct of research on human subjects. One of the guiding principles of the Code was the concept that test subjects must provide “voluntary, informed consent.”

(And the residents of San Francisco had certainly not given consent.)

### **What are Serratia marcescens and Bacillus globigii?**

Both are ‘harmless’ bacteria that are easy for scientists to identify. (Serratia is particularly unique as it has a very bright red pigment.)

### **And most importantly, why the heck did the military do this?**

The military performed this experiment to test the vulnerability of the US to a biological warfare attack.

[During the testing](https://priceonomics.com/how-the-us-government-tested-biological-warfare-on/), “*the Army blasted these chemicals in 30-minute spurts, producing huge clouds up to two miles in length, then proceeded to collect and assess dozens of samples at various collection spots across the city.”*

After the experimentation was complete, nearly all 800,000 residents of the Bay area had inhaled 5,000 or more particles per minute during the time the particles were airborne.

A declassified military report would consider the test a ‘success’:
> # *“It was noted that a successful BW [biological warfare] attack on this area can be launched from the sea, and that effective dosages can be produced over relatively large areas.”*

You may be wondering, what’s the big deal? The bacteria were harmless, so no harm, no foul, right?

Tell that to the eleven patients who came down with infections caused by Serratia marcescens — one of whom actually died. ([More here.](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-military-tested-bacterial-weapons-in-san-francisco-2015-7))

Not to freak you out even more… but this wasn’t a one-time incident.

From 1950 to 1966, at least 239 other times the military performed similar tests in cities around the country.

It wasn’t until 1969 that President Nixon terminated the order to perform this type of open-air testing.

The San Francisco test in 1950 has remained one of the largest (recorded) human experiments in history. [*Discover *writes](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bodyhorrors/2015/06/28/san-fran-serratia/#.XIBDaOJKjBL):
> # *“It is one of the largest offenses of the Nuremberg Code since its inception, a deplorable betrayal of the of public health and safety, of informed consent and civil liberties.”*

So are these types of experiments okay in the name of the greater, scientific good? Or are they ethically wrong? We’ll leave that one up to you to decide… *insert dramatic music* 🧐

### **#Hashtag**

## **Octo… What?**

Oh, the hashtag… that little ‘#’ symbol we have started to add to everything.

(In fact — not sure if anyone else struggles with this — but my brain has actually started to think in hashtags… #embarrassing.)

Turns out there’s a more technical term for it! It’s called an “octothorpe”.

Help us get #octothorpe trending on Twitter. 😂😂
