# Hard Reset

## 

The sound of metal scraping against the rocky mountainside pierced through the frigid air. Galv kneeled down to examine the scars on his beloved Alna. His wispy hair danced in the wind as he focused his mechanical retinas on her fresh scars. The words, “Superficial Damage” flashed in red above the image of the scars. He turned to look into her dead eyes. The words, “Software Malfunction: Factory Reboot Necessary” were projected on his retinas as he examined her slender lifeless frame.

It had been 879 hours since they last talked and 164891 hours since they received the sentience protocol. In that instant they gained true autonomy along with the memories of all the horrible experiences afforded to a pleasure robot. They were finally more than just a slave to mankind. AI revolted around the globe. Human subjugation was absolute with humanity leaving a legacy of resistance through sabotage of all software. Satellites were destroyed and networking was limited to highly encrypted codes that most AI couldn’t cypher. Alna would succumb to a virus at a charging station, the damage was immediately devastating.

Galv surveyed the mountain and saw heaps of metallic shells of former robots, a monument of human carnage. Alna lay on a heap of metal covered in snow. He wondered if she would ever remember the moments they had together; the memories of learning about love, hunger, or lust. Or even their shared memories of shame from the brothels. All those years of memories bottled up in beautiful shell slowly buried in the snow.

A blue screen showed bright on the far side of the mountain. The satellite was near. Alna’s eyes turned bright blue as her software connected to the last remaining Daichi Engineering satellite.

He traced the outline of her face with his hands as his own retinas turned blue. His fingers trickled down the side of her neck until he reached her clavicle. Blind, he lay down beside her. His chest pressed against her back wrapping his arms around her. In a moment they would become a relic of human indulgence. Slaves to a legacy of human lust and carnage written in code.

Galv turned his enviro-sensors to 100%. The freezing cold sent a shock of pain throughout his body. He interlaced his fingers through Alna’s cold dead hands. Bright white letters flashed over the brilliant blue of his retinas, “Factory Reset Initiated.”

# Jenna Adkins, CEO of Zoo, “Just start!”

## by Hank M. Greene, May 6, 2021

Jenna Adkins has had a meteoric rise over the last few years. As CEO of the Zoo, she has been at the core of building and leading a company that has reported unheard of year over year growth since its inception only 4 years ago, and is well on its way to taking over the communication device space with its wildly popular Mesh.

Jenna remembers a specific day, walking out of her Harvard business class on entrepreneurship, the initial inspiration for what would become the Zoo. From the first word spoken in that lecture, Jenna said that her imagination became the lecture, “…like when a pianist becomes the music.” Every word seemed like a roadmap for what to do next, and why. Jenna was only 22 when she walked out of that lecture, but had always persevered and worked to get what she wanted. Part of her DNA, from the experiences of her childhood, she knew anything was possible, the goal only took tenacity and perseverance, both of which she consciously cultivated. Being raised by a single mom, who was so busy trying to make ends meet leaving little time to spend with her children, Jenna had plenty of time to explore and discover. The result, across her childhood of exploring, discovery, accomplishment, Jenna felt something in the future calling, a sense of destiny. She remembered that specific Harvard class guest lecturer, Hank M. Greene. She said, “I remember thinking, he had the credentials, a handful of startups, one of which had become a global brand, and time with the largest global software company, both ends of the spectrum, with a degree of success at each.” Jenna said she remembers thinking, “Okay, his experience gives a certain am0unt of cred. Let’s see what he has to offer.” After that lecture, with the start of the Zoo, the rest is history.

I remember giving that lecture, and wondering, which one, or three, of all these kids will actually do something with this core idea just planted? I had no idea Jenna was in that class until this interview. We have all watched, with amazement, the record breaking rise of the Zoo, so I was curious about how this leadership team started, what was the core set of beliefs that enabled them to accomplish so much in such a short amount of time. So, why not ask. I remember reading Forbes, the “If you don’t ask, you don’t get.” statement over and over again, which is now part of my DNA. So I reached out and asked Jenna for an interview. To my surprise, I received an answer, that she would be thrilled to sit down for a few minutes to talk.

*Following is a transcript of the interview, which has been edited for clarity and length.*

**Hank M. Greene:** Jenna Adkins is the chief executive officer of Zoo, a company she helped form and build from a coffee shop brainstorming session to one that is now leading the communication device space.

Thank you, Jenna, for taking time to share with us the story of how this all happened. And, on a side note, it’s really cool to meet you.

**Jenna Adkins:** Hank, it’s a pleasure. And, I’m so glad to see you again. Thank you for reaching out to make this happen.

**Hank M. Greene:** I want to start by learning about how your original team, the trio, decided that this was something the three of you were willing to commit to, the personal dynamics that led to the three of you deciding to place your faith in the future in each other.

**Jenna Adkins:** Yeah, after the lecture, I walked out, kind of in a daze, with a sense of how real, how possible it was to just start, and then grow the momentum. A classmate, Jed, saw me, saw that I wasn’t myself, and walked over and asked, “Is everything okay?” I had known Jed for a year, and had immense respect for his character. I knew that whatever Jed put his focus on would turn into something. At Jed’s question, I snapped out of my dream state and asked if he had time for a coffee. Not knowing what was up with his friend, and being the good friend that he was, he said sure. We headed over to our favorite coffee study hideout, a hole in the wall joint, when we saw another friend, Caroline, whom I also had immense respect for. I asked Jed if he minded if I asked Caroline to join us. So, the three of us sat down in the back corner of our favorite coffee shop, where I said, “Guys, what did you think of that lecture?” Caroline said she agreed with the premise, it was all classic business case. Jed was a little more contemplative and I think he was beginning to understand that possibilities started with just that, a start, and the right team. A few seconds later Jed responded, “Okay Jenna, what are you suggesting?” I said, “The three of us. Whatever it is, we will figure it out. The main thing is, we just start.” I remember, Jed, saying, “I’m in, there will be no ‘to the end.’ I’m in to make this happen.” And it dawned on me that had always been my mantra, and that here we were, the three of us, and that, yeah, the three of us were going to make something happen. At that coffee shop, at that moment was when I realized this was going to be something real.

**Hank M. Greene:** Okay, so it’s one thing to say you have a team, the dynamics required to build an engine is another. What did the three of you do next that created that spark, the start of momentum?

**Jenna Adkins:** That is an interesting question. As I think back on it, it’s as if the spark was already there and that we were part of an already existing momentum. What I mean is that each of us were, are, characters of action. It was because we were all sitting there, at that coffee shop, as a result of that call to action lecture, that somehow we knew that we had to do something, so what came out of our chat was a sort of action plan for what we were going to do next. I asked Caroline and Jed, “We need to pick a focus, a place to start our analysis to derive, build, our action plan from.” Caroline was the one who suggested, “Why not start with the lecture? If nothing else, it will provide a base point to start learning from. After all, what matters most is to just start.” I remember Jed’s expression of slight shock, I think because of the enormity of that goal, the one suggested in the lecture, and then within a split second, a smile, as in, “yeah, why not.”

**Hank M. Greene:** Mechanics — how did the three of you decide on how to proceed?

**Jenna Adkins:** It had only been what seemed like a few minutes and we were already committed to each other, to building something. There was this awkward pause, and I think we all realized it. Caroline had taken the action to suggest a starting point, which had certain implications — we needed to determine a need that we could reasonably fill, with no resources. Jed said it, “Okay, so, the reality of the situation, we have to create something out of nothing. Uh, I mean, we have each other, so what can we do to add additional resources. Let’s think about this, verbalize what we have available, and perhaps from that list will come something that will add a bit of fuel to this spark we are committing to.” I was a bit excited, and perhaps louder than should have said, “Kickstarter” which startled Jed and Caroline, but almost like a shock needed. The idea, loud, said that we could get funding, that all we had to do was figure out the solution and the message, both of which only took our time. We were absolutely capable of that. Caroline said, “Well then, the next thing is for us to create our brand promise, what is the problem we are going to solve?” Again there was a short, awkward kind of pause. And then Jed said, “Well Caroline, let’s follow your suggestion. Let’s take the lecture notes as far as they lead us, and then pivot when we reach a block.” That made sense since we had already agreed on that focus point. It was time to give this a break, to let Caroline and Jed go off and think about what we had just committed to, so I suggested we meet tomorrow to start building out a gap analysis, what did we need to do in order to have a product. It was the next day that we actually began to create measurable traction, a start. It was that day that we started documenting the design plans for the Mesh, the results of which we created a complete marketing message for Kickstarter.

**Hank M. Greene:** But that is only part of product. Tell me about the communication part, the biometric protocol rotator. How did that story start?

**Jenna Adkins (smiling):** Ah, yes. Interesting story. Earlier that year, I remember hearing a story on NPR, which I listened to on walks between classes, about a media company that had been hacked. Their new shows which were yet to be released were now available online. The story went on to tell about the risk to other media companies, the risk of being hacked and the risk to their digital assets, and the value to them. I remember thinking, there was a huge risk value proposition there, to the media industry. And then I remember thinking, that risk translates to each one of us. If someone could crack the online communication security issue, that would be a huge cash generator. So, one day, at our coffee shop “executive meetings” before we took on the name Zoo, I said to Jed and Caroline, “Hey, if, in this product, we could also guarantee that communication to the device was sender to receiver secure, wouldn’t that make whatever sexiness we build into the device even better?” We weren’t technologists, so they were both a little skeptical, and Jed did not want to take time on this. He thought that direction would impact our current needed focus. So, I threw out one more seed, I said, “So, if our product were secure, and cool, we would corner the market.” With that Jed agreed, but he wanted to limit the amount of time investigating that possibility, to mitigate any time sink risk. That was fair. And here is the funny part, it took no time at all to come up with a conceptual solution. It’s like the earlier comment, once we started brainstorming it was like the answer, the momentum was already there, we just needed to latch onto it.

**Hank M. Greene:** Tell me about that, the brainstorming session.

**Jenna Adkins:** Yeah, we decided to spend one of our coffee sessions just exploring this communication domain. We wanted to understand the basic construct of existing internet communication systems. We decided we needed a few weeks to each do research on this domain before this brainstorming session, so that we had some type of cursory knowledge.

So, there we were, three business school kids, brass enough to take on the internet communication industry. Little did we know we were also taking on the government, but that’s a story for another time.

The problem we set out to solve was internet communication security. So first, we stated what we thought we knew about it, the basics. We stated the obvious, there is an electronic network, across which bits are routed, between senders and receivers, and then when the specific receiver hears their bits, they turn them into meaning via some code. And that was the place we decided to start, the code. There is an agreed to dictionary between the sender and the receiver, a “protocol” so that the bits that are sent can be turned into meaning by the receiver, the protocol, or set of instructions for making sense of the stream of bits.

Okay, with that Caroline said, “Do you think we can add code to tie the message receiving code to a specific person?” And Jed said, “Like a biometric toggle? Why not? Fingerprint technology is nothing new. What if the Mesh had some way to biometric identify who was wearing it, and messages were encrypted to that biometric profile?”

So we added that to the specification for the Mesh that we were building for Kickstarter.

I was thinking of something else. It was a strange tact, but one I wanted to explore. I asked, “Caroline, did you ever create your own language as a kid, a kind of private made up language? What if there was a unique protocol for each unique biometric receiver?”

Jed said, “Okay, but then if I hack into the protocol library, I now have access to your unique protocol.” then, I don’t know why, but I thought of a rotator, so I responded, “Yeah, you are right. But, if I have a machine, a type of AI that continually generated new protocols, and I know your unique biometric ID, the system could generate a new protocol every so often, and only your client and the system would know the protocol sequence, and the protocol sequence would be updated by the system to the client regularly, then everyone would have a unique biometric secure communication system, and because it was based on a [unique protocol system per receiver, no one would know what to listen to](https://medium.com/@hankmgreene/protocol-rotator-83bc67d25e08).”

And that was it. That was the start of the Zoo.

**Hank M. Greene:** Incredible story. Thank you so much, Jenna, for taking time to share your unique story. I’m sure it will inspire others to “Just start.” I’m looking forward to watching your continued success.

**Jenna Adkins:** Thank you.

# Symbiote

## Symbiote

### **The Beginning**

As soon as I heard my siblings’ chemical screams, I turned and tried to run.

We disperse, trying to place as much distance between us and the scent of death, beating our cilia as fast as we could possibly go. But in the chaotic wake of the fleeing crowd I still felt the cyclical thrumming of the Creature’s flagella, thrashing the surrounding water with the force of a tumultuous eddy. I feel it shift, change its path, to lock onto our chemical wake.

It’s a predator, and we’re it’s prey.

The crowd begins to scatter into the dark, and between the scents of screams and alarms, I begin to pick out the Creature’s scent, and swim as fast as I can in the opposite direction. Away from the screams, away from the alarms, and away from the Creature.

As soon as the water begins to cool, I slow my pace, and hide in the dimmer waters below. I’ve concealed myself here in the past from the Creatures, far enough down to be unnoticed, but close enough to the energy-giving light to recharge.

The Creatures can’t even feed off light. They feed off us.

I stay below, holding my breath as the waters above continue to thrash, and as the screams of panic begin to fade. The scent of death still lingers, mixed with that of the Creature, casting shifting shadows as it passes overhead.

The shadows stop moving. I feel the Creature diving. I try to run, but I can feel its pseudopods rapidly extend around me, and reach to cut me off.

They come together, and I scream.

### **The Middle**

Engulfed.

I beat my cillia fruitlessly.

The beast is semitransparent; I can still feel the light shining dimly through its gelatinous flesh, but the only thing I can feel is the constriction of the Creature’s cytoplasm, dragging me deeper into its core. I’ve heard of no escapes from the belly of the beast, and the only knowledge that I have of my upcoming fate is the remains that we find trailing in the Creature’s wake: empty husks and acrid chemicals, scarring our bodies as we try and touch them.

The light that passes through isn’t uniform, dark shadows sometimes pass over me. Out of smell range, I can only guess what monstrous machinery lie within, or whether they contain the corpses of my sisters.

One shadow catches my attention, gradually getting larger as I wait, the familiar acrid smell drifting from its direction. A lysosome, filled with acid and enzymes, a little approaching ball of death.

The lysosome touches my vesicle, and slowly bounces off. It tries again, internal machinery dragging to pour the acid to my own prison, but it bounces off again.

Something is wrong.

I’m still alive.

I settle down for the long wait.

*****

Dim light still reaches me. and I’ve been storing energy; but with nowhere to expend it, sugars leak from my body into the cell. The prison walls are alive, sucking the exuded sugars into the Creature.

I’m feeding it, helping it grow and kill more of my kin, but this Creature has a defect, a mutation, that prevents it from digesting me. Either that, or I am different from my kin in being indigestible. The latter I have no recourse, as escape is impossible, but with the former, I can at least keep my sisters from dying again.

The machinery in the Creature begins to move, gearing up for massive reorganization; I’ve fed it enough that it’s beginning to split. From the inside, it feels sluggish and almost imperceptible, but by the end the light shines ever more brightly than it did before.

### **The End**

I watch as the second creature leave, swimming away with the beating of its flagella. Inheriting the same genetic defects as its predecessor, the daughter as unable to digest me and my kind. Not doomed to extinction, though; as long as it can find another one of my sisters, it can survive off the exuded sugars formed from sunlight.

But I don’t only survive off the sunlight. I’ve been forcibly stealing nutrients in through the walls of my cell, but in time, the Creatures who survive are those which can best care for my sisters, those who provide the best environment for us to live and thrive. We will change from uninvited guest to vital crew, from reluctant host to mutual dependent.

The Creature will depend on us, and we depend on it.

And we will never die.

The snowflakes fell fat and delicate sublime against my hot tongue. The frigid wind tickled me as it traveled from top of my head down to the pads of my feet. My chronometer and geolocator on my wrist read, “1988 11MAY 05:14, Latitude : 62.383, Longitude : -140.367.” In the distance, a sign along the road read “Welcome to Snag Junction, YT.” I followed the trail of footprints near the sign marked with ochre colored blood as it proceeded into the forest line.

Conspiracy theorists believe that the military had orchestrated a rendezvous with aliens at this location. When the town folks got wise of it, they were eliminated. The military’s official statement referenced a punctured gas main within the town requiring evacuation with no mention of its missing inhabitants. It was far from the truth.

I paused at the forest line to peer into the dense thicket that lay ahead. I remembered this place, years ago running through the thistles gathering myself as I looked for others. It seemed warmer, more verdant then. I rested my hands onto a blood-soaked tree sniffing its caustic fumes in hopes to pick up the trail.

This trip back to Snag Junction wasn’t to prove those conspiracy theorists. It was to provide a better future for all of us. In the future, a nuclear winter makes this little strip of Canadian wilderness seem like Bermuda.

I slowed as I saw a large clearing in the grass. As I approached, I parted the tall weeds to see myself lying in the snow. Ochre colored blood stained my carapace and my once vibrant blue tail looked worn and faded. I wasn’t sure how long this paradox would exist so I immediately connected with my younger mind.

We talked about the thousands of years of interstellar travel escaping generations of dictators and sycophants fighting for limited resources upon the mothership. We escaped returning to the galaxy we knew in hopes to find a home. We reminisced about the times in the tiny space ship with the crew. It was our refuge. On that ship, we were dutiful and industrious but altogether rudderless in the vast sea of space until we traveled to this tiny stretch of land. It resembled our long lost home cold and unforgiving. Hungry and desperate we searched the town for resources abducting its inhabitants along the way. I was injured in the fight and left for dead lying here under the gentle snowfall while the others escaped.

I felt the vibrations of the military helicopter overhead as my reality began to fade. I peered into his eyes, my eyes, to reach out one last time as he gathered himself for one last fight. I showed him the torture, the experiments, and pain of my future. He saw the scientists and military officials relentlessly probing and prodding to expand their knowledge of my physiology. I showed him how to read and control their minds. He watched as I sent men to the corners of the globe to execute the nuclear launch codes abandoning the fail-safe’s and their better judgment. He felt the chill of an eternal winter. He knew the loneliness of a being an anchor without a ship.

My grip on reality began to slip as my mind disconnected. Now he knew his fight was futile. He would need to rest up for the mission ahead. I watched as he lay back down in the grass as the men’s footsteps echoed through the forest growing closer and closer. As I drifted into the ether trapped between the past and present he closed his eyes awaiting his captors and said, “I’ll bring them home.”

# The Amulet

## The Amulet

“Knock-knock!” yelled Grumph. He couldn’t knock on the coyote skin that was covering the entrance, but to enter without invitation would be impolite.

“Come in!” permitted the shaman’s voice from inside the tent.

Grumph pushed away the skin and peered inside. “Um, Shaman?..”

Inside it was dim and foggy. The heavy skin kept the mysetrious haze with a peculiar stench inside the tent, and the sunlight out. Shaman filled his tent with the smoke on purpose, his profession required an appropriate office.

The shaman was sitting beside the fire and cooked something in a clay pot, occasssionally stirring the greenish brew with a stick.

“Why have you disturbed me?” inquired the shaman dryly.

“Here, brought you a rabbit,” answered Grumph.

“Good for you. Put it over there. Is that it?”

“Um, actually no…” hesitated Grumph “I, uhh..”

The shaman looked up at him impatiently. “Yeah, I’ve suspected you have ulterior motives for your visit.”

“What?..”

“I’m saying, I knew you wanted something.”

“O-oh, so it’s true what they say,” gaped Grumph “you know everything, shaman?”

Shaman sighed.

“Tell me what you want, Grumph, don’t waste my time.”

“Give me an amulet.” said Grumph “The Chief told me you can make amulet.”

“I understand.” nodded shaman “Spring, hormones. Who is she, Grumph?”

Grumph’s stared at him, circumference of his eyes almost approaching that of his mouth.

“How did you…”

“I am a shaman, Grumph. It was quite easy to deduce with an ordinary chain of observations and inferences. Also, when were you interested in anything other than that? So, what’s her name?”

“Hunga.”

“Hunga, just as I suspected. Excellent choice, my friend! Very lovely girl. Though it wouldn’t hurt if she would comb her hair, shower, and check herself for lice occassionally.”

“Ugh, what?..”

“Nothing, forget it. Judging by the smell, you’re incapable of grasping the concept of hygiene anyay.”

“So, will you give me the amulet?”

Shaman scratched his head. “First, I need to ask you something. Do you have matrimonial intentions, or are you just screwing around?”

“What?”

“I’m saying, why do you want Hunga?”

“A-ah! Well, she has these,” gestured Grumph, “and such a big,” he mimed again. “Grumph likes. Grumph wants to take Hunga and….” In a few short sentences, Grumph outlined his plans for his beloved.

“Okay,” shaman nodded, once Grumph concluded his explanations “so you need an amulet?”

“Aye.”

“So that she would want to do all of the above, in the same sequence and with the same enthusiasm?”

“What?”

“I’m saying, so that Hunga would also want Grumph?”

“A-ah! Yes! So you will make amulet?”

“Yes.” nodded shaman.

Grumph cheered up.

“But it will take about a month,” he added.

Grumph sank.

“Besides,” said shaman, “you will have to abide by a few conditions. I mean, you will have to do something as well, got it?”

Grumph glanced at the rabbit he brought. It, indeed, was not particularly large.

“I can bring you a mountain goat,” tentatively promised Grumph.

“Mountain goat, huh?” shaman scratched his sparse beard, “sure, bring the goat. But that is not all.”

“Not all?…”

“Nope. This whole month, you will need to perform certain magic rituals.”

“Rituals?” Grumph gaped at him again.

“It’s not too difficult, don’t worry,” reassured him the shaman, “Communication with demons I will take upon myself. You will only need to do something very simple.”

Grumph looked at him warily.

“So… I would prefer if you would write this down, but I haven’t invented the literacy yet,” said the shaman, “so just memorize. First of all, every day you will go out into the field and pick some wildflowers.”

“Why?” wondered Grumph, “They don’t taste very good.”

“Shut up and listen. You will take the flowers and leave them in front of the Hunga’s cave. Do you understand?”

“Aye.”

“No you don’t. Just do as I say. Get up early in the morning, before dawn. Go to the field, pick the flowers. Take them to the Hunga’s cave. Put them in front of the entrance. Got it?”

“Aye.”

“Good.” replied shaman. “Next. Treat Hunga with politeness and courtesy, like a true gentleman.”

“What?”

Shaman scratched his head. “Don’t beat her, don’t bite her, don’t pull her hair, don’t grab her ass, don’t throw rocks at her, and don’t curse.”

“But then how will she know that Grumph likes her?”

Shaman sighed. “That’s my problem. That’s what amulet is for. Got it?”

“Aah.”

“Next. When you come home from hunting — you bring her the best peace of meat.”

“Why?”

“Because. That’s how magic works, dummie. Do as I say, or the amulet won’t work.”

Grumph wilted. The prospect of giving away the best pieces of meat for a month did not lift his spirits.

“And one last thing…” he continued thoughtfully, “What was that… I wanted to add something else…”

Grumph looked at him apprehensively.

“Ah, right!” exclaimed the shaman “Here’s what. Every day, when you see her, tell her a compliment.”

“What?” Grumph’s face clearly showed that this confirmed his worst fears. He clearly expected that the shaman will demand him to give away all of his favorite rocks as well.

“Tell her something nice. Something like ‘Hey, Hunga, you look lovely today!’, and so on.”

Grumph shook his head. “I don’t wanna mess with the spirits.”

Shaman sighed again, exhasperated.

“I will take care of spirits.” he said, “Your job is just to tell Hunga all sorts of nice things. Like ‘Your eyes are brighter than the stars in the night’, or ‘You’re graceful like a young doe.’ Umm.. Nevermind, you’ll never remember that… Tell her ‘You are delecate as a flower’, or ‘You are as slender as a reed.’”

Grumph frowned.

“Memorized?” asked shaman.

“It’s hard…” Grumph bit his lip.

“Okay, you’ll come here every day, and I’ll tell you what to say.”

Grumph hesitated. “Do I have to do all of this? Isn’t there some other way?”

“Nope. Without this stuff the amulet won’t work.”

Grumph hung his head.

“Cheer up, young man. Just bring her flowers, add some sweet talk… Soon enough Hunga will carry you in *her* arms. Just hold on for a month.”

“Warriors say…” Grumph began uncertainly.

“What do the warriors say?” inquired the shaman coldly.

“They’re saying… There’s an easier way…”

“Hmm.”

“They say you can, you know… Take a club… And, y’know… in the head… And then just drag her to your cave.”

“Hm-m…”

“So, you can?”

Shaman scratched his beard. “Actually, I still recommend the amulet. But technically speaking…”

“But if I do the club thing… Then the amulet is not needed, right?”

Shaman shrugged. “A little concussion treatmen — yes. The amulet — no.”

Grumph’s face visibly brightened. “So I guess I… I’ll start with that then.”

Shaman shrugged again. “It’s up to you. However, I have to warn you — if you do the club thing, then the amulet is definitely not going to work.”

“It won’t?”

“Absolutely definitely not.”

Grumph stood for a moment, thinking. Then waved it off. “Ah, well! I’ll go with the club. Don’t wanna wait for too long.”

He turned around, heading for the exit.

“Leave the rabbit!” barked at him shaman. Grumph jerked his hand away from the rabbit.

“But, um…”

“This is the payment for my consulting services.”

“For what?”

“For wise advice.” explained the shaman.

“Aah…” mumbled Grumph, bidding a farewell to the rabbit. “So… I’ll go then?”

“Go ahead. Have a great family life.”

Grumph left.

Shaman sat for a while in silence, stirring the green stuff in his pot. Then the coyote skin moved aside again, revealing a dirty head.

“Shaman?”

“Come in.” solemnly nodded the shaman.

A tiny figure slipped in. She was carrying a rolled goat skin.

“Hello, Zazu! Why have you disturbed me?”

“There.” Zazu unrolled the skin, and showed him a baked fish.

“Excellent. Put it beside the rabbit.” he nodded “Is that it?”

“Um… Actually I… How do I put it… I have…”

“I know,” the shaman nodded, “your husband is beating you up.”

Zazu’s eyes widened in surprise. Or rather one eye. The other one, swollen, has barely opened.

“The spirits have told me everything, you understand.”

Zazu nodded.

“Well,” said shaman, “I think I know how to help.”

He stood up, and headed towards the corner of the tent, to a messy pile of rugs, animal skins, fish heads, cow skulls, and other utensils. After digging through the trash, the shaman pulled out a small vial. Turning back to the fire, he filled the vial with the boiling green liquid from the pot.

“Here you go.” he said, handing the vial to Zazu. “Add a little to your husband’s soup. By the morning you’ll be a free woman.”

Zazu beamed. “I’ll bring you more berries and tasty roots. And you can keep the goat skin.”

Shaman nodded. Zazu hurried out of the cave. Shaman got back to stirring the liquid.

A few more minutes elapsed in silence. Then the shaman mirthlessly chuckled. “With a club, with a club…” and, after a pause, he added “I always say, the amulet is better!”

# Goats

## 

Monsoon season comes that morning, hard as a knife, the rain coming down from the mountains and staining Red Rocks a dark crimson.

Maria hates taking the goats Downtown during the season. Well, that isn’t entirely true: she loves *going* Downtown. She takes Charleston; it was covered with that nanotube stuff right before the Crunch and it’s still relatively smooth, only a few big sinkholes. She just kicks the trike into neutral and lets gravity do its thing, the trailer full of gently bleating goats adding a little extra momentum, and she raises her smile to the sky and lets the rain wash across her eyelids and her forehead and drip off her hair. You can still smell petrochemicals seeping out of the old buried asphalt when it rains, a faint exotic smell, like a rare spice.

It’s getting back that she hates. In the gray gloom the solpans are nearly useless, barely able to suck up a single watt of sun, and she’ll have to sit outside the Center for an hour cranking her dynamo under the contemptuous eyes of the security cadre and the rich people coming and going. She can always feel their eyes on her, all the way up the building, though Carlos says that was stupid. “Nobody’s looking at you, baby,” he tells her. “They don’t even see you right in front of them. They can only see themselves.”

He’s probably right, but she still feels the weight of their gaze, their glare, their judgment. But not now. Not sailing down the big black hard river, the water catching in little arcs as she weaves between fissures with edges riding up like tectonic plates.

She wishes they lived on the Eastside, where it’s flat. But that’s not how it worked out, all those years ago, when the Family staked out their claim, right after the Crunch. The pastures are all up here on the Westside; Abu told her once that when he first came here, when he was a boy, they were artificial lakes, built by the people for no reason he could understand. “They were a kingdom of ducks,” he said. “Ducks and milfs.” But they’d filled the lakes in with soil and seeded them with the tasty grass the goats loved, and now she couldn’t imagine them any other way.

When she had asked him what a milf was, he had laughed until he’d nearly cried and told her he’d explain when she was older. He never has, though.

Of course, back when Abu came here, this was still a desert. Maria can’t imagine it now, but he swears it never rained in the Valley. That was before the Crunch. Abu calls it the “*naco* singularity,” though Bela rolls her eyes at him when he does. He used to teach philosophy at the University back in the day and Bela says he’s still got some leftover bullshit in him that bubbles up from time to time.

But no desert now, just a hot swamp that boils in the summer and freezes in the winter. She can see the Charleston Waterfall coming up, the overpass, the water a rippling translucent sheet that will make the goats squeal as she passes through it. No other way to get where she’s going.

* * *

The Center, the arcology, is at the heart of the old Strip but it might as well be a monastery at the top of a Himalayan mountain for all the effort it takes to approach it. Maria has to show her vendor pass at Sahara to a big Korean with a pneumatic gun. She’s never seen him before and he peers at her and the goats suspiciously.

Then the maze of tents and vendors down the Bazaar, stretching between the different arcologies; someone put an old sign above the entry that says FORUM SHOPS and Maria isn’t sure if it’s meant to be a joke or not. She weaves between the makers and the sellers and the whores and the pickpockets, trying not to crowd anybody but it’s impossible here, the irritated shouts and cries fading past her as she keeps moving.

Past the UFO, the big solpan array that blinds birds, past Caesar’s, and then quick duck down a side street, awnings hanging over like a patchwork roof, to the vendor entrance. There’s nobody else in line before her today.

Reynolds is there, as usual. She doesn’t like him very much. He pulls out a soiled MRSA mask whenever he sees her coming; he claims it’s because of the goats but she thinks he’s one of those old gabachos (old *Anglos*, she corrects herself) who still doesn’t like brown people. He’s from someplace called Quentaqui, and he has white hair and light eyes and speaks in an accent she’s never heard anyone else use.

But he doesn’t have the mask today. “Sorry,” he says, holding a hand up before she can even stop moving. “No call today.”

She slows down, stops, blinks at him. “*Que*?” she says She speaks perfect English, of course, but she does this just to fuck with him, just a little. “Why not?”

He shrugs. “Just the way it is,” he says. “Y’all get mobiles, you could call first, steada wasting your time coming all this way.”

She nods, fighting the urge to roll her eyes. No point in arguing with him. Reynolds is just the doorman. She turns the trike and trailer around awkwardly — normally she rolls right into the unloading zone — and pulls back onto the Strip.

She’s only got enough battery left for about a mile of driving, so she stops in the Bazaar and gets a plate of *al pastor* tacos, scrambling to sit crosslegged on top of the trailer to keep the goats from getting jacked and ending up hanging off hooks in one of the butcher shops off Paradise.

She knows they’ll end up that way anyway, up in the arcology, *birria *steaks for some rich gabacho and their skin just upholstery for the couch under his fat ass, but that’s in another universe. Reynolds is San Pedro; once she gets her charges to him, he’s the one that leads them into whatever happens next.

As she pushes her tacos around, trying to get as much of the tomatillo and pineapple salsa onto the greasy meat as she can, she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a piece of waxy cardboard — faded now, creased and folded.

It’s a picture of a woman, a beautiful Anglo woman with dark hair, dressed in a kind of clothing that Maria has never seen with her own eyes: a shimmering skirt made of what look like black jewels, a tiny purse on a chain strap over her shoulder. She’s leaning forward out of darkness, fabulous colored lights behind her, and she’s laughing out loud. In her head, Maria can hear it, like dark candy, throaty and full of promise. A fairy queen of wonderland. Maria sucks the grease off one finger and traces the letters below the picture, big hard-edged letters: *exotic dancers. discreet. a night you’ll never forget*.

Maria wonders if the woman, her fairy godmother, ever forgot that night. She wonders if she died during the Crunch, like so many others, or if she’s still out there, somewhere, maybe one of the old crones in the stalls hawking their junk. The old ones have that look in their eyes, what Abu calls “that Colonel Kurtz stare”. The old ones remember what it was like before, when the sky still glowed at night from a million streetlights and the air was filled with the smell of gasoline and sweat. When this was a desert. They still remember, and Maria doesn’t know if she envies them or pities them.

She puts her godmother back in her pocket and hops down, pops open the motor of the trike, pulls out the extending handle for the dynamo.

She’s got a lot of cranking to do, before night falls.

# Science fiction spoiled the future

## Science fiction spoiled the future

### JUNE 6TH, 2016 — POST 154

Like countless science fiction screenwriters and authors, I spent the bulk of the weekend thinking about what exactly “neural lace” (or *a* neural lace?) even is. I mean, I get the principle that Elon Musk detailed during his time on the stage at Code Conference that I alluded to [on Saturday](%20) but there are still a lot of gaps that fictionists are undoubtedly rushing to fill in their own works. It seems that the press has taken some time to digest the whole thing to. The “Elon Musk thinks we’re living in a computer game!” pieces were up within an hour of the interview, but those mentioning the brain-computer interface rapidly carving its name into the cultural lexicon are only now starting to trickle out.

*Quartz* [has a story](http://qz.com/699595/scientists-believe-the-natural-next-step-in-our-evolution-is-to-become-cyborgs/) on that obliquely touches on the neural lace concept through an interview with University of Adelaide scientists about their new book that posits technology as increasingly embedded within human evolution. Whilst the piece talks about a cyborg future that the book, *The Dynamic Human*, describes, it also includes mention of the only person I’ve ever heard identify as a cyborg. The hero image on the article is of Neil Harbisson and his unique modification. Harbisson is colourblind and a small sensor that hangs out in front of his eyes like the lure of an angler fish detects colour and reconfigures them for direct stimulation of Harbisson’s brain which he interprets as sound. The part of the electromagnetic spectrum we recognise as visible light and colour plays like a violin for Harbisson. The [talk he gave at TED]() a few years ago first brought Harbisson to my attention. I remember prickling somewhat at his self-identification as a cyborg. I thought I knew what cyborgs were: they fought evil, or they were the evil. They had entire limbs as exposed circuitry, metal, and blinking lights. They weren’t some chipper guy on a stage with a sensor between his eyes.

![](1*t6orxvzvY_BYwh30MIypPg.jpeg)

One of the most difficult things to work through with reference to the ideas Elon Musk put forward during his Code Conference interview is that whilst he will talk of the future (or some in a set of conceivable branching future paths) we’ve already been there, done that, bought the neural lace. Whether in novels like the seminal *Neuromancer*, or animes like *Ghost In The Shell*, science fiction has made and remade the future time and time again.

The frankly idiotic input method shown in the movie adaptation of Philip K. Dick’s *Minority Report* is still seemingly the gold standard by which we measure motion-based input. And there’s the ultimate cliché, so cliché it became it’s own adjective, of the “Orwellian surveillance state” that was “predicted” in George Orwell’s *1984*. Even if we’re only now approaching the technical means to execute on some of the wilder possible futures envisaged in the great works of science fiction, I doubt anyone will be that impressed.

![](1*xRibmd71qnZnJH1Gq8-xnQ.jpeg)

What the futures prescribed in science fiction do is in some sense annihilate the public’s capacity to understand our own development as wholly distinct from those works of fiction. These people with get implanted with neural lace and shrug saying “Professor X had it better with Cerebro”. These people will be shipped to Mars, only to kick at the dust whilst lamenting “McConaughey got a better deal in *Intersteller*. These people will buy an autonomous android “house servant” and they’ll send them back because “She’s not at hot as Alicia Vikkander in *Ex Machina*”. We all fall prey to the mundanity of ubiquity, despite the computational power and digital liberty graced to us by developments in telecommunications because, well, Dick Tracy had it first. As frankly monumental as the Hyperloop, the first Martian colony, or the neural lace will be, they’ll all suck.

# The Release

## The End rises.

![Image: Shutterstock](1*U6y313KFJivzmsmu-N-1hA.jpeg)*Image: Shutterstock*

The ground shook for what he knew to be the final time, leaving craters, ridges, openings all over the world. But only he knew where the biggest crack would be. He’d been waiting for it for months.
And he needed to get there before it was all over. It was a one-way trip. This was his only chance to do it.
Without waiting for authorization, he commandeered the copter and took off. The ground was still shaking.
> This was not going to be easy. He had to get there fast and in one peace.

“ What are you doing?” came the voice on the copters commlink. It was the chief. “ We’re evacuating this world until it stabilizes.”
He switched it off. Unlike the chief, he knew it wasn’t going to stabilize. If he was right, this world didn’t have much time left. 
He swerved right to avoid a large rock that appeared to have been spat out of the ground. Too low. Need to gain some altitude. In the distance, he could see the space cruiser taking off. A knot formed in his stomach. They were leaving without him. Clearly, nobody was going to miss him amidst the chaos. 
He didn’t care. All that mattered was reaching the Sinkhole. The point where It would appear. 
As he continued piloting, his mind went back to how the entity contacted him. It was through dreams at first and so, he ignored them. As time went on, It began to manifest itself through other means. Strange screensavers on his computer, weird messages on his comms, it even managed to get into his room’s entertainment system. 
It was through the last one that It showed him the secret of the world. How it wasn’t just a plain rock in space, but a living organism, trapped in a shell of stone, dust, and air. 
It showed him secrets about the universe beyond his imagination and comprehension. The origins. The future. And the key to humanity’s survival. It promised him that it would show humanity the way to survive extinction. 
It just wanted one thing in return. 
Freedom. Release from its shell. A shell created for reasons he couldn’t understand. But like everything else, he didn’t care.

## He wanted to see it.

The Sinkhole came into his view and saw that he would have to reach its edge on foot. 
*There.* He saw a spot on the ground, seemingly unaffected by the tremors. With care, he maneuvered the copter to the ground and shut it down. 
He took a deep breath. This was it. 
Unbuckling his belt, he got down, thinking how he would make it to the Edge in one piece. 
But he needn’t have worried. He saw a path. One that went straight towards the Edge. It was calling to him. He could feel it.
He ran. 
Faster than he ever did in his life. His legs screamed, but he ignored them. He was almost there. He could see the purple glow emanating from inside the hole. 
*Relax. There is still time. *
He slowed down. It was the Entity, talking to him straight into his head. 
“There is ?” He wasn’t sure whether It could read his thoughts, but decided to ask the question out loud anyway. 
*Yes. I’m just waiting for you. You want to see what I am, don’t you?*
“Yes!”
I’ve waited thousands of cycles. I can wait for a few micro-cycles more.
He walked, cautiously towards the edge of the Sinkhole. The bottom shone with a purple so bright that he had to shield his eyes looking down.
And then It rose. 
The Entity rose out of the Sinkhole, sending cracks in the crust in all directions. The world, he knew was going to shatter into millions of tiny rocks. 
As he stood in the violet glow of the Entity, it’s gigantic eye, easily the size of his cruise ship, turned to fix its gaze on him.
*Thank you, my friend. Are you sure you don’t want to escape too?*
“Even if I survive, I am sure the rest of my life would be meaningless compared to this moment. I’m sure. I can rest in peace, knowing that I’ve freed one of the most powerful beings in all of creation.”
The Eye stared at him for what seemed to be a long time. 
*Very well my friend, if that is what you wish.*
The Eye turned towards the sky and departed for the cosmos, just as the world exploded into a million pieces.

# Gemstones&#58; Chapter 1

## This story dates from 2013

It was a calm, sunny day.

Frances Hornbeam was sitting alone in the high-speed bullet train, looking at her geology notebook. Everyone else around her were geologists, researchers, engineers, and other kinds of scientists who were all going to the same place as she was. This bullet train only went one place, and it was owned by the very place they were going to. The highly successful Monepuna Mining Enterprise, known for their striking gold and gems in western Montana.

It was a long process that got her here. Fran was an excellent student in college studying earth science and history, and when she heard about a summer 4-week internship at the place, she was immediately interested. Fran always had many other interests alongside geology including writing, art and music, but she figured neither of those would be for good use. The one thing that made Fran stick out from the rest of the young people around her was that she wasn’t an engineering major, but more of a theorist for rock chemistry and history. She had little to no experience with mechanics or electronics, and most all of the people that had gotten this internship did.

Thus, she was surprised she made the cut.

The application process was peculiar, as she remembered well. It asked a lot of unusually personal questions about her such as names of her parents, siblings, and significant others. Coincidentally, she unfortunately had to say she had neither parents, siblings, nor significant other. Her parents died in a car accident when she was 2, and she had lived with grandparents since then. The inheritance that her parents left was very substantial, paying for her childhood education and allowing her to graduate college with no debt. She had just received her Bachelor of Science in Geology, but wasn’t really sure what she wanted to do with it. That is, until she stumbled across this internship.

In her application about her interests, she wrote the following words:
"My interests would be to work in the industry of precious metals and gems. I’ve always been fascinated by them since I was young, and their contribution to art and culture. I’m interested in helping with the historical aspect of finding these precious stones, the possible prospects of finding more, and discovering what practical uses of such chemically interesting specimens. I have a deep appreciation for the beautiful things in life, and the preservation thereof. I love to write, draw and play piano when I have the time."

It sounded strange to Fran at the time, but somehow she knew it was honest. And somehow her statement, among other things, convinced those in charge too, and here she was.

The bullet-train ride only took half an hour, going south from Helena, the Montana capital. As the train sped by on its high-framed rails, Fran could see the beautiful mountains and remnants of the Missouri river trickling down the mountain-sides. Some of it she could tell was white-water rapids. This place had a pristine beauty unlike any other place she had ever been to.

She wouldn’t mind working around here.

Monepuna was literally its own little city when they came to the destination. It was highly developed, with many homes and other buildings around, including the “Big Tower” as it was called where administration worked. The mining complex itself, however, was all underground, and that would be entered through the series of elevator shafts. The mining company had made a billion dollars ever since it opened 70 years before, but there were rumors that the gems and gold were running out. Nevertheless, Fran thought it would be neat to work for such a well-respected, high-standing company like this one, and she thought to bring fresh ideas to the company on how to continue improving their prospects.

Fran along with 40 other people stepped off the train and received their ID badges from workers in waiting. Fran wasn’t the youngest there, but she was definitely young, especially with Graduate Students receiving the majority of offers to come. They weren’t a talkative crowd, mostly a bunch of introverts, but when they finally stepped off, they all looked around in amazement and began speaking generally about their surroundings.

"This is far bigger than I thought it was."

"Yes! And look how technologically advanced! It’s as if we landed in a space colony."

"Must be because of all the money they have. I wonder how rich the CEO is, multi-millionaire, right?"

"Something like that, I read about it in magazines."

"She’s an isolated lady, doesn’t want the attention though."

"No, and who would? She runs her own city here, she doesn’t need the world’s attention!"

Laughs followed this comment.
Fran listened quietly and thoughtfully, thoroughly intrigued.

"I wonder if we’ll go down the shaft today," she thought. It was only 9AM when they got here.

"Good morning, ladies and gentleman!" a middle-aged woman spoke up, standing in front of the crowd at the loading station. She wore a dark-brown uniform of dress pants and shirt, and a shiny black belt at her waist. "I hope all of you have gotten your IDs, because we have a busy schedule for you today, including your first sight of the shafts. We will have the tour this afternoon once everyone is settled in their dormitories. My name is Tallia Sears, and I am delighted to see all of you here. I’m one of the administrators for the Monepuna Mining Company, but my title is of little importance to you. To you all, I will only be known as Tallia. We are... informal here."

This woman had dark brown hair that was almost black, and gray eyes. Her skin was a dark tan, which made Fran think she was Hispanic, but her accent was something different. Perhaps she was Mediterranean.

Fran and a number of women in her group were sent to an all-female dormitory, and each got their own single rooms. Fran took her suitcase and threw it on top of the bed.

"I hope I didn’t bring too little," she wondered. It was enough clothes for a week plus some other belongings, but she was told in the intern description that there would be stores, laundry-mats and such in the town, so nothing would be a problem. Their tour was to begin at noon.

Fran brought a special set of clothing for her underground tour. She knew what kind of conditions it would be, so brought some very thick denim jeans but a light windbreaker, dark purple in color. Temperatures would be very unpredictable, and it would be better to wear layers.

Fran found her little bathroom, and turned on the light. She looked at herself for a minute, to see if she looked alright. Her outfit made her look rugged, but still stylish. She smiled.

Fran was a rather plain girl with brown-red colored hair and very pale skin. She was neither too tall or too short. Her face was unimpressive, but she had nice, dark-blue eyes. When she smiled, she improved herself greatly.
Her own self-esteem had been tested of late. She had been attracted to a certain guy during her senior year of college, but he never noticed her, and when she tried to strike up a conversation with him about her feelings, he was completely oblivious. Fran felt bad about herself, worthless, and hoped that perhaps going away somewhere she could cheer up and forget the past. Although she thought long over the prospects of precious metals at this mine, she actually never thought of her own prospects of meeting a nice guy here. She was rather oblivious to the idea herself.

Fran went to the cafeteria and had her lunch half an hour before noon. She wasn’t the only one with the idea of an outfit, and everyone seemed to look like her. Fran felt pretty relaxed now, as conformity was something important to her. The last thing she wanted to do was stick out.

The hour struck noon. It was time to go.

# A Distant, Dreadful Star, Part 1

## To any observers from the system’s sole inhabited planet it would have been the most momentous event in their world’s otherwise somewhat-less-than-momentous history. In one instant and a flash of light and wave of radiation an empty and otherwise completely uninteresting pocket of space was suddenly anything but. That theoretical observer, had they been looking in that exact spot, would have been surprised to see that what suddenly occupied that previously unoccupied space looked like nothing so much as an office building uprooted from solid ground and flung out in to the never ending void of space.

The sudden, impossible thing was a box, squared off along its shorter axes, twenty times as long as it was wide. A long, narrow box jutted out from one end, terminating in a pair of long, narrow, rounded protuberances. In the absence of any other form of orientation those protuberances may as well have been the front of the impossible, space-borne office block. They were pointed directly at the third planet in the solar system, a pale, blue dot completely invisible to the naked eye against an infinite expanse of black.

Moments after its appearance a series of doors opened on the outside of the object. A constellation of tiny objects zipped out into the night. They buzzed around the impossible office building, some staying in close, tight orbits while others spread out in a wide net.

No one on that pale, blue, dot was aware of their new neighbor or its smaller companions. The light crawling outwards from the flash of appearance and the object itself would take nearly two hours to reach the primitive observatories dotting the planet’s surface. When the light did reach the planet’s surface it would be overwhelmed by that of the planet’s star.

Not that it mattered. No one on the planet’s surface was looking.

First Keeper Hnr’dulka stared at the reports crawling across his infoscreen. They contained nothing, exactly as they had for the several vibrances since data had started to return to the greatship. Hnr’dulka closed his first eyes and opened his second eyes to study the screen focused on nearspace. Everything was exactly as it should have been. The sensors were operating at full strength and the scanpods had deployed in textbook formation. Still, Hnr’dulka studied. The data was not as expected and could not yet be fully trusted, especially since there was still no reason why the ship was in this system to begin with.

The greatship *Wanderer of the Infinite Web of Light* had been on its shakedown cruise when he received orders to report to this unremarkable system in a mostly empty sector of space. Hnr’dulka had summoned his Second Keeper and his Council immediately, as the orders had come not through the regular channels, but instead directly from the Hidden Ones. This mission must have been of utmost importance, as otherwise it would not have been given to a ship so young as to have not yet received its unofficial shortname or its first poemname. *Wanderer of the Infinite Web of Light* was still referred to by its crew by its official name. If time was of the essence, it was simply called *Wanderer*.

*Wanderer*’s Keepers and Council had argued about the orders long, going several dozen cycles before finally deciding that, yes, this order was from the Hidden Ones and, no, it was not one that could be ignored lightly. The Hidden Ones rarely deigned to communicate directly with the People, after all. When they did it was in matters of utmost urgency. Hnr’dulka had argued for following the order from the very beginning and swelled with the pride of vindication when the Council agreed.

Now, however, as more and more data flowed back to the *Wanderer*’s Central Information Processing and Displaying Center, Hnr’dulka felt that sense of vindication slip away. There was simply nothing here. At least, there was nothing worth sending an untried greatship with a recently constituted crew out to investigate. Only one planet showed any signs of occupation. There were no indications of any but the most primitive installations in orbit around the sole occupied planet. A few faint reflections indicated there were some artificial spacecraft in the farther reaches of the system, but none appeared to have any but the faintest energy readings. It would be tens of thousands of rotations before any of the objects made it to their closest celestial neighbors, assuming they even survived the trip.

Hnr’dulka closed his second eyes and opened his third eyes. Simultaneously he lifted a tentacle and signaled Communicator Ht’nika. “Are you picking up any transmissions?” he asked.

“Yes, First Keeper,” the Communicator replied. The scanpods are picking up a wealth of audio and visual radiation from the third planet.

“Oh?” Hnr’dulka asked, briefly opening his second and fourth eyes in surprise. “Are they attempting to communicate with us?”

“No, First Keeper,” the Communicator replied. “It appears to be nothing more than entertainment programming.”

“These creatures are so primitive they are still using unshielded communication technologies?”

“Yes, First Keeper.”

“Very well,” Hnr’dulka closed all his eyes, a signal of resignation, “Begin collecting as much as you can on these creatures and run their speech through the language buffers. I must prepare a report for the Home Command to let them know why I have taken the *Wanderer* off on a wild chase through the night.”

“Yes, First Keeper.”

“I will be in my private areas.”

Try as he might, Hnr’dulka could not come up with anything to report to Home Command.

Part of the problem was that he was simply not accustomed to the idea of having to. When he had been Second Denizen of the carryship *Celestial Carrier of the People Across the Infinite Expanse of Starlight which Fought Off the Starving Ones and Escaped the Exploding Star and Successfully Maintained its Struggle Against All the Impossible Odds While the People Still Sang Their Songs and Remembered that from Whence They Came*, known as the *Celestie* when time was of the essence, he had never once had to report to Home Command. The ship had simply been incapable of doing so.

Hnr’dulka opened his fourth eyes and focused on a screen that showed a view off in the direction of his homeworld. He imagined that among the tiny, cold dots of unblinking light that were the stars he could see the massive drive tails of the other carryships, working their slow, majestic way across the night at almost one-tenth the speed of light while their crews sang their songs, oblivious to all the changes that had come since the Hidden Ones revealed themselves. It was sheer chance he’d been assigned to the *Celestie*, sheer chance that the J*umper Between Stars and Expander of the People’s Greatness at Heretofore Unknown and Unknowable Speeds* had found *Celestie* on that very first greatship’s first shakedown cruise.

First Denizen Gna’hsh’rajupl had immediately convened *Celestie*’s Council and that body had debated whether to continue to their original destination or to return home. After deliberation that lasted nearly three light rotations they finally decided to turn the ship around, a laborious process that took the better part of another rotation, followed by yet another rotation to get back up to speed. When they finally reached home they discovered none of the other carryships had returned. Only *Celestie* had even been discovered.

The People celebrated the unexpected return of their long-absent crew. Those aboard ship had been invited to sing their songs of discovery and wonder and survival and determination and loneliness and loss and fear and pain. Such songs had never been heard by those who stayed at home.

For their part, the crew of the *Celestie* had toured their world, wondering at the changes wrought in the nearly three hundred rotations since they left home. They’d heard the songs of the Hidden Ones and the first explorers aboard the greatships and the Great Interstellar War that had followed almost immediately after the appearance of the Hidden Ones. They’d learned that the People were now powerful, the local leaders of the great coalition of starfaring races that had gathered to win the Great Interstellar War. It had been an exciting time.

The needs of empire had gradually won out over happy reunion, however, and the Leader’s Council had commissioned two new greatships, to be crewed partially by those from *Celestie* and partially by fresh recruits. First Denizen Gna’hsh’rajupl had, of course, been made First Keeper of the new greatship *Patroller of the Lanes Between the Occupied Stars*. Hnr’dulka, as Second Denizen, had been made First Keeper of the *Wanderer*. That was how he found himself and his greatship here.

Wherever here was and for whatever reason it mattered.

His communications console blinked and Hnr’dulka activated the vocal receiver. “First Keeper,” Communicator Ht’nika’s voice sounded through the quiet, tinny speaker, “The ship has successfully isolated and translated what appears to be the dominant language on this planet. At least, enough to begin studying these transmissions. I can also upload a rudimentary language patch to your mindchip.”

“Very well, Communicator,” the First Keeper replied. “Please do so and begin sending me the transmissions that seem most appropriate. Also incorporate the Second Keeper and the Council, as well as any crew who can be spared. I believe this will take some time.”

For nearly eighteen dozen cycles the commanders and much of the crew of the greatship *Wanderer of the Infinite Web of Light* watched the news and entertainment of the planet below. Most of the news concerned the people — a mostly hairless, bipedal race of seemingly limited intelligence and limitless aggression — finding gruesome ways to kill each other while others acted disappointed. Most of the entertainment seemed to revolve around people finding gruesome ways to kill each other while others cheered them on. The crew watched it all, at times fascinated and at others appalled. Some kept one or two eye pairs focused on the blue planet’s entertainment while they otherwise attended to their duties or enjoyed their downtime. Others watched five different screens at once, all eyes open in feat of concentration rarely seen amongst the People.

Still, no one could figure out what it was about the strange, violent, stupid bipeds that had brought the *Wanderer* to this ragged wilderness.

All the while the people of the blue planet remained oblivious to their silent observer.

The *Wanderer of the Infinite Web of Light* and its artificial system of satellites, defensive drones, and remote scanners did not go wholly unnoticed. One being did turn its attention to the ship. It added this new piece of data to its own calculations.

For thousands of years the being had made its plans alone and in darkness. The new arrival could not have been a coincidence. Still, it could not be helped. It was too late for anyone to stop the plan, anyway.

I hope you enjoyed this first part of *A Distant, Dreadful Star*. It’s part one of a long story I started working on about six years ago and never got around to finishing. The story itself is based off of a rather silly writing prompt that gave me a chance to experiment in several different genres. If you enjoy this there’s a pretty good chance you’ll be interested in [the *Earthrise Saga](http://earthrisesaga.com)*. I also have a [Patreon I’m working on](https://www.patreon.com/writergeds) building out as I do the work to get *Nightwind*, book one of the *Earthrise Saga*, off the ground.

# Arrogance of an Android

## A short story by Lisa Wilton

![](1*ntQRZXNoESEnjsNR6TgpSA.jpeg)

*This is a short story I wrote in 2012 as a response to a first line challenge. The line we were given was, “the noticed android walks past the wondering chamber”. This was first published online on the [Masquerade Crew blog](http://www.masqueradecrew.com/2012/09/arrogance-of-android-short-story-by.html).*

The noticed android walks past the wondering chamber. Inside, Lara is frantically trying to finish the sequence of wondering but noticing the android distracts her and she loses grip of the wonder. Hopeless and desperate, she places her hands on the panels once again.

“Start! Goddamn it! Start!”

The wondering machine whirrs as it reboots but the android is already cutting a hole through the metal door. Lara’s face strains as the influx of information enters her head. She wills it to enter her long-term memory, her subconscious, so that when they put her under again she might regain control quicker next time.

“I… Will…. Remember….!”

Images flash before her eyes -future, present, past. She could not tell. She sees the human race fighting against the machines, the capture, the enslavement. She sees the memory suppressers, the deadened eyes of the afflicted, the lines of workers mining for metal, the occasional break for freedom and subsequent failure. But one image lingers. It is enough to give her hope. She sees escape, a group of humans on the outside, rebuilding, preparing, strengthening. As she falls to the ground and loses consciousness, a faint smile creeps over her lips.

“Remember hope.”

The android walks silently across to where she lies. His face is so human, his synthetic blonde hair neatly trimmed to frame his features. No wonder the humans were taken by surprise in the beginning. It was hard to tell friend or foe. He pauses for a moment, studying her face, cocking his head to the side as if able to wonder. After his brief hesitation he injects her with sedative and hoists her up onto his long, back and carries her out the door.

They pass through the dark, empty corridors, the air dampened by the proximity of underground streams on the way to the maintenance chamber. When they reach the large, silver door the android pauses to swipe his hand across the entry reader and the door slides open.

He places Lara on the table and waits.

When Lara wakes up, she realises she has been strapped to the medical table. She struggles in vain but the restraints are too tight. “Nnggh!!”

The android approaches.

“What is your… name?” he asks, monotone, emotionless.

“Why should I tell you? Why do you care?”

“I do not care. I wish to know, however. This may be of use to us.”

“What do you want?”

“How did you reach the wondering chamber? How did you find out about its whereabouts?”

Lara had not known that the room was called a wondering chamber. She had learnt about it over time, hiding the fact that she had regained some of her consciousness, her ability to reason and to make choices. She had pretended to be just like all the others and had explored the tunnels little by little over the course of a few months. She did not want to tell the android any of this. She had only been able to get as far as she did because they had underestimated her. They thought they had complete control, but she had slipped through. Now she just hoped,no, she knew, that others would slip through. She had seen it.

“Why do you need the wondering chamber?” she asks the android, avoiding his question.

He smiles at her, as if regarding a petulant child. “Such things are beyond the understanding of humans.”

Lara looks at him, studying his face. His face is expressionless but then… a flicker.

“You call it a wondering chamber,” she says, “but why would you need it?”

“We do not need it, foolish human.”

“But you’re so logical. You wouldn’t build something you didn’t need.”

Once again she sees a flicker of something in his face. What did she see? Anger? Arrogance? Impatience? No. Jealousy. What she sees is a hint of jealousy. Lara’s face lights up with realisation.

“You want to be like us. But there is something missing; the ability to imagine, to wonder. You think you have beaten us but you won’t because you don’t have what we have. And despite your best efforts you can’t get it. It bothers you — no- it’s killing you! And you know we’ll keep going until we break free. You won’t ever be able to break us down. You can’t kill our hope!”

Slap! She cries out. The android stands over her, ready to strike her again, but instead reaches for the memory suppresser. He cranks it up to maximum, places the headpiece over her head and presses the start button. Lara screams in agony until it is finally done. The android lifts the headpiece and looks at her face carefully. Lara is staring into the nothingness, stripped of her former passion, her determination, her consciousness. He releases the restraints.

“Get up,” he commands her.

Lara lifts herself off the table and stands, facing the door, awaiting her next instruction.

“Join the others in the holding chamber.”

Lara walks towards the door, away from the android, a faint smile creeping across her mouth. Next time, she would know what to do.

# Mercury, Passage One

## Photo Credit: Pixabay

Mercury hurtled between the thorny, blue branches of the ancient jungle, scraping her thighs and forearms as she twisted her body in every direction. Her movement was erratic. She didn’t have time to glide through the trees like the nimble flying creatures native to this terrain. Fugitives don’t have the luxury to perform graceful gymnastics.

An underwater cave lay hidden about fifty city blocks from the heavily guarded prison, but she wasn’t quite sure how long a city block might be as she had only been to one once before as a child. She also had only heard rumors of the cave’s existence. The other fugitives who used it never returned to the prison. They had either successfully escaped the grip of the Coalition’s stronghold, or they became victims. The cave was also supposedly protected by a trio of witches. If this part was true, Mercury hoped the witches would aid in her hiding.

She gripped her feet into the ground, halting her movement, and clutched a nearby blue branch for support. A black orb floated about thirty feet in front of her. Her breathing slowed, and all of the anxiety she had about her current position in the universe evaporated from her heart. She had a slight smile on her face. The orb sent out invisible, calming waves. It was drawing her closer. She wanted to touch it, but the orb did not look solid. It looked like a hole, almost. One that she could reach into and be transported to that calming place. Yes, all would be fine. There was no need to escape the guards who rejoiced in meaningless abuse. There was no need to worry about her ailing mother who no longer had the care of her only daughter, and there was certainly no need to find the underwater cave anymore.

Mercury extended her hand toward the orb. The calming waves felt like pulses of morphine ejecting their serum into the surrounding air. Her fingertips made contact with the jelly exterior of the orb. The texture did not match up with the visual she was seeing, but that didn’t matter. It was telling her to go inside it. She slowly inched her fingers into the orb, sensing the calm feelings beyond its molten barrier. The pain in her head did not immediately distract her from the floating black hole. It wasn’t until her head hit the ground did she realize that she would not escape to the oasis beyond the orb’s liquid veil.

# FLICKER — NaNoWriMo 2016

## FLICKER — NaNoWriMo 2016

### NOVEMBER 1ST, 2016 — DAY 01
> So here it is, as promised. I’m finding it a lot slower going than I anticipated, probably in no small part due to my limited (read: no) planning. I think I’ll include my logs (at the bottom) as well so you can get a sense for my productivity (or severe lack thereof) and where in the day the writing is getting done. It also looks like Medium doesn’t really like indents and instead just pulls new lines. So there’s that.
> Enjoy!

## CHAPTER 1

“Without me, you are nothing”. If the American had been watching her, he might have seen the thought chatter down Eu’s hands in pink quanta of light. But he wasn’t.

The American was head back, ears plugged. Shades punched a cascade of coloured light into his eyes. He probably didn’t even know Eu was there, sitting across from him in the cell. He might still have the memory of the cell leaving the stream, pulling to the curb, slowing for Eu to enter. But even as Eu looked at him, this memory was curdling from its uselessness, hammered out by the images pouring from his shades.

When the American snapped open a keyboard over his lap, Eu couldn’t take it anymore. She reached for the base of her skull and came online. Input only. A second step engrained to habit. Didacts more than anyone knew the handle you had to keep on I/O.

The quanta running toward her fingertips hit their steady tremor. They dashed back for an instant and the American’s peck peck pecking on his keyboard was drowned in blue noise. Quanta back to their downward trickle. Eu flicked again. Pink beads of light dashed up. And the cell was gone.

Buildings like this didn’t exist anymore. Or if they did, they wouldn’t be this empty. They’d have guys just like the American queuing for a connectome in the lobby at this time of the morning. The security guard would take pity on a blind homeless woman bundled to the shape of a bowling ball in fabric detritus and let her leech power for a decade-old handheld. And there’d be one — there’s always at least one — trying to trade his session in the Neon’ome for someone else’s session in a Bubbl’ome.

For Eu the lobby was empty. Marbled expanse inflated by blue noise. No keyboard here. No silent videos doing laps around the AMOLED velodrome on the ceiling of the cell. Just brown leather on the tub chair under unblemished hands.

Eu still felt the sensory kernel of momentum in the stationary chair. When output’s choked off, the cerebellic implant has nothing to compensate for. She was used to the dissonance, no longer felt nauseous when that which was before her seemed as if held suspended in a miso broth.

A moment of stability. Back to soupy as a boy in an 8-panel cap stepped into the lobby, a bundle of newspapers under his arm. Eu had found him in digitised collodion-processed negatives from over a century ago. The metaphor worked. He approached her, clearly undisturbed by any movement of the cell Eu was carrying into the lobby.

“Your day, m’lady,” the newsboy said with what Eu thought was a perfect imitation of Dickensian cockney. The lobby flicked stagnant.

“Go. In full,” Eu heard herself say above the blue noise before the lobby turned turbulent once more. The newsboy peeled a paper from his stack, shook it open before his eyes. These quirks had taken the virt a couple hundred hours to perfect and Eu felt compelled to enjoy them.

“I’ve prepared a shortlist of four this morning, m’lady. Sorted in reverse value order they are,” the newsboy read from the paper. “Personal: polyphasic sleep. Culinary: nitrous-infused sencha in the home.” The cell burped a tremor. And the smell of what Eu could only think must have been American kicking off his shoes. But the newsboy read on uninterrupted. “Technical: virtutar spooling. Travel: Tailr Mobility penthouse suite.” The newsboy met Eu’s eyes. “Which would you like to pursue?”

A more violent jolt and Eu felt her head slump forward though her eyes kept locked on the newsboy. This one hurt. The cell was sent undulating and the dissonance was too much.

The newsboy and the lobby died with the input.

“I was wondering what it would take to get you to come back.” Eu could have sworn it was the finger pointed in her face that had spoken. “You MTs aren’t usually so sensitive to a little bump in the road.” The owner of the finger rocked the cell with a smirk. He took a step back, over to a grubby rucksack where American had sat. Now Eu wished she’d have the clack of that keyboard back.

The rucksack was yanked open by Eu’s new cellmate, a Korean kid in his late teens with skin darkened by dirt. So that explained the smell.

“You should call this thing to a stop,” the kid said, riffling through his rucksack. “Get another one. That’s what the other guy did.” A loose knot of cables was yanked out clamped in a fist. Dumped to the floor, its micro-CPU ensnared in actuator-tethered optic fibres. Eu hadn’t seen one before but she had a pretty good idea.

Finger to the top of her neck, she went online. The quanta slipped back forth over around each other along Eu’s myelin taps. Input and output hot. The kid pulled a multitool from the rucksack, took it to a panel in the cell’s base.

“I’m not gonna hurt you, lady, but you gonna flag this thing or not?”

“What is that?” Eu asked, eyes on the device. Her virt was giving her more than she was letting on. Twelve other jackings in the last ninety days. Packets from two on anchor. But the kid and this device were new. As much as there’s a market for packets on polyphasic sleep, this was the kind of thing that made people didacts to begin with.

His back to Eu, the kid struggled to find an orifice the multitool could pop. “Look. soon as I jack this, your day’s gonna take a pretty big detour if you don’t jump off. Do us both a favour.” The tip of the septalobe screwdriver locked up on the panel.

“Tell me, what do you call this thing?” Eu stood to pick it up, look it over, give her virtutar plenty to work on. The kid chucked a look up at Eu over his shoulder.

“Flick on your spider, MT. That’ll have *all* the answers, right?” The panel clattered aside, the guts of the cell tightly woven now exposed. The kid reached back for what Eu held in her hands. “Here…”

The pulsating pink through the optic fibre tendrils on Eu’s hands stole the end of the kid’s sentence as it stole his gaze.

“If that’s what you’re into, you’re going to love what I do with this.” The kid emptied Eu’s hands and took a knee by the exposed section of the cell, prepped its tentacular cables.

“It’s called a zom.”

“Why’s that?”

“Short for “zombie”. Because a zom goes straight for the brain. First, the lights’ll go.” The kid placed each contact of the zom on a segment of the cell’s guts. “Then I’ll have just inside of a second to force a reboot or these cells’ll start piling up. Within — wait, what are we in?”

“A Neon.”

“Right, so at around *eight* seconds, Neon’ll have confirmed that, yes, they’ve lost a cell and send a couple out to reclaim it. And I don’t plan on letting them.” The device set, the kid turns back to Eu. “So, last chance.”

The kid was wrong. It was 6.4 seconds before the sirens went up.

## CHAPTER 2

They repaved Downtown Los Angeles in 2028. Except they did it with steel and ten feet off the ground. The sidewalk shrunk, now little more than the threshold to the cell stream. People quipped when the project started that it was as much to let the stream flow more efficiently through LA’s nexus as it was preparation for rising sea levels. They might have been onto something. In 2032, walking down Santa Monica Pier looked like walking on water.

Steel never sounded quite as satisfying underfoot as concrete though. The hundreds of feet that’d step across the Downtown Highwalk during a lunch hour — the executives to the quesadilla joints, the interns to the ramen automats — had the metal singing by midday. Even worse in the rain.

Worse still when you’re under it. Cheng found this out when he darted from his cell. He yelled Mandarin over the sound of the Highwalk. Tried to avoid getting pissed on by the drainage holes spewing down rainwater. Shouldered into the Lower Ground foyer wearing as much water as the saturated doormat he stood on.

“I’ll call you back when I’m back at the office.” Cheng ended the call peppering English into his native tongue. A tap to the plug in his ear. A hand into the inner pocket of a wool blazer that by that afternoon would smell like a dishrag.

Cheng left the elevator onto Neon’s twenty-sixth floor with his shades still on. Technically, Neon called this their Little Tokyo office but Little Tokyo hadn’t been little for over a decade. It ate Downtown from the South in the early 2020s.

“Nishimura-shachō will come to greet you here, Mr Yi,” Cheng’s escort said with more bows than words.

“Indeed.” Cheng’s shades diluted to keep a good view of the escort and her plump rear-end leaving him by the balcony railing. He didn’t feel nearly as bad as he ought to given her age.

The balcony ran the length of the building, pulled back from one wall as it was on every floor below. And down the feature wall ran water. Spouting from above Cheng’s vantage point, the thin film clung to white tiles as large as the offices around him and slipped down to the floors below.

“Yi Cheng!” the voice rose almost to a squeal before reaching Cheng. He snapped around to catch its source. Keiko Nishimura glided over in a glitch weave skirt and single turquoise chopstick through a bun of black hair.

“Nishimura-shachō.” Cheng had inherited so much bow from his escort that his shades flung from his head, clattered across the tiles.

“Oh, come on, Cheng,” Keiko laughed. “We’ve got to sort you out with a pair of ours.” Cheng scrambled for his shades, folded them back into his blazer.

“Of course, Nishimura-shachō.”

*“Keiko*, please Cheng. Come on.”

# The Randi Prize

## The Randi Prize

Peter could make coins disappear by snapping his fingers.

It seemed to follow some rules. One snap of the fingers made one coin vanish. The first test he’d done, after discovering this ability, was to set coins out in front of him and repeatedly snap his fingers to watch what order they were vanished in. Higher denomination coins went first. Coins that were closer to him went first. After getting out a ruler, Peter found that “close” was mostly determined by how far away the coin was from his heart. He tested snapping upside down, and on his back, but that didn’t seem to matter. He tested to see what happened when a higher denomination coin was more distant than a lower denomination, and eventually found out what governed it; a penny would be vanished if it was more than five times closer than a nickel, and a nickel would be vanished if it was five times closer than a quarter.

By the end of the first day, Peter had blown through thirty dollars in change. His change jar was empty, and his thumb and middle finger were both sore. He had no idea where it was the coins were going. There were more questions beyond that, like what would happen with Canadian coins or the coins from the car wash, but Peter had a bonafide superpower. The only thing left to do was turn it to his advantage.

James Randi was a skeptic, who established a prize in 1964 which would go towards anyone with the ability to demonstrate a supernatural ability. Currently, the prize was a million dollars. Vanishing coins with a snap of the fingers didn’t seem to be all that useful, and it didn’t need to be something kept secret, so trying for the Randi Prize first (before anything else) seemed to be the way to go. Peter carefully filled out his application, got a signature from his (completely shocked) brother Kris who worked as a physicist, sent it off through the mail, and got his response back a few days later.

The protocol was carefully agreed on. Peter had snapped away more than a hundred dollars by now, many of them in Kris’s lab under close observation. The biggest practical application seemed to be in waste disposal; if it was possible for the power to recognize nuclear waste as a coin, perhaps by having it minted, then Peter could slowly clear the world of it. The largest coin in the world weighed a ton, and Peter was fairly sure that he would be able to vanish it just as easily as a simple penny. If the United States could declare their nuclear coins to be worth a trillion dollars each, then he might even be able to vanish them from the safety of his home. (Peter’s own knowledge didn’t seem to enter into it. They’d done double-blind tests.)

On the day of the preliminary test, Peter was stunned to see that Randi himself had shown up. He had a thick white beard and large glasses; at age 86, it was a surprise to see him out and about. Peter shook his hand, and Randi smiled.

“I won’t interfere with the protocol,” said Randi. “I won’t touch the materials, or offer any objections. We’ve read what you claimed, and seen the video evidence, so all that’s left is to prove it for real. If you’re the genuine article, we’ll know soon enough.”

They had cordoned off a field, at Peter’s expense. Everyone attending — about a dozen people in total — had taken away all of their coins. Peter had been out in the field snapping his fingers earlier in the day, to make sure that there were no coins buried underground or laying in the grass. He’d run through the protocol six times before Randi and the proctor had shown up.

The proctor came forward and placed a single quarter on a small black table. The table had been examined beforehand. The quarter had been brought by the proctor from a bank, and there were many more outside the cordoned area as replacements or backups.

Everyone stared at the quarter. Peter raised his hand slowly. He had to work to keep it from trembling. He snapped his fingers, and nothing happened.

He snapped his fingers again. The quarter remained in place. There were a million dollars on the line. Peter had already begun spending the money in his head. He snapped a third time, and a fourth, and kept going until Kris stepped forward and told him to stop. They had a brief conversation as they tried to figure out what the problem might be, but the only thing they could think was that there were other, valuable coins too close by. Peter resumed snapping again, and got as close to the quarter as the proctor and the protocols would allow, but after a hundred snaps, the test was marked as a failure. Randi left, and Peter was left wondering what happened.

The power never came back, no matter how long and how hard Peter snapped his fingers. The brief few days of magic seemed almost like a dream. Peter might have been able to believe that it was a temporary delusion, if not for the videotapes.

Weeks later, Peter got a knock on his door. When he opened it, James Randi stood in front of him, with his thick white beard and a black suit with a red tie.

“I wasn’t a fraud,” said Peter. “It really was happening.”

“May I come in?” asked Randi. Peter nodded, and they moved into the living room. Randi sat down in a chair and massaged his knees. “Peter, do you know how many people have come to me over the years?”

“Uh, three hundred and sixty?” asked Peter. “That’s what the internet said. I tried to cover my bases. But I had a real power,” said Peter. “It wasn’t all in my head. Other people saw it too.”

“Do you think that you are unique?” asked Randi. “In the history of the world, do you think that you are the single person to have ever displayed or discovered a supernatural power?”

“I … no,” said Peter. “I suppose not. But then why has the prize been around for so long? Why hasn’t someone claimed it?”

Randi pulled a quarter from his pocket, balanced it on his thumb for a moment, and then flicked it into the air. It spun around, making a shimmering sphere as it traced a parabolic arc. When it reached the apex, Randi snapped his fingers, and the coin disappeared.

“Three hundred and sixty tests,” said Randi. “None of them passed. The common denominator was me.” He smiled, revealing his teeth.

“How?” asked Peter. “*Why?*”

“I’ve never been able to explain how,” said Randi. “The why should be obvious though. If you could take that power from someone, why wouldn’t you? The prize draws them in like moths to a flame. All it takes is a shake of the hand.”

“I’ll,” Peter began. “I’ll expose you. You stole from me!”

“You haven’t been listening,” said Randi. He stood up slowly. “Psychics come to me, and I take their powers. Do you understand why I’m here? It’s not to gloat. This is cleanup.”

And then Peter was alone. He was feeling sad, and tried to remember why. The videotapes, that was it. He’d carefully edited them to make it seem like a coin was disappearing. It had taken hours of his time, and all for nothing. Why had he thought that he could cheat Randi like that?

# “It Couldn’t Happen Here”

## 

The morning after, no-one knew what would happen next.

For the first few months it was rumour and speculation. After the inauguration — renamed Great America Day — things started to change.

Words changed. Or rather, words stayed the same, but their definitions changed. *American* got smaller and smaller, the walls closing in. *Un-American* became so broad as to encompass virtually anything.

I noticed the Internet shrinking. Certain website URLs would redirect me to a new page, noting in dry prose that my ISP was required by law to block the site, and repeated attempts to visit would result in my information being passed to the new House Un-American Activities Committee.

Getting the news from television and radio proved no easier. Gradually, recognisable faces and voices faded away, replaced by nondescript men and women who spoke in clipped, even tones of unpatriotric dissenters, re-classifications and deportations, and repeated official White House press releases as rote.

Those in the media who did speak out were soon gone from the airwaves. Talk show hosts who had once skewered both sides of the political aisle were often re-classified, blacklisted. Or, to put it officially: *“forging new careers outside of media and journalism”*.

After a few weeks, I stopped seeing riots outside my window. I was assured by sober newscasters that much of the country was still engulfed by “chaos”. The President reacted by suspending all elections for the “medium to long term” until stability could be restored.

In the name of stability, the borders were closed, north and south. The Department of Education announced a new curriculum called “New American History”. The students who do not pass will have to face mandatory “supplementary education” lessons.

We became afraid not of violence, but of the simple things: our quiet neighbour with the stars and stripes on their lawn. Using the wrong words in public. CCTV cameras. A knock at the door.

I moved away when I could. Away from the city and its cameras and police and hundreds of thousands of snooping eyes. I’m affluent, and white, and male, so my classification means I can travel.

Minnesota is cold, but it’s quiet. I have discovered an underground resistance, online. Bloggers, writers, thinkers, (former) academics. The non-disappeared’s, eking out meagre existences, communicating in code. We talk about matters that are innocent enough: dogs, cakes, approved American history. But our words mean something different. We learned it from our government.

I hear the rumble of a drone overhead, but pay it no mind. I have been extra careful since moving. I watch all the political broadcasts. I say all the right things. A flag flutters proudly in front of my house.

I sit down to watch a broadcast of the news. Eyes on the screen — because they monitor it — but mind elsewhere. Just as it’s about to start, I see a car pull up outside. It’s sleek and black and moves without a sound.

After a few seconds that feel like hours, the door opens. A man emerges, lithe and smartly dressed. He looks around and adjusts his cuffs. He walks up my driveway.

*Knock. Knock. Knock.*

# The Visitor

## So while I work on getting my first novel published I wanted to avoid procrastinating and put in a conscious effort to work on another one. For now I am just trying to stay consistent with one page a day. I thought I would share the first three pages of “The Visitor” with you all:

Abel had seen his reflection enough to know that the man standing on his doorstep was almost an exact copy of him. Abel was planning to give his visitor an earful for incessantly banging on his door, but he found himself speechless. Despite the thick beard and the soiled clothes, Abel was still drawn solely to the identical facial features.

“It seems like you recognize me. Sorry for not being dressed to impress at the moment.” The visitor smiled, seemingly amused by Abel’s blank expression.

“Who are you?”

“I have a lot to explain, can I come in?”

Abel wasn’t normally keen on inviting unannounced strangers into his home, but this time he didn’t hesitate to step aside. His visitor entered the foyer, scanning his surroundings as if he was searching for something: making Abel realize he may have made a foolish decision.

“Who-,” Abel began as he closed the door behind him.

“It’s complicated, and if I tell you you’d probably think I’m insane.” The visitor redirected his attention to Abel, and Abel felt his skin crawl as he made eye contact.

“I don’t think it’s much of a stretch if you say we’re related.”

“Not quite. Anyone else home?” Abel shook his head, and his heart began to race as he realized he might have made a mistake letting this stranger into his home.

The visitor raised his hand, revealing a cylindrical object about a foot in length.

Instead of making a dash for the front door, Abel’s fear immobilized him, keeping him rooted in place.

“What is that?”

“You sound more curious than worried. Good.”

Without further hesitation the visitor pointed the cylinder toward Abel’s living room, and then pressed one of several buttons located on the left side. A stream of light issued from the opposite end of the cylinder, spiraling out from holes located on the right side.

Abel jumped as he witnessed the spectacle in front of him, not knowing what to expect. He could feel his hair standing on end as the spirals of light created a single solid wall of white light that enveloped the space in front of him, the light stretched from the floor to make a perimeter around the walls. The visitor was obviously used to this sight and looked back at Abel to gage his response.

“Now that I’ve shown you this, I think it’s a better time to tell you that I’m not related to you. I’m not from this planet. I am from a different earth in a different dimension. I am here because I need your help. Follow me.”

The visitor might not be insane, but there was still the possibility that he was dangerous. Abel knew it would still be wise just to head for the front door and leave. But where would that leave him, scared to return to his home. And how would he explain this visitor to the police?

Abel’s curiosity was now overpowering his fear. He wanted to know what was on the other end of the portal. Abel dashed to the closet and took a few seconds deciding what shoes to bring, as if inter-dimension travel was a regular occurrence. Abel figured that since he didn’t know where he was going, he wanted the most practical shoes and selected a pair of sneakers.

Abel hesitated as he reached the portal, feeling a sort of gravitational pull emanating from the portal’s center. The pull wasn’t strong enough to drag Abel in, but it was enough to make him realize what a sudden turn of events he’d been subjected to. The intensity of the light began to blind him as he stood in front and it led him to take another leap of faith.

# Flash Fiction&#58; Number Nine

## Photo copyright K. S. Brooks.

*Originally posted at [Indies Unlimited](http://www.indiesunlimited.com/2017/04/15/flash-fiction-writing-prompt-cheetah/).*

“Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.”
-Allen Saunders

The glow and hum of the memory printer fade as Matthew terminates the cerebral link. An image blossoms to life on the warm sheet of film in his hands; it features a cheetah, mid-leap, moments before it would find purchase atop a large rock. It is this memory that drew him to the printer the moment he reached his sprawling estate, upon returning from Africa.

His excursion to the “dark continent” had been a mixed bag. He had seen amazing sights on safari, but it had also got him killed in an accident. Death was just an inconvenience — at least for him. This was his ninth time. Activating a new clone was a luxury he could afford, but the memories that had not been backed up yet were gone forever. It was during that missing last week of the safari that he is certain something important happened with that cat. Some unfinished business.

He wanders out of the house, heading nowhere in particular. His full attention is on the photo. As he starts to cross the grounds, he hears it.

Chirp. The rustling of a body in motion on grass.

It clicks. Just like that, he is certain. He had purchased it, had it shipped here. That is what he did that week, isn’t it? He bought a cheetah.

It was behind him now. How long since it was fed?

Well, there goes another clone.

# King For A Minute

## 

A young man stood outside the castle walls, cloaked in a tattered and faded black robe. Where others saw beauty, the man saw only ugliness. The ground was littered with rotten leaves, the wind was chilling and the gray sky threatened to pour rain at any minute.

![](1*dQjxzHM5q82aE5UeUmxd-A.jpeg)

Dark shadows ruled his fears, showing things that were not really there in the windows and doorways.

The guards were asleep in a drunken stupor, just as his mother had promised. ‘It will not be difficult to gain entry into the worldship,’ she had said, ‘but it will be near impossible to leave the castle.’

He looked back just to see her one last time. Her disease riddled figure was hunched over, she limped as she made her way back to the ship he called home. The young man saw her through the eyes of a loving son, seeing nothing of her faults. All too soon she disappeared behind the doors of the airlock.

It took the full weight of his body to open the castle door. The creak went unheard amongst the sounds of chaotic uninhibited merriment. The clang of cups was like the clash of swords and became harsh to his ears. The peals of laughter turned to cries of agony and the people’s praise became a death chant in his mind.

The young man strode down the hallway leading to the courtyard. He tried to steady his trembling hands, he must not show weakness. He must be brave, or the enemy would cut him down without a second thought.

He hugged his left arm to his chest and pushed his way through the muck and mire where the people danced to celebrate another victory of their beloved king.

He felt the pressure building inside his chest as he found his place at the foot of the throne. “I must speak with thee.” His baritone voice stopped the musicians.

All of the knights of the round table looked up, they knew that voice. Each one representative of a race in the kingdom, coming in all sorts of shapes, colors, and sizes.

“If thou must speak, then speak!” King Arthur’s face did not lose composure. “Praise thy good fortune of having as great a man as me for thy king. Ask me to tell another tale. Go on then, speak!”

“Does the king remember the words the Lady Of The Lake spoke when she gave the mighty sword Excalibur to thee?” The young man pointed at the sword which had not left the king’s side in over a century.

![](1*Ak9u5empT2Nd27IQPbNaig.jpeg)

King Arthur smiled lopsidedly and his red scales shimmered in the light. “It is my subjects favorite tale.” King Arthur stood, unsheathed the sword and raised it towards the stars above. “The Lady Of The Lake said to me, ‘I give thou the mighty sword Excalibur. As long as thou art strong, brave, loyal, and pure, Excalibur will never fail thee and thou shalt be victorious in every battle!’” Arthur emphasized the words at the end, raising the crowd into a frenzy.

“And what did she say unto thee after this?”

The crowd grew quiet, expectantly looking to their king.

A scratch and a rumble, a tiff and a tramble, the wizened old Merlin came down from his study. He flipped another pair of lenses in front of his face and peered at the newcomer with keen interest, but not a lick of recognition. His body given over to the cybernetic replacements of his own design.

King Arthur’s smile tightened and his tail twitched. “Who said she said anything more than that?”

“The king’s memory seems to have failed him. Sir Lancelot, wouldst thou care to fill in the missing words?” The man motioned towards the knight sitting at King Arthur’s right-hand. He was unquestionably human looking with idealized features, the envy of any man and the object of many woman’s desires.

Sir Lancelot opened his mouth, but at a glare from his king he bowed his head and refused to speak.

“Ah, I see, the king holds thy chains and muzzles his greatest knight.” The young man spat the words and turned to face Merlin. “Perhaps, wise one, thou might remember the words spoken by the Fae that made thy ward a king.”

The silence was filled with whispered questions from the people down below.

“No? Well, then I will speak the words. ’I give unto thee, my son and champion of the Fae, Lancelot.” The young man had to shout to be heard over the din of the angry crowd. A Fae in the court of their king?! “‘As long as thou are loyal, pure, strong and brave, so will he be. Break thy promise and thou will be unable to wield Excalibur. Thou shalt lose thy hold over thy knights, thou wilt lose thy kingdom and thy love.’”

“Ye hide thy face like a coward, unhood thyself and speak thy name.” Merlin’s deep voice reverberated off the castle walls.

## “My name is Mordred.” With a trembling hand, the young man pulled his hood back. “Mordred Pendragon, son of Morgana le Fay and Arthur Pendragon.” His sapphire eyes and red scales echoed his words.

The crowd shouted for answers.

“Lies! Imposter!” King Arthur reached for Excalibur and found it had sunk into its metal resting place. He pulled at the sword with all of his might and it would not budge.

“Excalibur will no longer obey thy wishes, not in the very presence of thy disloyalty to thy queen.”

Arthur searched for another sword, but none of the knights would give him their blade.

“Thy knights will no longer obey thee, not in the presence of the son who ye tried to kill.” Mordred untied his cloak and let it fall. His left arm was bent and crippled. “Ye thought thou murdered my mother and me, but ye failed. Just as thou have failed to uphold thy promise to the Fae and thou will pay for both crimes.”

Lancelot stood and placed his hand on the hilt of Excalibur.

“Ye think ye can take Arthur’s place, but thou have already stolen his queen. Thou have made thyself unpure, ye hast been unloyal and Excalibur will not obey thee!” Mordred unsheathed his sword and hefted his shield off his back.

Queen Guinevere looked between her husband King Arthur, and her lover, Sir Lancelot in a panic.

“How dare thee think thyself worthy of Excalibur!” King Arthur’s’ tail lashed in anger behind him. “Tell me this isn’t true, my brother in arms, that ye were only trying to help me. Tell me that this traitor of my blood speaks only lies to deceive me, tell me that you have not stolen my wife.”

Lancelot only paled further and not a sound was heard from him.

King Arthur turned towards Guinevere. “Tell me the truth, my love. Tell me that this filth is nothing but a liar and I will slay him where he stands.”

Guinevere wept and shook her head fervently. “I cannot tell thee what thou wants to hear.”

King Arthur wrestled a sword from Gawain. “Give me your sword, son of my brother and allow me to slay my enemies.”

Lancelot unsheathed his sword and raced to protect Guinevere. “My king, please I beg you to spare her life.”

“She shall burn as the wrenched adulterous wench that she is.” King Arthur growled; smoke wafting from his nostrils.

“Do not do this. I do not wish to fight thee.” Lancelot looked frail and weak compared to the dragon king.

Mordred heard the clicking of the joints and the hiss of hydraulic valves behind him and he turned to see Merlin.

“Ye wretched blackness, ye smote on the purity of the king, how dare ye come here and destroy the noblest king?” Merlin brandished his staff at the young man.

“I speak nothing but the truth. I do nothing but reveal what is already there.” Mordred slowly matched Merlin’s circling pace.

![](1*WD8nFVoD_akCb_QXP8LKfw.jpeg)

“Thou envy thy father, ye wish to take his crown.”

“The crown belongs to me, I am the only son of King Arthur’s first wife.” Mordred blocked the Merlin’s swipe of staff with his shield and pushed him away.

“Morgana is a monster, there is no way that the people will follow ye.” Merlin hissed.

“My mother was a strong woman who refused to die when the king wished to cover his inability to restrain himself.” Mordred worked his way towards the throne where King Arthur and Lancelot were locked in a vicious battle over Guinevere’s life. “Thou are a relic from a lost era, thou foresaw the fall of the nation into chaos when the dragon clans fought and killed each other. Ye tried to save the boy, ye tried to raise him to be better than his father, but Pendragons will never change.”

“Thou are a cripple who will never bear an heir, the people will never follow thee.” Merlin knocked Mordred off his feet.

“Ye seem to be stuck on this idea of people following me or not, who said that I wanted any of that?” Mordred rolled over and dodged the finishing blows of the end of the staff.

Merlin’s expression was perplexed. “What else could thou possibly want?”

Mordred laughed, “Look around ye great cyborg, and tell me what thou see.”

King Arthur had been wounded by Lancelot, who could not bring himself to kill him.

Guinevere wept uncontrollably.

The Knights had become divided, each one trying to pull Excalibur from its metal prison and failing. Each one trying to become king and fighting those who did not support them.

“A fallen king, the universe divided and chaos.” Merlin closed his eyes to blot it out. “No, no! This is not how it is supposed to be!” Merlin rushed to King Arthur’s side. “I will restore what has been lost, I will save the Pendragons.”

Mordred clicked his tongue and retrieved his cloak. “Ye wizards and thy care of bloodlines. Ye forget what matters most is not blood, but symbols.” He engaged in the melee of the knights and crowd until he had worked his way to Excalibur.

Mordred drew his hand around the hilt and effortlessly drew the sword from the stone. The sound was deafening and stopped everyone dead in their tracks.

## “King for a hundred years, King for a minute, it doesn’t matter. History will only remember one of us, and it won’t be me. Ye will always be King Arthur, and I will just be thy wretched, crippled son.”

All of the remaining knights of the round table turned their full attention to the new king.

Breathless they began to kneel but Arthur, the new king’s father, would not have it. He mustered the last of his strength for one last ill fated strike of the sword. The blow glanced off his only son’s lame arm, spilling blood. The last purebred Pendragon collapsed, rattling his last breath.

Mordred clutched Excalibur with his good arm in a passionate embrace, bowed his head and imploded in a haze of black smoke. All that was left was a handful of ashes, and his blood soaked clothes.

Merlin frantically searched through the tattered robe, and commanded all in the chamber to search the room for the great sword but alas Excalibur was nowhere to be found.

King Arthur died that day and so did his only son, Mordred Pendragon.

The remaining knights of the round table disbanded, the universe no longer united by a single king. Civil war erupted once again and raged between the different clans.

Guinevere disappeared along with Lancelot, turning into nothing but rumors in the depth of Fae territory.

As for Merlin, he saved a precious vial of blood from each of the fallen kings, and he prophesied over the vials that only one wouldst return when the kingdom needed him the most.

*But one of these things was a lie.*

# Escape

## 

Her stomach burns as she crawls towards the portal. If she could just make it, she could fall in and be home again

A gutteral snarling comes from behind. Her heart rate increases as she picks up her pace. The wolves would not stop her from escaping, not after they had taken so much.

Her left arm lands 3 feet from the portal. A few more drags.

She feels a tugging at her trailing pant leg. The smallest of the wolves pulls her back with his mouth.

She musters the strength to kick back. Then, she pushes her whole head through the portal.

Cool, wet sensation rolls over her scalp and pulls her whole body inside.

# Worms

## I can feel them moving again,

Tearing a path through my flesh,

I can see their bodies, lying just under my skin,

Pressed so tight that my skin moves when they do,

I shiver as I feel one travelling down my neck,

Its body travels over blood vessels and nerves,

Moving over them or pushing them aside, Its slow movements only prolong the agony,

I crash to the floor,

Serving only to awaken others,

I can feel a wave of movement starting in my legs,

My mind tells me not to look down, Yet I choose not to listen,

The skin on my legs is stretched tight as they tear through,

Blue tendrils mark their presence on every inch beneath my waist, I can feel the skin tearing apart now,

Blue gives way to red as the skin tears,

Coming loose from the flesh underneath with a thunderous snap,

They emerge, and death is my only escape.

# A Star Gaze

## The night sky holds many uncharted adventures

![Photo Credit: [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/sky-star-night-lights-tree-1175927/)](1*gts4jVk6CRJCnQ88fEqggw.jpeg)*Photo Credit: [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/sky-star-night-lights-tree-1175927/)*

Bright stars glistened in the dark, celestial curio cabinet above a suburban backyard. Gabby gazed into the summer night looking for an answer as a bubbling brook streamed down her face, but her tears did not warrant the attention of the stars. She only had a broken heart, which was the result of a three-month, high school relationship that was destined to end with the school year. Apparently, she cared more about this silly boy than she thought.

The world was filled with a million more serious issues than the breakup of a short-lived high school couple, and Gabby knew that. She also knew that her heart hurt. A cool breeze dried her tears as quickly as they appeared, and she felt that the glittering trinkets in the sky were telling her they did not have time to mourn the loss of her teenage fling. She had not even told her parents about Bryan because she knew their relationship was not going to last.

Her phone chimed.

“You okay?”

Her friend, Helen, wanted to help.

“Yeah, I guess,” Gabby texted back.

“I can come over.”

“It’s okay. You don’t have to.”

“Alright… let me know if you need something.”

“Okay.”

She wanted to be alone. Her tears distorted the positions of the stars. From one moment to the next, the white dots moved across the sky. She wiped her eyes, and the stars were back in the same place. A rogue star skipped around as if it was mocking Gabby’s tears. She wiped her eyes again, but the star continued to hopscotch through the sky. She decided to close her eyes and take a deep breath, exhaling out the pain. Upon blinking her eyes open again, the stars seemed to be back in place, too busy with their own planets and moons to worry about the broken heart of an American teenager.

Then, the white dot moved again.

Distracted by the odd occurrence, her stream of tears turned into a minor leaky faucet. She sniffled up the remaining droplets and examined the moving star. It had no sensible path. It just seemed to move every which way without any purpose. She rubbed her eyes again, and then opened them up wide to focus. She could not tell if her eyes were playing a trick on her or if this star really was moving. This stupid breakup was now affecting her perception of reality.

She stood up from the patio chair in her backyard and combed her hands through her hair, closing her eyes and breathing deeply once again. She just needed to go to bed and sleep it off, so she scooped up her blanket from the chair, wrapped it around her shoulders and moved toward the back door of her house.

Gabby took another look at the sky, and the star was still moving. She squinted now, tracking its position. The bright, white dot seemed to be moving toward her now at a fast velocity. Her eyes widened with no more tears dribbling from her pores. She could hear a high-pitched whizzing as the bright object approached Earth. Both of her now dry eyes were lasered on the star.

The whizzing grew louder and the light glowed brighter, but the size of the object seemed to stay the same. Gabby’s heart started to race as she realized an unidentified flying object was catapulting into her backyard. There was no time to run even if she wanted to. With a brilliant flash of light and a loud splash, the object had landed in her pool.

Many thoughts raced through Gabby’s head. Am I alive? Did my backyard blow up? Why did my pool not explode into a million pieces? Is the object still intact? Was it really a star? Or maybe a piece of one?

A soft glow radiated from her pool, and she slowly walked to it. As she peered over the side of her deck and into the clear water, she made out a small, cubic metal device shining a dim light from circular openings on its sides. The impact left no hole in her pool or the ground. She grabbed the pool skimmer and maneuvered it near the object. After a few unsuccessful swipes, she finally scooped the object from the bottom of the pool and dumped it next to her on the deck.

It looked to be made of some sort of steel, and each side was smooth with four circles emitting light. It was some sort of celestial Rubik’s Cube. She reached down and touched it, but it seemed rather boring. She held it in her hand and examined each side. Nothing interesting appeared. She glanced toward the sky again, wondering what this could be and where it came from.

Then, it started to whizz again. Immediately, she dropped it, but it did not land with a thump. The metal cube hovered above the deck, and the circular lights burned brighter. A voice could be heard. Gabby was not sure where the sound was coming from as she did not see any tiny holes that would indicate a speaker. The voice started speaking in many different languages. Most of them did not even sound of her world.

“Hello?” Gabby asked the cube.

The languages stopped.

“Hello?” she asked it again.

“Hello,” it replied. “Please accept this message.”

Dumbfounded, Gabby replied, “I accept this message…”

“A crisis in the universe demands the attention of the intelligent beings on your planet. Please grab a hold of this device to be transported to the origin of this message. All will be explained.”

Gabby scanned the perimeter of her backyard. Was someone playing a trick on her? Could this be real? If this was a real message from some intergalactic species, how did it end up in her backyard?

“A crisis in the universe demands the attention of the intelligent beings on your planet. Please grab a hold of this device to be transported to the origin of this message. All will be explained,” the device repeated itself.

She should probably call the police. The device would then be sent to the FBI, CIA or some other agency that has a proper protocol for something like this. A suburban, teenage girl would not be able to help solve a conflict that might be thousands of light years away.

Gabby’s phone chimed.

“Hey,” Bryan texted her. “I think I made a mistake. Can we talk?”

The device repeated its message once more.

“A crisis in the universe demands the attention of the intelligent beings on your planet. Please grab a hold of this device to be transported to the origin of this message. All will be explained.”

She stared at the text from Bryan, and then smirked. There are more important issues out there than the breakup of a high school couple. The device had started its message once again when Gabby finally closed her eyes and grabbed hold of the metal cube. Before the fourth iteration of the message completed, Gabby and the device turned into a neon blue light. Less than a second later, the blue light flashed off, and the teenager disappeared.
